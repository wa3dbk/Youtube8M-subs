00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 nothing expected and everything will get hello 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.500
 together we the film factory the map 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.790
 my dreams are coming to us now 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.759
 cinemas and is the story of that 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.320
 Ten-year tsb it is highly talented 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.960
 and he always finds things 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.150
 and there he will be awarded 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.490
 with a very prestigious award only 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.140
 nobody actually knows this ts first 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.880
 is ten years old but you go 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.130
 assuming that he is much older 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.410
 His parents are very different 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.029
 Namely his mother is a biologist 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.560
 which always and how insects collect 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.680
 and the father does not have anything at all 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.930
 for this is left as a typical 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.760
 ranger who runs on his farm 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.200
 and not so much for spiritual matters 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.840
 drive head and therefore decides the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.180
 It also independently on its own 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.620
 fist to washington dc to mature that 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.110
 of course for a long time 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.030
 they do not travel straight and they are crazy 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.660
 runs like the whole looks like that 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.660
 behind here in the trader 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.440
 Everyone in the family is as well 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:05.020
 the soul and mentality as cowboys 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.690
 Every evening he gets a glass of wine 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.760
 whiskey and my mother has chosen for 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.410
 a great naturalist like herself 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.670
 my parents are falling in love 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.720
 could be a mystery 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.670
 they are like day and night then he is 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.460
 my sister grace or tom famous 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.930
 to become 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.020
 and people 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.550
 presumably 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:30.880
 aesculap 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:33.939
 He has the muckis and I think 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:39.119
 ts asks her invention is the 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:39.119
 winner of our prestigious award 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.380
 the faithful donors grow the journey 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.090
 Although made fear but no matter 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.170
 Tomorrow I'm going to Washington and Rome 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.170
 depend on a price 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.189
 I'm a bit important too 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.119
 experience 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.119
 canucks here nothing happens 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.770
 I do not know 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:19.380
 but that is the graphic has 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.380
 stay the way you are lucky 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.680
 I'm sorry what I did nobody did 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.680
 has ever talked about it 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.950
 not at all your fault it was not 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.950
 in it 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.750
 kempen 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.090
 if I'm a gentleman 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.090
 I agree 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.540
 I have even seen the movie 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.519
 before the German coach at all 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.159
 came out and I was sitting in the cinema 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.569
 did not know what to expect only that 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.980
 the same director is for the 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.810
 fabulous world of amÃ©lie 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.970
 of course I was already poor of that 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.890
 film is visually in any case of a 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.660
 or another surprise for me 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.940
 have ready and that's what it has 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.250
 film on every corner is something 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.930
 lovingly processed it is a whole 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.700
 great equipment incredibly great 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.190
 pictures and above all that's what 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.879
 He has completely distinguished this film 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.750
 1000 million percent heart and that 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.430
 I do not mean that myself 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.140
 It's kind of cheesy but you can tell 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.459
 simply that the filmmaker at work 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.829
 they are what they do 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.510
 unbelievable love and that's why you have 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.829
 this movie and the characters too 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.540
 unbelievable lies the little boy 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.340
 that really works really well 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.590
 always has one or the other 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.420
 smart ass ready 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.220
 and you just know that 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.690
 children who have learned something or 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.549
 what do they always bring to one 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.319
 very special way over but 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.879
 also the rest of the cast for example 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.940
 dealer bonham carter is also there 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.510
 he always plays that quirky one 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.190
 personalities even here 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.930
 it just does not do it that way 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.859
 exaggerated straw and diagonally across 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.720
 to bring 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.519
 she has this quirkiness but she can 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.200
 just a little bit weaken that 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.849
 The whole thing is realistic 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.859
 anyway so crazy you think at the beginning 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.349
 The game somehow over 150 years ago 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.669
 but plays in the current time and that 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.280
 also succeeds in that one 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:12.569
 visually experimented a lot and 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.519
 straight in the cut still with the 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.109
 Camera work is incredibly daring 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.120
 and then I have to say that 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.950
 I think that's rewarded if you listen 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.870
 many thoughts as get 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.910
 I designed this movie more exciting 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.500
 What's innovative about it when I do that 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.150
 Now I want that movie 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.530
 does not look like everyone else and 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.930
 that has succeeded here and it's easy 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.880
 just a really big hat off again 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.229
 What else I think about the movie 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.450
 like that he is also a lot of genres 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.039
 meanwhile, it is mine 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.660
 roadmovie that's it 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.610
 little family drama at the same time 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.500
 tragic comedy and one or the other 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.539
 one also has the feeling of fantasy elements 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.639
 that it is also infected and slumbers 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.530
 Also in the film I like that incredibly 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.349
 gladly because he just every single one 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.580
 figure correctly present in the foreground 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:55.560
 So it does not bring that feeling 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.280
 one is completely overwhelmed but 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.740
 he 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.010
 just make it no matter who it is 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.630
 you like the characters totally like 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.610
 and would rather still 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.930
 but much more of the figures learn 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.550
 The movie is just about two 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.290
 hours and of course he can not do it 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.610
 tell every figure completely from that 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.320
 would be too much of a good thing 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.060
 at the same time it also made it to ours 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.830
 beautiful statements too mediated but without 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.060
 Now that you are in the foreground too 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.650
 ask and say we have one here 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.340
 very important statement we want 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.320
 Selling 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.090
 up with this movie, unfortunately, creates 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.590
 just completely subliminal only the 3d 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.419
 conversion is completely nonsense 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.860
 So you need the profi 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.600
 not at all in 3d watch it brings 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.550
 only one two three represent what and 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.260
 in between, he has one or the other 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.850
 but I find narrative length even 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:40.740
 does not matter a lot 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:42.480
 fun and he makes a journey of range 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.460
 completely to washington dc from you 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.050
 I would like to know what you have as 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.419
 her small word for little trips 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.770
 at his own fist sometimes it's enough 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.780
 even if you are gone for baker 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.940
 to somehow get you or Particles 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.070
 Ice cream parlor but you were adventure 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.090
 moderately alone on the road writes that 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.680
 but sometimes in the comments 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.910
 my personal rating when i am 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.620
 not at all out of fanaticism 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.280
 Of course, it can only come out extremely 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.860
 be high 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.169
 the movie is incredibly beautiful too 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.000
 he looks touched he makes fun of it 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:11.280
 big adventures usually lead 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.900
 has expressed so great and small 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.000
 there it is really so give me yours 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.789
 family or with friends that is completely 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.440
 no matter 9 out of 10 points, the film gets 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:21.419
 family has a few in between 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.280
 tiny lengths but that makes me 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:24.390
 absolutely nothing at all but can 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.430
 I just do not get the full score 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.810
 give me but one of the absolute 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.430
 highlights and the biggest surprise 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.870
 For me I saw this year 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.180
 That's why I can only say look 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.890
 the thing but necessarily 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.720
 But who says I am with the wm 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.100
 actually not interested in 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.650
 to go to the cinema I mean, then I'm running 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.810
 anyway the second week but still 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.130
 the checked in here times ten movies that 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.380
 fitting to the wm 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.690
 come out at some point replace it 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.860
 I have movies in the current 10 football 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:52.620
 I presented you here below more 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.150
 but rather something completely different scenery the 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.700
 case, I just left the 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.900
 Director of the slide here below right 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.400
 check it out and see you soon 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:04.370
 gladly again with a new film criticism 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.370
 about the film factory with me the double
