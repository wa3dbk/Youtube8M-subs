00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.010 
i'll be tomorrow most likely finishing
it<00:01:45.979> it<00:01:46.369> should<00:01:46.610> only<00:01:46.670> be<00:01:46.850> about<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.660> two<00:01:47.810> days

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
it it should only be about the two days

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.320 
it it should only be about the two days
because<00:01:48.290> i'll<00:01:49.070> start<00:01:49.430> some<00:01:49.670> tonight<00:01:50.000> and

because i'll start some tonight and

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.940 
because i'll start some tonight and
it'll<00:01:50.869> only<00:01:50.990> be<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.290> middle<00:01:51.560> so<00:01:51.740> i<00:01:51.770> could

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
it'll only be the middle so i could

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.850 
it'll only be the middle so i could
still<00:01:52.190> go<00:01:52.430> outside<00:01:53.200> and<00:01:54.200> it's<00:01:54.590> funny<00:01:54.770> because

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
still go outside and it's funny because

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.410 
still go outside and it's funny because
that's<00:01:55.130> what<00:01:55.280> I<00:01:55.340> do<00:01:55.400> when<00:01:55.550> I<00:01:55.670> when<00:01:56.000> I<00:01:56.030> put<00:01:56.270> them

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
that's what I do when I when I put them

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.230 
that's what I do when I when I put them
in<00:01:56.540> I<00:01:56.780> do<00:01:56.990> it<00:01:57.350> all<00:01:57.500> around<00:01:57.800> the<00:01:57.950> edges<00:01:58.070> and<00:01:58.400> then

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
in I do it all around the edges and then

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.420 
in I do it all around the edges and then
the<00:02:00.050> middle<00:02:00.290> will<00:02:00.380> be<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.620> last<00:02:00.770> part<00:02:01.130> but

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
the middle will be the last part but

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.730 
the middle will be the last part but
when<00:02:02.030> I'm<00:02:02.240> taking<00:02:02.450> them<00:02:02.570> out<00:02:02.750> I<00:02:03.050> start<00:02:03.620> with

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
when I'm taking them out I start with

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.560 
when I'm taking them out I start with
the<00:02:03.830> middle<00:02:04.040> first<00:02:04.250> and<00:02:04.640> then<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.120> edges<00:02:05.480> will

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
the middle first and then the edges will

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.930 
the middle first and then the edges will
be<00:02:05.659> the<00:02:05.780> last<00:02:05.930> part<00:02:06.370> so<00:02:07.370> I<00:02:07.400> can<00:02:07.610> still<00:02:07.760> function

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
be the last part so I can still function

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.600 
be the last part so I can still function
and<00:02:08.420> go<00:02:08.540> shopping<00:02:09.080> or<00:02:09.470> you<00:02:09.769> know<00:02:09.920> whatever<00:02:10.399> I

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
and go shopping or you know whatever I

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.570 
and go shopping or you know whatever I
need<00:02:10.790> to<00:02:10.820> do<00:02:11.620> you<00:02:12.620> know<00:02:12.739> without<00:02:12.950> all<00:02:13.550> my

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
need to do you know without all my

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.630 
need to do you know without all my
braids<00:02:14.000> being<00:02:14.300> taken<00:02:14.660> out<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:15.080> um<00:02:16.010> I<00:02:16.340> don't

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
braids being taken out and um I don't

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.890 
braids being taken out and um I don't
have<00:02:16.820> to<00:02:16.940> sit<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.180> do<00:02:17.360> it<00:02:17.450> all<00:02:17.570> in<00:02:17.720> one<00:02:17.750> sitting

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
have to sit and do it all in one sitting

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.259 
have to sit and do it all in one sitting
so<00:02:18.500> I<00:02:18.769> probably<00:02:19.250> get<00:02:19.489> some<00:02:19.670> help<00:02:19.820> with<00:02:20.000> taking

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
so I probably get some help with taking

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:21.490 
so I probably get some help with taking
the<00:02:20.300> mouth<00:02:20.510> cuz<00:02:20.720> that's<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:20.989> worst<00:02:21.230> for<00:02:21.380> me

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
the mouth cuz that's the worst for me

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.920 
the mouth cuz that's the worst for me
that's<00:02:21.680> why<00:02:22.209> also<00:02:23.209> I<00:02:23.239> had<00:02:23.420> them<00:02:23.570> in<00:02:23.660> for<00:02:23.810> so

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
that's why also I had them in for so

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.110 
that's why also I had them in for so
long<00:02:24.110> because<00:02:24.320> I<00:02:24.530> just<00:02:24.739> I<00:02:24.920> did<00:02:25.580> not<00:02:25.790> want<00:02:26.000> to
