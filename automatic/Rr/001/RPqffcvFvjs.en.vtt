00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.009
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:05.221
 This is a table tennis wisdom bag 

00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:08.260
 Nice to meet you Today is 5 o'clock in the morning 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.860
 Today's theme that will continue today will be here 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.430
 About how to distinguish the rotation of side down rotation and side up rotation 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.610
 I'll try to do it, I'm receiving it 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.950
 Very much trouble is served by the other party 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.150
 I do not know whether it is side-to-side rotation or side-down rotation 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.840
 How do you judge it and receive it 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.270
 There is a lot of troubles like this during the game 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.140
 It is better if the other party's serve is good 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.570
 It's hard to tell if it's sideways or below 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.940
 This time, just be aware of that one point 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.790
 We can distinguish side down rotation and side up rotation well 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.719
 It's a secret technique but I just look with eyes 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.579
 There is one iron rule that introduces a perspective 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.920
 It hangs on the side turn in the opponent's serve 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:07.829
 At that time the angle of the racket is facing the ceiling 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:11.899
 Side down rotation when applying side rotation 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:14.600
 It is when the face of the racket gets up like this 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.840
 When the face of the racket is up like this 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.619
 In the state where the face of the racket is awake 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.749
 At the moment you hit the ball, this will be side-to-side rotation 

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:29.450
 So, how to put out a normal side-turn serve, turn side-down 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.159
 When it comes to this side, the angle of the side-turning racket 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.829
 Please see the moment you hit the ball and the point to determine the rotation is 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.930
 As you see the serve only at the moment of impact you hit 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.910
 Please take this side turn serve 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.270
 At the time of this impact when putting out 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.779
 Please see only this moment of impact 

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:51.899
 The secret of how to identify this side down rotation and side up rotation 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.549
 The angle of the opponent's racket at the moment you hit the ball 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.489
 If you look at this, all horizontal rotation serve 

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:02.219
 I will understand the whole 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.430
 It is not this way to see this impact 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.129
 I only see it when I hit it at this moment 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.000
 Even if the toss is high, you can not see the toss 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.810
 If you look at the toss and chase this way 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.040
 Because the response to rotation is delayed 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.800
 I'm not looking at the toss this way 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.629
 I'm raising that toss, but without looking at the toss 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:23.300
 If you hit the ball with raising it, only this impact 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.650
 If you do what you see when you hit this ball 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.140
 If you look at the angle of the moment you saw that moment 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.840
 If you do not know the horizontal rotation serve 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.989
 By focusing only on the moment of impact 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.540
 It will be understood by the angle It is the same with the back serve 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.260
 For example, everyone in Bachsar is a popular backserv 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.500
 It's hard to understand. 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.680
 It is getting confusing, but this swing and motion 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.250
 Not looking at it, only looking at this impact 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.730
 If you look at the moment you hit the ball 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.040
 In the feeling that it is raised after hanging down 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.769
 When hitting a ball, the back side is properly 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:10.280
 If this is also facing the sky, the side of the racket is turned by the side down rotation 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.959
 If it is awake, it will rotate sideways 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.079
 Back serve is easy to understand 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.070
 In the moment you hit the ball because the image 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.260
 Which side it is on the moment you hit the ball 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.780
 I think what it is now This is the moment you hit a ball 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.049
 I'm looking closely and turn on the side and then on 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.530
 It's like I'm putting the motion below 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.760
 So by looking closely at the moment you hit the ball 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.439
 If the face of the racket is up sideways 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:45.170
 Downside when the face of the racket faces the ceiling 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.409
 If you look only at the surface of this rubbing moment 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.290
 I feel like I can read the rotation 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.939
 If you think that the side of the racket faces the ceiling and the side bottom has come out 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:58.889
 Soo it and return 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:04.609
 If you think you got up the moment the racket rubs for a moment 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.690
 Flick sideways or press a little 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.480
 It feels like you're playing, just hit it or hit it 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.859
 With this Tsuyotsutsu which already returns with this alone 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.609
 It's like I'm going to fly sideways 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.430
 Because it is normal now side turn which disappears 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.221
 It is easy to understand, but it is difficult to understand 

00:04:20.221 --> 00:04:22.419
 Involvement serve or not Involvement serve 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.680
 The face of the racket with the other party's roll serve 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.931
 In this way, as it goes to heaven 

00:04:27.931 --> 00:04:33.060
 It is this side-down rotation when I do the entrainment serve 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.560
 The face is standing up with this involvement serve 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.979
 Standing up and standing up 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.860
 This will turn sideways The moment of this impact 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.139
 Because it is fooled by this shook at the first time in a roll-in serve 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.599
 Swing and watch the last moment you hit 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:54.870
 If it does so, it is Yokomichi. 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.280
 This is the side down like this is the side up 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.990
 Watch the moment you hit the ball and the angle of the racket 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.030
 Should I have a look at it? 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.039
 Should I flick or turn side down or side up? 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.680
 The same as horizontal rotation will be understood immediately 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.500
 There is yg serve yg serve is also the face of the racket 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.020
 The person who is giving yg serve while facing the ceiling 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.910
 When you hit it this way when it is facing the ceiling 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.940
 Side down rotation yg serve is the side of the racket 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.789
 A state of being awake at the moment you hit the ball 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:31.979
 It's all together After all the face is facing the ceiling 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:35.090
 Horizontal rotation when the entire horizontal lower surface is awake 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.419
 When it's all upside-down and you're awake 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:40.160
 This side of the side turn 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.099
 When it is facing up, it feels like turning sideways 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.449
 Just watch the moment you hit a yg serve 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:51.910
 I don't care about forms I don't worry about looking at motion 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:57.039
 Look at the racket surface only for the surface angle when hitting 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:58.949
 In doing so with yg serve below 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:01.599
 You can easily see the sideways 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:04.940
 It can not be thrown away by side down rotation side up rotation by this 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.169
 I wonder if it will be much less 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:09.490
 Please try if you like 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:10.539
 Thank you very much
