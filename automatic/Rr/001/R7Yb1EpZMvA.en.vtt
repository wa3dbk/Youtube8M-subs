creamy<00:01:25.590> like<00:01:25.979> buttery<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.850> touch<00:01:27.090> but

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
creamy like buttery to the touch but

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.179 
creamy like buttery to the touch but
it's<00:01:27.420> not<00:01:27.600> powdery<00:01:28.110> at<00:01:28.229> all<00:01:28.380> or<00:01:28.530> anything<00:01:28.799> and

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
it's not powdery at all or anything and

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.060 
it's not powdery at all or anything and
I<00:01:29.850> really<00:01:30.270> like<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.780> formula<00:01:31.079> it's<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.770> nice

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.280 
the formula on both of these products is
very<00:01:34.770> satin<00:01:35.670> it's<00:01:35.820> just<00:01:36.090> like<00:01:36.299> satin<00:01:36.900> finish

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
very satin it's just like satin finish

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.590 
very satin it's just like satin finish
satiny<00:01:37.920> feel<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.579> I'm<00:01:38.700> actually<00:01:38.909> wearing<00:01:39.329> both

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.450 
know it's a concentrated swatch and this
is<00:01:48.390> like<00:01:48.600> nicely<00:01:49.079> blended<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.710> my<00:01:49.920> skin<00:01:50.189> so

tone<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.829> me<00:01:52.920> can<00:01:53.100> definitely<00:01:53.640> get<00:01:53.759> away<00:01:54.000> with

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
tone to me can definitely get away with

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.359 
tone to me can definitely get away with
this<00:01:54.390> product<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:55.079> can't<00:01:55.530> speak<00:01:55.770> for<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.100> carry

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
this product I can't speak for the carry

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.830 
this product I can't speak for the carry
in<00:01:56.549> big<00:01:56.759> shade<00:01:57.030> because<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.360> didn't<00:01:57.689> buy<00:01:57.810> that

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
in big shade because I didn't buy that

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.230 
in big shade because I didn't buy that
one<00:01:58.170> but<00:01:58.350> definitely<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:59.340> can<00:01:59.520> get<00:01:59.700> away<00:01:59.820> with

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
one but definitely you can get away with

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.330 
one but definitely you can get away with
wearing<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.719> because<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.500> very<00:02:01.829> silky

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
wearing this because it is very silky

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.940 
wearing this because it is very silky
and<00:02:02.700> really<00:02:03.450> easy<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.990> blend<00:02:04.200> out<00:02:04.469> so<00:02:04.740> let's

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
and really easy to blend out so let's

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.679 
and really easy to blend out so let's
say<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.159> did<00:02:05.460> apply<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.790> kind<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.240> strongly

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
say you did apply it kind of strongly

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.809 
say you did apply it kind of strongly
you<00:02:06.899> can<00:02:07.350> kind<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.649> blend<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.160> off<00:02:08.369> if<00:02:08.670> that

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
you can kind of blend it off if that

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.999 
you can kind of blend it off if that
makes<00:02:09.060> sense<00:02:09.149> because<00:02:09.599> of<00:02:09.629> how<00:02:09.869> smooth<00:02:10.349> this

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
makes sense because of how smooth this

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.140 
makes sense because of how smooth this
powder<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.670> it's<00:02:12.030> not<00:02:12.239> like<00:02:12.300> I

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
powder is it's not like I

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.610 
powder is it's not like I
I<00:02:13.180> would<00:02:13.360> say<00:02:13.540> it's<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.810> lot<00:02:14.019> different<00:02:14.230> than

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
I would say it's a lot different than

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.860 
I would say it's a lot different than
their<00:02:14.860> other<00:02:15.180> sweethearts<00:02:16.180> blushes<00:02:16.599> those

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
their other sweethearts blushes those

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.630 
their other sweethearts blushes those
have<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.170> different<00:02:17.650> kind<00:02:17.799> of<00:02:17.950> like<00:02:18.099> baked

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
have a different kind of like baked

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.179 
have a different kind of like baked
texture<00:02:19.239> almost<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.870> this<00:02:20.319> does<00:02:20.560> not<00:02:20.590> feel

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
texture almost and this does not feel

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.030 
texture almost and this does not feel
like<00:02:21.370> those<00:02:21.549> it's<00:02:21.879> definitely<00:02:22.569> more<00:02:23.140> similar

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
like those it's definitely more similar

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.280 
like those it's definitely more similar
to<00:02:24.220> their<00:02:24.489> chocolate<00:02:25.360> Soleil<00:02:25.659> bronzer<00:02:25.689> it

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
to their chocolate Soleil bronzer it

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.869 
to their chocolate Soleil bronzer it
feels<00:02:26.530> just<00:02:26.739> like<00:02:26.829> that<00:02:27.129> but<00:02:27.400> actually<00:02:27.849> a

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
feels just like that but actually a

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.520 
feels just like that but actually a
little<00:02:28.299> bit<00:02:28.450> more<00:02:28.780> sauce<00:02:29.140> as<00:02:29.319> far<00:02:29.500> as

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
little bit more sauce as far as

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.259 
little bit more sauce as far as
pigmentation<00:02:30.310> goes<00:02:30.489> I<00:02:30.640> have<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.909> say<00:02:31.060> I'm

bronzer so I kind of just go tap tap on
the<00:03:13.450> blush<00:03:13.689> and<00:03:13.959> then<00:03:14.139> maybe<00:03:14.530> like<00:03:14.739> one<00:03:14.980> tap

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220
