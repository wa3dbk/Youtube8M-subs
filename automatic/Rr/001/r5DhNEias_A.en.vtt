00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.470
 good the truth that we are super 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 happy with the work that we have 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.019
 done I think the first 20 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.300
 minutes the team has made a game 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.549
 showy with ball mobility with the 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.960
 energy with decision especially in 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.960
 defensive situations where you could 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.359
 watch a 34 player activity 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.189
 changing man without ever giving up 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.529
 to take risks is a bit what 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.750
 we had been demanding in the previous 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.010
 weeks this way we can lose or 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.050
 we can win but showing a 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.510
 own identity that we want to have as 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.760
 team and I think also as a student 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.110
 by saying how the club lives a little bit 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.530
 what I think today the situation 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.120
 it was super difficult super super difficult and 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.890
 I think we have brought forward a 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.629
 match with the casualties we had 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.760
 with the three casualties we had and the one 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.890
 sales to rest and elimination of 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.660
 Álex Mumbrú in the absence of 18 minutes 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.350
 play and the reason for the lack of 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.550
 89 Just like in our club I think that 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.350
 in this root we have the same 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.520
 feeling of power philosophy 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.710
 fight against all circumstances 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.270
 that can be put before us and in that 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.379
 we are and that's why I'm happy not only 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.450
 by the players but by the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.080
 club leaders also and for all 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.390
 because this guy 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.340
 and two are important and Race 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.930
 what we want to have as values 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.930
 important within the team 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.580
 such a match coral is not good 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.190
 but it means somewhere 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.420
 if what happens what you can not do 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.950
 we did not comment it now a while ago I 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.869
 if it was still the last ball with 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.040
 I happen not to happen that I do believe 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.259
 you have to have a little more of 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.970
 ambition to show the character and the 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.830
 technical quality that he has a 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.869
 jump that nobody knows yet he 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.520
 can can play over the hoop 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.200
 can do things but obviously with 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.060
 the 21 minutes he has played and in the 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.160
 situations in which he has played and 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.509
 against the opponent he has played is for 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.649
 be very happy not but also 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.840
 I'm happy with the three minutes of 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.000
 borja I'm happy with the time spent and 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.250
 san roque al 3 to save our 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.569
 situation of having no spare part that in 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.610
 that moment we are a little bit with many 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.679
 problems and the tablet yes frame 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.650
 also and then especially happy 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.870
 today with quino colom I do not think what to do 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.130
 0 of 9 0 out of 10 and directed to the team 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.660
 with the solvency that he has done before 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.430
 situations as complicated as that of 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.440
 hold without knowing the system that you can 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.360
 play because there are some who are tired 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.069
 others who can not others I think that 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.019
 It has much merit 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.950
 in short everyone for the work 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.950
 defensive they have done not 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.050
 well I believe that not only in confidence 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.910
 Trust has to be done 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.700
 working for me the important thing of the 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.380
 reading that I would get as a coach and 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.420
 that after analyzing I hope to take 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.070
 is and they as players is that 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.470
 we can compete against 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.460
 any rival as long as we continue 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.920
 our energy and our situation 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.200
 defensive rules of pushing and not 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.140
 let us play as they want as 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.700
 a week ago then with this 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.260
 we know we have something gained then 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.270
 will depend on the rival's party 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.100
 success of many other things that not that 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.990
 we can not control sometimes but it's what 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.100
 only that we want to gain confidence in the 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.060
 energy and in the activity that we have 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.060
 shown during today 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.709
 two 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.410
 not similar but not the same as this one but 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.200
 clear like maybe if ever with 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.980
 three casualties but then you have another 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.050
 go to rest and that therefore Alexei 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.190
 missing eight minutes be out and that 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.370
 he is outside when there are eight left 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.620
 minutes maybe not no but it's that maybe 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.330
 I believe that the value that miribilla has 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.160
 also maybe I had not had it before 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.410
 neither do I believe that the public today 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.959
 has been a determining factor for not 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.980
 to be able to overcome Real Madrid is true 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.739
 that the players have made a good 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.170
 work but driven by one for a 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.790
 level of effort exertion energy 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.140
 of people who are hard to find 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.349
 in another good court I think it's 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.349
 impossible 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:16.019
 on the track 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.710
 of the meritorious minutes because I did not have 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.500
 another to take out but yes it is true that 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.570
 the why I wanted to highlight not because 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.190
 the easiest thing is to go to other names that 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.410
 have given a very good level like the 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.360
 defensive and team and they have also 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.880
 had the opportunity to put baskets 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.460
 but he is very wrong I think that 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.110
 sometimes he has chosen well and others have not 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.000
 also but what he has chosen 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.190
 the moments to pass the players 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.800
 to play slower then defend 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.960
 to rebound I think it's a game of 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.460
 formidable team and I'm very happy 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.070
 for him he did not tell me now not just 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.900
 I need to put in good good then the 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.280
 other things are those that are missing are 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.780
 much harder to recover the 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.280
 Meteor does not depend on the circumstance 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.680
 of the right the right thing can have 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.669
 any one day the other or you have it 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.669
 you do not have it and he has it 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.789
 more fruits 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:14.789
 forever 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:22.110
 I do not reach the union of the whole team 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.120
 the belief for the victory and it's what 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.490
 that said in the union that we want to have 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.289
 as a club and as a team before any 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.220
 difficulty if the best is that none in 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:31.889
 the things that depend on us 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.990
 themselves and today we depended on ourselves 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.099
 keep struggling to keep fighting 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.180
 as I think he has been doing this in 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:38.180
 one of the last three or four months 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:45.049
 no no I have not spoken yet I think it's 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.489
 other things a hit he received in the 

00:05:45.049 --> 00:05:48.499
 input that the last entry of the 

00:05:46.489 --> 00:05:50.539
 second quarter that we are going to evaluate 

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:52.339
 now and tomorrow in the medical service 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:55.099
 get what we hope is not great 

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:56.360
 thing but good if it's a big thing because 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:59.019
 prepare nun to play some minute 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.019
 lighter 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.160
 Yes thanks
