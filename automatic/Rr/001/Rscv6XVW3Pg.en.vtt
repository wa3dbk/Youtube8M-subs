00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
because then the flap of the bag won't

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.119 
because then the flap of the bag won't
come<00:00:45.989> all<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.170> way<00:00:46.200> down<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.620> bottom<00:00:46.770> but

come all the way down to the bottom but

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.889 
come all the way down to the bottom but
that<00:00:47.280> doesn't<00:00:47.520> matter<00:00:47.610> but<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.480> might<00:00:48.660> not<00:00:48.690> at

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
that doesn't matter but it might not at

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.530 
with thickness don't forget now if you
like<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.590> can<00:02:32.860> make<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.310> handle<00:02:33.880> all<00:02:34.090> in<00:02:34.390> the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
like you can make the handle all in the

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.509 
like you can make the handle all in the
one<00:02:34.690> piece<00:02:35.019> so<00:02:36.120> there's<00:02:37.120> my<00:02:37.480> gusset<00:02:38.170> part<00:02:38.620> and

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
one piece so there's my gusset part and

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.650 
one piece so there's my gusset part and
then<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:40.390> have<00:02:40.780> just<00:02:41.850> move<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:43.000> camera<00:02:43.209> so<00:02:43.420> you

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
then I have just move the camera so you

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:52.380 
then I have just move the camera so you
can<00:02:43.840> see<00:02:44.110> I<00:02:47.100> have<00:02:49.350> my<00:02:50.350> gusset<00:02:50.590> part<00:02:51.090> up<00:02:52.090> to

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
can see I have my gusset part up to

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.390 
can see I have my gusset part up to
there<00:02:52.600> and<00:02:52.870> then<00:02:52.989> I<00:02:53.079> have<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.500> extra<00:02:53.950> bit<00:02:54.190> for

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
there and then I have the extra bit for

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.580 
there and then I have the extra bit for
the<00:02:54.489> handle<00:02:54.970> so<00:02:55.660> I'm<00:02:55.810> gonna<00:02:55.959> grab<00:02:56.200> one<00:02:56.410> more

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
the handle so I'm gonna grab one more

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.569 
the handle so I'm gonna grab one more
strip<00:02:57.130> and<00:02:57.400> I'm<00:02:57.549> gonna<00:02:58.980> connect<00:02:59.980> all<00:03:00.280> this<00:03:02.579> up

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
strip and I'm gonna connect all this up

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:11.940 
strip and I'm gonna connect all this up
together<00:03:03.910> and<00:03:04.630> up<00:03:05.470> to<00:03:07.709> there<00:03:08.709> so<00:03:10.709> that<00:03:11.709> makes

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
together and up to there so that makes

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.890 
together and up to there so that makes
my<00:03:12.220> handle<00:03:12.820> and<00:03:13.060> you<00:03:13.359> might<00:03:13.510> want<00:03:13.690> to<00:03:13.750> adjust

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
my handle and you might want to adjust

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.140 
my handle and you might want to adjust
the<00:03:14.350> size<00:03:14.590> of<00:03:14.890> it<00:03:15.070> as<00:03:15.250> well<00:03:15.549> before<00:03:16.060> you

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
the size of it as well before you

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.360 
the size of it as well before you
completely<00:03:16.690> connect<00:03:17.260> together<00:03:20.250> now<00:03:21.250> if

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
completely connect together now if

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.890 
completely connect together now if
you're<00:03:21.519> gonna<00:03:21.640> make<00:03:21.790> handles<00:03:22.359> that<00:03:22.540> you<00:03:22.720> want

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
you're gonna make handles that you want

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.819 
you're gonna make handles that you want
to<00:03:23.109> make<00:03:23.799> out<00:03:24.040> of<00:03:24.070> two<00:03:24.370> layers<00:03:25.709> instead<00:03:26.709> of

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
to make out of two layers instead of

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.090 
to make out of two layers instead of
sticking<00:03:27.130> them<00:03:27.519> like<00:03:28.060> that<00:03:28.359> and<00:03:28.720> then<00:03:29.100> widen

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
sticking them like that and then widen

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.349 
sticking them like that and then widen
up<00:03:30.280> at<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.519> edge<00:03:30.690> maybe<00:03:32.670> stagger<00:03:33.670> it<00:03:33.760> a<00:03:33.850> bit<00:03:34.030> so

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
up at the edge maybe stagger it a bit so

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.190 
up at the edge maybe stagger it a bit so
it's<00:03:34.540> staggered<00:03:35.049> on<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.260> end<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:37.079> then<00:03:38.079> on

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
it's staggered on the end and then on

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.770 
it's staggered on the end and then on
the<00:03:38.290> other<00:03:38.320> end<00:03:38.680> it's<00:03:39.070> it's<00:03:39.540> staggered<00:03:40.540> too

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
the other end it's it's staggered too

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.510 
the other end it's it's staggered too
and<00:03:41.470> then<00:03:41.590> your<00:03:41.709> next<00:03:41.920> bit<00:03:42.160> of<00:03:42.250> paper<00:03:42.459> path

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
and then your next bit of paper path

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.480 
and then your next bit of paper path
want<00:03:43.730> to<00:03:43.940> lie<00:03:44.120> so<00:03:44.510> if<00:03:44.600> that<00:03:44.780> means<00:03:44.960> they<00:03:45.490> want

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
want to lie so if that means they want

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.460 
want to lie so if that means they want
to<00:03:46.580> lie<00:03:46.730> that<00:03:46.940> they<00:03:47.210> said<00:03:47.720> that<00:03:47.870> you<00:03:48.260> join<00:03:48.590> is

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
to lie that they said that you join is

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.330 
to lie that they said that you join is
is<00:03:51.470> here<00:03:51.980> instead<00:03:52.430> of<00:03:52.610> on<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:54.260> NT<00:03:54.680> I<00:03:54.920> think<00:03:55.250> it

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
is here instead of on the NT I think it

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.430 
is here instead of on the NT I think it
might<00:03:55.490> be<00:03:55.520> a<00:03:55.640> waked<00:03:56.060> join<00:03:56.240> if<00:03:56.420> it's<00:03:56.570> there<00:03:56.780> so

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
might be a waked join if it's there so

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.170 
might be a waked join if it's there so
maybe<00:03:57.620> just<00:03:57.950> stagger<00:03:58.250> and<00:03:58.400> over<00:03:58.790> a<00:03:58.820> little<00:03:58.970> bit

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
maybe just stagger and over a little bit

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.910 
maybe just stagger and over a little bit
like<00:03:59.360> that<00:03:59.390> and<00:03:59.810> then<00:04:00.410> when<00:04:00.530> you<00:04:00.590> get<00:04:00.710> to<00:04:00.770> the

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
like that and then when you get to the

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.140 
like that and then when you get to the
end<00:04:01.040> you'll<00:04:01.190> have<00:04:01.370> a<00:04:01.400> little<00:04:01.640> bit<00:04:01.790> left<00:04:01.970> over

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
end you'll have a little bit left over

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.890 
end you'll have a little bit left over
just<00:04:02.630> trim<00:04:02.870> it<00:04:02.900> off

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.330 

okay<00:04:09.900> so<00:04:09.959> you<00:04:10.230> want<00:04:10.440> to<00:04:10.530> touch<00:04:10.680> your<00:04:10.890> handle

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
okay so you want to touch your handle

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.600 
okay so you want to touch your handle
and<00:04:11.400> what<00:04:11.580> I've<00:04:11.700> done<00:04:11.970> is<00:04:12.239> I've<00:04:12.630> just<00:04:13.489> put<00:04:14.489> them

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
and what I've done is I've just put them

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.949 
and what I've done is I've just put them
together<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:15.060> top<00:04:15.239> just<00:04:15.569> holding<00:04:15.840> them

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
together the top just holding them

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.490 
together the top just holding them
together<00:04:16.160> and<00:04:17.160> then<00:04:18.000> just<00:04:18.239> sort<00:04:19.079> of<00:04:19.230> sitting

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
together and then just sort of sitting

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.170 
together and then just sort of sitting
that<00:04:19.709> like<00:04:19.889> that<00:04:20.190> just<00:04:20.639> so<00:04:20.760> I<00:04:20.790> know<00:04:20.910> I've<00:04:21.150> got

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
that like that just so I know I've got

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.590 
that like that just so I know I've got
enough<00:04:21.359> at<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:21.780> top<00:04:21.989> for<00:04:22.200> the<00:04:22.290> handles<00:04:22.770> I<00:04:23.600> do

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
enough at the top for the handles I do

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.900 
enough at the top for the handles I do
is<00:04:24.840> you<00:04:24.930> want<00:04:25.110> to<00:04:25.200> join<00:04:25.500> our<00:04:28.340> handle<00:04:29.340> to<00:04:29.700> our

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
is you want to join our handle to our

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.629 
is you want to join our handle to our
bag<00:04:31.490> yeah<00:04:32.520> this<00:04:32.790> might<00:04:33.030> be<00:04:33.210> a<00:04:33.240> little<00:04:33.450> bit

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
bag yeah this might be a little bit

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.450 
bag yeah this might be a little bit
that's<00:04:35.639> okay<00:04:36.620> so<00:04:37.620> what<00:04:37.710> we're<00:04:37.830> doing<00:04:37.860> is<00:04:38.280> it

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
that's okay so what we're doing is it

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.500 
that's okay so what we're doing is it
joining<00:04:39.360> our<00:04:39.450> top<00:04:39.780> piece<00:04:40.050> of<00:04:40.080> our<00:04:40.380> bag<00:04:41.389> to<00:04:42.389> the

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
joining our top piece of our bag to the

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.530 
joining our top piece of our bag to the
top<00:04:42.750> part<00:04:43.020> of<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.200> handle<00:04:43.760> bitch<00:04:44.790> and<00:04:45.090> then

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
top part of the handle bitch and then

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.080 
top part of the handle bitch and then
our<00:04:45.690> bottom<00:04:45.990> bit<00:04:46.139> to<00:04:46.320> our<00:04:46.380> bottom<00:04:46.740> card<00:04:47.090> bottom

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
our bottom bit to our bottom card bottom

00:04:48.090 --> 00:05:01.580 
our bottom bit to our bottom card bottom
inch<00:04:54.919> so<00:04:55.919> grabbing<00:04:56.400> our<00:04:57.470> top<00:04:58.470> edge<00:04:59.330> and<00:05:00.590> lining

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
inch so grabbing our top edge and lining

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:08.830 
inch so grabbing our top edge and lining
it<00:05:01.620> up<00:05:01.740> with<00:05:01.919> the<00:05:02.040> top<00:05:02.250> part<00:05:02.550> of<00:05:02.790> our<00:05:02.910> bag

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.200 

so<00:05:09.840> this<00:05:10.020> bit<00:05:10.290> you<00:05:10.590> want<00:05:11.340> to<00:05:11.430> join<00:05:11.700> to<00:05:11.880> the<00:05:11.970> top

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
so this bit you want to join to the top

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.690 
so this bit you want to join to the top
edge<00:05:12.419> of<00:05:12.780> our<00:05:13.020> bag<00:05:15.950> and<00:05:16.950> it<00:05:17.070> might<00:05:17.220> be<00:05:17.250> easier

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
edge of our bag and it might be easier

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.950 
edge of our bag and it might be easier
