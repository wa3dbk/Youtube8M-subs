00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.590
 very good to all gentlemen I am the 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.960
 Sincere welcome from small video 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.700
 teach how to make a laser door for your 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.810
 blackjack paper more than everything ok as 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.580
 can see here we have a door 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.230
 link that is when this chest as 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.760
 can see symbolizes a door link and 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.410
 just when he tried to get in there 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.300
 my sixth a restricted and a half returns 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.160
 ok and here is also symbolized more or 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.960
 less for example for a museum that 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.820
 always the museums in the movie type 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.730
 it goes around that there is a laser and in the 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.500
 medium is the something important a game 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.630
 me something like that ok and good has been 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.130
 symbolized and good as the accomplished 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.070
 make this really very simple to be 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.480
 it's just the typical clock ok and here 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.370
 with these repeaters he is sent the 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.530
 signal to these command block which 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.190
 they are sending particles of happy 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.750
 bayern 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.580
 this means how much the villagers you 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.870
 you put many out some particles 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.000
 well those are the particles that I am 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.010
 using to symbolize the link as 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.750
 can see him symbolized to come out 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.250
 the particles on the top that 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.009
 have a range of three frames it 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.409
 It attracts pictures from above the cube that 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.720
 have three squares and good in that it is 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.520
 single row and they are 50 particles 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.229
 that will send for a second that is not 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.240
 can see here we have all three the 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.680
 three commandos say the same thing I did 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.340
 for what would be in the cell 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.670
 This laser 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.289
 taking care of this jewel according to me what good 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.179
 that I'm also using the same 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.189
 way and iced tea so that I do not 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.990
 let go to this area here and I 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.219
 send here to the middle as you can see my 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.469
 session has restricted 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:39.689
 simply used a third forum that does not 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:42.179
 you can see good here what we have is 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.119
 a telephone and the coordinates here with a 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.729
 1 ok radio and here we have the 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.490
 outside coordinates so that as soon as 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.679
 feel ford starter is fulfilled send a 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.000
 signal that I give a tp to the player more 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.770
 close in this case the player more 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.299
 near here, there are still some 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.220
 coordinates and they will do it more is apt 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.200
 for many people you have to put the 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.409
 exact coordinates and good more or less 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.909
 would be afuerita and here simply in what 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.160
 that is going to say there are restricted areas 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.060
 that's all he has and well I in 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.440
 the description I'm going to leave the 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.610
 command so that you more or less 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.530
 do in a given case that has 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.819
 liked and good been all for the video 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.560
 today I hope you liked that 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.430
 they have served subscribe the favorites 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.430
 and not in the next
