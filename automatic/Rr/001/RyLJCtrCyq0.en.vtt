00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.240 
your hand it's really big yeah yeah well
I<00:01:30.479> guess<00:01:31.049> that's<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.439> way<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:31.829> if<00:01:32.100> that's

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
I guess that's the way it is if that's

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.469 
I guess that's the way it is if that's
the<00:01:32.310> way<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.820> doesn't<00:01:32.970> go<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.270> know<00:01:33.329> in

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
the way it is it doesn't go you know in

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.359 
the way it is it doesn't go you know in
terms<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.439> desk<00:01:34.799> space<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.130> doesn't<00:01:35.310> make

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
terms of the desk space it doesn't make

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.770 
terms of the desk space it doesn't make
a<00:01:35.460> huge<00:01:35.759> difference<00:01:35.970> cry<00:01:36.329> because<00:01:36.509> some<00:01:36.750> of

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
a huge difference cry because some of

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.330 
a huge difference cry because some of
these<00:01:37.020> guys<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.560> brought<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.920> our<00:01:38.100> tiny

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340
