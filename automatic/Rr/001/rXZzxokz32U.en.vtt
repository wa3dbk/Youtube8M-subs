00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 I really hope for a hard fight that 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.990
 teams obey what they are capable of and 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.210
 the winner will not be known until the 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.490
 end a few teams will give on 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.590
 victory is a team very much of 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.150
 Belarus team gomel which is 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.640
 three-time world champion among 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.910
 schoolchildren Gennady Korotkevich and of course 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.189
 all in here is one victory but we hope 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.119
 our teams of St. Petersburg national team 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.849
 St. Petersburg 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.779
 we have a strong team, I from Moscow at a time 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.239
 they create they manage while our 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.210
 the profession of the programmer of Novi Garden steel 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.829
 year crank is not very popular among 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.149
 girls don't get more hopefully 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.149
 what more girls 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.920
 event i'm waiting to attend this 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.809
 the main thing I was planning to become somehow well 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.420
 naturally connect your life with 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.730
 computers with programming here 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.780
 maybe it will be some kind of developer 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.550
 business program 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.879
 like to think of a solution to them 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:06.330
 which is able to give the correct answer 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.799
 always able to process quickly 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.130
 it will be difficult to become peace 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.980
 My name is Dmitry Filipov but I'm in 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.440
 St. Petersburg live in general 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:21.030
 come to perform normally 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.610
 olympiad because in general we 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.460
 We train so well of us happen 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.350
 normal programmers and in general we 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.680
 then we want to study later 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.480
 industrial programming here and right now 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.940
 we train just so you ok 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.030
 writing well I arrived at the All-Russian 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.260
 adalbert schoolchildren want to hide my 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.660
 fifth show yourself your team 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:50.030
 perform worthy of programmers now 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.030
 for Russia, pretty much the right people here 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:58.560
 it's very intense now 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:01.159
 a growing industry, I think Russia is well 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.369
 how there is a shortage in 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.399
 people of this specialty myself from 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.200
 Peter I study in 239 programming me 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.000
 fascinated by my classmates and guys from 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.610
 my school I dream of becoming a programmer 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.379
 in the future because I like it 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.640
 programming for me is now one of 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.650
 main hobbies 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.299
 than i like math but 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.769
 programming love more 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.140
 if interesting dating with new 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.910
 people despite the fact that I know for my 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.129
 my kids programming is probably 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.650
 until passion until she became them yet 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:32.120
 probably the main hobby would be 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.650
 that it was not I would like to 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.329
 There were high results 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.190
 I would like them to achieve in life 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.440
 of all that paid and it is possible with 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.879
 using programming but for me 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.829
 programming I will not say that 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:46.519
 Profession I will say that, too, that hobby 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:49.040
 which I observe in pleasure and in 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.260
 Generally very like when of my 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.280
 children grow talented programmers 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.700
 which go enough index very 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.870
 many support all sorts of 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.930
 academic activities including 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.829
 olympiad olympiad it is very useful 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.359
 Olga you very useful event 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:12.290
 because with them you can 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:14.319
 to interest school children 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.079
 subject they have an incentive to engage 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:21.530
 this subject thanks to this stimulus 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:23.030
 they study much more intensively to spend 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.370
 this is much more time than 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.310
 There are a lot of lessons on this Olympiad. 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:32.060
 talented children we hope that they 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.829
 will continue to grow everything 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:39.169
 smarter and smarter getting more new 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:40.609
 knowledge and consequences will move our 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:44.470
 these industry and on 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.470
 and some hope and science too
