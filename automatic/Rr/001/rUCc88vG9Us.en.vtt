00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
any other chord and you may have noticed

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.289 
any other chord and you may have noticed
that<00:01:37.920> sometimes<00:01:38.159> if<00:01:38.520> you're<00:01:38.640> coming<00:01:39.000> into<00:01:39.180> a

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
that sometimes if you're coming into a

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.800 
that sometimes if you're coming into a
descent<00:01:40.100> you<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.490> pick<00:01:41.790> up<00:01:41.970> some<00:01:42.240> sort<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.479> you

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
descent you you pick up some sort of you

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.440 
descent you you pick up some sort of you
know<00:01:42.920> vibrations<00:01:43.920> like<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.460> or<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:45.329> know

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
know vibrations like this or you know

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.100 
know vibrations like this or you know
you<00:01:45.509> get<00:01:46.170> sort<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.829> twitchiness<00:01:47.659> and<00:01:48.659> what

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
you get sort of a twitchiness and what

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.240 
you get sort of a twitchiness and what
that<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.560> course<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.950> as<00:01:50.070> you're

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
that is of course is as you're

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.130 
that is of course is as you're
descending<00:01:51.060> your<00:01:51.840> rotors<00:01:52.740> are<00:01:52.979> pushing<00:01:54.140> this

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
descending your rotors are pushing this

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.080 
descending your rotors are pushing this
way<00:01:55.409> your<00:01:55.680> prop<00:01:55.920> wash<00:01:56.159> if<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.640> and

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
way your prop wash if you like and

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.609 
way your prop wash if you like and
you're<00:01:57.299> descending<00:01:57.780> through<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.469> there<00:01:58.590> is

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
you're descending through it so there is

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.859 
you're descending through it so there is
an<00:01:58.799> element<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.310> choppy<00:02:00.090> air<00:02:01.189> now<00:02:02.189> that's<00:02:02.399> fine

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
an element of choppy air now that's fine

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.999 
an element of choppy air now that's fine
it<00:02:03.869> will<00:02:03.990> give<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.380> wobbly<00:02:05.250> video<00:02:07.009> for

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
it will give you wobbly video for

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.699 
it will give you wobbly video for
example<00:02:08.459> but<00:02:09.239> normally<00:02:09.690> if<00:02:09.899> you're<00:02:10.319> coming

stably slow pace or you're doing it with

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.110 
stably slow pace or you're doing it with

an upward direction and part weights
going<00:03:27.750> down<00:03:28.020> and<00:03:28.320> you<00:03:28.500> get<00:03:28.650> like<00:03:28.770> a<00:03:28.830> a<00:03:29.240> crossing

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
going down and you get like a a crossing

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.060 
going down and you get like a a crossing
point<00:03:30.630> at<00:03:30.870> some<00:03:31.110> point<00:03:31.320> and<00:03:31.440> at<00:03:31.560> that<00:03:31.710> point

point at some point and at that point

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.030 
point at some point and at that point
there<00:03:32.340> you<00:03:33.330> get<00:03:33.510> a<00:03:33.540> nasty<00:03:34.140> little<00:03:34.230> vortex<00:03:34.800> and

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
there you get a nasty little vortex and

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.680 
there you get a nasty little vortex and
of<00:03:35.220> course<00:03:35.400> as<00:03:35.550> this<00:03:35.670> is<00:03:35.820> spinning<00:03:36.150> around<00:03:36.240> you

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
of course as this is spinning around you

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.340 
of course as this is spinning around you
get<00:03:36.870> a<00:03:36.900> ring<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.560> vortices<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.520> those

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
get a ring of vortices and those

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.450 
get a ring of vortices and those
vortices<00:03:40.520> can<00:03:42.560> reduce<00:03:43.560> an<00:03:43.770> awful<00:03:44.220> lot<00:03:44.310> of<00:03:44.340> the

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
vortices can reduce an awful lot of the

vortices can reduce an awful lot of the
lift<00:03:44.670> and<00:03:45.020> crucially<00:03:46.020> if<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.700> just<00:03:47.970> add<00:03:48.150> power

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
lift and crucially if you just add power

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.120 
lift and crucially if you just add power
as<00:03:48.780> you<00:03:48.870> would<00:03:49.020> normally<00:03:49.200> to<00:03:49.620> get<00:03:49.740> out<00:03:49.860> of<00:03:49.980> it

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
as you would normally to get out of it

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.480 
as you would normally to get out of it
it<00:03:50.910> doesn't<00:03:51.150> work<00:03:51.680> so<00:03:52.680> what<00:03:52.830> you<00:03:52.920> can<00:03:53.100> find<00:03:53.340> is

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
it doesn't work so what you can find is

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.840 
it doesn't work so what you can find is
if<00:03:53.610> you're<00:03:53.790> coming<00:03:54.570> down<00:03:55.400> straight<00:03:56.400> down<00:03:56.610> with

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
if you're coming down straight down with

if you're coming down straight down with

no lateral movement at a fast descent

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.120 
no lateral movement at a fast descent
rate<00:04:00.240> you<00:04:00.510> can<00:04:00.720> get<00:04:00.870> into<00:04:01.080> this<00:04:01.230> situation<00:04:01.470> and

rate you can get into this situation and

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.070 
rate you can get into this situation and
of<00:04:02.670> course<00:04:02.850> your<00:04:03.000> reaction<00:04:03.480> would<00:04:03.570> be<00:04:03.630> to<00:04:03.750> hit

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
of course your reaction would be to hit

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.110 
of course your reaction would be to hit
the<00:04:04.200> throttle<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:04.680> try<00:04:04.920> and<00:04:05.070> pull<00:04:05.670> out<00:04:05.790> of<00:04:05.820> the

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
steep descent that may not work okay

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.780

because all in fact you're doing is

because all in fact you're doing is
you're<00:04:11.940> still<00:04:12.270> creating<00:04:12.810> prop<00:04:13.080> wash<00:04:13.260> is<00:04:13.410> still

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
you're still creating prop wash is still

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.800 
you're still creating prop wash is still
falling<00:04:13.950> through<00:04:14.190> it<00:04:14.310> so<00:04:15.150> what<00:04:15.330> you<00:04:15.450> need<00:04:15.660> to

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
falling through it so what you need to

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.620 
falling through it so what you need to
do<00:04:15.960> is<00:04:16.200> you<00:04:16.410> need<00:04:16.620> to<00:04:16.799> move<00:04:17.670> out<00:04:18.090> of<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:18.390> prop

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
do is you need to move out of the prop

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.300 
do is you need to move out of the prop
wash<00:04:18.840> which<00:04:19.170> basically<00:04:19.470> means<00:04:19.859> use<00:04:20.130> your

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
wash which basically means use your

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.330 
wash which basically means use your
right<00:04:20.640> stick<00:04:21.000> and<00:04:21.239> go<00:04:22.049> in<00:04:22.200> any<00:04:22.350> direction

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
right stick and go in any direction

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.860 
right stick and go in any direction
other<00:04:23.850> than<00:04:23.970> straight<00:04:24.300> down

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.170 

that<00:04:27.500> will<00:04:27.680> move<00:04:27.830> you<00:04:28.009> out<00:04:28.159> of<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:28.729> wash<00:04:28.939> to

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
that will move you out of the wash to

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.540 
that will move you out of the wash to
wash<00:04:29.419> that's<00:04:29.689> causing<00:04:30.050> this<00:04:30.289> upward<00:04:30.740> movement

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
wash that's causing this upward movement

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.850 
wash that's causing this upward movement
here<00:04:31.789> and<00:04:31.819> the<00:04:32.060> and<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:32.479> the<00:04:32.599> vortex<00:04:33.110> will

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
here and the and the the vortex will

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.499 
here and the and the the vortex will
will<00:04:34.250> move<00:04:34.430> to<00:04:34.639> the<00:04:34.729> side<00:04:34.939> and<00:04:35.210> you<00:04:35.389> will

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
will move to the side and you will

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.230 
will move to the side and you will
regain<00:04:35.900> control<00:04:36.680> and<00:04:36.949> then<00:04:37.460> you<00:04:37.639> can<00:04:37.819> throttle

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
regain control and then you can throttle

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.570 
regain control and then you can throttle
out<00:04:39.340> and<00:04:40.340> arrest<00:04:40.939> the<00:04:41.090> descent<00:04:42.340> it's<00:04:43.340> happened

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
out and arrest the descent it's happened

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.390 
out and arrest the descent it's happened
to<00:04:43.639> me<00:04:43.729> a<00:04:43.759> couple<00:04:43.969> of<00:04:44.090> times<00:04:44.860> one<00:04:45.860> sort<00:04:46.099> of<00:04:46.129> very

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.189 
to me a couple of times one sort of very
early<00:04:46.460> flight<00:04:46.819> because<00:04:47.509> as<00:04:47.629> you<00:04:47.750> do<00:04:47.900> you<00:04:48.080> go

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
early flight because as you do you go

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.379 
early flight because as you do you go
out<00:04:48.289> you<00:04:48.469> testy<00:04:48.800> see<00:04:48.919> how<00:04:49.039> fast<00:04:49.280> it<00:04:49.430> got<00:04:49.580> Wow

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
out you testy see how fast it got Wow

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.689 
out you testy see how fast it got Wow
great<00:04:50.719> how<00:04:50.990> fast<00:04:51.229> he<00:04:51.349> thumbed<00:04:51.650> out<00:04:51.830> all<00:04:52.460> that's

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
great how fast he thumbed out all that's

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.119 
great how fast he thumbed out all that's
a<00:04:52.819> bit<00:04:52.969> blue<00:04:53.180> and<00:04:53.569> luckily<00:04:54.469> I<00:04:54.560> was<00:04:54.710> high<00:04:54.889> enough

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:55.129 
a bit blue and luckily I was high enough

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:57.610 
a bit blue and luckily I was high enough
that<00:04:55.340> I<00:04:55.430> I<00:04:55.669> kind<00:04:56.000> of<00:04:56.229> managed<00:04:57.229> to<00:04:57.349> get<00:04:57.439> out<00:04:57.590> of

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
that I I kind of managed to get out of

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.499 
that I I kind of managed to get out of
it<00:04:57.860> by<00:04:58.039> accident<00:04:58.250> there<00:04:59.000> may<00:04:59.150> have<00:04:59.210> been<00:04:59.270> a<00:04:59.389> bit

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
it by accident there may have been a bit

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:00.909 
it by accident there may have been a bit
of<00:04:59.569> a<00:04:59.629> breeze<00:04:59.870> which<00:05:00.139> will<00:05:00.289> of<00:05:00.379> course<00:05:00.500> blow

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
of a breeze which will of course blow

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:06.010 
of a breeze which will of course blow
the<00:05:01.550> prop<00:05:01.759> wash<00:05:01.940> away<00:05:04.240> it's<00:05:05.240> also<00:05:05.449> happened<00:05:05.990> to

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
the prop wash away it's also happened to

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.409 
the prop wash away it's also happened to
me<00:05:06.259> when<00:05:07.159> I've<00:05:07.520> been<00:05:09.909> concentrating<00:05:10.909> more<00:05:11.360> on

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
me when I've been concentrating more on

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:13.930 
me when I've been concentrating more on
filming<00:05:11.930> than<00:05:12.620> on<00:05:12.740> piloting<00:05:13.310> and<00:05:13.699> I<00:05:13.759> think

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
filming than on piloting and I think

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.700 
filming than on piloting and I think
that's<00:05:14.090> a<00:05:14.210> bit<00:05:14.419> of<00:05:14.479> a<00:05:14.569> risk<00:05:14.750> with<00:05:15.020> a<00:05:15.259> flying

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
that's a bit of a risk with a flying

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.070 
that's a bit of a risk with a flying
camera<00:05:15.949> you<00:05:16.580> can<00:05:16.819> focus<00:05:17.270> on<00:05:17.539> one<00:05:17.719> thing<00:05:17.750> and

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
camera you can focus on one thing and

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.260 
camera you can focus on one thing and
not<00:05:18.259> the<00:05:18.289> other<00:05:18.379> so<00:05:19.219> try<00:05:19.490> to<00:05:19.520> get<00:05:19.669> a<00:05:19.729> nice<00:05:19.879> cool

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
not the other so try to get a nice cool

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.240 
not the other so try to get a nice cool
kind<00:05:20.569> of<00:05:20.629> shot<00:05:20.930> of<00:05:21.110> things<00:05:21.379> coming<00:05:21.620> down<00:05:21.740> and

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
kind of shot of things coming down and

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.640 
kind of shot of things coming down and
suddenly<00:05:23.000> I'm<00:05:23.300> coming<00:05:23.629> down<00:05:23.779> too<00:05:23.960> fast<00:05:24.349> and

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
suddenly I'm coming down too fast and

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.170 
suddenly I'm coming down too fast and
not<00:05:24.770> moving<00:05:25.039> anywhere<00:05:25.340> nice<00:05:25.819> of<00:05:25.909> a<00:05:25.939> lateral

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
not moving anywhere nice of a lateral

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.059 
not moving anywhere nice of a lateral
movement<00:05:26.810> and<00:05:27.560> we<00:05:27.650> have<00:05:27.800> a<00:05:27.830> had<00:05:28.250> a<00:05:28.279> near<00:05:29.210> miss

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:30.069 
movement and we have a had a near miss

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:34.360 
movement and we have a had a near miss
so<00:05:31.069> my<00:05:31.279> tops<00:05:31.550> tips<00:05:31.909> would<00:05:32.180> be<00:05:32.389> number<00:05:32.719> one<00:05:33.370> if

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
so my tops tips would be number one if

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.040 
so my tops tips would be number one if
you're<00:05:34.580> gonna<00:05:34.669> come<00:05:35.060> down<00:05:35.090> and<00:05:35.779> you<00:05:35.840> need<00:05:35.960> to

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
you're gonna come down and you need to

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.200 
you're gonna come down and you need to
do<00:05:36.139> it<00:05:36.259> quickly<00:05:36.500> give<00:05:37.460> some<00:05:37.699> right<00:05:37.909> stick

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
do it quickly give some right stick

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.899 
do it quickly give some right stick
input<00:05:38.599> either<00:05:38.810> just<00:05:39.680> you<00:05:39.949> know<00:05:40.099> move<00:05:40.669> at<00:05:40.819> a

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:40.909 
input either just you know move at a

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:43.540 
input either just you know move at a
slope<00:05:41.180> to<00:05:41.990> go<00:05:42.110> down<00:05:42.349> in<00:05:42.620> any<00:05:42.770> direction<00:05:42.949> or

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
slope to go down in any direction or

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.100 
slope to go down in any direction or
alternatively<00:05:44.089> if<00:05:44.240> you're<00:05:44.389> you<00:05:44.750> know<00:05:44.779> if

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
alternatively if you're you know if

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.480 
alternatively if you're you know if
you've<00:05:45.259> got<00:05:45.289> that<00:05:45.710> stage<00:05:46.009> where<00:05:46.250> you<00:05:46.339> can

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
you've got that stage where you can

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:47.920 
you've got that stage where you can
actually<00:05:46.580> put<00:05:46.819> a<00:05:46.849> bit<00:05:46.969> of<00:05:47.000> a<00:05:47.089> coordinated<00:05:47.719> turn

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
actually put a bit of a coordinated turn

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.559 
actually put a bit of a coordinated turn
in<00:05:48.139> the<00:05:48.620> right<00:05:48.860> stick<00:05:49.129> and<00:05:49.310> you're<00:05:49.669> and<00:05:50.479> then

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:50.569 
in the right stick and you're and then

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:53.010 
in the right stick and you're and then
you<00:05:50.750> could<00:05:50.930> always<00:05:51.080> come<00:05:51.500> down<00:05:51.529> in<00:05:51.860> a<00:05:51.949> spiral

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
you could always come down in a spiral

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.269 
you could always come down in a spiral
any<00:05:54.020> of<00:05:54.259> those<00:05:54.349> things<00:05:54.650> that<00:05:55.009> means<00:05:55.190> you're

00:05:55.269 --> 00:05:55.279 
any of those things that means you're

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:56.769 
any of those things that means you're
not<00:05:55.310> coming<00:05:55.729> down<00:05:55.969> directly<00:05:56.360> into<00:05:56.479> your<00:05:56.509> prop

00:05:56.769 --> 00:05:56.779 
not coming down directly into your prop

00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:00.459 
not coming down directly into your prop
wash<00:05:57.020> we'll<00:05:57.289> see<00:05:57.830> you<00:05:58.009> very<00:05:58.810> much<00:05:59.810> safer<00:06:00.259> and

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:00.469 
wash we'll see you very much safer and

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:02.409 
wash we'll see you very much safer and
then<00:06:00.560> coming<00:06:00.800> straight<00:06:00.979> now<00:06:01.129> for<00:06:02.029> filming

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419 
then coming straight now for filming

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:05.469 
then coming straight now for filming
purposes<00:06:02.690> a<00:06:03.490> massively<00:06:04.490> top<00:06:04.789> tip<00:06:05.029> that<00:06:05.240> I<00:06:05.300> got

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 
purposes a massively top tip that I got

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:07.360 
purposes a massively top tip that I got
from<00:06:05.599> somebody<00:06:06.020> else<00:06:06.169> which<00:06:06.949> i<00:06:07.069> think<00:06:07.129> is

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
from somebody else which i think is

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.839 
from somebody else which i think is
brilliant<00:06:07.550> is<00:06:08.000> if<00:06:08.870> you<00:06:08.990> want<00:06:09.229> to<00:06:09.349> do<00:06:09.500> a

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:09.849 
brilliant is if you want to do a

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:12.730 
brilliant is if you want to do a
descending<00:06:10.849> shot<00:06:11.180> for<00:06:12.020> the<00:06:12.110> effect<00:06:12.500> of

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
descending shot for the effect of

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.760 
descending shot for the effect of
whatever<00:06:13.009> that<00:06:13.279> effect<00:06:13.580> is<00:06:13.789> then<00:06:14.690> why<00:06:15.199> not<00:06:15.440> do

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
whatever that effect is then why not do

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.540 
whatever that effect is then why not do
it<00:06:15.800> an<00:06:16.210> ascent<00:06:17.210> and<00:06:17.529> then<00:06:18.529> reverse<00:06:18.949> it<00:06:19.250> when

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
it an ascent and then reverse it when

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.640 
it an ascent and then reverse it when
you're<00:06:19.699> doing<00:06:19.969> the<00:06:20.089> Edit<00:06:20.360> because<00:06:21.349> then<00:06:21.560> you

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
you're doing the Edit because then you

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.379 
you're doing the Edit because then you
don't<00:06:21.800> have<00:06:21.949> to<00:06:22.099> worry<00:06:22.339> about<00:06:22.460> it<00:06:22.909> there's<00:06:23.240> no

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:23.389 
don't have to worry about it there's no

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:25.809 
don't have to worry about it there's no
issues<00:06:23.750> with<00:06:23.990> with<00:06:24.409> with<00:06:25.190> coming<00:06:25.520> down<00:06:25.639> too

00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:25.819 
issues with with with coming down too

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:27.779 
issues with with with coming down too
fast<00:06:26.000> and<00:06:26.120> of<00:06:26.240> course<00:06:26.419> if<00:06:26.569> you<00:06:26.690> if<00:06:26.960> you<00:06:27.139> if<00:06:27.440> you

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:27.789 
fast and of course if you if you if you

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:30.459 
fast and of course if you if you if you
go<00:06:28.789> up<00:06:28.940> quickly<00:06:29.210> and<00:06:29.539> reverse<00:06:29.870> it<00:06:30.110> it<00:06:30.259> would

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:30.469 
go up quickly and reverse it it would

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:32.829 
go up quickly and reverse it it would
look<00:06:30.560> like<00:06:30.620> a<00:06:30.800> rapid<00:06:31.250> descent<00:06:31.569> which<00:06:32.569> would<00:06:32.719> be

00:06:32.829 --> 00:06:32.839 
look like a rapid descent which would be

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:36.650 
look like a rapid descent which would be
a<00:06:32.870> great<00:06:33.639> little<00:06:34.639> tip<00:06:34.880> there

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
a great little tip there

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.600 
a great little tip there
as<00:06:36.870> long<00:06:37.710> as<00:06:37.830> you<00:06:37.890> weren't<00:06:38.070> filming<00:06:38.310> anything

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
as long as you weren't filming anything

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:39.920 
as long as you weren't filming anything
where<00:06:38.790> is<00:06:38.910> obviously<00:06:39.180> was<00:06:39.330> going<00:06:39.480> backwards

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
where is obviously was going backwards

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.740 
where is obviously was going backwards
like<00:06:40.100> cars<00:06:41.100> on<00:06:41.280> a<00:06:41.310> road<00:06:41.520> or<00:06:41.550> something<00:06:41.820> but

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750 
like cars on a road or something but

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:43.910 
like cars on a road or something but
certainly<00:06:43.080> it's<00:06:43.200> something<00:06:43.440> to<00:06:43.530> watch<00:06:43.680> out

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:43.920 
certainly it's something to watch out

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.580 
certainly it's something to watch out
for<00:06:43.950> it's<00:06:44.760> not<00:06:44.910> a<00:06:44.940> you<00:06:45.570> know<00:06:45.660> you<00:06:45.720> if<00:06:46.170> you<00:06:46.320> start

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:46.590 
for it's not a you know you if you start

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.560 
for it's not a you know you if you start
to<00:06:46.740> see<00:06:46.890> these<00:06:47.040> vibrations<00:06:47.970> and<00:06:48.210> juddering

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:48.570 
to see these vibrations and juddering

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.060 
to see these vibrations and juddering
then<00:06:48.930> you<00:06:49.140> are<00:06:49.230> probably<00:06:49.440> going<00:06:49.650> through<00:06:49.740> your

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.070 
then you are probably going through your

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.500 
then you are probably going through your
wash<00:06:50.280> and<00:06:50.580> you<00:06:50.700> probably<00:06:50.910> want<00:06:51.180> to<00:06:51.300> either

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:51.510 
wash and you probably want to either

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.190 
wash and you probably want to either
move<00:06:51.780> out<00:06:51.960> of<00:06:51.990> it<00:06:52.290> or<00:06:52.470> not<00:06:52.980> descend<00:06:53.670> any<00:06:54.200> faster

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:55.200 
move out of it or not descend any faster

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.990 
move out of it or not descend any faster
that's<00:06:55.800> the<00:06:55.950> reason<00:06:56.220> why<00:06:56.340> if<00:06:56.400> you<00:06:56.550> get<00:06:56.670> into<00:06:56.880> an

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 
that's the reason why if you get into an

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.880 
that's the reason why if you get into an
auto<00:06:57.150> land<00:06:57.510> situation<00:06:58.140> on<00:06:58.230> return<00:06:58.560> to<00:06:58.590> home

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:58.890 
auto land situation on return to home

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.380 
auto land situation on return to home
for<00:06:59.100> example<00:06:59.160> you'll<00:06:59.700> see<00:06:59.730> that<00:06:59.880> you<00:07:00.180> know<00:07:00.270> it

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:00.390 
for example you'll see that you know it

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.780 
for example you'll see that you know it
looks<00:07:00.900> like<00:07:01.140> it's<00:07:01.350> taking<00:07:01.740> a<00:07:02.040> fair<00:07:02.370> while<00:07:02.610> to

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:02.790 
looks like it's taking a fair while to

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.940 
looks like it's taking a fair while to
calm<00:07:03.000> down<00:07:03.240> it's<00:07:04.140> doing<00:07:04.410> that<00:07:04.440> deliberately

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:04.950 
calm down it's doing that deliberately

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.100 
calm down it's doing that deliberately
so<00:07:05.070> it's<00:07:05.280> not<00:07:05.370> to<00:07:05.490> get<00:07:05.580> into<00:07:05.760> this<00:07:05.970> so<00:07:06.780> that's<00:07:06.900> a

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.110 
so it's not to get into this so that's a

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.670 
so it's not to get into this so that's a
very<00:07:07.350> brief<00:07:07.680> explanation<00:07:08.450> of<00:07:09.560> settling<00:07:10.560> with

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 
very brief explanation of settling with

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.700 
very brief explanation of settling with
power<00:07:10.920> or<00:07:11.160> vortex<00:07:11.550> ring<00:07:11.760> state<00:07:12.030> and<00:07:12.440> what<00:07:13.440> can

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:13.710 
power or vortex ring state and what can

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.140 
power or vortex ring state and what can
cause<00:07:14.550> it<00:07:14.820> and<00:07:15.030> how<00:07:15.210> you<00:07:15.270> can<00:07:15.660> avoid<00:07:15.960> it

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:17.150 
cause it and how you can avoid it

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.730 
cause it and how you can avoid it
fingers<00:07:18.150> crossed<00:07:18.180> you<00:07:18.720> don't<00:07:18.900> have<00:07:19.080> to<00:07:19.290> but<00:07:19.590> if

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:19.740 
fingers crossed you don't have to but if

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.200 
fingers crossed you don't have to but if
you<00:07:19.890> get<00:07:20.100> into<00:07:20.340> a<00:07:20.370> situation<00:07:20.580> where<00:07:21.060> you're

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.210 
you get into a situation where you're

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.820 
you get into a situation where you're
descending<00:07:21.810> you<00:07:21.960> seem<00:07:22.260> to<00:07:22.380> be<00:07:22.530> still

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:22.830 
descending you seem to be still

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.950 
descending you seem to be still
descending<00:07:23.160> despite<00:07:23.790> having<00:07:24.030> power<00:07:24.390> you

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 
descending despite having power you

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.140 
descending despite having power you
could<00:07:25.200> be<00:07:25.380> in<00:07:25.470> that<00:07:25.620> state<00:07:25.950> try<00:07:26.730> giving<00:07:26.970> it

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.150 
could be in that state try giving it

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.090 
could be in that state try giving it
some<00:07:27.300> right<00:07:27.480> stick<00:07:27.840> and<00:07:28.050> moving<00:07:28.350> out<00:07:28.590> of<00:07:28.650> that

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:29.100 
some right stick and moving out of that

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.800 
some right stick and moving out of that
column<00:07:29.490> of<00:07:29.640> disturbed<00:07:30.150> air<00:07:30.330> that<00:07:30.510> you're<00:07:30.630> in

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:30.810 
column of disturbed air that you're in

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.630 
column of disturbed air that you're in
see<00:07:31.590> if<00:07:31.680> you<00:07:31.770> suddenly<00:07:31.980> regain<00:07:32.430> control

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:32.640 
see if you suddenly regain control

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.540 
see if you suddenly regain control
because<00:07:33.180> even<00:07:33.390> in<00:07:33.480> GPS<00:07:33.900> mode<00:07:34.070> you<00:07:35.070> know<00:07:35.220> you

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:35.550 
because even in GPS mode you know you

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:36.740 
because even in GPS mode you know you
could<00:07:35.760> have<00:07:35.880> been<00:07:35.970> a<00:07:36.030> situation<00:07:36.540> where<00:07:36.660> she

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:36.750 
could have been a situation where she

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.810 
could have been a situation where she
keeps<00:07:36.960> on<00:07:37.080> coming<00:07:37.380> now<00:07:37.530> I<00:07:37.770> hope<00:07:38.610> it<00:07:38.700> doesn't

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:38.820 
keeps on coming now I hope it doesn't

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.490 
keeps on coming now I hope it doesn't
happen<00:07:38.970> to<00:07:39.180> you<00:07:39.330> thanks<00:07:40.080> again<00:07:40.140> for<00:07:40.440> watching

00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919 
rotor pixel gimbal or at least the way I

all<00:07:54.630> the<00:07:54.810> official<00:07:55.140> way<00:07:55.290> but<00:07:55.830> it<00:07:55.919> seems<00:07:56.100> to

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:56.220 
all the official way but it seems to
