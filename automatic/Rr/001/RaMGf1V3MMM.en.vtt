heyyo<00:00:03.360> this<00:00:03.990> is<00:00:04.140> just<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.410> quick<00:00:04.560> video<00:00:04.740> from<00:00:05.100> me

00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:05.839 
heyyo this is just a quick video from me

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:08.450 
heyyo this is just a quick video from me
explaining<00:00:06.839> why<00:00:06.990> all<00:00:07.410> speedruns<00:00:08.069> should<00:00:08.280> not

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
explaining why all speedruns should not

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.089 
explaining why all speedruns should not
be<00:00:08.580> timed<00:00:08.880> using<00:00:09.360> real<00:00:09.570> time<00:00:09.679> I've<00:00:10.679> had<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:10.920> few

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
be timed using real time I've had a few

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.070 
be timed using real time I've had a few
inquiries<00:00:11.400> about<00:00:11.759> why<00:00:12.179> some<00:00:12.420> of<00:00:12.450> my<00:00:12.630> speedruns

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
inquiries about why some of my speedruns

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.810 
inquiries about why some of my speedruns
use<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.650> in-game<00:00:13.830> timer<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.460> measure<00:00:14.610> their

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
use the in-game timer to measure their

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.849 
use the in-game timer to measure their
speed<00:00:15.059> rather<00:00:15.360> than<00:00:15.570> real<00:00:15.780> timer<00:00:16.109> as<00:00:16.500> some

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
speed rather than real timer as some

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.590 
speed rather than real timer as some
people<00:00:16.980> seem<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.340> think<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:17.730> you<00:00:17.850> know<00:00:18.060> real

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
people seem to think that you know real

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.000 
people seem to think that you know real
time<00:00:18.869> measure<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.439> be-all<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.890> end-all

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
time measure is the be-all and end-all

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.880 
time measure is the be-all and end-all
of<00:00:20.279> speedruns<00:00:21.140> this<00:00:22.140> video<00:00:22.439> should<00:00:22.650> prove

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
aims for real time and to do this I

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.760 
aims for real time and to do this I
deliberately<00:00:36.510> mess<00:00:36.809> up<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.380> first<00:00:37.590> two

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
deliberately mess up in the first two

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.740 
deliberately mess up in the first two
acts<00:00:37.950> because<00:00:38.790> there's<00:00:38.969> such<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> huge<00:00:39.390> time

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
acts because there's such a huge time

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.959 
acts because there's such a huge time
bonus<00:00:40.170> when<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.440> get<00:00:40.590> very<00:00:40.800> low<00:00:41.070> times<00:00:41.399> for<00:00:41.940> a

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
bonus when you get very low times for a

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.150 
bonus when you get very low times for a
real<00:00:42.210> time<00:00:42.510> speedrun<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.200> game<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.950> would

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
real time speedrun of this game it would

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.869 
real time speedrun of this game it would
actually<00:00:44.309> be<00:00:44.610> much<00:00:44.850> faster<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.600> suck<00:00:46.879> because

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
actually be much faster to suck because

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.930 
actually be much faster to suck because
as<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:49.200> can<00:00:49.350> see<00:00:49.530> there<00:00:49.770> I've<00:00:50.070> already

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
as you can see there I've already

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.340 
as you can see there I've already
progressed<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> next<00:00:51.690> level<00:00:52.079> despite

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
progressed to the next level despite

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.740 
progressed to the next level despite
being<00:00:52.620> 8<00:00:52.800> seconds<00:00:53.219> slower<00:00:53.430> now<00:00:54.390> I've<00:00:54.570> actually

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
being 8 seconds slower now I've actually

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.889 
being 8 seconds slower now I've actually
abused<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.500> glitch<00:00:55.829> where<00:00:56.190> if<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.940> pause<00:00:57.270> after

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
abused a glitch where if you pause after

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.689 
abused a glitch where if you pause after
you<00:00:57.960> get<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.230> signpost<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.250> time<00:00:59.489> will

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
you get the signpost the time will

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.340 
you get the signpost the time will
continue<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.180> run<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.840> can<00:01:01.079> manipulate

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
continue to run so I can manipulate

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.100 
continue to run so I can manipulate
getting<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.100> lower<00:01:02.250> time<00:01:02.489> bonus<00:01:02.940> it's<00:01:03.570> actually

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
getting a lower time bonus it's actually

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.380 
getting a lower time bonus it's actually
still<00:01:04.500> faster<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.400> wait<00:01:05.580> for<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> timer<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.240> go

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
still faster to wait for the timer to go

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.060 
still faster to wait for the timer to go
to<00:01:06.450> 24<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.520> any<00:01:08.520> act<00:01:09.360> well<00:01:10.020> not<00:01:10.170> any<00:01:10.439> act<00:01:10.710> except

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
to 24 in any act well not any act except

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.010 
to 24 in any act well not any act except
sky<00:01:11.250> high<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.490> where<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.270> would<00:01:12.420> get<00:01:12.600> less

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
sky high to where you would get less

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.800 
sky high to where you would get less
than<00:01:13.049> 20<00:01:13.500> seconds<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.189> level<00:01:14.810> so

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
than 20 seconds in this level so

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.450 
than 20 seconds in this level so
hopefully<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.740> video<00:01:16.890> will<00:01:17.189> clearly

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
hopefully this video will clearly

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.039 
hopefully this video will clearly
demonstrate<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.150> real<00:01:18.420> time<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.869> not<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
demonstrate that real time is not the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.410 
demonstrate that real time is not the
answer<00:01:19.409> for<00:01:19.560> all<00:01:19.710> speedruns<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.490> understand<00:01:21.299> it

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
answer for all speedruns I understand it

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.300 
answer for all speedruns I understand it
is<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.570> much<00:01:21.840> better<00:01:22.020> measure<00:01:22.350> for<00:01:22.710> several

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
is a much better measure for several

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.770 
is a much better measure for several
games<00:01:23.430> where<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.850> in-game<00:01:24.180> timer<00:01:24.450> can<00:01:24.689> be

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
games where the in-game timer can be

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.899 
games where the in-game timer can be
manipulated<00:01:25.530> through<00:01:25.860> lag<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.670> whatever

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
manipulated through lag and whatever

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.690 
manipulated through lag and whatever
else<00:01:27.240> but<00:01:27.540> there<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.590> no<00:01:28.829> biggleland<00:01:29.189> end-all

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
else but there is no biggleland end-all

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.640 
else but there is no biggleland end-all
to<00:01:29.880> use<00:01:30.060> one<00:01:30.299> measure<00:01:30.540> it's<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.049> game<00:01:31.259> by<00:01:31.439> game

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
to use one measure it's a game by game

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.270 
to use one measure it's a game by game
case<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:33.030> games<00:01:33.270> such<00:01:33.750> as<00:01:33.810> these<00:01:34.280> it's

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
case and in games such as these it's

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.980 
case and in games such as these it's
pretty<00:01:35.579> obvious<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.420> should<00:01:36.630> be<00:01:36.780> using

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
pretty obvious that you should be using

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.700 
pretty obvious that you should be using
the<00:01:37.229> in-game<00:01:37.409> timer<00:01:38.990> for<00:01:39.990> games<00:01:40.200> where<00:01:40.470> you

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
the in-game timer for games where you

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.609 
the in-game timer for games where you
know<00:01:40.829> either<00:01:41.100> ones<00:01:41.490> fine<00:01:41.610> I'm<00:01:42.290> fine<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.500> do

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
know either ones fine I'm fine to do

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.380 
know either ones fine I'm fine to do
either<00:01:43.829> but<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.250> prefer<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.909> use<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.210> in-game

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
either but I prefer to use the in-game

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.440 
either but I prefer to use the in-game
timer<00:01:45.869> because<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.920> know<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.280> just<00:01:47.880> think<00:01:48.210> it

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
timer because you know I just think it

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.899 
timer because you know I just think it
makes<00:01:49.140> more<00:01:49.439> sense<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:50.070> you're<00:01:50.399> playing<00:01:50.729> the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
makes more sense that you're playing the

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.520 
makes more sense that you're playing the
game<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.479> may<00:01:51.630> as<00:01:51.750> well<00:01:51.899> use<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.320> game's

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
game you may as well use the game's

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.399 
game you may as well use the game's
measure<00:01:53.270> at<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.450> third<00:01:54.659> level<00:01:54.899> here<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.290> this

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
measure at the third level here in this

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.170 
measure at the third level here in this
video<00:01:55.649> actually<00:01:55.829> makes<00:01:56.189> no<00:01:56.369> sense<00:01:56.700> I'm<00:01:56.850> as

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
video actually makes no sense I'm as

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.450 
video actually makes no sense I'm as
I've<00:01:57.329> been<00:01:57.450> both<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> videos<00:01:58.290> more<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.280> on

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
I've been both of the videos more so on

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.429 
I've been both of the videos more so on
the<00:01:59.579> right<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.119> yet<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.630> still<00:02:00.750> wins<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.229> zone

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
the right and yet it still wins the zone

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.120 
the right and yet it still wins the zone
so<00:02:02.659> clearly<00:02:03.659> showing<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.049> real<00:02:04.680> time<00:02:04.920> is

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
so clearly showing that real time is

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.249 
so clearly showing that real time is
exceptionally<00:02:05.909> stupid<00:02:06.240> for<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.509> game<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:06.960> I

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
exceptionally stupid for this game and I

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.960 
exceptionally stupid for this game and I
mean<00:02:07.530> it's<00:02:07.680> not<00:02:07.860> just<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.429> game<00:02:08.640> there<00:02:08.879> are

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
mean it's not just this game there are

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.510 
mean it's not just this game there are
several<00:02:09.209> games<00:02:10.080> as<00:02:10.319> well<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.800> mean<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.310> haven't

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
several games as well I mean I haven't

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.850 
several games as well I mean I haven't
played<00:02:11.760> every<00:02:12.060> game<00:02:12.090> but<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.599> can

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
played every game but I can

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.830 
played every game but I can
tell<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.160> for<00:02:13.430> sure<00:02:13.460> that<00:02:13.610> pretty<00:02:14.450> much<00:02:14.600> all

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
tell you for sure that pretty much all

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.900 
tell you for sure that pretty much all
of<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.080> Sonic<00:02:15.380> series<00:02:15.590> doing<00:02:16.400> real-time

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
of the Sonic series doing real-time

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.060 
of the Sonic series doing real-time
would<00:02:17.330> be<00:02:17.450> very<00:02:17.660> stupid<00:02:17.930> well<00:02:18.350> most<00:02:18.890> of<00:02:18.980> the

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
would be very stupid well most of the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.120 
would be very stupid well most of the
classic<00:02:19.460> Sonic<00:02:19.760> games<00:02:19.940> anyway<00:02:20.330> Sonic<00:02:21.230> 1<00:02:21.470> for

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
classic Sonic games anyway Sonic 1 for

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.920 
classic Sonic games anyway Sonic 1 for
the<00:02:22.190> Master<00:02:22.520> System<00:02:22.670> has<00:02:23.060> a<00:02:23.090> very<00:02:23.540> similar

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
the Master System has a very similar

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.750 
the Master System has a very similar
time<00:02:24.620> bonus<00:02:24.980> issue<00:02:25.600> where<00:02:26.600> you<00:02:27.170> get<00:02:27.760> 300,000

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
time bonus issue where you get 300,000

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.680 
time bonus issue where you get 300,000
for<00:02:29.150> beating<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.450> game<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.290> timer<00:02:30.590> that

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
for beating the game and the timer that

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.270 
for beating the game and the timer that
the<00:02:32.690> countdown<00:02:33.170> goes<00:02:33.380> even<00:02:33.650> slower<00:02:33.890> in<00:02:34.130> that

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
the countdown goes even slower in that

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.180 
the countdown goes even slower in that
game<00:02:34.460> so<00:02:34.970> it's<00:02:35.150> even<00:02:35.450> worse

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
game so it's even worse

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.620 
game so it's even worse
most<00:02:37.190> of<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.400> classic<00:02:37.760> Sonic's<00:02:38.060> as<00:02:38.180> well<00:02:38.360> just

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
most of the classic Sonic's as well just

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.660 
most of the classic Sonic's as well just
Sonic<00:02:39.050> 1<00:02:39.170> 2<00:02:39.410> 3<00:02:39.620> &amp;<00:02:39.830> Knuckles<00:02:40.100> little<00:02:40.310> Mega<00:02:40.459> Drive

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
Sonic 1 2 3 &amp; Knuckles little Mega Drive

00:02:40.670 --> 00:03:00.640 
Sonic 1 2 3 &amp; Knuckles little Mega Drive
have<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.420> same<00:02:41.630> issue<00:02:41.840> with<00:02:41.959> time<00:02:42.230> bonus
