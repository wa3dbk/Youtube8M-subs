00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.120

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.559
 You can heat more because you painted 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.059
 This way, I'm finally Catholic, it's an animal. 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.309
 It must be one of those children of yours. 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:04.899
 crazy people to get this over with 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:14.450
 Things that go out in charlotte do not come out 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:15.500
 of the minho that there was the km of line is the 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.530
 monica 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.200
 She should come with that color there. 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.170
 until you are enjoying the graffiti of this 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.680
 way on the carnival line or anything there 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:33.920
 You see I wanted to disposable that 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:37.640
 it's happening you too it 's a 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.770
 chicken because people never creased 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:46.310

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:49.070

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.490
 to my best friend got into this RCA 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.170
 a little bit as far as they go 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.390
 Let's go ahead with this joke without 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.229
 free because you are required that 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.360
 genius 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.360
 good staff that's my color 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.700
 is this band are going to live there and I 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.200
 I have to get back here for a 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:17.890
 experience of a compromise 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.820
 I think my mother had player looks 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:25.360
 It's going to rain. 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:28.270
 And since you do not wait, walk there. 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.800
 pilagallo I had never seen to 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.090
 to be so nervous 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.260
 There are a lot of people here that explain everything to me. 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:38.230
 That's right, it's really on the list. 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.300
 the botafogo does not come close to me 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.000
 but because I do not want to be seen 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.860
 happening with types like you need 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.670
 tell the mother 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.670
 pulls life 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.950
 Look, she gave me a little touch. 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.950
 shame 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.250
 ae 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.120
 I do not know how they leave these things. 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.940
 Circling around is old enough. 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.420
 enough this girl is almost being 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.420
 judged 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.849
 u1 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.640
 They are knowing me as if I am. 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.630
 Kenny Noyes will be a justino has 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.560
 way 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.870
 This is the criminal voice instead. 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.370
 You look like a very young lady. 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.190
 nice 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.840
 was what every pine tree with that sense 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.760
 let her have a snack 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.040
 maybe little girl you were not 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.700
 paying attention to the good things in life 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.190
 it 's not anyway 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.800
 this is the efficacy of a willingness to embrace 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.530
 the world does not start applying 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.910
 any agreement but how to involve them 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:40.150
 with your kur as everyone in the ge - 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:43.390

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.010

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.960

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.110
 I do not know what's happening or even 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:05:02.320
 I know what neighbor beans do I 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:05:04.270
 I need to go, I really do. 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.160
 Imagine how confused I am. 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.890
 it seems that everyone has decided to preach 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.410
 a piece was painted jackson and 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.810
 pretend that you do not respect me and I do not know the 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:17.410
 What happened I do not cry laughter like 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:21.230
 they continue just like they feel 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:27.230
 the same things they miss 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:29.660
 there is something created out here very good account 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.160
 hungry I even forgot to have breakfast 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.880
 when I left home 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.680
 Let's go to the whistle and not even 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:41.600
 jokes, I should have thought of that already. 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:44.750
 Before Mom, Mom, you 're already awake. 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.730
 daughter with me is nothing, dear 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.310
 I just thought you already had 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:52.460
 down to have coffee here in the 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:57.260
 I have in my room was my voice. 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:06:01.670
 I think I'm getting read dispute food 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:03.370
 alloy and thorns, and I cast 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.470
 fire 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.350

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:13.340

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:19.550

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:23.380
 it is already agreed this is what is 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.380
 doing there looking at the wall 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:36.400
 but yesterday we established my own 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:39.600
