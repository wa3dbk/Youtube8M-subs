00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.120
 hello to all the guys is received 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.540
 this year the new computer episode 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.190
 museum 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.650
 in this episode they talk about how 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.480
 connect a socket to a 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.000
 switch to maybe make a point 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.800
 light controlled by a switch though 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.300
 in this case we will make a grip 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:40.660
 commanded then necessary of this 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:44.050
 bet an outlet obviously 16 some 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.570
 you want a switch I used more 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.879
 however, that other a switch will have the 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.470
 same function 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.989
 obviously if used on a 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.660
 switch then obviously we have to 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.910
 buy the cable I tell you about 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.640
 current is fine any type of cable 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.710
 and then I saw that it will simulate everything here 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.270
 I'll pretend this will be the line 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.490
 incoming 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.710
 obviously as you know we do not 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.960
 we use the current matha house 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.880
 current of an inverter that like 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.250
 already explained to other episodes is 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.200
 practically a converter that 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:23.530
 converts the current of a battery 12 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:25.539
 volt in 232 20 however current home 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.280
 then first of all what we have to do 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:34.060
 create then we have to start creating 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.440
 a practically we have to take a 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.229
 shows learned to begin a 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.020
 connect the first warm then we must 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:44.910
 go to the beginning take as you see 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:49.349
 our cable which is the entry one 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:57.580
 so with another we go to unscrew it 

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:59.319
 in this way ok unscrewed just ok 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.160
 at this point let's go behind 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.160
 the cable 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.989
 ok 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.620
 once done we are going to remove the 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.410
 carts 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.930
 maybe you could from other experiments e 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:29.620
 let's connect it to the neutral of the 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:31.450
 our grip on this film and we are like that 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.209
 ready we go to connect the last one 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.940
 hot that is of the phase is our grip 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:44.829
 of current that will be what will be his 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:46.950
 is commanded ok let's enter it 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.950
 inside of 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:04.329
 ok at the end it will have to be something 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.610
 of the kind practically connected the 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:09.610
 clean phase as you see the clean phase is 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.769
 connected to the main connector of the 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.470
 our switch and then acquaintance 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.579
 will come out practically and will go to connect 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.709
 to the socket making it so commanded 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:23.530
 we remove all the residues that maybe 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.000
 may affect the operation of the 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.400
 circuit 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.260
 we go to attack the plug and then the 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.629
 second plug 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.840
 guys I don't recommend you 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:37.900
 absolutely to follow what i am 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.060
 doing there is in the sense I advise you to 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.519
 follow my tutorial because it works 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.040
 however in the sense that I advise you not to 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.680
 follow my use as i am doing 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.500
 he said practically without cases 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.939
 therefore without derivation drawers or 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.530
 cases because it is practically for 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:56.230
 save on time the more I'm explaining 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.909
 practically the circuit how and how 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.010
 said it's very dangerous it went to 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:02.079
 touch the contacts I recommend 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.150
 don't do what I'm doing if you want 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.430
 try to take the example but hold on 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.280
 always bought gene stuff cases 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.129
 so it is called boxes of 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.579
 dispensing however for safety reasons and 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.349
 more 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:19.359
 once we are ready however we have 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:21.360
 a circuit then as you see 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:25.110
 at first the light will not turn on 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:28.300
 let's go down the switch as you see 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.630
 will work perfectly let's create it down 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.599
 as you see it works we turn off we find 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.000
 again but it works perfect okay 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:40.120
 guys this was the tutorial of how 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.840
 build an outlet controlled through 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.460
 switch 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.470
 I thank you for viewing 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.880
 this video and see you next time 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.419
 computer museum episode 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.419
 Hello
