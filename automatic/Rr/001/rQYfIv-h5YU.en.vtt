00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.690 
than half way so you still have a bit
showing<00:01:25.680> at<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.860> bottom<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:31.340> I<00:01:32.340> will<00:01:32.579> live

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
showing at the bottom so I will live

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.359 
showing at the bottom so I will live

to rip it and just fold it so here's

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.190 
to rip it and just fold it so here's
what<00:02:16.819> it<00:02:17.000> looks<00:02:17.209> like<00:02:17.360> on<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.959> back<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:20.200> once

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
what it looks like on the back and once

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.090 
what it looks like on the back and once
you've<00:02:21.470> got<00:02:21.800> that<00:02:22.150> we're<00:02:23.150> just<00:02:23.420> going<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:23.810> UM

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:34.210 

fold<00:02:28.100> this<00:02:28.400> over<00:02:32.530> you<00:02:33.530> don't<00:02:33.680> need<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:33.890> i<00:02:34.100> just

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
fold this over you don't need to i just

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.370 
fold this over you don't need to i just
think<00:02:34.580> it<00:02:34.790> gives<00:02:34.970> just<00:02:35.209> more<00:02:35.480> crease<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:36.110> it

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
think it gives just more crease to it

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.910 
think it gives just more crease to it
and<00:02:37.100> i<00:02:37.280> think<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.790> looks<00:02:38.000> better<00:02:39.850> and<00:02:41.920> after

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920

liking fold in half to make a mark and
then<00:03:07.250> fold<00:03:07.730> back<00:03:08.000> to<00:03:08.299> the<00:03:08.420> middle<00:03:08.690> line<00:03:08.870> I'll

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
then fold back to the middle line I'll

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.280 
then fold back to the middle line I'll
just<00:03:09.590> made<00:03:10.000> after<00:03:11.000> you've<00:03:11.480> done<00:03:11.720> that<00:03:11.780> we're

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
just made after you've done that we're

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:19.000 
just made after you've done that we're
just<00:03:12.440> going<00:03:12.829> to<00:03:13.660> make<00:03:14.660> triangles<00:03:17.739> this<00:03:18.739> time

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
just going to make triangles this time

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.349 
just going to make triangles this time
towards<00:03:19.549> the<00:03:20.450> side<00:03:21.230> instead<00:03:21.709> of<00:03:21.950> inside<00:03:22.760> so

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
towards the side instead of inside so

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.710 
towards the side instead of inside so
it'll<00:03:23.690> just<00:03:23.900> look<00:03:24.019> like<00:03:24.079> that<00:03:24.500> and<00:03:25.720> once

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
it'll just look like that and once

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:34.080 
it'll just look like that and once
you've<00:03:26.989> got<00:03:27.260> that<00:03:27.609> we're<00:03:28.609> just<00:03:28.850> going<00:03:29.269> to<00:03:29.570> UM

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.539 

we're<00:03:35.090> going<00:03:35.420> to<00:03:36.170> fold<00:03:36.769> this<00:03:37.459> in<00:03:38.709> so<00:03:39.709> I'm<00:03:40.400> going

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
we're going to fold this in so I'm going

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.849 
we're going to fold this in so I'm going
to<00:03:40.579> look<00:03:40.700> like<00:03:40.910> that<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:41.450> it'll<00:03:42.410> make<00:03:42.680> a

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
to look like that and it'll make a

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.270 
to look like that and it'll make a
triangle<00:03:43.370> here<00:03:44.120> that<00:03:44.950> and<00:03:45.950> we're<00:03:46.130> going<00:03:46.250> to

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
triangle here that and we're going to

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.920 
triangle here that and we're going to
fold<00:03:46.519> this<00:03:46.640> in

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
fold this in

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:59.869 
fold this in
and<00:03:49.709> it<00:03:50.700> will<00:03:50.939> make<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.359> triangle<00:03:52.079> here<00:03:58.189> and<00:03:59.189> it

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
and it will make a triangle here and it

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:05.030 
and it will make a triangle here and it
will<00:03:59.909> take<00:04:00.810> that<00:04:00.989> now<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:02.510> now<00:04:03.510> we're<00:04:03.930> just<00:04:04.040> um

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
will take that now and now we're just um

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.720 
will take that now and now we're just um
and<00:04:06.030> with<00:04:06.329> the<00:04:06.750> triangles<00:04:07.379> you're<00:04:08.370> going<00:04:08.609> to

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
and with the triangles you're going to

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.569 
and with the triangles you're going to
want<00:04:08.879> to<00:04:09.030> pull<00:04:09.299> this<00:04:09.540> like<00:04:10.409> that<00:04:11.060> so<00:04:12.469> yeah<00:04:13.579> just

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
want to pull this like that so yeah just

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.529 
want to pull this like that so yeah just
going<00:04:14.879> to<00:04:15.000> want<00:04:15.269> to<00:04:15.359> pull<00:04:15.659> it<00:04:15.870> pull<00:04:17.209> lift<00:04:18.209> the

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
going to want to pull it pull lift the

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:21.620 
going to want to pull it pull lift the
triangle<00:04:19.430> pull<00:04:20.430> it<00:04:20.549> towards<00:04:20.940> like<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:21.269> and

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
triangle pull it towards like that and

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.870 
triangle pull it towards like that and
we're<00:04:22.380> just<00:04:22.560> going<00:04:22.740> to<00:04:22.770> want<00:04:23.009> to<00:04:23.070> make<00:04:23.250> a<00:04:23.930> ankle

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
we're just going to want to make a ankle

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.460 
we're just going to want to make a ankle
fold<00:04:26.880> at<00:04:27.090> an<00:04:27.210> angle<00:04:27.599> so<00:04:27.840> it's<00:04:27.960> not<00:04:28.080> perfectly

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
fold at an angle so it's not perfectly

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.920 
fold at an angle so it's not perfectly
straight<00:04:28.560> and<00:04:31.880> so<00:04:32.880> when<00:04:33.060> you<00:04:33.180> turn<00:04:33.599> it<00:04:33.780> over

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
straight and so when you turn it over

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.430 
straight and so when you turn it over
it'll<00:04:34.590> look<00:04:34.680> like<00:04:34.860> that<00:04:38.930> so<00:04:39.930> almost<00:04:40.320> looks

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
it'll look like that so almost looks

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.520 
it'll look like that so almost looks
like<00:04:40.650> a<00:04:41.009> pie<00:04:41.310> just<00:04:41.699> accept<00:04:42.330> is<00:04:42.690> some<00:04:43.289> white

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
like a pie just accept is some white

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.020 
like a pie just accept is some white
here<00:04:43.919> so<00:04:44.699> we're<00:04:45.120> gonna<00:04:45.500> fold<00:04:46.500> this<00:04:46.620> out<00:04:47.009> at<00:04:47.820> an

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
here so we're gonna fold this out at an

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.610 
here so we're gonna fold this out at an
angle<00:04:48.300> to<00:04:49.099> make<00:04:50.099> like<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:50.880> sleeves<00:04:51.349> so<00:04:52.349> it'll

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
angle to make like the sleeves so it'll

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.409 
angle to make like the sleeves so it'll
look<00:04:52.650> like<00:04:52.889> that<00:04:53.130> when<00:04:53.729> you<00:04:53.880> flip<00:04:54.090> it<00:04:54.120> over

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
look like that when you flip it over

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:59.420 
look like that when you flip it over
it's<00:04:55.110> a<00:04:55.320> really<00:04:55.440> cute<00:04:55.800> dress<00:04:56.840> and<00:04:58.250> you<00:04:59.250> can
