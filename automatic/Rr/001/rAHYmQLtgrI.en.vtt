look<00:05:33.690> at<00:05:33.810> the<00:05:33.870> wash<00:05:34.050> details<00:05:34.530> too<00:05:34.770> closely

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
look at the wash details too closely

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.170 
look at the wash details too closely
because<00:05:35.250> there<00:05:35.460> was<00:05:35.550> someone<00:05:35.760> waiting<00:05:35.880> gynie

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
because there was someone waiting gynie

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.879 
because there was someone waiting gynie
this<00:05:39.180> is<00:05:39.390> probably<00:05:39.780> a<00:05:39.870> rinse

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.950 

I'd<00:05:44.490> say<00:05:44.699> so<00:05:44.759> because<00:05:45.120> the<00:05:45.240> dryer<00:05:45.509> is<00:05:45.659> about<00:05:45.870> to

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
I'd say so because the dryer is about to

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:52.879 
I'd say so because the dryer is about to
drop

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:55.460
