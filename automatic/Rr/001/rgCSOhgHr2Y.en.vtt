people are really quick and doesn't do
it<00:02:34.410> so

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.990 

per<00:02:43.050> year

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.360 

generating<00:02:50.000> a<00:02:50.300> really<00:02:50.959> fast<00:02:51.260> girl<00:02:51.590> i<00:02:51.950> shelled

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
generating a really fast girl i shelled

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.290 
generating a really fast girl i shelled
the<00:02:52.489> phone<00:02:52.730> for<00:02:53.690> gear

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:07.040 

this<00:03:00.300> is<00:03:00.510> very<00:03:00.840> good<00:03:01.050> process

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.800 

but<00:03:08.050> I<00:03:08.100> think<00:03:09.100> I<00:03:09.310> don't<00:03:09.550> know<00:03:09.640> you<00:03:10.540> can<00:03:10.690> do

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
but I think I don't know you can do

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.380 
but I think I don't know you can do
better<00:03:11.760> but<00:03:12.760> it's<00:03:13.030> no<00:03:13.630> good<00:03:13.990> thing<00:03:14.260> going

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
better but it's no good thing going

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.480 
better but it's no good thing going
