00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
to talk about those silver fillings in

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.310 
to talk about those silver fillings in
your<00:00:24.220> mouth<00:00:24.369> first<00:00:25.180> why<00:00:25.630> do<00:00:25.689> you<00:00:25.869> still<00:00:26.110> have

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
your mouth first why do you still have

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.440 
your mouth first why do you still have
them<00:00:26.619> they're<00:00:27.040> old<00:00:27.400> they're<00:00:27.790> ugly<00:00:28.300> and

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
them they're old they're ugly and

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.290 
them they're old they're ugly and
probably<00:00:29.080> doing<00:00:29.470> more<00:00:29.680> harm<00:00:29.919> than<00:00:30.099> good

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
probably doing more harm than good

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.790 
probably doing more harm than good
summer<00:00:31.300> fillings<00:00:31.720> aren't<00:00:32.140> pure<00:00:32.320> silver<00:00:32.619> you

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
summer fillings aren't pure silver you

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.619 
summer fillings aren't pure silver you
know<00:00:32.920> they're<00:00:33.370> actually<00:00:34.030> a<00:00:34.059> mixture<00:00:34.540> of

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:34.629 
know they're actually a mixture of

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.670 
know they're actually a mixture of
silver<00:00:35.199> tin<00:00:35.739> zinc<00:00:36.370> copper<00:00:36.910> and<00:00:37.150> Mercury<00:00:38.140> where

research on mercury fillings can agree
as<00:00:49.930> to<00:00:50.079> whether<00:00:50.260> the<00:00:50.500> amount<00:00:50.860> of<00:00:51.010> mercury

as to whether the amount of mercury

as to whether the amount of mercury

being leached out of the filling is

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.920 
being leached out of the filling is

enough to do harm to me it seems only

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.779 
enough to do harm to me it seems only
logical<00:00:56.050> that<00:00:56.620> even<00:00:56.920> a<00:00:57.010> small<00:00:57.430> amount<00:00:57.460> of

removal of decayed tooth structure this
is<00:01:17.649> usually<00:01:17.860> done<00:01:18.190> under<00:01:18.490> anesthesia<00:01:18.970> and<00:01:19.330> God
