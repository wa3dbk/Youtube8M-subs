00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
quite another a couple of functions

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.340 
quite another a couple of functions
which<00:02:17.150> might<00:02:17.360> not<00:02:17.480> know<00:02:17.600> about<00:02:17.750> it's<00:02:17.870> got<00:02:17.989> one

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
which might not know about it's got one

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.800 
which might not know about it's got one
which<00:02:18.560> is<00:02:18.680> an<00:02:18.920> T<00:02:19.310> big<00:02:19.730> meeting<00:02:20.300> or<00:02:20.420> Veen

which is an T big meeting or Veen
lifting<00:02:21.319> and<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:21.860> know<00:02:22.069> how<00:02:22.160> you<00:02:22.220> get<00:02:22.370> like<00:02:22.550> a

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
lifting and you know how you get like a

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.660 
lifting and you know how you get like a
darkness<00:02:23.209> around<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.989> edge<00:02:24.350> of<00:02:24.650> your<00:02:24.890> image

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
darkness around the edge of your image

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.030 
darkness around the edge of your image
it<00:02:26.000> has<00:02:26.450> an<00:02:26.959> auto<00:02:27.170> thing<00:02:27.590> where<00:02:27.739> it<00:02:27.830> kind<00:02:28.010> of

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
it has an auto thing where it kind of

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.490 
it has an auto thing where it kind of
takes<00:02:28.370> away<00:02:28.459> of<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:28.819> in<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.060> JPEG<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.630> it

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
takes away of that in the JPEG and it

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.500 
takes away of that in the JPEG and it
also<00:02:30.770> has<00:02:31.610> a<00:02:31.640> thing<00:02:32.000> where<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:32.209> can<00:02:32.360> do

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
also has a thing where it can do

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.160 
also has a thing where it can do
automatic<00:02:33.190> DX<00:02:34.190> crop<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:35.270> automatic<00:02:35.810> becomes<00:02:36.020> a

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
automatic DX crop so automatic becomes a

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.670 
automatic DX crop so automatic becomes a
6<00:02:36.440> megapixel<00:02:37.190> image<00:02:37.670> but<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:39.230> that's<00:02:39.350> fine

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
6 megapixel image but and that's fine

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
6 megapixel image but and that's fine
with<00:02:39.920> this<00:02:40.130> like<00:02:40.489> this<00:02:41.500> 18<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.590> 200<00:02:43.100> millimeter

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
with this like this 18 to 200 millimeter

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.400 
with this like this 18 to 200 millimeter
lens<00:02:43.730> that<00:02:44.120> works<00:02:44.390> because<00:02:44.840> otherwise<00:02:45.200> you

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
lens that works because otherwise you

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.229 
lens that works because otherwise you
get<00:02:45.530> this<00:02:45.620> in<00:02:45.739> a<00:02:45.830> funny<00:02:46.130> Luke<00:02:46.580> current<00:02:47.030> age

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
get this in a funny Luke current age

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.460 
get this in a funny Luke current age
which<00:02:47.480> if<00:02:47.600> you<00:02:47.690> look<00:02:47.810> at<00:02:47.900> this<00:02:48.050> picture<00:02:48.440> here

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
which if you look at this picture here

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.000 
which if you look at this picture here
here<00:02:49.370> you<00:02:49.550> can<00:02:49.730> see<00:02:49.989> when<00:02:50.989> I<00:02:51.200> don't<00:02:51.650> have<00:02:51.890> the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
here you can see when I don't have the

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.710 
here you can see when I don't have the
lens<00:02:52.190> hood<00:02:52.400> on<00:02:52.580> it's<00:02:52.940> got<00:02:53.269> that<00:02:53.420> there<00:02:53.569> is<00:02:53.690> a

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
lens hood on it's got that there is a

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.590 
lens hood on it's got that there is a
proper<00:02:54.170> circle<00:02:54.769> and<00:02:54.980> in<00:02:55.850> this<00:02:56.060> next<00:02:56.330> image

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
proper circle and in this next image

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.900 
proper circle and in this next image
you'll<00:02:57.110> see<00:02:57.380> with<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:57.860> lens<00:02:58.220> hood<00:02:58.430> on<00:02:58.610> it's

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
you'll see with the lens hood on it's

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.520 
you'll see with the lens hood on it's
got<00:02:59.090> this<00:02:59.180> kind<00:02:59.330> of<00:02:59.450> cool<00:02:59.720> little<00:02:59.989> shape<00:03:00.260> in<00:03:00.440> it

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
got this kind of cool little shape in it

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.740 
got this kind of cool little shape in it
just<00:03:00.950> kind<00:03:01.160> of<00:03:01.190> adds<00:03:01.459> to<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.239> image<00:03:02.540> in<00:03:02.720> some

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
just kind of adds to the image in some

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.840 
just kind of adds to the image in some
cases<00:03:03.200> but<00:03:03.590> it's<00:03:04.190> not<00:03:04.370> really<00:03:04.610> what<00:03:04.730> you're

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
cases but it's not really what you're

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.640 
cases but it's not really what you're
wanting<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.120> do<00:03:05.299> so<00:03:05.510> you're<00:03:05.660> usually<00:03:05.900> cropping

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
wanting to do so you're usually cropping

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.710 
wanting to do so you're usually cropping
within<00:03:07.040> that<00:03:07.250> but<00:03:07.880> I<00:03:07.910> kind<00:03:08.299> of<00:03:08.330> like<00:03:08.540> that

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
within that but I kind of like that

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.630 
within that but I kind of like that
because<00:03:08.810> I<00:03:09.260> pretty<00:03:09.530> much<00:03:09.650> edit<00:03:10.070> all<00:03:10.190> my<00:03:10.370> photos

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
because I pretty much edit all my photos

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.060 
because I pretty much edit all my photos
so<00:03:10.880> I<00:03:10.910> will<00:03:11.209> crop<00:03:11.540> each<00:03:12.049> individual<00:03:12.680> one<00:03:12.829> so

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
so I will crop each individual one so

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.770 
so I will crop each individual one so
I'm<00:03:13.220> still<00:03:13.519> getting<00:03:13.820> the<00:03:13.850> twelve<00:03:14.269> million

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
I'm still getting the twelve million

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.100 
I'm still getting the twelve million
pixels<00:03:15.530> amount<00:03:16.519> of<00:03:16.579> detail<00:03:17.000> in<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.630> in<00:03:17.930> the

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
pixels amount of detail in the in the

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.500 
pixels amount of detail in the in the
kind<00:03:18.500> of<00:03:18.560> long<00:03:18.980> ways<00:03:19.220> that<00:03:19.400> -<00:03:19.670> a<00:03:19.730> better<00:03:19.940> sight

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
kind of long ways that - a better sight

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.210 
kind of long ways that - a better sight
and<00:03:20.780> especially<00:03:21.440> doing<00:03:21.739> kind<00:03:21.920> of<00:03:21.980> more<00:03:22.100> of

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
and especially doing kind of more of

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.830 
and especially doing kind of more of
panoramic<00:03:22.790> shots<00:03:23.060> of<00:03:23.209> people<00:03:23.329> who<00:03:23.570> don't<00:03:23.660> need

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
panoramic shots of people who don't need

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.849 
panoramic shots of people who don't need
the<00:03:23.989> fill<00:03:24.230> square<00:03:25.040> um<00:03:25.810> but<00:03:26.810> but<00:03:27.320> when<00:03:27.530> I<00:03:27.560> used

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
the fill square um but but when I used

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.509 
the fill square um but but when I used
my<00:03:27.980> Tokina<00:03:28.609> 11<00:03:29.239> to<00:03:29.570> 60<00:03:30.019> millimeters<00:03:30.230> if<00:03:31.010> I<00:03:31.190> just

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
my Tokina 11 to 60 millimeters if I just

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.610 
my Tokina 11 to 60 millimeters if I just
zoomed<00:03:31.880> it<00:03:32.030> in<00:03:32.150> to<00:03:32.329> 60<00:03:32.690> millimeters<00:03:32.900> it

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
zoomed it in to 60 millimeters it

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.080 
zoomed it in to 60 millimeters it
covered<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.160> full<00:03:34.400> full<00:03:35.030> full<00:03:36.609> sensor<00:03:37.609> size

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
covered the full full full sensor size

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.140 
covered the full full full sensor size
anyways<00:03:38.570> so<00:03:38.900> it<00:03:39.230> was<00:03:39.380> like<00:03:39.560> having<00:03:39.859> a<00:03:40.190> 14

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
anyways so it was like having a 14

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.170 
anyways so it was like having a 14
millimeter<00:03:41.359> lens<00:03:42.350> on<00:03:42.680> this<00:03:43.400> so<00:03:43.670> it<00:03:43.970> works

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
millimeter lens on this so it works

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.360 
millimeter lens on this so it works
really<00:03:44.359> well<00:03:44.450> so<00:03:44.840> you<00:03:45.500> don't<00:03:45.590> always<00:03:45.829> have<00:03:46.190> to

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
really well so you don't always have to

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.970 
really well so you don't always have to
have<00:03:46.579> as<00:03:46.850> a<00:03:46.880> cropped<00:03:47.380> sense<00:03:48.380> if<00:03:48.530> you<00:03:48.680> do<00:03:48.799> with

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
have as a cropped sense if you do with

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.199 
have as a cropped sense if you do with
different<00:03:49.280> lenses<00:03:49.549> only<00:03:49.700> with<00:03:49.910> these<00:03:50.060> that

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
different lenses only with these that

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.840 
different lenses only with these that
long<00:03:50.420> zoom<00:03:51.140> ones<00:03:51.380> so<00:03:52.220> that<00:03:52.250> was<00:03:52.489> know<00:03:52.640> a<00:03:52.670> really

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
long zoom ones so that was know a really

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.289 
long zoom ones so that was know a really
cool<00:03:53.180> thing<00:03:53.269> but<00:03:53.920> then<00:03:54.920> today<00:03:55.160> I've<00:03:55.609> been<00:03:56.150> out

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
before it started going to slow again

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.130 
before it started going to slow again

and I wasn't that great so that's where
also<00:04:37.260> the<00:04:37.410> d3<00:04:38.070> comes<00:04:38.700> in<00:04:38.850> handy<00:04:39.140> but<00:04:40.140> if<00:04:40.320> it<00:04:40.530> was

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
also the d3 comes in handy but if it was

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.760

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.440 
pretty quickly and that's what the where
the<00:05:00.840> d3<00:05:01.290> has<00:05:01.440> much<00:05:01.680> more<00:05:02.220> channels<00:05:03.120> for<00:05:03.330> its

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
the d3 has much more channels for its

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.710 
the d3 has much more channels for its
buffer<00:05:03.750> to<00:05:03.870> go<00:05:03.960> through<00:05:04.200> so<00:05:05.010> so<00:05:05.850> yeah<00:05:05.970> build

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
buffer to go through so so yeah build

extra<00:06:12.930> battery<00:06:13.170> pack<00:06:13.530> in<00:06:13.740> I<00:06:13.920> managed<00:06:14.430> to<00:06:14.460> get

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.070 

1430<00:06:18.930> photos<00:06:19.350> and<00:06:19.650> still<00:06:19.890> got<00:06:20.010> 2%<00:06:20.370> in<00:06:20.700> it<00:06:20.820> and

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
1430 photos and still got 2% in it and

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.870 
1430 photos and still got 2% in it and
on<00:06:22.080> the

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
on the

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.760 
on the
batteries<00:06:23.450> already<00:06:23.690> have<00:06:23.870> said<00:06:24.050> it<00:06:24.170> only<00:06:24.410> 2%

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
batteries already have said it only 2%

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.440 
batteries already have said it only 2%
was<00:06:25.130> used<00:06:25.310> I<00:06:25.400> think<00:06:25.430> that<00:06:25.670> was<00:06:25.760> the<00:06:25.940> power<00:06:26.240> that

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.450 
was used I think that was the power that

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.990 
was used I think that was the power that
was<00:06:26.570> used<00:06:26.810> while<00:06:27.560> as<00:06:27.860> a<00:06:27.890> case<00:06:28.400> another<00:06:28.670> battery

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
was used while as a case another battery

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.110 
was used while as a case another battery
pack<00:06:29.180> on<00:06:29.420> and<00:06:29.690> 15-footers<00:06:30.530> so<00:06:31.220> that<00:06:31.430> that's<00:06:31.970> a

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
pack on and 15-footers so that that's a

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.080 
pack on and 15-footers so that that's a
huge<00:06:32.630> number<00:06:32.930> of<00:06:33.110> forces<00:06:33.530> are<00:06:33.650> 1,400<00:06:34.550> and<00:06:34.730> got

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
huge number of forces are 1,400 and got

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.000 
huge number of forces are 1,400 and got
to<00:06:35.150> remember<00:06:35.270> that<00:06:35.420> was<00:06:35.840> quite<00:06:36.530> a<00:06:36.590> lot<00:06:36.890> of
