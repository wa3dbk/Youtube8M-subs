00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.199
 I was growing up in the streets as an American orphan 

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:04.180
 Bangkok on 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.120
 and probably for a crime he did not commit to jail 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.120
 remains 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:16.039
 and they all stand 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.699
 He finances his life through life and death struggles 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.079
 for which he paid a small amount 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:30.889
 the 1 percent initially low THR 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.910
 to Paris 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.910
 the descent followed 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.440
 after he beat her every opponent 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.440
 There, he will eventually become the biggest challenge 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.250
 Finally, fighting for survival through shots fights hard to understand his 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.200
 sister 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.200
 now fall victim to stress 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.700
 Gescher 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.750
 he jokes governing for the fight against speech is the naughty tech 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.750
 Master decision 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.039
 Richert is north 

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.989
 the descent followed
