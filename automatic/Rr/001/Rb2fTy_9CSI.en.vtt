on the front here it says it had
mushroom<00:00:28.829> pin<00:00:29.099> tumbler<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:29.759> I<00:00:29.790> was<00:00:29.910> really

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:30.149 
mushroom pin tumbler so I was really

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:31.639 
mushroom pin tumbler so I was really
thinking<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.840> was<00:00:30.960> unusual<00:00:31.140> and

00:00:31.639 --> 00:00:31.649 
thinking that that was unusual and

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.090 
thinking that that was unusual and
looking<00:00:32.130> forward<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.489> picking<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:34.010> you<00:00:35.010> know

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
looking forward to picking it you know

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.319 
looking forward to picking it you know
it<00:00:35.190> says<00:00:35.399> hardened<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:35.940> everything<00:00:36.270> I

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
it says hardened and everything I

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.000 
it says hardened and everything I
haven't<00:00:36.600> tested<00:00:36.750> any<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.290> but<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.530> really

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
haven't tested any of that but I really

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.610 
haven't tested any of that but I really
doubt<00:00:38.220> it<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:39.210> hardened<00:00:39.620> he

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
doubt it that it that it's hardened he

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.610

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.360 
it in there and we just rock this thing
of<00:01:30.810> course<00:01:31.020> now<00:01:31.260> that<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.530> cameras<00:01:31.950> won't<00:01:32.100> on

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
of course now that the cameras won't on

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.340 
of course now that the cameras won't on
it's<00:01:32.580> not<00:01:32.760> going<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:32.970> cooperate<00:01:33.150> with<00:01:33.630> us<00:01:33.810> but

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.730 

there<00:01:37.350> we<00:01:37.470> go

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
there we go

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.200 
there we go
that's<00:01:37.860> how<00:01:38.010> easy<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.369> rocked<00:01:38.670> but<00:01:38.940> you<00:01:39.090> know

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
that's how easy it rocked but you know

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.060 
that's how easy it rocked but you know
what<00:01:39.390> that's<00:01:39.960> really<00:01:40.140> not<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.470> worst<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.950> it

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
what that's really not the worst of it

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.680 
what that's really not the worst of it
this<00:01:41.190> really<00:01:41.490> was<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> waste<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.150> ten<00:01:42.420> dollars

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
this really was a waste of ten dollars

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.410 
this really was a waste of ten dollars
so<00:01:43.190> and<00:01:44.190> I<00:01:44.369> can't<00:01:44.580> believe<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:44.909> guy<00:01:45.119> didn't

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
so and I can't believe this guy didn't

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.480 
so and I can't believe this guy didn't
get<00:01:45.570> robbed<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.140> all<00:01:46.290> those<00:01:46.470> years

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
get robbed in all those years

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.640 
get robbed in all those years
it's<00:01:47.760> also<00:01:48.090> unshielded<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:49.110> I'm<00:01:49.200> gonna<00:01:49.320> go<00:01:49.500> in

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
it's also unshielded so I'm gonna go in

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.590 
it's also unshielded so I'm gonna go in
through<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:49.950> keyhole<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:51.240> through<00:01:51.510> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
through the keyhole and through the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.149 
through the keyhole and through the
keyway<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.140> we're<00:01:52.260> just<00:01:52.409> going<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.590> disengage

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
keyway and we're just going to disengage

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.149 
keyway and we're just going to disengage
the<00:01:53.189> locking<00:01:53.610> mechanism<00:01:54.330> it<00:01:54.740> down<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.950> side

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
the locking mechanism it down the side

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.660 
the locking mechanism it down the side
with<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.640> pins<00:01:57.119> on<00:01:57.390> it

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
with the pins on it

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.630 
with the pins on it
and<00:01:59.990> compress<00:02:00.990> them<00:02:01.260> and<00:02:01.619> just<00:02:02.130> pop<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.610> just

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
and compress them and just pop it just

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.179 
and compress them and just pop it just
like<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:04.290> it's<00:02:04.530> clear<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:04.830> there<00:02:05.159> are

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
like that so it's clear that there are

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.419 
like that so it's clear that there are
not<00:02:05.490> two<00:02:06.200> locking<00:02:07.200> Paul's<00:02:07.650> inside<00:02:08.189> there's

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
not two locking Paul's inside there's

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.940 
not two locking Paul's inside there's
only<00:02:08.580> one<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:08.909> only<00:02:09.209> had<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.509> unlock<00:02:09.899> one<00:02:10.679> side

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
only one I only had to unlock one side

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.750 
only one I only had to unlock one side
this<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.659> probably<00:02:12.659> a<00:02:12.720> $2.00<00:02:13.379> lock<00:02:13.769> at<00:02:14.069> best

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
this is probably a $2.00 lock at best

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.759 
this is probably a $2.00 lock at best
again<00:02:14.970> here<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.360> am<00:02:15.480> in<00:02:15.689> Africa<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.319> got<00:02:16.500> ripped

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420
