00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
 but this is the cali 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.140
 I am evil 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.599
 they were very good and we are returning 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.050
 for the channel and this time it took off 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.440
 the pheasant 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.240
 4.1 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.620
 this is a small update for 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.250
 those who have had errors 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.870
 as for closures in version 4 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.690
 commented not everyone has happened sometimes 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:35.070
 to some since the zombie mountains and the 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.480
 mold then of the double gta 5 valleys 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.760
 that they used closures in some 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.630
 devices this time I come with 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.640
 the 4.1 in which corrected these books 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.190
 the bucs these closures there are no closures 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.770
 I added some cars as you see this 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.640
 pack pin terminator this beautiful 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.370
 it is beautiful I have added many more 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.989
 still 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.180
 adding still to the bikes and then 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.360
 this is a version because that's why he put 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.390
 4.1 The truth is not much 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.640
 is that they only change, only the 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.480
 mods then of zombies and the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.120
 mountain 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.360
 of gangs from 7 to 5 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.420
 in exchange for that I add this I think mounts 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.030
 that says how will gta 5 be a 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.370
 way of handling gta 5 as they see 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.550
 the time to go around moves like the 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.670
 GTA 5 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.070
 also add more cars 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.400
 I told 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.920
 I added other times I will teach you 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.310
 change this the graph I put the tv3 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.670
 so that he goes when he asks us is that the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.940
 p3 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:55.659
 if you want us that added 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:59.499
 good 94 appointment is already there he 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.870
 admit admire 

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:04.610
 he taught me 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.710
 the word has added this other 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.789
 they told me the group changed what 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.730
 look in that faith 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.849
 I do not know have been like five or six cars 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:19.390
 extra from version 4 to 4.1 add 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:22.750
 extra dose and fix the bucs so 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.060
 now it 's more fluid it ends it from 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.670
 yesterday but I passed them to my friends from 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.680
 gta developer to try and 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.540
 and they say why they were the 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.340
 who informed me that they were given 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.090
 closures and that did not open the game 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.609
 then shit I pass them to them 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.519
 for them to try it one day and that 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:43.760
 they told me master already works and so that 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.250
 believe 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.069
 it works without problems and without 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.530
 closes so now it's come 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:55.220
 sharing and if you are one of those who can 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.260
 to 4.0 in version 4 and gave him closures 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.980
 he recommended that I can in this version to 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.510
 4.1 so that they can play well well 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.260

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:19.120
