you<00:01:55.439> releasing<00:01:55.829> new<00:01:56.159> hardware<00:01:56.549> then<00:01:56.790> yeah<00:01:57.630> we

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
you releasing new hardware then yeah we

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.990 
you releasing new hardware then yeah we
people<00:01:58.320> want<00:01:58.590> new<00:01:58.740> hardware<00:01:59.130> developers<00:01:59.729> want

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
people want new hardware developers want

people want new hardware developers want
new<00:02:00.149> hardware<00:02:00.540> but<00:02:00.810> if<00:02:00.899> it's<00:02:01.049> not<00:02:01.259> going<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.590> be

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
new hardware but if it's not going to be

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.969 
new hardware but if it's not going to be
a<00:02:02.630> decent<00:02:03.630> leap<00:02:04.110> from<00:02:04.380> what<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.740> already<00:02:04.829> have

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
a decent leap from what you already have

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.029 
a decent leap from what you already have
then<00:02:05.520> what's<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.060> point<00:02:06.360> it's<00:02:07.140> stupid<00:02:07.799> wives

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
then what's the point it's stupid wives

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.729 
then what's the point it's stupid wives
because<00:02:08.459> investors<00:02:09.149> want<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.840> because

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
because investors want you to because

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.380 
because investors want you to because
you<00:02:10.890> want<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.129> trick<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.580> public<00:02:11.910> into<00:02:12.180> being

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
you want to trick the public into being

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.820 
you want to trick the public into being
excited<00:02:12.900> for<00:02:13.110> next<00:02:13.260> Jensen

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
excited for next Jensen

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.670 
excited for next Jensen
systems<00:02:14.100> like<00:02:14.300> why<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.630> mean<00:02:15.840> Nintendo<00:02:16.320> needed

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
systems like why I mean Nintendo needed

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.650 
systems like why I mean Nintendo needed
to<00:02:16.800> release<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.310> wii<00:02:17.490> u<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.910> wii<00:02:18.360> was

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
to release the wii u the wii was

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.810 
to release the wii u the wii was
outdated<00:02:19.260> when<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.710> came<00:02:19.890> out<00:02:19.920> six<00:02:20.340> years<00:02:20.580> ago

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
outdated when it came out six years ago

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.630 
outdated when it came out six years ago
so<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.780> was<00:02:21.860> ridiculously<00:02:22.860> behind<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.400> curve

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
so it was ridiculously behind the curve

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.050 
so it was ridiculously behind the curve
so<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:23.970> wii<00:02:24.150> u<00:02:24.300> was<00:02:24.540> necessary<00:02:25.170> but<00:02:25.440> if<00:02:26.070> the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
so the wii u was necessary but if the

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.420 
so the wii u was necessary but if the
ps4<00:02:27.570> and<00:02:28.050> 720<00:02:28.770> are<00:02:28.860> just<00:02:29.070> going<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.250> be

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
ps4 and 720 are just going to be

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.090 
ps4 and 720 are just going to be
slightly<00:02:30.270> better<00:02:30.630> with<00:02:30.960> more<00:02:31.200> anti-aliasing

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
slightly better with more anti-aliasing

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.130 
slightly better with more anti-aliasing
and<00:02:32.220> some<00:02:32.430> better<00:02:32.640> lighting<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.870> it's<00:02:33.960> not

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
and some better lighting and it's not

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.440 
and some better lighting and it's not
really<00:02:34.320> going<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.470> be<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.590> noticeable<00:02:34.830> jump

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
really going to be a noticeable jump

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.370 
really going to be a noticeable jump
you're<00:02:36.450> going<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.660> really<00:02:36.870> make<00:02:37.050> people<00:02:37.290> go

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
you're going to really make people go

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
you're going to really make people go
out<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.620> spend<00:02:37.770> 350<00:02:38.370> 400<00:02:38.940> bucks<00:02:39.120> on<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.360> more<00:02:39.810> I

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
out and spend 350 400 bucks on it more I

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.370 
out and spend 350 400 bucks on it more I
don't<00:02:41.400> know<00:02:41.460> that's<00:02:41.940> just<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.570> really<00:02:43.080> think

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
don't know that's just I really think

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.170 
don't know that's just I really think
they<00:02:43.530> should<00:02:43.710> wait<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.160> wait<00:02:44.340> for<00:02:44.580> technology

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
they should wait and wait for technology

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.390 
they should wait and wait for technology
to<00:02:45.300> get<00:02:45.420> cheaper<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.290> they<00:02:46.440> can<00:02:46.590> make<00:02:46.740> next-gen

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
to get cheaper so they can make next-gen

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.580 
to get cheaper so they can make next-gen
systems<00:02:47.850> feel<00:02:48.480> like<00:02:48.810> next<00:02:49.110> generation
