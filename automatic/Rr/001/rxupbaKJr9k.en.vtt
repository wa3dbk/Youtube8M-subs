00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
the team in the WWE so I think it's

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.970 
the team in the WWE so I think it's
inevitable<00:02:59.870> that<00:03:00.230> some<00:03:00.500> people<00:03:00.740> aren't<00:03:00.860> going

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
inevitable that some people aren't going

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.590 
inevitable that some people aren't going
to<00:03:01.040> make<00:03:01.160> it<00:03:01.220> unfortunately<00:03:01.610> some<00:03:02.180> people<00:03:02.450> are

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
to make it unfortunately some people are

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.760 
to make it unfortunately some people are
and<00:03:02.870> you<00:03:02.900> just<00:03:03.110> gotta<00:03:03.290> hope<00:03:03.440> that<00:03:03.500> your

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
and you just gotta hope that your

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.140 
and you just gotta hope that your
talents<00:03:04.130> are<00:03:04.190> good<00:03:04.310> enough<00:03:04.460> to<00:03:04.610> make<00:03:04.730> it<00:03:05.000> and

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
talents are good enough to make it and

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.700 
talents are good enough to make it and
fortunately<00:03:05.600> so<00:03:05.840> far<00:03:06.110> that's<00:03:06.260> been<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.560> case
