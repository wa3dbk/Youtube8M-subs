00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
would suit the character and we went to

people<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.079> said<00:00:58.199> ask<00:00:58.739> them<00:00:59.070> whether<00:00:59.250> they

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
people and said ask them whether they

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.099 
people and said ask them whether they
would<00:00:59.550> do<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.850> role<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.270> think<00:01:00.510> everyone

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
would do the role and I think everyone

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.280 
would do the role and I think everyone
here<00:01:01.940> loved<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.090> script<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.660> everyone<00:01:04.170> was

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
here loved the script and everyone was

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.820 
here loved the script and everyone was
happy<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.769> glad<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.369> do<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.549> but<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.270> think<00:01:06.830> we

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
happy and glad to do it but I think we

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.429 
happy and glad to do it but I think we
should<00:01:08.100> mention<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:09.360> man<00:01:09.600> had<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
should mention that this man had the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:28.000 
should mention that this man had the
idea<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.400> start<00:01:11.640> with<00:01:11.760> he<00:01:12.210> got<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.540> all<00:01:12.689> started

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.310 

I<00:01:29.010> think<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.700> Basie<00:01:29.910> magic<00:01:30.630> part<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.110> is

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
I think the Basie magic part of it is

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.400 
I think the Basie magic part of it is
the<00:01:31.710> fact<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.400> know<00:01:33.170> wonderfully<00:01:34.170> sheis

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
characters who brings about a lovely

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.480 
characters who brings about a lovely
change<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:38.960> way<00:01:39.960> things<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.470> way<00:01:40.920> things<00:01:41.220> go

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
change in way things to way things go

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.090 
change in way things to way things go
over<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.880> way<00:01:42.000> things<00:01:42.270> unfold<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.770> think

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
over the way things unfold and I think

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.770 
over the way things unfold and I think
what<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.580> idea<00:01:44.910> is<00:01:45.060> when<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.300> say<00:01:45.479> they<00:01:45.720> see

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
what the idea is when you say they see

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.870
