00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
a lot of dichroic glass elements yeah

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.250 
a lot of dichroic glass elements yeah
and<00:01:02.070> that's<00:01:02.670> what<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.809> that's<00:01:04.049> the

purpose of this video you ever had any
jewels<00:01:07.409> or<00:01:07.920> bevels<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.700> were<00:01:08.820> too<00:01:09.060> thick<00:01:09.420> for

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
jewels or bevels that were too thick for

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.800 
jewels or bevels that were too thick for
your<00:01:11.670> copper<00:01:12.030> foil<00:01:12.439> that<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.500> might<00:01:13.770> have

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
your copper foil that you might have

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.270 
your copper foil that you might have
3/16<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.140> going<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.380> work<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:16.920> bevel

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
3/16 is it going to work on this bevel

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.560 
3/16 is it going to work on this bevel
it's<00:01:17.400> not<00:01:17.549> even<00:01:17.729> going<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.939> cover<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.990> edge

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
it's not even going to cover this edge

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.510 
it's not even going to cover this edge
7/32<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.689> not<00:01:21.869> going<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.170> give<00:01:22.320> me<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.470> lip<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.340> go

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
7/32 is not going to give me a lip to go

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.640 
7/32 is not going to give me a lip to go
over<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.790> edge<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.270> even<00:01:24.869> quarter-inch<00:01:25.470> is

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
over the edge and even quarter-inch is

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.170 
over the edge and even quarter-inch is
not<00:01:25.830> going<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.159> be<00:01:26.250> enough<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.729> cover<00:01:26.939> this

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
not going to be enough to cover this

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.210 
not going to be enough to cover this
edge<00:01:27.420> because<00:01:28.229> once<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.619> coat<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.040> with

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
edge because once I coat this with

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.800 
edge because once I coat this with
dichroic<00:01:29.820> if<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.689> thickens<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.799> glass<00:01:32.810> so

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
dichroic if it thickens this glass so

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.660 
dichroic if it thickens this glass so
how<00:01:34.020> are<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.290> going<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.530> go<00:01:34.650> about<00:01:34.920> putting<00:01:35.579> a

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
how are you going to go about putting a

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.160 
how are you going to go about putting a
bevel<00:01:36.150> or<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.360> jewel<00:01:36.979> into<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.159> window<00:01:39.020> when<00:01:40.020> it's

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
bevel or a jewel into a window when it's

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.719 
bevel or a jewel into a window when it's
seemingly<00:01:40.530> thicker<00:01:40.890> than<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.220> others<00:01:41.490> and

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
seemingly thicker than the others and

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.609 
seemingly thicker than the others and
maybe<00:01:41.909> you're<00:01:42.259> frustrated<00:01:43.259> because<00:01:43.500> your

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
maybe you're frustrated because your

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.660 
maybe you're frustrated because your
copper<00:01:43.920> foil<00:01:44.100> won't<00:01:44.520> even<00:01:44.820> cover<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.390> piece

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
copper foil won't even cover the piece

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.899 
copper foil won't even cover the piece
cut<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> couple<00:01:47.939> ways<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.420> approaching<00:01:48.659> that

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
cut a couple ways of approaching that

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.760 
cut a couple ways of approaching that
one<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.090> them<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.869> way<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.079> copper<00:01:52.530> foil

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
one of them is the way you copper foil

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.460 
one of them is the way you copper foil
this<00:01:52.950> piece<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.750> when<00:01:54.750> if<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.930> have<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.110> piece

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
this piece and when if you have a piece

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.740 
this piece and when if you have a piece
of<00:01:55.500> glass<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.579> mean<00:01:56.939> there's<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.210> lot<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.540> glass

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
of glass I mean there's a lot of glass

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.969 
of glass I mean there's a lot of glass
out<00:01:57.990> there<00:01:58.200> that's<00:01:58.409> thicker<00:01:58.680> than

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
out there that's thicker than

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.010 
out there that's thicker than
quarter-inch<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.759> you'll<00:02:00.540> have<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.869> use<00:02:00.899> a

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
quarter-inch and you'll have to use a

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.209 
quarter-inch and you'll have to use a
ripple<00:02:01.530> bit<00:02:03.049> to<00:02:04.049> bring<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.350> down<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.189> a

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
ripple bit to bring it down this is a

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.510 
ripple bit to bring it down this is a
ripple<00:02:05.460> bit<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:06.750> bring<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.140> quarter-inch<00:02:07.560> piece

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520

one<00:02:17.709> way<00:02:17.860> of<00:02:17.890> doing<00:02:18.310> it

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
one way of doing it

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.790 
one way of doing it
yeah<00:02:19.569> don't<00:02:19.930> think<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.200> want<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.440> do<00:02:20.590> that

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
yeah don't think I want to do that

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.370 
yeah don't think I want to do that
although<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:21.819> might<00:02:22.090> test<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:22.660> just<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:23.110> see<00:02:23.260> how

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
although I might test it just to see how

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.010 
although I might test it just to see how
that<00:02:23.530> works<00:02:23.740> out<00:02:24.010> with<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:24.940> piece<00:02:25.209> of<00:02:25.240> dichroic

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
that works out with a piece of dichroic

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.949 
that works out with a piece of dichroic
Devils<00:02:26.440> that<00:02:26.650> I've<00:02:26.800> now<00:02:27.010> made<00:02:27.330> this<00:02:28.330> is<00:02:28.540> cyan

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
Devils that I've now made this is cyan

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.800 
Devils that I've now made this is cyan
red

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
red

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.770 
red
there's<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:32.050> cyan<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:34.360> there's<00:02:34.569> a<00:02:34.630> couple

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
there's the cyan so there's a couple

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.949 
there's the cyan so there's a couple
things<00:02:34.930> on<00:02:35.350> this<00:02:35.500> video<00:02:36.420> wish<00:02:37.420> I<00:02:37.660> know<00:02:37.810> I'm

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
you're going to use two pieces of foil

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.470 
you're going to use two pieces of foil
two<00:02:44.739> copper<00:02:45.070> foil<00:02:45.310> this<00:02:45.519> bevel<00:02:45.910> let's<00:02:46.239> see<00:02:46.420> if

see it up close the copper foil is flush

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.699 
see it up close the copper foil is flush
on<00:03:15.819> the<00:03:15.940> back<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.510> it<00:03:16.600> extends<00:03:17.380> over<00:03:17.680> the

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
front so I'm going to use my bevel the

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.920 
front so I'm going to use my bevel the
this<00:03:21.190> side<00:03:21.430> of<00:03:21.610> my<00:03:21.730> Devils<00:03:22.150> my<00:03:22.299> guide<00:03:22.540> that<00:03:22.810> I'm

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
going to run my copper foil right up to

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.800 
going to run my copper foil right up to
this<00:03:25.180> edge<00:03:25.480> right<00:03:26.400> up<00:03:27.400> to<00:03:27.549> that<00:03:27.579> edge<00:03:27.810> I'm

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
this edge right up to that edge I'm

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.170 
this edge right up to that edge I'm
trying<00:03:29.140> to<00:03:29.230> be<00:03:29.350> mindful<00:03:29.680> of<00:03:30.160> my<00:03:30.459> camera<00:03:31.000> lens

trying to be mindful of my camera lens
here<00:03:31.540> on<00:03:32.290> all<00:03:32.500> my<00:03:32.709> videos<00:03:32.890> I'm<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.549> only<00:03:33.670> one

here on all my videos I'm the only one

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.289 
here on all my videos I'm the only one
that<00:03:34.239> holds<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:34.810> camera<00:03:35.350> so<00:03:35.709> I<00:03:35.950> try<00:03:36.790> to<00:03:36.850> do<00:03:37.150> the

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
that holds the camera so I try to do the

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.830 
that holds the camera so I try to do the
best<00:03:37.480> that<00:03:37.600> I<00:03:37.720> can<00:03:37.780> so<00:03:38.820> I'm<00:03:39.820> copper<00:03:40.329> foiling<00:03:40.630> my

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
best that I can so I'm copper foiling my

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.090 
best that I can so I'm copper foiling my
piece<00:03:41.290> I'm<00:03:41.620> turning<00:03:42.070> it<00:03:42.190> with<00:03:42.340> my<00:03:42.489> left<00:03:43.420> hand

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
piece I'm turning it with my left hand

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.259 
piece I'm turning it with my left hand
holding<00:03:45.100> the<00:03:45.160> foil<00:03:45.579> with<00:03:46.090> my<00:03:46.299> right<00:03:48.030> trying<00:03:49.030> to

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
holding the foil with my right trying to

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.380 
holding the foil with my right trying to
do<00:03:49.450> this<00:03:49.660> in<00:03:49.810> such<00:03:50.079> a<00:03:50.109> way<00:03:51.030> it's<00:03:52.030> a<00:03:52.090> little

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
do this in such a way it's a little

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.360 
do this in such a way it's a little
unorthodox<00:03:52.660> for<00:03:53.470> me<00:03:55.829> holding<00:03:56.829> it<00:03:56.980> this<00:03:57.130> way

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
unorthodox for me holding it this way

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.420 
unorthodox for me holding it this way
but<00:03:57.640> I'm<00:03:57.760> recording<00:03:58.359> this<00:03:58.920> okay<00:03:59.920> now<00:04:00.130> I'm

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
but I'm recording this okay now I'm

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.449 
but I'm recording this okay now I'm
going<00:04:00.579> to<00:04:00.670> overlap<00:04:04.650> with<00:04:05.650> my<00:04:05.799> finger<00:04:06.280> you

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
going to overlap with my finger you

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.460 
going to overlap with my finger you
don't<00:04:07.000> want<00:04:07.180> to<00:04:07.299> put<00:04:07.720> your<00:04:07.870> finger<00:04:08.170> straight

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
don't want to put your finger straight

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.259 
don't want to put your finger straight
down<00:04:08.650> on<00:04:08.859> the<00:04:08.890> fall<00:04:09.190> because<00:04:09.459> this<00:04:09.700> foil<00:04:09.970> will

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
down on the fall because this foil will

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.569 
down on the fall because this foil will
cut<00:04:10.570> you<00:04:10.930> so<00:04:11.410> you<00:04:11.470> kind<00:04:11.829> of<00:04:11.890> want<00:04:12.100> to<00:04:12.190> do<00:04:12.549> a

cut you so you kind of want to do a
little<00:04:12.880> bevel<00:04:13.299> and<00:04:13.570> what<00:04:14.500> I've<00:04:14.620> got<00:04:14.890> here<00:04:15.720> is

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
little bevel and what I've got here is

this is a way of approaching that so now
on<00:05:37.960> this<00:05:38.140> side<00:05:38.380> it's<00:05:38.620> flat<00:05:38.860> this<00:05:39.310> new<00:05:39.700> piece<00:05:39.940> of

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
on this side it's flat this new piece of

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:49.950 
on this side it's flat this new piece of
foil<00:05:40.530> again<00:05:42.630> I'm<00:05:43.630> laying<00:05:43.990> down<00:05:44.110> my<00:05:46.200> foil<00:05:48.960> so

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
foil again I'm laying down my foil so

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.020 
foil again I'm laying down my foil so
check<00:05:50.290> it<00:05:50.440> out<00:05:52.500> I've<00:05:53.500> got<00:05:53.800> a<00:05:53.830> piece<00:05:54.190> I've<00:05:54.760> got<00:05:55.000> a

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
check it out I've got a piece I've got a

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.200 
check it out I've got a piece I've got a
bevel<00:05:55.560> that's<00:05:56.560> perfectly<00:05:57.160> filed<00:05:57.610> on<00:05:58.000> both

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
bevel that's perfectly filed on both

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.540 
bevel that's perfectly filed on both
sides<00:05:58.570> I've<00:05:59.050> accomplished<00:05:59.890> what<00:05:59.950> I<00:06:00.070> wanted<00:06:00.430> to

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
sides I've accomplished what I wanted to

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.700 
sides I've accomplished what I wanted to
do<00:06:00.730> with<00:06:01.390> two<00:06:01.630> pieces<00:06:02.110> of<00:06:02.260> foil<00:06:03.540> 7/32<00:06:04.540> I<00:06:04.720> know

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
do with two pieces of foil 7/32 I know

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.320 
do with two pieces of foil 7/32 I know
that<00:06:05.919> might<00:06:06.070> seem<00:06:06.310> kind<00:06:06.580> of<00:06:06.669> crazy<00:06:06.910> but<00:06:07.210> it

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
that might seem kind of crazy but it

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.530 
that might seem kind of crazy but it
might<00:06:07.480> save<00:06:07.780> your<00:06:07.990> butt<00:06:08.610> in<00:06:09.610> that<00:06:09.669> instance<00:06:10.360> as

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:10.540 
might save your butt in that instance as

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.850 
might save your butt in that instance as
it<00:06:10.900> does<00:06:11.080> here<00:06:11.700> now<00:06:12.700> let's<00:06:13.690> move<00:06:13.900> my<00:06:14.140> coil<00:06:14.710> out

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
it does here now let's move my coil out

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:22.260 
it does here now let's move my coil out
of<00:06:15.010> the<00:06:15.070> way<00:06:17.160> one<00:06:18.160> way<00:06:18.370> to<00:06:18.430> approach<00:06:18.730> this<00:06:21.000> if<00:06:22.000> I

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
of the way one way to approach this if I

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:27.800 
of the way one way to approach this if I
lay<00:06:22.660> this<00:06:22.930> bevel<00:06:23.470> in<00:06:23.680> that<00:06:24.100> hole

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.250 

let's<00:06:28.810> say<00:06:29.110> I<00:06:29.140> gotta<00:06:29.380> turn<00:06:29.680> this<00:06:31.020> to<00:06:32.020> where<00:06:32.140> it

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:32.260 
let's say I gotta turn this to where it

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.330 
let's say I gotta turn this to where it
fits

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
fits

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:40.530 
fits
I've<00:06:34.300> already<00:06:34.480> soldered<00:06:34.870> my<00:06:35.290> window<00:06:38.430> yeah<00:06:39.540> it

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.540 
I've already soldered my window yeah it

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.890 
I've already soldered my window yeah it
did<00:06:40.780> fit<00:06:42.120> I've<00:06:43.120> gotta<00:06:43.330> keep<00:06:43.570> turning<00:06:44.080> this

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
did fit I've gotta keep turning this

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.120 
did fit I've gotta keep turning this
some<00:06:46.900> there<00:06:47.530> we<00:06:47.650> go

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.130 
some there we go

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:45.040 
stick too high there's a natural way of

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.190 
stick too high there's a natural way of
approaching<00:07:45.550> this<00:07:45.970> that<00:07:46.600> won't<00:07:46.720> make<00:07:46.930> sense

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:47.200 
approaching this that won't make sense

approaching this that won't make sense
to<00:07:47.470> you<00:07:47.590> when<00:07:47.740> you<00:07:47.860> see<00:07:48.070> it<00:07:48.190> it's<00:07:48.640> really<00:07:48.790> easy
