00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:08.570
 good hello friends of the human system in 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.429
 this time we are going to talk about what 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.320
 are the devices these devices 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:16.970
 which are bar code readers 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.220
 one of the first questions that a 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.190
 sometimes worries the developers 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:26.289
 that are beginning 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:28.419
 how to connect on these devices 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.529
 because there are often very few 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:36.370
 information about how it works if 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:39.309
 is that we're going to do this video well in 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.909
 this case is a brand scanner is 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.620
 online is a scanner for usb in the 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:46.809
 most of the code scales of 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.640
 bars already come with this type of 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.640
 good connection 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.950
 it's not a special device really 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.480
 is 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:03.399
 an alternative to the keyboard 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.780
 the bar code standard 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.780
 properly it is a keyboard 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.920
 that all he's going to do is do and 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:17.200
 read data that is encoded in 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.630
 bar and will send them as if we 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.600
 we would have written them by pressing the 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.420
 keyboard keys in this sense not 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.689
 require no driver does not require 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.789
 of no special software works with 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.200
 standard drivers in most 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:36.200
 the operating systems 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.299
 and all he has is that the 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.289
 power coefficient feeding 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:44.990
 it must be enough in the usb port 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:47.780
 well to prove this we have here 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.630
 an android tablet in this case the 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.180
 issa brand 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.189
 we have the program that is the quick 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.899
 office well 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:02:00.280
 good how stable did this from a 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:03.390
 usb connector of the normal size so 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.390
 we are going to connect 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.060
 veron 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:14.770
 we see that it is activated 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:18.350
 to be able to use it 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.480
 we are going to need something that gives 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.489
 Thank you 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.040
 in this case we are going to use the code 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.040
 of bars with this is a book 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.560
 really what is in the 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.810
 sheep code that number that is there 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.610
 down this you see here that's 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.950
 what it is in this bar code 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.300
 is what is encoded here we are going to 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.300
 take our barcode reader 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.860
 do not 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.330
 this did not read and we will see that the number 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.360
 what's here 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.730
 it is exactly the same as it was written 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.040
 here 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.980
 let's do it a little bit more 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.550
 demonstrative 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.220
 subtract 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:11.170
 scanner 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.170
 the barcode is downloaded 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.740
 it's okay 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.570
 it's like a keyboard only there's no 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.780
 no need for any try or anything 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.460
 nothing like that then therefore 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.110
 works with any system with 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.840
 any program that you go to 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.250
 use there is no 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.959
 if we are developers there is no 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.090
 need to be no match 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.430
 special to work with the 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.870
 barcode scanner in this case 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.070
 we are talking to a table of 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.520
 android 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.709
 eye let's clarify this works with 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.320
 this tablet so much today does not mean that 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.500
 works with android phones we have 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.489
 done the test with using a 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.030
 adapter 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:06.580
 from what is usb to micro usb what 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.250
 we connect to two android phones in 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.400
 none of the cases worked then 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.930
 with adapters does not work then no 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.450
 we can connect an android phone 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:21.359
 if we can connect to tablet while 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.359
 you have to have standard usb connection 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:29.180
 2 than those that are tablets that only 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.840
 attract microusb connector can not be 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.270
 We will not be able to, we will not be able to 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.919
 connect a cry of code duties what 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.380
 we can with a blackberry phone 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.479
 in this case a z10 does not work either 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.419
 with the adapter then it has to be 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.860
 direct connection without adapter well for 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.840
 let it be clear that in this case 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.389
 works with any team in 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.580
 any system let's see it in this 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:56.120
 case on mac 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:05:01.569
 ok continuing with this question of 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.569
 the scales I'm going to connect it here to 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:08.740
 usb port of a mac computer 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.740
 yes 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:16.900
 and we have here a simple program what 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.150
 which is the text edit well 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.030
 in this case the first time that what 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.650
 we connect it detected it like a keyboard in 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.500
 this case we know a coding 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.300
 European does not matter the coding 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.740
 started it has no keys and we're going to 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.150
 show what exactly the same happens 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.150
 I'm going to scan a barcode 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:39.460
 but this 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.560
 this 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:08.270
 there it is there we have it as we see it is not 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.059
 requires no driver is not required 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.400
 no special software is not required 

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:18.199
 of any specific code that has to be 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:19.809
 give the device forgiveness when 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:23.029
 program that we are doing 

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:25.479
 it is one it is as if it were increased by 

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:25.479
 keyboard 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:30.080
 it will work well with any system 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.960
 that you do in any language 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:37.190
 of programming how does any 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:40.129
 keyboard well I hope this resolves 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:43.000
 some doubts of many 

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:44.830
 well here the last 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.340
 we are looking here for a 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.200
 keyboard 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:53.070
 usb scanner 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:58.320
 the scanners that is in ps2 connection in 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:07:00.810
 sometimes they require that there be a 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:04.020
 connected physical keyboard bring what is 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.550
 a connector and the scanner connected to the 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.460
 computer and the keyboard is going to go 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:12.930
 connected to the scanner properly in 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:15.330
 these cases is many of them require 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.970
 that is a physical keyboard connected to 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:20.040
 the scale if you have not connected the the 

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.810
 keyboard 

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.670
 s2 to the scanner because it simply does not 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.760
 it works that is a condition that they have 

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:28.590
 some but you're already only post and 

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.790
 they run into any of these old 

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:35.430
 scales and but most are already in usb 

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:38.100
 well I hope that it serves them that is of 

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:40.370
 utility and he declared some two this 

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.370
 video
