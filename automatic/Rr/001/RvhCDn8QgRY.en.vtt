00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.019
 and that where you kid you a new 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.730
 michael video good guys team 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.889
 I bring you other new minimums 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.139
 called we are going to be and so good is 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.820
 asks the modesty that in hell 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.529
 and good because this is going to be a gnome 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.930
 that a new mobile that will appear 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.730
 only in the lava vale or is it 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.289
 that there must be at least two blocks of height 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.109
 of lava 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.519
 so that you are not able to put or that is 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.829
 we can not find them in a 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.110
 Mine that has the drool that makes you 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.969
 you are going to have a little more danger in 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.350
 your mines and also a little bit of 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.420
 danger in hell not for these 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.460
 motorcycles we want here to dry well 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.399
 there as you can see the same now I 'm going 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.620
 to put out here to see how 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.989
 its texture and the other not the good the point 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.729
 boy is that when they walk at least 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.620
 in the real world or here is going to generate 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:54.210
 fire your way is going to generate this 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.120
 of your path what you step on and so on 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.960
 is going to die just touch the water by 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.790
 logic no 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.739
 and well let's hope that the 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.560
 fireballs because your attack is 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.270
 throw fireballs 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:10.060
 there it looks as it throws the ball of salt 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.530
 of magma leaves fire so good I'll 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.320
 to take one here the north gives us and you 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.780
 I'm going to take the move 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.210
 to kill it 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.340
 and it's going to give us a magma kring what 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.920
 here it has been burned thanks to the generated 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.740
 the same good power the point is that we 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.030
 is going to give a magna cream worth or like 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.270
 they want to call the light and kill him 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.950
 here dies besides is that it is difficult that 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.280
 you do not let them burn here it's worth it 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.409
 that we will have to do whatever 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.210
 do not burn or put water or something and 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.860
 it's about killing him so he can shake our hand 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.930
 macri but that's the point there are no good 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.100
 guys already this is the minimum simply 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.350
 adds a little more danger to the 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.149
 hell as is the lava and in the mines 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.399
 when obviously obviously the mines 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.250
 as it isolated some parts because they are from 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.710
 lava as you can can is to join 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.659
 this way is worth it from its pretty this 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.479
 It is his only attack on the trees of 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.429
 mom cold and if guys I hope you have 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.810
 liked them well give you like comment and 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:06.810
 subscribe and see you next time
