00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
to so as you can see we've started off

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.920 
to so as you can see we've started off
with<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:11.040> head<00:01:11.700> at<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.970> top<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.330> page<00:01:12.540> our

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
with a head at the top of the page our

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.800 
with a head at the top of the page our
main<00:01:13.350> section<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.100> middle<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.570> then<00:01:15.570> our

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
main section in the middle and then our

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.550 
main section in the middle and then our
footer<00:01:16.080> at<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.009> bottom<00:01:17.159> over<00:01:17.700> here<00:01:17.930> so<00:01:18.930> that's

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
footer at the bottom over here so that's

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.350 
footer at the bottom over here so that's
basically<00:01:20.220> what<00:01:20.400> our<00:01:20.520> page<00:01:20.670> looks<00:01:20.970> like<00:01:21.150> now

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
basically what our page looks like now

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.050 
basically what our page looks like now
and<00:01:21.619> what<00:01:22.619> we<00:01:22.770> can<00:01:22.920> do<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.460> go<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.610> our<00:01:23.850> CSS

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
and what we can do is just go to our CSS

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.950 
and what we can do is just go to our CSS
and<00:01:24.890> we<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:26.070> use<00:01:26.310> relative<00:01:26.970> positioning<00:01:27.659> to

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
and we can use relative positioning to

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.990 
and we can use relative positioning to
change<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.829> little<00:01:29.220> bit<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.490> positioning

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
change a little bit of the positioning

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.020 
change a little bit of the positioning
on<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.450> web<00:01:30.600> page<00:01:30.780> let's<00:01:31.229> just<00:01:31.409> go<00:01:31.560> ahead<00:01:31.650> and

on the web page let's just go ahead and
position<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.540> our<00:01:33.930> main<00:01:34.710> section<00:01:35.340> we'll<00:01:35.939> go

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
position the our main section we'll go

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.179 
position the our main section we'll go
ahead<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.450> position<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:37.549> relative<00:01:38.549> and

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
ahead and position that relative and

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.160 
ahead and position that relative and
what<00:01:41.189> we<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.460> do<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.759> go<00:01:41.909> up<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.150> position<00:01:42.960> from

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
what we can do is go up is position from

what we can do is go up is position from
the<00:01:43.320> top<00:01:43.460> can<00:01:44.460> be<00:01:44.490> 400<00:01:45.030> pixels<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.979> position

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.399 
can see this is very different to what
happened<00:02:02.939> in<00:02:03.119> our<00:02:03.270> previous<00:02:03.689> tutorials

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
happened in our previous tutorials

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.069 
happened in our previous tutorials
whenever<00:02:04.740> we<00:02:04.950> positioned<00:02:05.490> an<00:02:06.180> element<00:02:06.659> okay

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
whenever we positioned an element okay

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.880 
whenever we positioned an element okay
so<00:02:08.069> as<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.369> can<00:02:08.610> see<00:02:08.670> our<00:02:09.420> footer<00:02:09.890> didn't

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
so as you can see our footer didn't

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.730 
so as you can see our footer didn't
actually<00:02:11.099> shoot<00:02:11.520> up<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.870> fill<00:02:12.870> up<00:02:13.020> this<00:02:13.230> empty

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
actually shoot up to fill up this empty

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.560 
actually shoot up to fill up this empty
space<00:02:14.030> that<00:02:15.030> has<00:02:15.840> been<00:02:16.200> left<00:02:16.410> by<00:02:16.800> our<00:02:17.570> article

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
space that has been left by our article

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.630 
space that has been left by our article
okay<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.580> reason<00:02:20.940> for<00:02:20.970> that<00:02:21.330> is<00:02:21.660> because

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
okay and the reason for that is because

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.820 
okay and the reason for that is because
the<00:02:23.640> browser<00:02:23.940> store<00:02:24.540> actually<00:02:25.110> drew<00:02:25.470> our

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
the browser store actually drew our

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.480 
the browser store actually drew our
article<00:02:26.490> in<00:02:26.730> this<00:02:27.120> space<00:02:27.810> or<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:29.010> don't<00:02:29.250> wanna

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
article in this space or I don't wanna

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.220 
article in this space or I don't wanna
say<00:02:29.640> drew<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.150> actually<00:02:30.480> rendered<00:02:31.020> our

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
say drew it actually rendered our

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.760 
say drew it actually rendered our
article<00:02:31.940> in<00:02:32.940> this<00:02:33.270> space<00:02:33.570> our<00:02:33.930> main<00:02:34.230> section

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
article in this space our main section

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.610 
article in this space our main section
and<00:02:34.980> then<00:02:35.700> only<00:02:35.910> after<00:02:36.240> rendering<00:02:37.110> our<00:02:37.320> main

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
and then only after rendering our main

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.580 
and then only after rendering our main
section<00:02:38.190> in<00:02:38.370> this<00:02:38.580> space<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:39.570> decided<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.350> move

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
section in this space it decided to move

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.740 
section in this space it decided to move
our<00:02:41.150> article<00:02:42.290> 400<00:02:43.290> pixels<00:02:43.680> down<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.750> 100

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
our article 400 pixels down and 100

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.300 
our article 400 pixels down and 100
pixels<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:46.890> left<00:02:47.010> okay<00:02:47.760> so<00:02:49.010> that's<00:02:50.010> why

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
pixels to the left okay so that's why

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.160 
pixels to the left okay so that's why
there<00:02:50.610> is<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:50.880> big<00:02:51.120> open<00:02:51.600> space<00:02:51.900> in<00:02:52.140> the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
there is this big open space in the

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.240 
there is this big open space in the
middle<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.850> if<00:02:53.850> that's<00:02:54.240> different<00:02:54.660> to

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
middle and if that's different to

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.500 
middle and if that's different to
absolute<00:02:56.250> positioning<00:02:56.730> because<00:02:57.030> absolute

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
absolute positioning because absolute

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.080 
absolute positioning because absolute
positioning<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.220> footer<00:02:59.430> actually<00:02:59.850> shot

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
positioning the the footer actually shot

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.660 
positioning the the footer actually shot
up<00:03:00.240> and<00:03:00.450> then<00:03:00.870> took<00:03:01.320> a<00:03:01.380> took<00:03:02.070> up<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.460> space

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
up and then took a took up the space

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.440 
up and then took a took up the space
that<00:03:02.850> was<00:03:03.000> left<00:03:03.240> behind<00:03:04.100> and<00:03:05.100> then<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.090> next

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
that was left behind and then the next

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.240 
that was left behind and then the next
thing<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:06.990> want<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.170> tell<00:03:07.320> you<00:03:07.470> guys<00:03:07.650> about<00:03:07.920> is

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
thing I want to tell you guys about is

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.560 
thing I want to tell you guys about is
that<00:03:08.580> our<00:03:08.930> article<00:03:09.930> isn't<00:03:10.290> actually<00:03:10.830> position

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
that our article isn't actually position

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.530 
that our article isn't actually position
800<00:03:12.570> pixels<00:03:13.080> from<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.800> top<00:03:14.160> left<00:03:14.820> corner<00:03:15.210> of

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
800 pixels from the top left corner of

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.380 
800 pixels from the top left corner of
our<00:03:15.870> browser<00:03:16.200> or<00:03:16.620> our<00:03:16.920> window<00:03:17.250> it's<00:03:17.820> actually

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
our browser or our window it's actually

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.380 
our browser or our window it's actually
positioned<00:03:19.070> 800<00:03:20.070> pixels<00:03:20.490> down<00:03:20.670> from<00:03:21.240> its

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
positioned 800 pixels down from its

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.460 
positioned 800 pixels down from its
original<00:03:21.510> position

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
original position

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.950 
original position
so<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:22.800> is<00:03:22.950> 800<00:03:23.370> pixels<00:03:23.400> down<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:24.060> then<00:03:24.720> a

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
so that is 800 pixels down and then a

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.320 
so that is 800 pixels down and then a
hundred<00:03:25.500> pixels<00:03:25.740> left<00:03:26.460> to<00:03:27.090> its<00:03:27.210> original

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
hundred pixels left to its original

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.560 
hundred pixels left to its original
position<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.370> I<00:03:29.370> can<00:03:29.640> demonstrate<00:03:29.820> this<00:03:30.210> a

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
position and I can demonstrate this a

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.430 
position and I can demonstrate this a
little<00:03:30.810> bit<00:03:31.020> better<00:03:31.610> by<00:03:32.610> going<00:03:33.480> over<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:34.290> our

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
little bit better by going over to our

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.830 
little bit better by going over to our
CSS<00:03:34.710> and<00:03:35.310> instead<00:03:35.910> of<00:03:36.030> using<00:03:36.330> such<00:03:36.540> big

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
CSS and instead of using such big

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.360 
CSS and instead of using such big
measurements<00:03:37.440> over<00:03:37.560> here<00:03:37.800> we<00:03:37.920> can<00:03:38.070> just<00:03:38.100> go

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
measurements over here we can just go

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.210 
measurements over here we can just go
ahead<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.610> say<00:03:39.140> position<00:03:40.140> at<00:03:40.260> 10<00:03:40.500> pixels<00:03:40.950> left

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
ahead and say position at 10 pixels left

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.140 
ahead and say position at 10 pixels left
and<00:03:42.740> yeah<00:03:43.740> we<00:03:43.980> can<00:03:44.010> go<00:03:44.250> ahead<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.520> say<00:03:44.700> 5

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
and yeah we can go ahead and say 5

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.750 
and yeah we can go ahead and say 5
pixels<00:03:45.660> down<00:03:46.340> okay<00:03:47.540> so<00:03:48.540> go<00:03:49.440> back<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.890> Firefox

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
pixels down okay so go back to Firefox

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.510 
pixels down okay so go back to Firefox
and<00:03:51.030> then<00:03:51.300> click<00:03:51.630> refresh<00:03:51.960> and<00:03:52.410> as<00:03:53.190> you<00:03:53.370> can

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
and then click refresh and as you can

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.740 
and then click refresh and as you can
see<00:03:54.470> we're<00:03:55.470> now<00:03:55.710> actually<00:03:56.130> just<00:03:56.730> 5<00:03:57.240> pixels

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
see we're now actually just 5 pixels

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.650 
see we're now actually just 5 pixels
down<00:03:58.080> from<00:03:58.650> where<00:03:58.890> our<00:03:59.130> main<00:03:59.670> section<00:04:00.270> would

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
down from where our main section would

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.230 
down from where our main section would
have<00:04:00.780> originally<00:04:01.050> been<00:04:01.530> and<00:04:01.740> 10<00:04:02.730> pixels

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
have originally been and 10 pixels

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.840 
have originally been and 10 pixels
across<00:04:03.570> from<00:04:04.230> when<00:04:04.410> our<00:04:04.530> main<00:04:04.770> section<00:04:05.280> would

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
across from when our main section would

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.190 
across from when our main section would
have<00:04:06.210> originally<00:04:06.690> been<00:04:07.370> okay<00:04:08.370> so<00:04:09.270> that's<00:04:09.870> what

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
have originally been okay so that's what

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.440 
have originally been okay so that's what
relative<00:04:10.770> positioning<00:04:11.430> actually<00:04:11.970> does<00:04:12.150> on

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
relative positioning actually does on

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.160 
relative positioning actually does on
your<00:04:12.570> web<00:04:12.750> page<00:04:12.990> and<00:04:13.290> we<00:04:13.620> can<00:04:13.800> compare<00:04:14.220> this<00:04:14.459> to

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
your web page and we can compare this to

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.900 
your web page and we can compare this to
absolute<00:04:16.170> positioning<00:04:16.739> if<00:04:16.920> I<00:04:17.130> just<00:04:17.370> go<00:04:17.549> over

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
absolute positioning if I just go over

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.449 
absolute positioning if I just go over
to<00:04:18.299> my<00:04:18.480> style<00:04:18.750> sheets<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.200> will<00:04:19.709> position<00:04:20.100> our

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
to my style sheets and will position our

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.010 
to my style sheets and will position our
footer<00:04:20.900> absolutely<00:04:22.250> okay<00:04:23.250> so<00:04:24.060> let's<00:04:24.690> go<00:04:24.930> ahead

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
footer absolutely okay so let's go ahead

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.920 
footer absolutely okay so let's go ahead
and

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
and

okay<00:05:04.660> awesome<00:05:05.199> so<00:05:05.440> it's<00:05:05.560> five<00:05:05.830> pixels<00:05:06.370> from

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
okay awesome so it's five pixels from

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.870 
okay awesome so it's five pixels from
the<00:05:06.669> top<00:05:06.970> and<00:05:07.150> 10<00:05:07.990> pixels<00:05:08.289> from<00:05:09.070> the<00:05:09.190> left<00:05:09.639> of

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
the top and 10 pixels from the left of

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.659 
the top and 10 pixels from the left of
the<00:05:10.570> top<00:05:10.810> corner<00:05:11.410> of<00:05:11.560> our<00:05:11.949> browser<00:05:12.220> and<00:05:12.580> that

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
the top corner of our browser and that

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.120 
the top corner of our browser and that
is<00:05:13.570> what<00:05:13.720> absolute<00:05:14.289> positioning<00:05:14.889> does

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
is what absolute positioning does

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.550 
is what absolute positioning does
compared<00:05:15.910> to<00:05:16.150> relative<00:05:16.780> positioning<00:05:17.380> which

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
compared to relative positioning which

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.580 
compared to relative positioning which
is<00:05:17.740> now<00:05:17.979> five<00:05:18.789> pixels<00:05:19.300> from<00:05:19.539> its<00:05:19.780> original

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
is now five pixels from its original

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.450 
is now five pixels from its original
position<00:05:21.310> in<00:05:21.669> the<00:05:21.729> document<00:05:22.300> flow<00:05:22.740> and<00:05:23.740> five

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
position in the document flow and five

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.189 
position in the document flow and five
pixels<00:05:24.759> down<00:05:25.000> and<00:05:25.270> ten<00:05:25.599> pixels<00:05:25.900> to<00:05:26.080> the<00:05:26.110> left

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 
pixels down and ten pixels to the left

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:28.920 
pixels down and ten pixels to the left
of<00:05:26.500> its<00:05:26.650> original<00:05:27.550> position<00:05:27.820> in<00:05:28.270> the<00:05:28.479> document

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
of its original position in the document

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.129 
of its original position in the document
flow<00:05:29.020> so<00:05:29.830> that's<00:05:30.370> pretty<00:05:30.610> much<00:05:30.699> what<00:05:31.210> absolute

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
flow so that's pretty much what absolute

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:34.529 
flow so that's pretty much what absolute
positioning<00:05:33.010> and<00:05:33.280> relative<00:05:33.970> positioning

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
positioning and relative positioning

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:36.170 
positioning and relative positioning
does<00:05:34.780> and<00:05:35.050> what's<00:05:35.289> the<00:05:35.530> difference<00:05:35.860> between

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
does and what's the difference between

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.120 
does and what's the difference between
both<00:05:37.180> of<00:05:37.389> them<00:05:37.539> so<00:05:38.260> thank<00:05:38.860> you<00:05:38.949> guys<00:05:38.979> for
