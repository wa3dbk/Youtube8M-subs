00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.810
 as dawn approaches 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.230
 the building next door is becoming increasingly cool 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.060
 the small jetty 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.400
 the only thing you hear is a single busting on the shore of the beach 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.840
 while in the sky it seems like it's a party because the sky lights up 

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:36.260
 with three stars 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.690
 the dim light of the moon shows a couple of silhouettes in the distance 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.980
 It's three in the morning with 37 minutes 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.640
 when you start listening to the first good morning at the pier 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.690
 arrive mounted on tricycles where they load the engines of the bands 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.370
 they are people with plastic guaraches 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.520
 with gathered trousers and skin made up by the sun are men 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.120
 Women and children 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.170
 husbands are wives and figs are people of the sea 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.210
 who is not afraid of him 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.400
 but that shows you a deep respect they are Attic fishermen 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.530
 manager and 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.530
 about thirty-five fishermen start pushing the pangas in which 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.210
 they sail daily 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.470
 as if they were one family 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.280
 each other and help 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.980
 you have to lower the bread to deposit it in the sea 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.550
 you have to unload the engines of the tricycles 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.770
 you have to mount them in the panga and finally you have to look at the sky and 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.740
 ask for a good fishing 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.870
 from the oldest to the youngest 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.870
 They know perfectly what they have to do 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.860
 three minutes to four in the morning 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.960
 'the time to leave' that she 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.729
 the silence of the early morning is interrupted by the noise of the engines 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.270
 good luck for all of us see you in a while 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.120
 luck 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.800
 God bless you 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.800
 one by one they leave the jetty 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.120
 little by little they disappear into the blackness of the immense sea 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.800
 which has become for many of them his lifelong companion 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.659
 This is the case of Jesus 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:16.500
 who from the age of five tries on these fragile pangas 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:18.149
 at present 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:19.769
 at 18 years old 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.680
 I have already pointed out among your peers as a fisherman of experiences 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:26.879
 In a couple of minutes 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.480
 Jesus and his cousin Augustine are already on the sea in search of 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.889
 best place where sulkin bulls will go down 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.439
 as if they did not want to wake the sea 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.439
 they introduce their networks into the water slowly 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.170
 immediately they make signals with a great respect of their companions indicating them 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.170
 that place is already occupied 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:52.529
 the first fifth rocker lists the second one also 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:56.029
 the same happens with the third 4th and 5th 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.599
 it only remains to wait for the first rays of the sun to appear 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.810
 meanwhile it's time to have a good cup of coffee to warm the 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.129
 posts which are a static titiritando method 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:15.189
 At six in the morning, the first rays of the sun appear 

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:20.229
 the time to review the networks and effective practice ended with a see you later 

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:24.149
 in the first quincho rhon there is almost nothing 

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:27.480
 just a couple of mixed kiwifruit and smaller 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.699
 but nevertheless 

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:32.469
 almost at the end of lifting the network appears the first constant 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.879
 As the minutes pass 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:41.620
 the nets reveal various species of fish rinaldi and be constantino while a 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.620
 delimit and so on 

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:48.589
 the sun brings with it also pays as 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:01.449
 the time to return arrives 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:05.629
 the clock shows and at nine o'clock in the morning with 17 minutes 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.669
 the last hammock is raised 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:12.400
 from the band you can see the pier where they are already 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.400
 Dozens of people waiting for the sale of fish 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.359
 fishing has been regular 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.239
 according to Jesus 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.239
 5 the help of his companions to his gang of thieves 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.840
 the jetty becomes a mobile market 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.819
 This is the end of Jesus' day of work 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:36.139
 work that is repeated seven days a week 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.629
 even with fog or rain 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:41.639
 people with plastic guaraches 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.089
 with pants picked up and the faithful makeup by the sun 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:46.930
 Seafarers 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:47.999
 do not fear them 

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:50.999
 but that shows you a deep respect 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.469
 a fisherman 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:54.409
 kaman and nayarit
