00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.580
 hello today we will tell you 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.220
 about me something sequoia metasequoia it 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.100
 distant relative of the giant sequoia 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.209
 which grows in north america 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.180
 interesting story of this 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.980
 the plants first described it by 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.750
 fossil remains and then to china 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.730
 found a small grove of this plant 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.730
 the seeds of which have already spread throughout 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.110
 the world now grow it willingly in 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.690
 cultural environment so to speak 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.699
 amateur gardeners landscape designers 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.010
 Odessa is to have something to love this tree 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.230
 well in nature, it grows enough 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.440
 large up to 40 meters high 2 with full 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.700
 meter trunk girth with him in diameter 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.440
 a huge plant of course you have 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.790
 most likely not grow our conditions 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.550
 but nevertheless he has a beautiful 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.460
 conical classic shape look 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.379
 What needles very beautiful needles very 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.700
 soft 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.420
 so long from one to three 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.809
 centimeters 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.360
 soft extremely this deciduous 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.879
 conifer plant here these needles fall off 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.430
 in the month of November and in May appear 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.490
 new at first not so fresh green 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.200
 colors very gentle summer end summer 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.600
 it is already beginning to turn pink 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.390
 become crimson so autumn 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.220
 brown before falling tree changes 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.290
 your color and your look throughout 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.110
 Season principle Metasequoia is very 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.790
 undemanding they are heat resistant 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.369
 frost resistant to -30 degrees endure 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.740
 wind resistant all have this tree 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.150
 well even the soil is basically possible and 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.840
 probably grow well of course better 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.689
 responds to good good 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.700
 one land ratio we will not 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:41.810
 talk to ken about like two 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.789
 manure parts two parts peat two parts 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.890
 humus one part of the sand but you can 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.750
 vary than richer of course 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.240
 the soil the faster the tree will be 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.979
 grow a tree grows big even in 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.469
 our conditions are therefore natural 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.020
 it is recommended to plant it on some 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:59.359
 large spaces near the big 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.959
 at home they are connection some kind of clearing edge 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:04.520
 looks great near the reservoirs 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:06.500
 special late summer when foliage 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.849
 becomes a contract if you pull it off 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.349
 still metallic green 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:11.720
 plants will be just great 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.430
 look another important condition for 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.579
 successful cultivation of metasequoia 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.349
 are sunny places and good 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:20.569
 moisturizing here if you will 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.549
 Metasequoia water often enough then 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.190
 it will grow well when planted 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:29.120
 Metasequoia dug a hole but how 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.590
 minimum depth of 80 centimeters to 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.610
 Metasequoia is very important not to damage 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.650
 earth bed 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.780
 the fact is that mycorrhiza which lives on 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.709
 its roots is a microorganism 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.540
 which helps 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.180
 absorb water nutrients 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.859
 the roots under the main thing it does not hurt 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.139
 bare seedling with bare root 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:47.299
 system chances to settle down as a rule 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:49.970
 minimum so if you buy 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.650
 here in the garden centers metasequoia in 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.440
 container culture in containers 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.780
 try to gently pull the planted 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.780
 without damaging the earth com 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.069
 by the way metasequoia is very good 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.290
 perceives urban conditions 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.180
 car exhaust that's in his 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.090
 land in China landed even 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.040
 along the highway busiest highway 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.630
 on which a lot of cars goes that is 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.400
 exhaust for her does not matter 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.319
 hanging on gorgeous unpretentious 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.150
 a plant that more and more often 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.910
 appear on our sites by the way 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.109
 say such an interesting object 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.970
 really don't see him often 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.440
 museum such an exhibit because 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.430
 really plants one of the most 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.430
 the oldest on earth
