 hello how about cutout friends of us 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.420
 we meet with juan carlos medina 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.719
 USA midfielder on a date 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.700
 especially since not every day 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.769
 they are 10 years old in the first division 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.520
 it seems that it was yesterday as you take it juan 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.520
 carlos good first of all a taste 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.320
 be able to serve them and greet them and good 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.320
 how do I take it in the best way 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:31.010
 enjoying I think they come to me in a very 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.960
 good time for the way it is 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.360
 playing the team the results that are 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.470
 they are giving us then enjoying 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.470
 enjoying these 10 years 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:47.519
 for him at times giving him a refreshed 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.109
 everything that one has gone through to everything 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.820
 I have lived in these ten years and 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:54.609
 well above all, thank you 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.010
 God for letting me be these ten 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:58.809
 years in the first division that is not easy 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.510
 and in the fields of coapa what 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.640
 we exemplify with number one and 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.490
 number zero has already passed until the two 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.080
 digits I think this was nostalgia 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.440
 but at the same time it also gives you a lot 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.659
 motivation a lot motivation not so much 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.240
 nostalgia I believe how handsome you learn 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.369
 one of all this time and good the 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.200
 true that fulfilling these ten years gives me 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.780
 much motivation and commits me more to 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.690
 keep working and ask God to 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.610
 give me a lot of health to be able 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.560
 to fulfill many more years the truth I want 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.360
 keep enjoying want to continue 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.700
 giving me what I love is 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.200
 what I want and good today as I say 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.090
 especially thank God for 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.580
 these first 10 years and enjoy them 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.220
 The best way 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.750
 came monterrey came the america a 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.640
 first stage I think is also something 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.920
 very important that maybe they did not happen 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.240
 things in for what you want 'in 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.120
 the first stage but in this second 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.460
 you had the revenge and what better than 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.680
 be an artifice of the title yes yes yes 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.240
 there were several moments the first 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.250
 Once I had to come here, we did not know 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.230
 gave the results and in a 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.810
 institution like this can not be given 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.700
 the luxury of having a bad tournament that is 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.399
 that this time I had to live it after I go 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.980
 Monterrey there, it was good for me. 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.620
 it was pretty good but I did not have to have 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.720
 the continuity that I wanted 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.290
 next comes San Luis where he recovered the 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.290
 continuity 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.880
 we did two good tournaments I had to be 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.370
 One year I did two good tournaments in 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.020
 one we qualify in another we stay 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.050
 the shore by a point we do not qualify 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.390
 but I think they were good for 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.240
 what the team aspired at that time 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.220
 and well I have to come back here, when 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.100
 returned the ball once the first tournament 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.280
 I did not do well for some injuries 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:48.380
 and because I could never put myself in good 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:52.190
 in the physical and good then comes 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:55.940
 the opportunity that so much was 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.740
 waiting for arrives to miguel miguel returns to 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.270
 trust me and give me the opportunity and 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.540
 Well, I have to live all that up 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.160
 Now I have to live, I think it was 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.020
 what I expected to get my thorn 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.760
 in this way and as I tell you very 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.520
 grateful to God and enjoying the 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.770
 best way last ten years in the 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.570
 mind of all and in yours of course 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.340
 I would also celebrate it with a 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.680
 bicampeonato not something that is not achieved in 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.280
 the club for 25 years would be 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.780
 would be great would be perfect to be able 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.120
 close them that way but for that 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.340
 it is quite ahead I think that 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.770
 we are reaching almost half of the 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.560
 tournament is much ahead and we have 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.600
 to go step by step hopefully and it would be what 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.950
 better for everyone to be able to get it but 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.360
 being aware that we have to 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.550
 work very hard and not lower the 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.470
 arms do not trust us to achieve that that 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.570
 goal that we want the friends of 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.700
 record we said goodbye to Juan Carlos 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.070
 medina thanking you for the time and 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.900
 also with the intention I think that 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.490
 must send a message, not especially 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.040
 to your family to be with you all 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.829
 these 10 years not only thank you 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.069
 thank you very much for the good ones 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:03.319
 moments also do not believe you are are 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.599
 part also of maturity but about 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:09.319
 all the unconditional support that always 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:13.730
 they have about me my wife my 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:15.739
 daughters my dads my brothers 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.870
 and some friends that also always 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:22.479
 they are always supporting me and giving me 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.760
 well, that little push for no 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.780
 moment either good or bad throw the 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.340
 towel 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.410
 then thank you all but about 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.000
 all thank God I think that at 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.070
 who else I have to thank is him 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.090
 for giving me health reasons to be able 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.800
 reach these years and be able to be of 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.110
 way in which I am then thank you 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.690
 thank you all and good thanks too 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.790

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.130
 moment supports us and that is with 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.000
 thank you very much Juan Carlos
