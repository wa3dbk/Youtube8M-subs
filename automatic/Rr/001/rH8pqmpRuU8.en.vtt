00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello to all I find you in 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.690
 this video to show you how 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.940
 to make cupcake base without mold 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.380
 so this video is mostly for 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.780
 people who do not have molds to 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.450
 cupcakes like beginners 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.930
 there is very little material to take 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.640
 so it's just a tooth cure and the 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.920
 fimo paste of the color of your choice 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.410
 so I took a mixture of chocolate and 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.269
 of caramel so that's everyone can 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.650
 to get there it's really very easy to 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.679
 make 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.960
 so here are some models and it's gone 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.870
 to show you how to make a base 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.520
 cupcake 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.140
 we will start by taking a ball of 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.730
 filming dough of your choice and we're going 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.780
 make a code by pressing lightly 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.780
 on the one hand 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:59.130
 here we are going to put the bang in the direction 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:07.320
 vertical from bigger to finer the 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:12.210
 side now we will not support too much 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:17.430
 strong either that's how it will be so 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.960
 there already we at the base of the cupcake and then 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.460
 now we have more to do 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:28.320
 small wrinkles with the toothpick 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:30.420
 we will put them upside down here is the 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.080
 bigger opus one side then now 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:39.450
 we will take our toothpick and we will 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:44.160
 press the side like these and then 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.860
 so that's what gives this so it gives 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.170
 this for now and then we're going 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.649
 continue all around the base of 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.649
 cupcake 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.680
 so that's the cupcake base is 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.250
 finished so I hope this little 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.990
 trick you will have pleased to do the basics 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.740
 cupcake for those who do not have 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.740
 cupcake molds
