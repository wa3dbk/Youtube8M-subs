00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
a great controversy going on in terms of

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.620 
a great controversy going on in terms of
what<00:04:15.370> we<00:04:15.519> should<00:04:15.790> eat<00:04:15.819> because<00:04:16.389> a<00:04:16.419> lot<00:04:16.600> of

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
what we should eat because a lot of

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.029 
what we should eat because a lot of
people<00:04:16.870> are<00:04:16.959> saying<00:04:17.049> we<00:04:17.199> have<00:04:17.350> to<00:04:17.440> eat<00:04:17.560> more

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
locally grown foods we have to eat foods

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.110 
locally grown foods we have to eat foods
which<00:04:20.709> are<00:04:20.829> organically<00:04:21.340> grown<00:04:21.669> and<00:04:21.910> then<00:04:22.000> of

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
which are organically grown and then of

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.400 
which are organically grown and then of
course<00:04:22.150> this<00:04:22.479> becomes<00:04:22.810> a<00:04:22.900> class<00:04:23.169> issue

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
course this becomes a class issue

the<00:04:32.139> spring<00:04:32.410> particularly<00:04:32.770> meat<00:04:33.070> because

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
the spring particularly meat because

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:35.340 
the spring particularly meat because
over<00:04:34.000> last<00:04:34.210> summer<00:04:34.509> there<00:04:34.750> is<00:04:34.870> there<00:04:35.080> is<00:04:35.169> less

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
production of meat due to the higher

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.689 
production of meat due to the higher

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
into the spring we're going to see

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.350 
into the spring we're going to see
higher<00:04:48.009> prices<00:04:48.430> on<00:04:48.550> meat<00:04:48.729> if<00:04:48.970> you<00:04:49.060> can<00:04:49.180> pull

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
higher prices on meat if you can pull

higher prices on meat if you can pull
away<00:04:49.479> from<00:04:49.740> meats<00:04:50.740> are<00:04:51.280> there<00:04:51.759> other<00:04:51.940> foods<00:04:52.210> we

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
away from meats are there other foods we

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.200 
away from meats are there other foods we
typically<00:04:52.720> go<00:04:53.020> towards<00:04:53.940> well<00:04:54.940> well

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
typically go towards well well

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.999 
typically go towards well well
absolutely<00:04:55.360> I<00:04:55.990> mean<00:04:56.020> you<00:04:56.289> don't<00:04:56.530> eat<00:04:56.650> me<00:04:56.830> what

you<00:04:57.130> end<00:04:57.280> up<00:04:57.370> doing<00:04:57.430> is<00:04:57.789> eating<00:04:58.270> more<00:04:58.750> grains

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
you end up doing is eating more grains

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:00.900 
you end up doing is eating more grains
and<00:04:59.560> more<00:04:59.860> vegetables<00:05:00.310> in<00:05:00.400> your<00:05:00.430> diet<00:05:00.520> but<00:05:00.789> of

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
course in America what also happens is

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.050 
course in America what also happens is
because<00:05:02.889> we<00:05:03.130> have<00:05:03.220> so<00:05:03.340> many<00:05:03.430> processed<00:05:04.060> foods

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
because we have so many processed foods

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.150 
because we have so many processed foods
we<00:05:04.630> have<00:05:04.720> so<00:05:04.840> much<00:05:04.960> of<00:05:05.020> our<00:05:05.199> food<00:05:05.410> industry<00:05:05.949> is

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
we have so much of our food industry is
