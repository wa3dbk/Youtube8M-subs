00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.650 
over the last four years so this seems
like<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.649> logical<00:00:58.890> next<00:00:59.760> step<00:00:59.910> it's<00:01:00.359> an

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
like a logical next step it's an

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.910 
for the community
well<00:02:01.820> of<00:02:01.880> course<00:02:01.940> we're<00:02:02.270> really<00:02:02.590> engaged<00:02:03.590> now

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
well of course we're really engaged now

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.490 
well of course we're really engaged now
as<00:02:04.100> a<00:02:04.130> community<00:02:04.580> in<00:02:05.200> working<00:02:06.200> with<00:02:06.230> the

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
as a community in working with the

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.580 
as a community in working with the
president's<00:02:06.980> role<00:02:07.070> with<00:02:07.280> integrity<00:02:07.550> document

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
president's role with integrity document

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.760 
president's role with integrity document
that's<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.830> really<00:02:10.610> critical<00:02:11.150> piece<00:02:11.930> in<00:02:12.230> in

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
that's a really critical piece in in

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.260 
that's a really critical piece in in
thinking<00:02:13.100> about<00:02:13.190> how<00:02:13.400> McMaster<00:02:13.940> is<00:02:14.030> going<00:02:14.210> to

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
thinking about how McMaster is going to

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.930 
thinking about how McMaster is going to
move<00:02:14.480> forward<00:02:14.720> in<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.020> next<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:16.340> next<00:02:16.370> few

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
move forward in the next the next few

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.240 
move forward in the next the next few
years<00:02:17.740> that<00:02:18.740> document<00:02:19.250> lays<00:02:19.730> out<00:02:20.000> some<00:02:20.480> very

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
years that document lays out some very

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.610 
years that document lays out some very
critical<00:02:22.250> high<00:02:23.090> level<00:02:23.420> priorities<00:02:24.080> for<00:02:24.410> the

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
critical high level priorities for the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.380 
critical high level priorities for the
institution<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.340> ways<00:02:25.550> of<00:02:25.730> thinking<00:02:25.940> about

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
institution and ways of thinking about

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.600 
institution and ways of thinking about
how<00:02:27.080> McMaster<00:02:27.800> can<00:02:28.160> can<00:02:28.580> change<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:29.540> become

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
how McMaster can can change and become

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.130 
how McMaster can can change and become
even<00:02:31.610> better<00:02:31.730> institution<00:02:32.720> of<00:02:32.990> higher

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
even better institution of higher

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.660 
even better institution of higher
learning<00:02:33.200> over<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:33.800> next<00:02:34.070> number<00:02:34.220> of<00:02:34.430> years

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
learning over the next number of years

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.550 
learning over the next number of years
but<00:02:35.330> it's<00:02:35.450> at<00:02:35.540> a<00:02:35.600> very<00:02:35.780> high<00:02:35.840> level<00:02:35.990> and<00:02:36.440> so

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
but it's at a very high level and so

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.170 
but it's at a very high level and so
there's<00:02:36.740> a<00:02:36.800> lot<00:02:36.950> of<00:02:36.980> strategic<00:02:37.610> thinking<00:02:37.970> that

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
there's a lot of strategic thinking that

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.900 
there's a lot of strategic thinking that
needs<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.540> happen<00:02:38.590> about<00:02:39.590> where<00:02:39.920> we<00:02:40.670> want<00:02:40.820> to

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
needs to happen about where we want to

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.120 
needs to happen about where we want to
put<00:02:41.060> our<00:02:41.120> priorities<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:41.990> what<00:02:42.680> will<00:02:42.860> be<00:02:42.980> the

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
put our priorities and what will be the

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.710 
put our priorities and what will be the
areas<00:02:43.430> of<00:02:43.580> emphasis<00:02:43.970> within<00:02:44.180> forward<00:02:44.600> with

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
areas of emphasis within forward with

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.660 
areas of emphasis within forward with
integrity<00:02:45.020> and<00:02:45.560> how<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:45.740> implement<00:02:46.160> some<00:02:46.550> of

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
integrity and how to implement some of

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.730 
integrity and how to implement some of
the<00:02:46.760> high-level<00:02:47.570> ideas<00:02:48.140> that<00:02:48.290> are<00:02:48.410> contained

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
the high-level ideas that are contained

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.920 
the high-level ideas that are contained
in<00:02:48.950> that<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:49.640> my<00:02:49.970> priority<00:02:50.390> over<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.600> next<00:02:50.810> few

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
in that so my priority over the next few

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.590 
in that so my priority over the next few
months<00:02:51.080> is<00:02:51.320> to<00:02:51.440> work<00:02:51.650> with<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.070> community

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
months is to work with the community

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.699 
months is to work with the community
take<00:02:53.600> all<00:02:53.810> of<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:54.020> ideas<00:02:54.140> that<00:02:54.380> have<00:02:54.590> been

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
take all of the ideas that have been

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.110 
take all of the ideas that have been
generated<00:02:54.740> over<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.520> last<00:02:55.700> couple<00:02:55.880> of<00:02:56.060> years

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
generated over the last couple of years

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.090 
generated over the last couple of years
and<00:02:56.510> think<00:02:57.080> about<00:02:57.320> where<00:02:57.560> we<00:02:57.590> can<00:02:57.890> move

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
and think about where we can move

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.130 
and think about where we can move
forward<00:02:58.130> quickly<00:02:58.640> in<00:02:59.300> order<00:02:59.420> to<00:02:59.690> be<00:02:59.810> able<00:02:59.930> to

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
forward quickly in order to be able to

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.890 
forward quickly in order to be able to
make<00:03:00.320> some<00:03:00.560> some<00:03:01.130> impacts<00:03:01.640> at<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:02.510> same<00:03:02.690> time

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
make some some impacts at the same time

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.360 
make some some impacts at the same time
that's<00:03:03.140> happening<00:03:03.590> we<00:03:03.709> have<00:03:03.860> a<00:03:03.890> number<00:03:04.100> of

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
that's happening we have a number of

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.199 
that's happening we have a number of
other<00:03:04.490> critical<00:03:05.739> enabling<00:03:06.790> things<00:03:07.790> happening

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
other critical enabling things happening

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.670 
other critical enabling things happening
in<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.420> background<00:03:08.540> that<00:03:08.959> have<00:03:09.110> to<00:03:09.260> do<00:03:09.410> with

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
in the background that have to do with

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.830 
in the background that have to do with
changes<00:03:10.550> to<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.820> to<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.090> budget<00:03:11.360> model

changes to the to the budget model

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
changes to the way in which we

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.009 
changes to the way in which we
distribute<00:03:13.820> funds<00:03:14.120> within<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.600> institution
