00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.430
 to win paris roubaix me I say 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.709
 always at the first of things without 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:17.140
 to feel like you have to want 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:19.359
 and it's inevitably an appointment 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.070
 with his own sporting destiny and if they 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.230
 just have to remember a little bit when 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.460
 Fred Guesdon enter the velodrome 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.200
 there are people around him he must 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.900
 go last on the bike mirande 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.970
 the last shot that even until the 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.720
 down the last corner of this 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.129
 velodrome of Roubaix 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.410
 we do not really believe in victory 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.760
 fred guesdon is what today 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.140
 can say that you really had all 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.879
 the assets to win paris roubaix 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:46.210
 no I see we had the destiny for 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:48.010
 we it's fate are so it's a 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.089
 moment of grace yeah that's not really 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.339
 predictable and it's hard to 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:52.719
 difficult to explain it is difficult 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:56.019
 to design it 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.460
 I think in bodies that were 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.690
 in the end of that year a lot 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.839
 today must have regrets 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:09.219
 huge 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:10.780
 but paris roubaix the flanks of san 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:12.520
 remo a world championship be like 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.740
 it's a race of a lifetime 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.399
 a destiny that's what makes it 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.439
 it's magic where there are moments 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.100
 in races we have an appointment of his 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.259
 own destiny 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.619
 sas is part of you dwelt 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.299
 by this case here I have often said 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.770
 I had the vocation of runners as 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.060
 we have the vocation of the killings so I 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.710
 never had the vocation of the priests but 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.909
 I had the vocation of runners it is 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.880
 something that one has in oneself 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.590
 I believe that there are races like 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.210
 paris roubaix among others or must 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:46.509
 to have it in oneself must live by the thing 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.950
 crazy is inhabited by the trick if if the 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.990
 current is inhabited by the stuff he goes 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.340
 necessarily do more than he does 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.130
 usually can let this 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.329
 kind of stuff 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.969
 do you feel like your 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.950
 runners of this generation are more 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.060
 inhabited by classics that do not 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.670
 was it you 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.890
 first rider but first quad is 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.780
 not necessarily all that talent enough 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.119
 and necessary to fetch the 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.860
 big results not always had the 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.580
 outstanding a game not always had 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.260
 exceptional runners 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.060
 we had difficult years 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.160
 the team has had difficult years 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.260
 has known bad times we will 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.830
 not rewrite the story where it was 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.989
 complicated to exist so but he 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.080
 Nevertheless, even in these moments the 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.140
 more is harder to live 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.250
 there was still this flame there 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.480
 had this flame we always had 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.819
 hoping to go get something 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.610
 and we were always going to scratch 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.769
 one place we made blows 5 6 7 8 of the 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.200
 all of paris roubaix we went to get 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.980
 donations to the trades made five six of the 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.780
 flanders tower 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.019
 Oh sure we did not win but we 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.349
 existed what we were not we were not 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.269
 not to the street if we could sublimate 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.250
 the few means we had at the place 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.330
 where it was necessary 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.530
 because we had it in us because we 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.739
 had this this fascination by 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.670
 relation to these races there what and 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.209
 today I know that I have more 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.500
 of runners who have the potential and then 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.420
 I think they are inhabited by the pru 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.310
 they are inhabited by the thing huh but 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.319
 like ladagnous this I think he thinks 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.709
 robert he dreams roubaix since the year 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.560
 latest 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.620
 so precisely the last ones we did not 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.260
 the picture but but we remember after 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.480
 the arrival there is both and there is 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.739
 a lot of emotion because it's the 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:35.139
 last of gaydon and then because 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.489
 mathieu ladagnous did a 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:39.370
 nice feat but was not at all 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.019
 rewarded and you almost have 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.579
 maybe not the tear to the eye but the 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.290
 elected to the tear to the eye 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.910
 you are very moved you are moved 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.530
 why are you mureaux at first 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.000
 think it's more for hugot and in 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.960
 do no I'm moved for both 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.730
 stuff because 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.710
 it was a part of the season 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.710
 were turning a corner of the history of 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:02.510
 the team that were turning with the 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:04.010
 departure from fred and which at the same time there 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.110
 had the disappointment of being past everything 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.410
 near a big trick of a Paris podium 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.100
 roubaix 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.290
 but with hindsight today I 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.420
 prefers what happened to lada 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.510
 has happened for a spot or two 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:21.710
 three only for one last and at the same 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.300
 time I am deeply convinced that the 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:25.630
 day we will be for the win really 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.630
 win
