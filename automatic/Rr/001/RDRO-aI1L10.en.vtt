00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
hey everybody today I'm gonna talk about

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.410 
hey everybody today I'm gonna talk about
why<00:00:11.070> it's<00:00:11.250> important<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.790> stretch<00:00:12.210> the

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
why it's important to stretch the

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.240 
why it's important to stretch the
rotator<00:00:12.750> cuff<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:13.320> then<00:00:13.769> I'm<00:00:13.860> gonna<00:00:14.040> follow

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
rotator cuff and then I'm gonna follow

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.950 
rotator cuff and then I'm gonna follow
it<00:00:14.490> up<00:00:14.610> with<00:00:14.639> some<00:00:15.120> actual<00:00:15.389> stretches<00:00:15.839> that

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
it up with some actual stretches that

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.609 
it up with some actual stretches that
you<00:00:16.020> can<00:00:16.080> do

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
you can do

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.830 
you can do
alright<00:00:17.160> so<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.369> kick<00:00:17.730> it<00:00:17.850> off<00:00:18.000> stretching<00:00:18.720> the

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
alright so to kick it off stretching the

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.720 
alright so to kick it off stretching the
rotator<00:00:19.140> cuff<00:00:19.320> muscles<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.830> critical<00:00:20.490> in

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
rotator cuff muscles is critical in

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.450 
rotator cuff muscles is critical in
order<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.240> have<00:00:22.140> your<00:00:22.380> shoulders<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.279> your

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
order to have your shoulders and your

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.730 
order to have your shoulders and your
scapula<00:00:23.760> move<00:00:24.150> properly<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.869> prevent<00:00:25.350> injury

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
scapula move properly and prevent injury

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.410 
scapula move properly and prevent injury
many<00:00:26.220> people<00:00:26.519> are<00:00:26.609> aware<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:27.000> keeping<00:00:27.150> their

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
many people are aware of keeping their

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.839 
many people are aware of keeping their
rotator<00:00:27.720> cuff<00:00:27.990> strong<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.490> know<00:00:29.609> you'll

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
rotator cuff strong so you know you'll

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.460 
rotator cuff strong so you know you'll
see<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> lot<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.359> people<00:00:30.599> especially<00:00:30.750> baseball

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
see a lot of people especially baseball

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.260 
see a lot of people especially baseball
players<00:00:31.710> doing<00:00:32.040> rotator<00:00:32.460> cuff<00:00:32.669> strengthening

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
players doing rotator cuff strengthening

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.240 
players doing rotator cuff strengthening
exercises<00:00:33.750> but<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.500> don't<00:00:34.710> see<00:00:34.860> very<00:00:35.100> many

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
exercises but you don't see very many

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.370 
exercises but you don't see very many
people<00:00:35.460> stretching<00:00:36.090> their<00:00:36.239> rotator<00:00:36.510> cuffs<00:00:36.809> so

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
people stretching their rotator cuffs so

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.310 
people stretching their rotator cuffs so
people<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.040> have<00:00:38.100> desk<00:00:38.910> jobs<00:00:39.030> or<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:40.200> know

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
people that have desk jobs or you know

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.770 
people that have desk jobs or you know
students<00:00:41.100> anybody<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.820> sits<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.360> lot<00:00:42.540> is

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
students anybody that sits a lot is

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.319 
students anybody that sits a lot is
basically<00:00:43.530> almost<00:00:43.860> guaranteed<00:00:44.670> going<00:00:45.210> to

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
basically almost guaranteed going to

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.360 
basically almost guaranteed going to
have<00:00:45.539> tight<00:00:45.989> medial<00:00:46.469> rotators<00:00:46.980> which<00:00:47.219> are

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
have tight medial rotators which are

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.910 
have tight medial rotators which are
basically<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.030> internal<00:00:48.690> rotators<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.320> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
basically the internal rotators of the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.439 
basically the internal rotators of the
arm<00:00:50.070> bone<00:00:50.309> okay<00:00:50.550> they<00:00:50.700> rotate<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.120> arm<00:00:51.239> bone

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
arm bone okay they rotate the arm bone

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.900 
arm bone okay they rotate the arm bone
inwards<00:00:52.020> like<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.460> reason<00:00:53.789> for

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
inwards like this and the reason for

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.330 
inwards like this and the reason for
that<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.800> you<00:00:55.800> know<00:00:55.920> when<00:00:56.219> you're

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
that is that you know when you're

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.799 
that is that you know when you're
sitting<00:00:56.640> down<00:00:56.670> you're<00:00:57.090> most<00:00:57.239> likely<00:00:57.420> doing

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
sitting down you're most likely doing

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.450 
sitting down you're most likely doing
something<00:00:58.079> you're<00:00:58.170> not<00:00:58.260> sitting<00:00:58.649> most<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.399> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
something you're not sitting most of the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.010 
something you're not sitting most of the
times<00:00:59.670> you're<00:00:59.940> not<00:01:00.059> sitting<00:01:00.359> down<00:01:00.660> with<00:01:00.870> your

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
times you're not sitting down with your

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.290 
times you're not sitting down with your
shoulders<00:01:01.350> open<00:01:01.829> chest<00:01:02.190> out<00:01:02.399> you're<00:01:02.910> most

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
shoulders open chest out you're most

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.880 
shoulders open chest out you're most
likely<00:01:03.480> rounded<00:01:03.989> forward<00:01:04.290> your<00:01:04.500> arms<00:01:04.769> are

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
likely rounded forward your arms are

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.429 
likely rounded forward your arms are
actually<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.549> medially<00:01:06.030> medially<00:01:06.869> rotated

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
actually in a medially medially rotated

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.660 
actually in a medially medially rotated
position<00:01:07.470> you're<00:01:08.070> working<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.430> keyboard

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
position you're working on a keyboard

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.429 
position you're working on a keyboard
reading<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.450> book<00:01:09.570> or<00:01:09.780> texting<00:01:10.110> or<00:01:10.200> something

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
reading a book or texting or something

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.990 
reading a book or texting or something
like<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.979> since<00:01:11.580> you're<00:01:11.790> always

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
like that and since you're always

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.149 
like that and since you're always
putting<00:01:12.689> your<00:01:12.720> medial<00:01:13.170> rotators<00:01:13.860> into<00:01:14.130> a

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
putting your medial rotators into a

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.740 
putting your medial rotators into a
shortened<00:01:14.549> position<00:01:14.909> they<00:01:15.060> get<00:01:15.210> tight<00:01:15.540> and

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
shortened position they get tight and

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.289 
shortened position they get tight and
what<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.110> restricts<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.890> external<00:01:17.759> rotation

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
what that restricts is external rotation

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.090 
what that restricts is external rotation
of<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.659> arm<00:01:18.810> okay<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.590> when<00:01:19.710> your<00:01:19.830> medial

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
of the arm okay so when your medial

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.359 
of the arm okay so when your medial
rotators<00:01:20.520> are<00:01:20.670> tight<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.299> muscles<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.750> that

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
rotators are tight the muscles that that

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.080 
rotators are tight the muscles that that
internally<00:01:23.369> rotate<00:01:23.640> your<00:01:23.700> arm<00:01:23.850> with<00:01:24.000> those

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
internally rotate your arm with those

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.450 
internally rotate your arm with those
are<00:01:24.210> tight<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.750> makes<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.080> hard<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.460> externally

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
are tight it makes it hard to externally

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.120 
are tight it makes it hard to externally
rotate<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:27.060> move<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.080> arm<00:01:28.350> bone<00:01:28.560> out<00:01:28.740> like

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
rotate to move the arm bone out like

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.340 
rotate to move the arm bone out like
that<00:01:29.310> now<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.119> actually<00:01:30.329> becomes<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.960> big

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
that now this actually becomes a big

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.569 
that now this actually becomes a big
problem<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.250> overhead<00:01:33.000> sports<00:01:33.509> like<00:01:34.579> baseball

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
problem in overhead sports like baseball

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.080 
problem in overhead sports like baseball
and<00:01:36.470> tennis<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.650> things<00:01:37.920> like<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.100> even<00:01:38.790> in

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
and tennis and things like that even in

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.789 
and tennis and things like that even in
overhead<00:01:39.509> pressing<00:01:40.079> because<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.409> need<00:01:40.650> to

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
overhead pressing because you need to

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.340 
overhead pressing because you need to
have<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.759> external<00:01:42.270> rotation<00:01:42.540> range<00:01:43.170> of

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
have that external rotation range of

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.200 
have that external rotation range of
motion<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.829> if<00:01:44.159> your<00:01:44.280> medial<00:01:44.640> rotators<00:01:45.060> are

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
motion and if your medial rotators are

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.609 
motion and if your medial rotators are
super<00:01:45.659> tight<00:01:45.899> because<00:01:46.170> you've<00:01:46.320> been<00:01:46.439> sitting

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
super tight because you've been sitting

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.499 
super tight because you've been sitting
at<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.829> desk<00:01:47.130> all<00:01:47.310> day<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:48.060> know<00:01:48.180> that's<00:01:48.420> a

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
at a desk all day you know that's a

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.330 
at a desk all day you know that's a
recipe<00:01:48.810> for<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:49.140> shoulder<00:01:49.470> injury<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:50.220> I'm

recipe for a shoulder injury so I'm

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.679 
recipe for a shoulder injury so I'm
about<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.579> get<00:01:50.759> into<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.030> stretches<00:01:51.450> here

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
about to get into the stretches here

about to get into the stretches here
keep<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.140> mind<00:01:52.350> with<00:01:52.500> these<00:01:52.649> guys<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.250> you

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
keep in mind with these guys that you

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.639 
keep in mind with these guys that you
want<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.939> do<00:01:54.030> these<00:01:54.149> very<00:01:54.600> very<00:01:54.990> gently<00:01:55.439> your

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
want to do these very very gently your

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.170 
want to do these very very gently your
rotator<00:01:55.950> cuff<00:01:56.189> muscles<00:01:56.549> especially<00:01:57.119> if

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
rotator cuff muscles especially if

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.330 
rotator cuff muscles especially if
they're<00:01:57.390> stiff<00:01:57.899> they're<00:01:58.530> gonna<00:01:58.680> kind<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.100> be

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
they're stiff they're gonna kind of be

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.780 
they're stiff they're gonna kind of be
predisposed<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.299> being<00:02:01.259> injured<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.130> take

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
predisposed to being injured so take

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.510 
predisposed to being injured so take
these<00:02:02.969> very<00:02:03.299> very<00:02:03.780> very<00:02:04.259> slowly<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.159> be<00:02:05.280> very

gentle on yourself

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.700 
gentle on yourself
this<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:06.810> not<00:02:06.960> like<00:02:07.140> stretching<00:02:07.500> your

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
this is not like stretching your

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.279 
this is not like stretching your
hamstrings<00:02:08.220> out<00:02:08.399> or<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:09.420> know<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.720> larger

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
hamstrings out or you know a larger

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.660 
hamstrings out or you know a larger
muscle<00:02:10.590> group<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.830> your<00:02:10.920> body<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.310> rotator

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
muscle group of your body the rotator

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.880 
muscle group of your body the rotator
cuff<00:02:11.760> muscles<00:02:11.879> are<00:02:12.239> very<00:02:12.270> very

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
cuff muscles are very very

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.200 
cuff muscles are very very
small<00:02:13.220> and<00:02:13.460> you<00:02:13.520> want<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:13.730> be<00:02:13.819> careful<00:02:14.030> with

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
small and you want to be careful with

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.510 
small and you want to be careful with
them<00:02:14.420> secondly<00:02:15.410> if<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:15.650> already<00:02:15.830> have<00:02:16.190> some

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
them secondly if you already have some

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.520 
them secondly if you already have some
sort<00:02:16.550> of<00:02:16.819> shoulder<00:02:17.270> pathology<00:02:17.900> if<00:02:18.319> you've

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
sort of shoulder pathology if you've

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.080 
sort of shoulder pathology if you've
already<00:02:18.709> injured<00:02:19.130> your<00:02:19.280> rotator<00:02:19.580> cuff<00:02:19.850> and

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
already injured your rotator cuff and

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.730 
already injured your rotator cuff and
it's<00:02:20.209> still<00:02:20.510> injured<00:02:20.870> do<00:02:21.350> not<00:02:21.470> do<00:02:21.620> these

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
it's still injured do not do these

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.559 
it's still injured do not do these
exercises<00:02:22.190> consult<00:02:22.700> with<00:02:22.819> your<00:02:22.940> doctor<00:02:23.120> and

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
exercises consult with your doctor and

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.390 
exercises consult with your doctor and
see<00:02:24.200> what's<00:02:24.350> best<00:02:24.560> from<00:02:24.740> there<00:02:24.890> alright<00:02:25.280> so

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
see what's best from there alright so

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.830 
see what's best from there alright so
most<00:02:25.850> of<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.060> are<00:02:26.180> gonna<00:02:26.270> benefit<00:02:26.780> from

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
most of you are gonna benefit from

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.170 
most of you are gonna benefit from
stretching<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.770> internal<00:02:28.400> rotators<00:02:28.790> by

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
stretching the internal rotators by

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.330 
stretching the internal rotators by
externally<00:02:29.990> rotating<00:02:30.470> so<00:02:30.680> there's<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:31.220> couple

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
externally rotating so there's a couple

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.370 
externally rotating so there's a couple
ways<00:02:31.520> to<00:02:31.580> do<00:02:31.910> this<00:02:32.030> so<00:02:32.390> one<00:02:32.930> is<00:02:33.110> to<00:02:33.140> actually

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
ways to do this so one is to actually

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.770 
ways to do this so one is to actually
use<00:02:33.560> this<00:02:33.950> tool<00:02:34.400> here<00:02:34.430> called<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:35.330> rotator

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
use this tool here called the rotator

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.160 
use this tool here called the rotator
and<00:02:36.080> basically<00:02:37.070> what<00:02:37.340> this<00:02:37.430> is<00:02:37.490> for<00:02:37.880> is

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
and basically what this is for is

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.360 
and basically what this is for is
precisely<00:02:39.170> for<00:02:39.560> stretching<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.010> rotator

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
precisely for stretching the rotator

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.100 
precisely for stretching the rotator
cuff<00:02:40.430> so<00:02:40.910> like<00:02:41.630> I<00:02:41.750> said<00:02:41.810> we're<00:02:42.020> gonna

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
cuff so like I said we're gonna

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.229 
cuff so like I said we're gonna
externally<00:02:42.860> rotate<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.250> arm<00:02:43.370> so<00:02:43.700> if<00:02:44.030> you<00:02:44.120> have

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
externally rotate the arm so if you have

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:45.640 
externally rotate the arm so if you have
one<00:02:44.390> of<00:02:44.480> these<00:02:44.540> you<00:02:44.750> can<00:02:44.810> basically<00:02:45.080> strap<00:02:45.500> on

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
one of these you can basically strap on

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.340 
one of these you can basically strap on
your<00:02:45.680> wrist<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.130> can<00:02:46.400> externally<00:02:47.120> rotate<00:02:47.630> out

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
your wrist you can externally rotate out

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.140 
your wrist you can externally rotate out
to<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.680> side<00:02:48.890> like<00:02:49.100> this<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:49.489> can<00:02:49.610> abduct

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
to the side like this you can abduct

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.690 
to the side like this you can abduct
your<00:02:50.239> arm<00:02:50.450> like<00:02:50.870> this<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.370> externally<00:02:52.370> rotate

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
your arm like this and externally rotate

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.370 
your arm like this and externally rotate
behind<00:02:53.000> you<00:02:53.150> okay<00:02:53.360> be<00:02:53.540> very<00:02:53.810> careful<00:02:54.200> in<00:02:54.290> this

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
behind you okay be very careful in this

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.479 
behind you okay be very careful in this
position<00:02:54.860> all<00:02:55.190> right

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
position all right

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.090 
position all right
God<00:02:55.850> take<00:02:56.090> this<00:02:56.209> very<00:02:56.570> very<00:02:56.959> carefully<00:02:57.380> but

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
God take this very very carefully but

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.280 
God take this very very carefully but
basically<00:02:58.430> just<00:02:58.730> kind<00:02:59.180> of<00:02:59.300> scissor<00:02:59.660> in<00:03:00.019> and

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
basically just kind of scissor in and

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.320 
basically just kind of scissor in and
out<00:03:00.440> of<00:03:00.680> in<00:03:01.040> range<00:03:01.370> motion<00:03:01.610> so<00:03:01.970> if<00:03:02.060> you<00:03:02.120> can<00:03:02.239> go

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
out of in range motion so if you can go

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.330 
out of in range motion so if you can go
to<00:03:02.360> here<00:03:02.780> without<00:03:02.989> restriction<00:03:03.530> then<00:03:04.040> loosen

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
to here without restriction then loosen

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.979 
to here without restriction then loosen
it<00:03:04.459> up<00:03:04.519> a<00:03:04.640> little<00:03:04.760> bit<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:05.480> then<00:03:05.630> go<00:03:05.810> there

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
it up a little bit and then go there

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.440 
it up a little bit and then go there
again<00:03:06.290> push<00:03:06.590> little<00:03:07.280> bit<00:03:07.370> harder<00:03:07.760> loosen<00:03:08.390> up

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
again push little bit harder loosen up

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.050 
again push little bit harder loosen up
again<00:03:08.720> push<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.230> little<00:03:09.530> bit<00:03:09.860> harder<00:03:10.190> so<00:03:10.430> a<00:03:10.610> tool

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
again push a little bit harder so a tool

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.350 
again push a little bit harder so a tool
like<00:03:11.239> this<00:03:11.450> is<00:03:11.650> really<00:03:12.650> a<00:03:12.739> great<00:03:13.010> tool<00:03:13.820> so<00:03:14.150> you

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
like this is really a great tool so you

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.030 
like this is really a great tool so you
can<00:03:14.780> get<00:03:14.989> you<00:03:15.140> can<00:03:15.290> externally<00:03:15.709> rotate<00:03:16.010> the

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
can get you can externally rotate the

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.920 
can get you can externally rotate the
arm<00:03:16.160> at<00:03:16.519> a<00:03:16.550> lot<00:03:16.820> of<00:03:16.850> different<00:03:17.239> angles<00:03:17.390> here

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
arm at a lot of different angles here

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.900 
arm at a lot of different angles here
alright<00:03:18.290> and<00:03:18.440> that's<00:03:19.070> one<00:03:19.340> reason<00:03:19.370> why<00:03:19.700> I<00:03:19.730> like

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
alright and that's one reason why I like

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.610 
alright and that's one reason why I like
this<00:03:20.060> thing<00:03:20.120> alright<00:03:20.810> so<00:03:21.019> a<00:03:21.049> second<00:03:21.530> way<00:03:21.590> to

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
this thing alright so a second way to

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.620 
this thing alright so a second way to
externally<00:03:22.100> rotate<00:03:22.730> your<00:03:22.760> arm<00:03:23.030> if<00:03:23.239> you<00:03:23.269> don't

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
externally rotate your arm if you don't

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.569 
externally rotate your arm if you don't
have<00:03:23.930> one<00:03:24.320> of<00:03:24.350> those<00:03:24.530> tools<00:03:25.010> that<00:03:25.340> I<00:03:25.370> just

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
have one of those tools that I just

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.130 
have one of those tools that I just
showed<00:03:25.730> you<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:25.940> rotator<00:03:26.269> is<00:03:26.480> to<00:03:26.959> basically

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
showed you the rotator is to basically

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.620 
showed you the rotator is to basically
use<00:03:27.709> a<00:03:27.980> resistance<00:03:28.700> band<00:03:28.850> so<00:03:29.209> you<00:03:29.269> want<00:03:29.510> a

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
use a resistance band so you want a

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.660 
use a resistance band so you want a
closed<00:03:29.989> resistance<00:03:30.590> band<00:03:30.799> that's<00:03:31.370> just<00:03:31.459> a

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
closed resistance band that's just a

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.970 
closed resistance band that's just a
circular<00:03:31.970> band<00:03:32.390> like<00:03:32.780> this<00:03:33.019> not<00:03:33.380> one<00:03:33.799> with

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
circular band like this not one with

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.370 
circular band like this not one with
handles<00:03:34.370> so<00:03:34.690> basically<00:03:35.690> what<00:03:35.959> you<00:03:36.049> can<00:03:36.079> do<00:03:36.260> is

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
handles so basically what you can do is

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.979 
handles so basically what you can do is
you<00:03:36.470> can<00:03:36.590> just<00:03:36.620> loop<00:03:37.519> it<00:03:37.670> around<00:03:37.820> a<00:03:38.390> vertical

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
you can just loop it around a vertical

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.069 
you can just loop it around a vertical
column<00:03:39.170> something<00:03:39.799> like<00:03:39.920> that<00:03:40.130> you<00:03:40.730> want<00:03:40.880> to

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
column something like that you want to

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.600 
column something like that you want to
fasten<00:03:42.079> the<00:03:42.110> band<00:03:42.350> so<00:03:42.590> it's<00:03:42.799> at<00:03:42.950> about<00:03:42.980> elbow

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
fasten the band so it's at about elbow

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.479 
fasten the band so it's at about elbow
level<00:03:44.000> here<00:03:44.299> okay<00:03:44.690> and<00:03:45.019> what<00:03:45.890> you<00:03:45.950> can<00:03:46.130> do<00:03:46.340> is

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
level here okay and what you can do is

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.340 
level here okay and what you can do is
you<00:03:46.579> can<00:03:46.730> hold<00:03:46.970> on<00:03:47.180> to<00:03:47.209> it<00:03:47.420> use<00:03:48.110> your<00:03:48.260> other

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
you can hold on to it use your other

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.199 
you can hold on to it use your other
hand<00:03:48.620> that<00:03:48.680> you're<00:03:48.829> not<00:03:48.950> stretching<00:03:49.340> and<00:03:49.730> put

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
hand that you're not stretching and put

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.850 
hand that you're not stretching and put
that<00:03:50.329> on<00:03:50.450> your<00:03:50.540> elbow<00:03:50.930> because<00:03:51.410> you<00:03:51.650> basically

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
that on your elbow because you basically

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.069 
that on your elbow because you basically
want<00:03:52.310> to<00:03:52.400> hold<00:03:52.610> the<00:03:53.120> humerus<00:03:53.600> your<00:03:53.750> arm<00:03:53.870> bone

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
want to hold the humerus your arm bone

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.390 
want to hold the humerus your arm bone
right<00:03:54.230> underneath<00:03:54.500> your<00:03:54.680> shoulder<00:03:54.980> here<00:03:55.130> and

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
right underneath your shoulder here and

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.910 
right underneath your shoulder here and
make<00:03:55.850> sure<00:03:56.090> that<00:03:56.269> it<00:03:56.420> rotates<00:03:56.750> on<00:03:57.049> this<00:03:57.290> axis

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
make sure that it rotates on this axis

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.550 
make sure that it rotates on this axis
here<00:03:57.950> okay<00:03:58.670> so<00:03:59.150> you're<00:03:59.269> trying<00:03:59.450> to<00:03:59.510> spin<00:04:00.019> the

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
here okay so you're trying to spin the

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.670 
here okay so you're trying to spin the
humerus<00:04:01.400> out<00:04:01.579> so<00:04:02.450> you<00:04:03.049> don't<00:04:03.200> want<00:04:03.320> it<00:04:03.380> being

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
humerus out so you don't want it being

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.259 
humerus out so you don't want it being
pulled<00:04:04.010> back<00:04:04.250> away<00:04:04.519> from<00:04:04.579> your<00:04:04.790> hip<00:04:04.940> like<00:04:05.120> that

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
pulled back away from your hip like that

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.390 
pulled back away from your hip like that
so<00:04:05.420> use<00:04:05.570> this<00:04:05.720> hand<00:04:05.989> kind<00:04:06.590> of<00:04:06.650> stabilize<00:04:07.040> and

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
so use this hand kind of stabilize and

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.190 
so use this hand kind of stabilize and
you're<00:04:08.239> basically<00:04:08.510> going<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:08.810> do<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.019> same

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
you're basically going to do the same

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.449 
you're basically going to do the same
thing<00:04:09.470> here<00:04:09.709> as<00:04:09.799> you<00:04:09.859> did<00:04:10.010> with<00:04:10.100> the<00:04:10.190> rotator

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
thing here as you did with the rotator

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.699 
thing here as you did with the rotator
you're<00:04:10.579> gonna<00:04:10.670> rotate<00:04:11.030> away<00:04:11.600> from<00:04:11.930> it<00:04:12.079> like

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
you're gonna rotate away from it like

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.160 
you're gonna rotate away from it like
this<00:04:12.980> until<00:04:13.850> you're<00:04:14.000> at<00:04:14.120> in<00:04:14.299> range<00:04:14.600> which<00:04:15.019> for

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
this until you're at in range which for

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.719 
this until you're at in range which for
me<00:04:15.290> is<00:04:15.320> about<00:04:15.590> right<00:04:15.739> here<00:04:15.980> and<00:04:16.130> then<00:04:16.640> you're

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
me is about right here and then you're

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:17.680 
me is about right here and then you're
gonna<00:04:16.820> release<00:04:17.209> a<00:04:17.239> little<00:04:17.390> bit<00:04:17.570> of<00:04:17.630> the

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
gonna release a little bit of the

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.380 
gonna release a little bit of the
pressure<00:04:17.870> and<00:04:18.169> then<00:04:18.289> go<00:04:18.410> back<00:04:18.680> to<00:04:18.829> end<00:04:18.979> range

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
pressure and then go back to end range

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.659 
pressure and then go back to end range
release<00:04:20.390> a<00:04:20.419> little<00:04:20.660> bit<00:04:20.810> of<00:04:20.900> pressure<00:04:21.430> go<00:04:22.430> back

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
release a little bit of pressure go back

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.310 
release a little bit of pressure go back
to<00:04:22.820> end<00:04:22.970> range<00:04:23.240> every<00:04:23.750> single<00:04:23.990> time<00:04:24.140> you're

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
to end range every single time you're

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.750 
to end range every single time you're
pushing<00:04:24.440> it<00:04:24.650> a<00:04:24.710> little<00:04:24.740> bit<00:04:25.070> harder<00:04:25.370> okay

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
pushing it a little bit harder okay

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.580 
pushing it a little bit harder okay
all<00:04:25.880> right<00:04:26.180> so<00:04:26.300> the<00:04:26.540> third<00:04:26.750> and<00:04:26.900> final<00:04:27.200> way<00:04:27.560> to

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
all right so the third and final way to

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.980 
all right so the third and final way to
externally<00:04:28.130> rotate<00:04:28.430> your<00:04:28.460> arm<00:04:28.700> is<00:04:29.630> using<00:04:29.930> a

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
externally rotate your arm is using a

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.660 
externally rotate your arm is using a
wall<00:04:30.140> so<00:04:30.290> this<00:04:30.440> one<00:04:30.650> is<00:04:30.920> good<00:04:31.370> if<00:04:31.520> you're

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
wall so this one is good if you're

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.400 
wall so this one is good if you're
really<00:04:31.880> on<00:04:32.030> a<00:04:32.060> budget<00:04:32.300> you<00:04:32.570> don't<00:04:32.600> have<00:04:32.960> any<00:04:33.260> of

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
really on a budget you don't have any of

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.200 
really on a budget you don't have any of
those<00:04:33.530> things<00:04:33.800> that<00:04:33.890> I<00:04:34.130> showed<00:04:34.610> you<00:04:34.700> earlier<00:04:34.790> a

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
those things that I showed you earlier a

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.000 
those things that I showed you earlier a
rotator<00:04:35.600> or<00:04:35.900> a<00:04:35.930> resistance<00:04:36.380> band<00:04:36.650> so

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
rotator or a resistance band so

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.980 
rotator or a resistance band so
basically<00:04:37.760> all<00:04:37.970> you<00:04:38.150> need<00:04:38.330> for<00:04:38.450> this<00:04:38.570> is<00:04:38.780> a

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
basically all you need for this is a

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.570 
basically all you need for this is a
wall<00:04:39.290> what<00:04:40.010> you're<00:04:40.130> gonna<00:04:40.220> do<00:04:40.370> is<00:04:40.490> you're

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
wall what you're gonna do is you're

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.390 
wall what you're gonna do is you're
gonna<00:04:40.640> put<00:04:40.760> your<00:04:41.090> elbow<00:04:41.630> and<00:04:41.980> your<00:04:42.980> forearm

gonna put your elbow and your forearm
and<00:04:43.490> hand<00:04:43.730> on<00:04:44.000> the<00:04:44.180> wall<00:04:44.300> flat<00:04:44.720> okay<00:04:45.140> you're

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
and hand on the wall flat okay you're

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.710 
and hand on the wall flat okay you're
gonna<00:04:46.010> basically<00:04:46.610> get<00:04:47.000> off<00:04:47.120> to<00:04:47.240> the<00:04:47.360> side<00:04:47.600> of

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
gonna basically get off to the side of

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.440 
gonna basically get off to the side of
the<00:04:47.780> wall<00:04:47.960> and<00:04:48.200> then<00:04:48.740> you're<00:04:48.860> gonna<00:04:48.980> dip

the wall and then you're gonna dip
forward<00:04:50.450> like<00:04:50.960> this<00:04:51.200> okay<00:04:51.770> so<00:04:52.370> you're<00:04:52.880> moving

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
forward like this okay so you're moving

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.830 
forward like this okay so you're moving
forward<00:04:53.570> your<00:04:54.490> humerus<00:04:55.490> and<00:04:55.760> your<00:04:56.360> forearm

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
forward your humerus and your forearm

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.520 
forward your humerus and your forearm
are<00:04:57.050> staying<00:04:58.180> fixed<00:04:59.180> in<00:04:59.510> place<00:04:59.810> so<00:05:00.170> while<00:05:00.350> you

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
are staying fixed in place so while you

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.260 
are staying fixed in place so while you
rotate<00:05:00.740> forward<00:05:01.340> your<00:05:01.730> arm<00:05:01.910> is<00:05:02.120> actually

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
rotate forward your arm is actually

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.430 
rotate forward your arm is actually
being<00:05:02.600> externally<00:05:03.050> rotated<00:05:03.650> okay<00:05:03.890> like<00:05:04.520> this

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
being externally rotated okay like this

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.690 
being externally rotated okay like this
okay<00:05:06.440> you<00:05:06.530> have<00:05:06.620> to<00:05:06.710> be<00:05:06.800> very<00:05:07.010> very<00:05:07.430> very

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
gentle here especially if it's feeling

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.320 
gentle here especially if it's feeling
tight<00:05:09.500> all<00:05:09.950> right<00:05:10.070> what<00:05:10.700> I<00:05:10.730> don't<00:05:11.030> want<00:05:11.150> to<00:05:11.210> see

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
tight all right what I don't want to see

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.710 
tight all right what I don't want to see
you<00:05:11.450> do<00:05:11.600> is<00:05:11.750> push<00:05:12.230> in<00:05:12.530> like<00:05:13.040> that<00:05:13.250> okay<00:05:13.720> you're

you do is push in like that okay you're

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.300 
you do is push in like that okay you're
actually<00:05:15.110> that's<00:05:15.710> more<00:05:15.830> of<00:05:15.980> a<00:05:16.040> PEC<00:05:16.280> stretch

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
actually that's more of a PEC stretch

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.420 
actually that's more of a PEC stretch
wait<00:05:16.970> that<00:05:17.780> version<00:05:18.320> okay<00:05:18.620> so<00:05:19.100> you're<00:05:19.340> not

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
wait that version okay so you're not

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.310 
wait that version okay so you're not
trying<00:05:19.700> to<00:05:19.820> stretch<00:05:20.270> your<00:05:20.450> PEC<00:05:20.870> major<00:05:21.020> your

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
trying to stretch your PEC major your

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.360 
trying to stretch your PEC major your
PEC<00:05:21.440> minor<00:05:21.560> you're<00:05:21.770> trying<00:05:21.920> to<00:05:22.010> stretch<00:05:22.220> your

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
PEC minor you're trying to stretch your

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.180 
PEC minor you're trying to stretch your
internal<00:05:23.240> rotators<00:05:23.600> so<00:05:23.990> remember<00:05:24.740> it's<00:05:25.040> not

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
internal rotators so remember it's not

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.640 
internal rotators so remember it's not
pushing<00:05:25.580> forwards<00:05:26.270> it's<00:05:26.600> more<00:05:26.840> of<00:05:26.900> a<00:05:26.990> rotating

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
pushing forwards it's more of a rotating

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.800 
pushing forwards it's more of a rotating
your<00:05:27.740> body<00:05:27.800> downwards<00:05:28.730> while<00:05:29.270> leaving<00:05:29.600> your

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
your body downwards while leaving your

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.090 
your body downwards while leaving your
hand<00:05:30.080> fixed

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
hand fixed

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.220 
hand fixed
that's<00:05:31.730> what's<00:05:32.000> gonna<00:05:32.180> stretch<00:05:32.720> those<00:05:32.900> medial

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
that's what's gonna stretch those medial

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.900 
that's what's gonna stretch those medial
rotators<00:05:33.620> out<00:05:33.800> all<00:05:34.160> right<00:05:34.280> so<00:05:34.520> those

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
rotators out all right so those

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.340 
rotators out all right so those
stretches<00:05:35.300> are<00:05:35.420> gonna<00:05:35.510> help<00:05:35.780> a<00:05:35.930> lot<00:05:35.960> of<00:05:36.200> you

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
stretches are gonna help a lot of you

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.220 
stretches are gonna help a lot of you
that<00:05:36.890> basically<00:05:37.610> sit<00:05:38.210> a<00:05:38.240> lot<00:05:38.390> like<00:05:38.750> I<00:05:38.870> said<00:05:39.080> if

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
that basically sit a lot like I said if

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.930 
that basically sit a lot like I said if
you're<00:05:39.290> immediately<00:05:39.470> immediately<00:05:40.040> rotated

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
you're immediately immediately rotated

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.360 
you're immediately immediately rotated
you<00:05:41.330> want<00:05:41.540> to<00:05:41.600> do<00:05:41.720> external<00:05:42.500> rotation<00:05:43.160> to

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
you want to do external rotation to

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.770 
you want to do external rotation to
stretch<00:05:43.670> the<00:05:43.850> medial<00:05:44.150> rotators<00:05:44.540> that<00:05:44.690> are

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
stretch the medial rotators that are

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:45.820 
stretch the medial rotators that are
most<00:05:44.930> likely<00:05:45.110> gonna<00:05:45.260> be<00:05:45.440> tight

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
most likely gonna be tight

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.230 
most likely gonna be tight
however<00:05:46.220> some<00:05:46.490> of<00:05:46.610> you<00:05:46.730> are<00:05:46.880> also<00:05:47.000> going<00:05:47.180> to

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
however some of you are also going to

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.510 
however some of you are also going to
have<00:05:47.350> externally<00:05:48.350> or<00:05:48.560> external<00:05:49.160> rotators

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
have externally or external rotators

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.280 
have externally or external rotators
that<00:05:49.640> are<00:05:49.730> tight<00:05:49.910> so<00:05:50.390> to<00:05:50.510> stretch<00:05:50.870> those<00:05:51.110> you

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
that are tight so to stretch those you

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.380 
that are tight so to stretch those you
meet<00:05:51.470> it<00:05:51.680> immediately<00:05:52.130> rotate<00:05:52.790> and<00:05:53.210> I'm<00:05:53.270> going

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.390 
meet it immediately rotate and I'm going

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:54.370 
meet it immediately rotate and I'm going
to<00:05:53.420> show<00:05:53.510> you<00:05:53.570> how<00:05:53.660> to<00:05:53.720> do<00:05:53.810> that<00:05:53.900> right<00:05:54.050> now

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
to show you how to do that right now

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.390 
to show you how to do that right now
so<00:05:54.560> if<00:05:54.650> you're<00:05:54.770> when<00:05:54.950> you're<00:05:55.040> stretching<00:05:55.280> your

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
so if you're when you're stretching your

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.220 
so if you're when you're stretching your
internal<00:05:55.850> rotators<00:05:56.120> I<00:05:56.360> usually<00:05:56.720> only<00:05:56.900> use<00:05:57.200> a

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.230 
internal rotators I usually only use a

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.990 
internal rotators I usually only use a
wall<00:05:57.560> for<00:05:57.740> this<00:05:57.830> there's<00:05:58.100> this<00:05:58.220> there's<00:05:58.790> a

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
wall for this there's this there's a

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.850 
wall for this there's this there's a
version<00:05:59.810> of<00:05:59.990> this<00:06:00.110> that<00:06:00.260> you<00:06:00.350> can<00:06:00.380> do<00:06:00.590> laying

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
version of this that you can do laying

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.410 
version of this that you can do laying
on<00:06:01.010> the<00:06:01.070> floor<00:06:01.220> but<00:06:01.490> I<00:06:01.520> like<00:06:01.700> using<00:06:01.880> a<00:06:02.030> wall<00:06:02.180> for

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:02.420 
on the floor but I like using a wall for

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.000 
on the floor but I like using a wall for
it<00:06:02.540> so<00:06:02.960> basically<00:06:03.200> what<00:06:03.620> you<00:06:03.710> do<00:06:03.800> is<00:06:03.920> you

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.010 
it so basically what you do is you

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.490 
it so basically what you do is you
abduct<00:06:04.670> your<00:06:05.000> arm<00:06:05.240> out<00:06:05.510> to<00:06:05.960> about<00:06:06.170> shoulder

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
abduct your arm out to about shoulder

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.540 
abduct your arm out to about shoulder
height

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
height

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.400 
height
you<00:06:07.790> put<00:06:07.940> your<00:06:08.060> elbow<00:06:08.360> on<00:06:08.390> the<00:06:08.600> wall<00:06:08.780> you<00:06:09.260> let

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
you put your elbow on the wall you let

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.200 
you put your elbow on the wall you let
your<00:06:09.500> hand<00:06:09.710> kind<00:06:09.950> of<00:06:10.040> hang<00:06:10.190> here<00:06:10.220> and<00:06:10.610> then<00:06:11.090> you

gonna<00:06:14.390> feel<00:06:14.600> that<00:06:14.630> stretching<00:06:15.290> behind<00:06:16.280> your

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
gonna feel that stretching behind your

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.300 
gonna feel that stretching behind your
shoulder<00:06:17.210> those<00:06:18.140> external<00:06:18.620> rotators<00:06:19.040> for<00:06:19.190> me

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
shoulder those external rotators for me

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.430 
shoulder those external rotators for me
I'm<00:06:19.460> not<00:06:19.580> even<00:06:19.760> tight<00:06:19.970> there<00:06:20.210> I<00:06:20.420> don't<00:06:21.140> ever<00:06:21.260> do
