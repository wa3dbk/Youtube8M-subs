00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
so here's a quick review of the LED

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.129 
so here's a quick review of the LED
light<00:00:12.059> bulb<00:00:12.360> compared<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:12.929> regular

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
light bulb compared to a regular

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.310 
incandescent light bulb or a unit
compared<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.940> CFL<00:00:18.539> light<00:00:18.810> bulb<00:00:19.050> all<00:00:19.200> those

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
compared to a CFL light bulb all those

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.560 
compared to a CFL light bulb all those
little<00:00:19.440> curly<00:00:19.680> ones<00:00:20.040> you<00:00:20.910> can<00:00:21.030> see<00:00:21.060> their<00:00:21.360> fat

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
little curly ones you can see their fat

little curly ones you can see their fat
the<00:00:21.720> same<00:00:21.930> size<00:00:22.290> the<00:00:22.650> led<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.160> got<00:00:23.370> the<00:00:23.460> metal

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
the same size the led you got the metal

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.770 
the same size the led you got the metal
sleeve<00:00:25.650> here<00:00:25.980> for<00:00:26.190> cooling<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:27.270> kind<00:00:27.450> of<00:00:27.510> sucks

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:27.780 
sleeve here for cooling it kind of sucks

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.300 
sleeve here for cooling it kind of sucks
some<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.020> the<00:00:28.080> heat<00:00:28.290> up<00:00:28.440> and<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:29.130> one's

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
some of the heat up and this one's

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.680 
some of the heat up and this one's
actually<00:00:29.490> been<00:00:29.730> plugged<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.120> for<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.360> while<00:00:30.510> so

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:30.690 
actually been plugged in for a while so

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.119 
actually been plugged in for a while so
it's<00:00:30.840> actually<00:00:30.990> quite<00:00:31.260> worn<00:00:31.620> and<00:00:31.830> metal<00:00:32.070> is

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129 
it's actually quite worn and metal is

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:35.090 
it's actually quite worn and metal is
quite<00:00:32.369> warm<00:00:32.610> but<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.570> glass<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.620> still<00:00:34.770> cool

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
quite warm but the glass is still cool

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.459 
quite warm but the glass is still cool
to<00:00:35.129> the<00:00:35.339> touch<00:00:35.570> with<00:00:36.570> an<00:00:36.690> incandescent<00:00:36.989> bulb

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
to the touch with an incandescent bulb

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.810 
to the touch with an incandescent bulb
when<00:00:37.739> it's<00:00:37.859> been<00:00:37.980> running<00:00:38.190> for<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.489> while<00:00:38.640> it

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
when it's been running for a while it

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.610 
when it's been running for a while it
actually<00:00:38.850> gets<00:00:39.300> quite<00:00:39.359> hot<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.410> can't

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
actually gets quite hot and you can't

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.149 
actually gets quite hot and you can't
touch<00:00:40.859> it

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:41.159 
touch it

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:43.369 
touch it
same<00:00:41.460> with<00:00:41.579> CFL<00:00:42.089> CFLs<00:00:42.659> actually<00:00:42.989> get<00:00:43.140> quite

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
same with CFL CFLs actually get quite

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.560 
same with CFL CFLs actually get quite
warm<00:00:43.620> after<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.339> little<00:00:44.460> while<00:00:44.579> another<00:00:45.179> cooler

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
warm after a little while another cooler

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.989 
warm after a little while another cooler
than<00:00:45.839> the<00:00:45.960> incandescent<00:00:46.339> but<00:00:47.339> they<00:00:47.519> still<00:00:47.850> are

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:47.999 
than the incandescent but they still are

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:48.739 
than the incandescent but they still are
warm<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.449> touch

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:48.749 
warm to the touch

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:51.319 
warm to the touch
this<00:00:49.260> one<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:50.010> glass<00:00:50.249> is<00:00:50.429> not<00:00:50.609> warm<00:00:50.969> it's

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
this one the glass is not warm it's

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.149 
this one the glass is not warm it's
actually<00:00:51.659> almost<00:00:51.839> cool<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.319> the<00:00:52.409> touch<00:00:52.620> but

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
actually almost cool to the touch but

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.969 
actually almost cool to the touch but
the<00:00:53.339> the<00:00:54.179> metal<00:00:54.539> part<00:00:54.870> does<00:00:55.199> get<00:00:55.469> warm<00:00:55.679> so<00:00:55.920> if

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:55.979 
the the metal part does get warm so if

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:58.099 
the the metal part does get warm so if
you're<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.249> closed<00:00:56.579> housing<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.449> could<00:00:57.989> see

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
you're in a closed housing I could see

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.290 
you're in a closed housing I could see
this<00:00:58.170> being<00:00:58.409> a<00:00:58.499> little<00:00:58.769> bit<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.979> an<00:00:59.069> issue<00:00:59.300> but

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
this being a little bit of an issue but

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.119 
this being a little bit of an issue but
it's<00:01:00.479> not<00:01:00.629> necessarily<00:01:01.260> hot<00:01:01.559> enough<00:01:01.769> to<00:01:01.829> melt

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
it's not necessarily hot enough to melt

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.640 
it's not necessarily hot enough to melt
anything<00:01:02.670> but<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.059> warm<00:01:03.530> they're<00:01:04.530> about

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
anything but it is warm they're about

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.490 
anything but it is warm they're about
the<00:01:04.769> same<00:01:04.920> size<00:01:04.979> as<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.580> can<00:01:05.760> see<00:01:06.259> but<00:01:07.259> this<00:01:07.439> is

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
the same size as you can see but this is

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.929 
the same size as you can see but this is
actually<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.950> fair<00:01:08.189> bit<00:01:08.219> heavier<00:01:08.610> probably

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
actually a fair bit heavier probably

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.819 
actually a fair bit heavier probably
three<00:01:09.119> or<00:01:09.149> four<00:01:09.270> times<00:01:09.390> heavier<00:01:09.960> one<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.710> these

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829 
three or four times heavier one of these

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:14.510 
three or four times heavier one of these
little<00:01:11.100> little<00:01:11.520> flimsy<00:01:12.500> senescent<00:01:13.500> bulbs<00:01:13.770> and

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
little little flimsy senescent bulbs and

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.969 
little little flimsy senescent bulbs and
probably<00:01:15.060> by<00:01:15.600> Thursday<00:01:16.079> I'd<00:01:16.469> probably<00:01:16.710> say

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
probably by Thursday I'd probably say

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.340 
probably by Thursday I'd probably say
that's<00:01:17.130> almost<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.610> pound<00:01:17.820> that's<00:01:18.719> probably

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
that's almost a pound that's probably

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.999 
that's almost a pound that's probably
about<00:01:19.590> 10<00:01:20.270> 14<00:01:21.270> ounces<00:01:21.719> maybe<00:01:21.899> even<00:01:22.200> 16<00:01:22.619> ounces

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
about 10 14 ounces maybe even 16 ounces

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.520 
about 10 14 ounces maybe even 16 ounces

see how it look compared to a regular
incandescent<00:01:40.920> bulb<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:42.000> we'll<00:01:42.119> kind<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.329> go

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
incandescent bulb and we'll kind of go

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.910 
incandescent bulb and we'll kind of go
from<00:01:42.630> there<00:01:42.810> okay<00:01:44.899> so<00:01:45.899> now<00:01:46.170> we're<00:01:46.380> back<00:01:46.409> and

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
from there okay so now we're back and

definitely a little whiter then the

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.760 
definitely a little whiter then the

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
incandescent bulb but it's not as white

incandescent bulb but it's not as white
as<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:34.950> CFL<00:02:35.610> or<00:02:35.850> it's<00:02:35.940> not<00:02:36.030> as<00:02:36.180> sterile<00:02:36.750> as<00:02:37.020> a

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
as a CFL or it's not as sterile as a

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.010 
as a CFL or it's not as sterile as a
fluorescent<00:02:37.800> might<00:02:38.280> be<00:02:38.550> it's<00:02:39.510> kind<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.900> good

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
fluorescent might be it's kind of a good

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.870 
fluorescent might be it's kind of a good
mix<00:02:40.260> it's<00:02:40.650> it's<00:02:40.890> actually<00:02:41.220> not<00:02:41.340> too<00:02:41.580> bad<00:02:41.610> at

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
mix it's it's actually not too bad at

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.840 
mix it's it's actually not too bad at
all<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.570> does<00:02:42.780> look<00:02:43.230> brighter<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:43.920> did<00:02:44.640> dump

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
all and it does look brighter I did dump

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.550 
all and it does look brighter I did dump
some<00:02:45.030> reading<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.540> found<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.940> CFLs

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
some reading and I found that the CFLs

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.600 
some reading and I found that the CFLs
kind<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.620> push<00:02:49.920> light<00:02:50.130> out<00:02:50.250> in<00:02:50.370> all<00:02:50.460> directions

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
kind of push light out in all directions

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.820 
kind of push light out in all directions
the<00:02:51.240> same<00:02:51.450> with<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.630> incandescent<00:02:51.900> but<00:02:52.740> the

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
the same with the incandescent but the

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.090 
the same with the incandescent but the
LED<00:02:53.130> light<00:02:53.670> is<00:02:53.880> much<00:02:54.120> more<00:02:54.300> concentrated<00:02:55.070> so<00:02:56.070> I

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
LED light is much more concentrated so I

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.290 
LED light is much more concentrated so I
don't<00:02:56.310> know<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.490> can<00:02:56.610> see<00:02:56.790> this<00:02:56.850> place<00:02:57.060> it's

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
don't know you can see this place it's

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.240 
don't know you can see this place it's
actually<00:02:57.630> a<00:02:57.660> little<00:02:57.870> bit<00:02:58.020> brighter<00:02:58.350> and<00:02:58.770> it

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
actually a little bit brighter and it

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.980 
actually a little bit brighter and it
kind<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.460> shoots<00:02:59.850> straight<00:03:00.180> out<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.810> ball

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
kind of shoots straight out of the ball

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.930 
kind of shoots straight out of the ball
as<00:03:01.230> opposed<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.650> off<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:01.980> sides<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.550> off<00:03:02.760> the

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
as opposed to off the sides and off the

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.140 
as opposed to off the sides and off the
back<00:03:03.290> so<00:03:04.290> there's<00:03:04.530> one<00:03:04.920> this<00:03:05.310> is<00:03:05.490> the<00:03:05.610> LED

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
back so there's one this is the LED

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.920 
back so there's one this is the LED
light<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:07.440> again<00:03:08.510> totally<00:03:09.510> cool<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.840> the

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
touch the the metal on the back does get

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.810 
touch the the metal on the back does get
a<00:03:12.870> little<00:03:13.020> bit<00:03:13.260> warm<00:03:13.470> but<00:03:14.100> totally<00:03:14.550> cool<00:03:14.700> to

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.920 
not too bad now a nice thing about LEDs
is<00:03:34.770> that<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:35.400> can<00:03:35.580> actually<00:03:35.790> dim<00:03:36.330> them<00:03:36.630> so

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
is that you can actually dim them so

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.380 
is that you can actually dim them so
here<00:03:37.110> goes<00:03:37.290> a<00:03:37.320> dimmer<00:03:39.650> here<00:03:40.850> and<00:03:41.850> you<00:03:41.970> can<00:03:42.150> see

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
here goes a dimmer here and you can see

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.050 
here goes a dimmer here and you can see
and<00:03:42.600> they<00:03:42.690> do<00:03:42.750> dim<00:03:43.320> down<00:03:43.620> a<00:03:43.650> fair<00:03:44.250> bet<00:03:44.610> let<00:03:44.970> me

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
and they do dim down a fair bet let me

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.320 
and they do dim down a fair bet let me
keep<00:03:45.240> going<00:03:46.130> before<00:03:47.130> they<00:03:47.550> actually<00:03:47.760> up<00:03:48.090> stay

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
keep going before they actually up stay

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.320 
keep going before they actually up stay
before<00:03:48.540> they<00:03:48.750> actually<00:03:49.140> shut<00:03:49.500> off<00:03:50.120> so<00:03:51.120> that's

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
before they actually shut off so that's

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.960 
before they actually shut off so that's
actually<00:03:51.720> a<00:03:51.750> pretty<00:03:51.959> good<00:03:52.200> dim<00:03:52.530> light<00:03:52.910> it's<00:03:53.910> a

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
actually a pretty good dim light it's a

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.570 
actually a pretty good dim light it's a
little<00:03:54.240> more<00:03:54.360> gray<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:54.690> little<00:03:55.050> more<00:03:55.170> white<00:03:55.580> but

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
little more gray a little more white but

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.220 
little more gray a little more white but
it's<00:03:56.730> not<00:03:56.910> too<00:03:57.060> bad<00:03:57.209> as<00:03:57.420> a<00:03:57.480> regular<00:03:57.840> dimmer<00:03:58.110> I

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
it's not too bad as a regular dimmer I

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.390 
it's not too bad as a regular dimmer I
just<00:03:58.560> plugged<00:03:58.860> in<00:03:59.040> there<00:03:59.220> it's<00:03:59.340> an

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
just plugged in there it's an

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.190 
just plugged in there it's an
incandescent<00:03:59.700> dimmer<00:04:00.209> on<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:00.450> walls<00:04:00.690> no<00:04:01.020> big

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
incandescent dimmer on the walls no big

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.790 
incandescent dimmer on the walls no big
deal<00:04:01.410> I<00:04:02.190> cannot<00:04:03.030> use<00:04:03.270> normally<00:04:03.840> you<00:04:03.930> CFLs<00:04:04.560> in

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
deal I cannot use normally you CFLs in

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.270 
deal I cannot use normally you CFLs in
this<00:04:04.950> dimmer<00:04:05.330> I<00:04:06.330> had<00:04:07.110> some<00:04:07.290> dimmable<00:04:07.650> CFLs

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
this dimmer I had some dimmable CFLs

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.650 
this dimmer I had some dimmable CFLs
that<00:04:08.459> I<00:04:08.490> put<00:04:08.790> in<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.209> they<00:04:09.270> just<00:04:09.420> kind<00:04:09.630> of

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
that I put in and they just kind of

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.940 
that I put in and they just kind of
flicker<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.110> it<00:04:10.200> just<00:04:10.380> didn't<00:04:10.620> work<00:04:10.650> real

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
flicker and it just didn't work real

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.680 
flicker and it just didn't work real
well<00:04:11.100> I<00:04:11.430> think<00:04:11.880> that's<00:04:12.120> just<00:04:12.240> kind<00:04:12.540> of<00:04:12.570> a

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
well I think that's just kind of a

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.930 
well I think that's just kind of a
drawback<00:04:12.900> of<00:04:13.110> CFLs<00:04:13.709> I<00:04:13.950> can<00:04:14.370> go<00:04:14.459> down<00:04:14.640> a<00:04:14.670> little

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
drawback of CFLs I can go down a little

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.390 
drawback of CFLs I can go down a little
further<00:04:15.350> it's<00:04:16.350> bad<00:04:16.530> that<00:04:16.770> one<00:04:16.920> finally<00:04:17.250> went

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
further it's bad that one finally went

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.670 
further it's bad that one finally went
off<00:04:17.459> there<00:04:17.670> we<00:04:17.760> go

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
off there we go

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.080 
off there we go
so<00:04:19.680> we're<00:04:19.859> about<00:04:20.840> that's<00:04:21.840> 75%<00:04:22.440> down<00:04:23.010> about<00:04:23.580> 25%

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
so we're about that's 75% down about 25%

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.780 
so we're about that's 75% down about 25%
brightness<00:04:24.750> here<00:04:24.840> you<00:04:25.050> can<00:04:25.200> see<00:04:25.669> one's<00:04:26.669> a

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
brightness here you can see one's a

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.000 
brightness here you can see one's a
little<00:04:26.940> this<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:28.050> LED<00:04:28.500> is<00:04:28.710> a<00:04:28.740> little

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
little this the the the LED is a little

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.510 
little this the the the LED is a little
darker<00:04:29.340> and

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
darker and

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.939 
darker and
than<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.449> incandescent<00:04:30.840> but<00:04:31.470> again<00:04:31.710> that's

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
than the incandescent but again that's

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.640 
than the incandescent but again that's
not<00:04:32.490> too<00:04:32.729> bad<00:04:32.910> just<00:04:33.780> kind<00:04:34.020> of<00:04:34.050> an<00:04:34.199> adjustable

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
not too bad just kind of an adjustable

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.020 
not too bad just kind of an adjustable
dim<00:04:34.860> there<00:04:36.979> and<00:04:37.979> I<00:04:38.220> can<00:04:38.400> bring<00:04:38.639> down<00:04:38.789> a<00:04:38.849> little

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
dim there and I can bring down a little

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.210 
dim there and I can bring down a little
more<00:04:39.240> I<00:04:39.300> shut<00:04:39.870> off<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.319> incandescent<00:04:40.800> still

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
more I shut off the incandescent still

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.670 
more I shut off the incandescent still
going<00:04:41.610> this<00:04:41.789> one's<00:04:42.000> not<00:04:42.180> but<00:04:43.139> I'll<00:04:43.289> kind<00:04:43.530> of

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
going this one's not but I'll kind of

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.719 
going this one's not but I'll kind of
bring<00:04:44.490> it<00:04:44.520> back<00:04:44.910> up<00:04:45.860> here<00:04:46.860> we<00:04:46.949> go<00:04:47.099> slowly

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
bring it back up here we go slowly

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:48.950 
bring it back up here we go slowly
getting<00:04:48.270> brighter<00:04:48.509> and<00:04:48.599> brighter<00:04:48.690> and

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
getting brighter and brighter and

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.409 
getting brighter and brighter and
brighter<00:04:49.460> I've<00:04:50.460> got<00:04:50.639> a<00:04:50.669> little<00:04:50.789> closer<00:04:51.090> to<00:04:51.330> the

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
brighter I've got a little closer to the

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.990 
brighter I've got a little closer to the
LED<00:04:51.840> but<00:04:52.080> both<00:04:52.289> are<00:04:52.530> fairly<00:04:53.039> bright<00:04:53.370> very

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
LED but both are fairly bright very

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.510 
LED but both are fairly bright very
consistent<00:04:54.509> zero<00:04:54.930> flicker<00:04:55.349> I<00:04:55.949> actually

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
consistent zero flicker I actually

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.710 
consistent zero flicker I actually
happen<00:04:56.759> to<00:04:56.910> be<00:04:57.000> one<00:04:57.120> of<00:04:57.210> those<00:04:57.300> people<00:04:57.479> who's

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
happen to be one of those people who's

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.100 
happen to be one of those people who's
become<00:04:57.960> very<00:04:58.319> sensitive<00:04:59.280> to<00:04:59.699> the<00:04:59.819> CFL<00:05:00.780> flicker

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
become very sensitive to the CFL flicker

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.450 
become very sensitive to the CFL flicker
of<00:05:01.259> Christmas<00:05:01.800> lights<00:05:02.039> and<00:05:02.340> other

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
of Christmas lights and other

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.550 
of Christmas lights and other
fluorescent<00:05:03.150> lighting<00:05:03.330> and<00:05:03.690> there's<00:05:04.110> no

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
fluorescent lighting and there's no

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.010 
fluorescent lighting and there's no
flicker<00:05:04.889> at<00:05:05.039> all<00:05:05.159> of<00:05:05.310> these<00:05:05.430> LEDs<00:05:06.020> it's

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
flicker at all of these LEDs it's

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.800 
flicker at all of these LEDs it's
actually<00:05:07.349> a<00:05:07.380> very<00:05:07.650> nice<00:05:08.069> light<00:05:08.490> and<00:05:08.909> I<00:05:09.479> think

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
actually a very nice light and I think

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.570 
actually a very nice light and I think
I'm<00:05:09.990> probably<00:05:10.560> end<00:05:10.919> up<00:05:10.979> buying<00:05:11.159> a<00:05:11.280> whole<00:05:11.400> bunch

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
I'm probably end up buying a whole bunch

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.640 
I'm probably end up buying a whole bunch
more<00:05:11.669> be<00:05:12.150> honest<00:05:12.360> with<00:05:12.509> you<00:05:12.659> oh<00:05:12.780> my<00:05:12.930> god<00:05:13.169> I<00:05:13.199> pick

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
more be honest with you oh my god I pick

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.589 
more be honest with you oh my god I pick
up<00:05:13.770> some<00:05:13.919> more<00:05:14.099> and<00:05:14.130> I'll<00:05:14.280> slowly<00:05:14.580> replace<00:05:15.330> my

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:15.599 
up some more and I'll slowly replace my

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:18.409 
up some more and I'll slowly replace my
CFLs<00:05:16.199> and<00:05:16.530> my<00:05:16.740> incandescent<00:05:17.099> with<00:05:17.490> LED<00:05:18.180> lights

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
CFLs and my incandescent with LED lights

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.280 
CFLs and my incandescent with LED lights
because<00:05:18.659> they<00:05:18.750> really<00:05:19.080> are<00:05:19.110> pretty<00:05:20.099> nice
