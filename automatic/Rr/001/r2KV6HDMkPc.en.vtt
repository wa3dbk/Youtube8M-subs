00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.679
 league 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.180
 what is the biggest challenge 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.800
 yes there are at this summer theater 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.410
 several challenges 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.809
 there is one thing that is for her three 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.030
 have very different venues 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.030
 here in the courtyard in neuzelle in the 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:42.589
 church in beeskow and on the island in 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.949
 frankfurt and the conditions under 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:47.390
 we play there are always total 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.970
 different now we do it 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.129
 it would work out here in neuzelle 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.379
 and then you can transfer that 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.930
 but we also want it everywhere 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.329
 really nice ideas there despite 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.550
 of all difference and the second 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.320
 challenge big challenge 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.920
 are the temperatures at the moment 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:10.490
 it's not that singer 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.810
 so insane early use their voice 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.869
 can the mood really be 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.700
 rested and is and have time 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.950
 to really wake up 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.350
 That's why theater rehearsals actually start 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.729
 not before ten o'clock in the morning at the moment 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.710
 we are because of the temperatures 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.759
 forced at 8 o'clock in the morning at the latest 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.720
 to begin 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.720
 It is a big challenge 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.290
 what fun 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.820
 what because the audience expects this 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.870
 year among the people summer so would be in 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.610
 This year again a very nice one 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.190
 program we have an opera one 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.500
 real discovery is albert lortzings 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.119
 casanova rarely played one 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.009
 socially critical oberhausen 19 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.430
 century therefore also on the stages 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.500
 not recorded in the 19th century 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.450
 Unfortunately there is no printed version 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.740
 So we have the handwriting from the 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.870
 Bavarian State Library here 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.360
 used to make this fit 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.850
 but otherwise musically also from the text 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.060
 beautiful here we offer and 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.000
 Of course we have in Beeskow 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.860
 in other stage and on the island 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.930
 I'll go to Frankfurt or more 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.080
 events such as the opera gala a 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.600
 barn or niederamt still exists 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.040

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.840

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.750
