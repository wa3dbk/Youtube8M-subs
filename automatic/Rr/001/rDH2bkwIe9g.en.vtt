00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.820
 applied to cumin try to deepen 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.950
 in the psychology of the character in that 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.559
 connection of the character with his own 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.480
 world with the society that manages with 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.600

 with him with the character we are a 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.400
 industrial product the superhero is not 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.170
 it is a personal comic as when 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.309
 you bond with him but above all a 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.500
 product that is aimed at an audience 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.140

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.330
 you have to assume that that product has 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.830
 some cultural keys that people who 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.040

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:10.210
 recognize it stanley creates precisely 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.979
 that is a pantheon of lay gods 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.260
 that do not respond to a religion 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.770
 established and that is the great popularity 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.800
 that the marvel universe has had 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.750
 I focused my life on every increase by 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.280
 courses that had nothing to do with 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.619
 the cartoon in no time I 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.450
 I thought I had a professional approach 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.399
 marvel saw what I was doing they called me 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.080
 the British edition I had a year with 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:36.070
 them and a year plus the good marvel 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.600
 let's say it like that the black legs 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.540
 they called they saw what I was doing with 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.310
 them and they called me to work 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.929

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.830
