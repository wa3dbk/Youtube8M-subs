kind of mix it around yeah now you can
take<00:01:16.750> your<00:01:16.960> clip<00:01:17.170> and<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:19.150> can<00:01:19.330> scrape<00:01:19.660> all

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
take your clip and you can scrape all

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.760 
take your clip and you can scrape all
the<00:01:21.300> Browns<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:24.960> won't<00:01:25.960> no<00:01:26.110> more<00:01:26.290> flour<00:01:26.560> than

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.730 
that so that it stays a bit bubbly now
the<00:01:34.090> thing<00:01:34.450> is<00:01:34.479> to<00:01:34.810> cook<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.170> flour<00:01:35.410> until

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
the thing is to cook the flour until

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.670 
the thing is to cook the flour until
it's<00:01:36.010> done<00:01:36.280> because<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:37.240> flour<00:01:37.510> has<00:01:38.260> a<00:01:38.290> raw

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
it's done because the flour has a raw

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.800 
it's done because the flour has a raw
taste<00:01:39.040> they<00:01:39.760> usually<00:01:39.910> say<00:01:40.210> cook<00:01:40.420> it<00:01:40.570> for<00:01:40.690> about

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
taste they usually say cook it for about

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.170 
taste they usually say cook it for about
two<00:01:41.200> minutes<00:01:41.380> and<00:01:41.830> then<00:01:41.890> I<00:01:42.369> like<00:01:42.610> to<00:01:42.640> cook<00:01:42.880> this

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
two minutes and then I like to cook this

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.450 
two minutes and then I like to cook this
for<00:01:43.570> just<00:01:43.690> a<00:01:43.869> little<00:01:44.110> bit<00:01:44.229> longer<00:01:44.530> until<00:01:44.830> it

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
for just a little bit longer until it

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.560 
for just a little bit longer until it
starts<00:01:45.850> to<00:01:46.170> get<00:01:47.170> just<00:01:47.470> a<00:01:47.590> little<00:01:47.619> bit<00:01:48.369> of<00:01:49.210> color

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
starts to get just a little bit of color

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.859 
starts to get just a little bit of color
on<00:01:49.900> it<00:01:50.110> now<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.040> more<00:01:51.369> you<00:01:51.400> cook<00:01:51.880> it<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.630> less

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
on it now the more you cook it the less

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.170 
on it now the more you cook it the less
it<00:01:53.320> will<00:01:54.100> absorb<00:01:54.940> liquid<00:01:55.570> and<00:01:55.990> and<00:01:56.670> think<00:01:57.670> of<00:01:57.820> a

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
it will absorb liquid and and think of a

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.210 
it will absorb liquid and and think of a
gravy<00:01:58.690> okay<00:01:59.200> so<00:01:59.259> if<00:01:59.530> you<00:01:59.590> cooked<00:01:59.800> it<00:01:59.890> too<00:02:00.040> much

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
gravy okay so if you cooked it too much

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.380
