I<00:00:23.699> mean<00:00:24.150> too<00:00:24.300> easy<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:24.779> they<00:00:25.109> try<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.350> make<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.560> a

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
I mean too easy so they try to make it a

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.339 
I mean too easy so they try to make it a
little<00:00:26.189> bit<00:00:26.340> harder<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.910> then<00:00:26.939> there<00:00:27.900> they're

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
little bit harder and then there they're

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.519 
little bit harder and then there they're
fixed<00:00:28.769> an<00:00:28.859> issue<00:00:28.980> with<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.580> punt<00:00:29.880> returner

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
moving when he called the fair catch I

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.970 
moving when he called the fair catch I
have<00:00:33.239> never<00:00:33.450> seen<00:00:33.960> anything<00:00:34.230> like<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.530> and

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
have never seen anything like that and

with<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> lime<00:00:41.309> in<00:00:41.340> which<00:00:41.640> i<00:00:41.879> don't<00:00:42.149> really

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
with the lime in which i don't really

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.959 
with the lime in which i don't really
rush<00:00:42.809> for<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:42.989> lyman<00:00:43.379> too<00:00:43.500> much<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.550> all

striking or whatnot on defense and then

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.270 
striking or whatnot on defense and then
also<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.360> can't<00:01:06.840> stack<00:01:07.140> your<00:01:07.320> player<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.220> you

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
also you can't stack your player so you

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.240 
also you can't stack your player so you
can't<00:01:08.700> get<00:01:08.850> um<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.600> lot<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.560> nanos<00:01:10.830> are<00:01:10.979> kind<00:01:11.189> of

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
can't get um a lot of nanos are kind of

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.950 
can't get um a lot of nanos are kind of
hard<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.549> come<00:01:11.790> by<00:01:11.939> this<00:01:12.000> year<00:01:12.390> it's

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
hard to come by this year it's

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.780 
hard to come by this year it's
definitely<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:14.040> definitely<00:01:14.250> still

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
definitely it's definitely still

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.590 
definitely it's definitely still
possible<00:01:15.360> but<00:01:16.400> with<00:01:17.400> how<00:01:17.549> bad<00:01:17.790> coverage<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.420> on

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
possible but with how bad coverage is on

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.990 
possible but with how bad coverage is on
the<00:01:18.689> back<00:01:18.900> end<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:19.860> almost<00:01:20.490> not<00:01:20.670> worth

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the back end it's it's almost not worth

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.170 
the back end it's it's almost not worth
it<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.479> send<00:01:21.689> six<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.560> have<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.580> double<00:01:24.030> like

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
it to send six and have a double like

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.270 
it to send six and have a double like
edge<00:01:24.360> pressure<00:01:24.659> for<00:01:24.960> example<00:01:25.380> because<00:01:25.680> it's

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
edge pressure for example because it's

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.640 
edge pressure for example because it's
just<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:26.610> easy<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.970> tear<00:01:27.180> up<00:01:27.360> even<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:28.170> main

just so easy to tear up even just main

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.249 
just so easy to tear up even just main
