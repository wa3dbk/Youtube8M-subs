00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.670 
forward to halo 4 this year so another
thing<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:47.939> really<00:01:48.509> awesome<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:49.200> being

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
thing that is really awesome is being

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.580 
thing that is really awesome is being
able<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.009> fly<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> pelican<00:01:51.030> inhale<00:01:51.479> for<00:01:51.869> most<00:01:52.439> of

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
able to fly a pelican inhale for most of

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.440 
able to fly a pelican inhale for most of
you<00:01:52.770> didn't<00:01:53.130> know<00:01:53.220> about<00:01:53.549> this<00:01:53.880> already<00:01:54.090> but

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
you didn't know about this already but

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.940 
you didn't know about this already but
here<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.869> can<00:01:54.899> see<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:55.409> screen<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.649> got

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
here you can see on this screen you got

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.550 
here you can see on this screen you got
some<00:01:56.280> footage<00:01:56.490> there<00:01:56.970> and<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:58.079> really<00:01:58.350> cool

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
some footage there and it's really cool

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.139 
some footage there and it's really cool
I'm<00:01:58.920> guessing<00:01:59.250> it's<00:01:59.399> gonna<00:01:59.549> be<00:01:59.759> really

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
I'm guessing it's gonna be really

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.109 
I'm guessing it's gonna be really
awesome<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:01.170> appears<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.799> for<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.610> Pelican

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
awesome it appears that for the Pelican

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.990 
awesome it appears that for the Pelican
it<00:02:03.270> fires<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:04.049> laser<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:05.520> that's<00:02:05.700> something

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
it fires a laser so that's something

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.419 
it fires a laser so that's something
that's<00:02:06.240> pretty<00:02:06.600> cool<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.200> new<00:02:07.229> addition<00:02:07.860> to

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
that's pretty cool and a new addition to

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.819 
that's pretty cool and a new addition to
UM<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:09.269> halo<00:02:09.420> 4<00:02:09.690> instead<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:10.019> firing<00:02:10.229> rockets

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:10.829 
UM to halo 4 instead of firing rockets

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.340 
UM to halo 4 instead of firing rockets
so<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.430> don't<00:02:11.820> think<00:02:12.000> that's<00:02:12.150> big<00:02:12.720> deal<00:02:13.049> though

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
so I don't think that's big deal though

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.369 
so I don't think that's big deal though
but<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.709> think<00:02:14.040> it'll<00:02:14.549> do<00:02:14.700> just<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:15.060> same<00:02:15.379> of

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
but I think it'll do just the same of

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.070 
but I think it'll do just the same of
damage<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.550> for<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.270> last<00:02:18.300> thing<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:18.810> ought

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
damage so for the last thing that ought

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.930 
damage so for the last thing that ought
to<00:02:19.110> say<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.680> on<00:02:19.950> this<00:02:20.160> bar<00:02:20.400> knobs

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
to say is on this bar knobs

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.090 
to say is on this bar knobs

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
guy so I'm gonna have that in there for

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.040 
guy so I'm gonna have that in there for
secondary<00:04:54.400> weapon<00:04:54.760> who<00:04:54.970> I'm<00:04:55.270> guessing<00:04:55.720> the

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
secondary weapon who I'm guessing the

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.910 
secondary weapon who I'm guessing the
Magnum<00:04:56.500> and<00:04:57.300> then<00:04:58.300> for<00:04:58.630> support<00:04:59.170> upgrades<00:04:59.680> I

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
Magnum and then for support upgrades I

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.520 
Magnum and then for support upgrades I
think<00:05:00.280> I'll<00:05:00.460> take<00:05:00.790> either<00:05:01.390> dexterity<00:05:02.230> which

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
think I'll take either dexterity which

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.520 
think I'll take either dexterity which
is<00:05:02.740> fast<00:05:03.340> reload<00:05:03.790> or<00:05:04.150> ammo<00:05:04.450> and<00:05:04.870> for<00:05:05.440> that

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
is fast reload or ammo and for that

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.190 
is fast reload or ammo and for that
stuff<00:05:05.950> i<00:05:06.100> don't<00:05:06.130> remember<00:05:06.750> that<00:05:07.750> i'll<00:05:07.900> choose

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
stuff i don't remember that i'll choose

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.900 
stuff i don't remember that i'll choose
later<00:05:08.440> on<00:05:08.710> but<00:05:08.920> for<00:05:08.980> now<00:05:09.130> this<00:05:09.370> is<00:05:09.520> what<00:05:09.760> i<00:05:09.790> know

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
later on but for now this is what i know

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.510 
later on but for now this is what i know

with it you know my answer to this okay
so<00:05:31.810> basically<00:05:32.940> I'm<00:05:33.940> thinking<00:05:34.300> about<00:05:34.330> picking

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
so basically I'm thinking about picking

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.520 
so basically I'm thinking about picking
up<00:05:35.220> the<00:05:36.220> hill<00:05:36.340> for<00:05:36.550> sniper<00:05:36.880> sniper<00:05:37.660> rifle<00:05:38.260> from

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
up the hill for sniper sniper rifle from

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.910 
up the hill for sniper sniper rifle from
the<00:05:38.560> UNSC<00:05:39.400> said<00:05:39.700> that<00:05:40.060> or<00:05:40.450> the<00:05:41.110> binary<00:05:41.560> rifle

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:41.920 
the UNSC said that or the binary rifle

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.690 
the UNSC said that or the binary rifle
both<00:05:42.160> those<00:05:42.460> are<00:05:42.790> really<00:05:43.000> cool<00:05:43.330> and<00:05:43.600> about

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
both those are really cool and about

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.120 
both those are really cool and about
what<00:05:45.700> why<00:05:46.600> would<00:05:46.900> I<00:05:47.200> pick<00:05:47.440> those<00:05:47.770> are

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
what why would I pick those are

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.650 
what why would I pick those are
basically<00:05:48.610> I<00:05:48.700> think<00:05:49.000> that<00:05:49.150> they're<00:05:49.360> really

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
basically I think that they're really

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.380 
basically I think that they're really
cool<00:05:49.900> I<00:05:50.200> think<00:05:51.010> you're<00:05:51.130> the<00:05:51.280> best<00:05:51.580> weapons<00:05:52.060> so

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
cool I think you're the best weapons so

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.150 
cool I think you're the best weapons so
far<00:05:52.690> in<00:05:52.780> here<00:05:52.930> for<00:05:53.170> I<00:05:53.200> mean<00:05:53.410> that's<00:05:53.560> just<00:05:53.950> my

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
far in here for I mean that's just my

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.370 
far in here for I mean that's just my
opinion<00:05:54.190> because<00:05:54.700> I'm<00:05:54.940> a<00:05:54.970> sniper<00:05:55.360> and<00:05:55.720> you

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
opinion because I'm a sniper and you

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.080 
opinion because I'm a sniper and you
know<00:05:56.500> they're<00:05:56.710> really<00:05:57.100> quietly<00:05:57.490> like<00:05:57.820> them
