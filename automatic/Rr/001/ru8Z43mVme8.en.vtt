Alice<00:02:17.490> in<00:02:17.580> Wonderland<00:02:18.090> Wizard<00:02:18.600> of<00:02:18.720> Oz<00:02:18.870> but

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
Alice in Wonderland Wizard of Oz but

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.560 
Alice in Wonderland Wizard of Oz but
totally<00:02:20.010> different<00:02:20.040> at<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:20.520> same<00:02:20.760> time<00:02:21.000> this

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
totally different at the same time this

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.750 
totally different at the same time this
one<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:21.870> quite<00:02:22.230> creepy<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.950> disturbing<00:02:23.490> as

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
one is quite creepy and disturbing as

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.480 
one is quite creepy and disturbing as
often<00:02:24.360> Neil<00:02:24.630> Gaiman's<00:02:24.840> books<00:02:25.500> are<00:02:25.830> but<00:02:26.370> it

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
often Neil Gaiman's books are but it

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.550 
often Neil Gaiman's books are but it
really<00:02:26.790> lets<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.630> think<00:02:27.960> about<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.380> way<00:02:28.530> we

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
really lets you think about the way we

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.800 
really lets you think about the way we
overlook<00:02:29.280> homeless<00:02:29.790> people<00:02:30.240> like<00:02:30.600> they're

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
overlook homeless people like they're

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.020 
overlook homeless people like they're
invisible<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.590> us<00:02:31.740> we<00:02:32.220> might<00:02:32.400> see<00:02:32.610> them<00:02:32.760> one

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
invisible to us we might see them one

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.790 
invisible to us we might see them one
minute<00:02:33.390> but<00:02:33.570> then<00:02:33.720> have<00:02:34.050> forgotten<00:02:34.710> about

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
minute but then have forgotten about

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.530 
minute but then have forgotten about
them<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.340> next<00:02:35.520> so<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:35.910> think<00:02:36.060> it's<00:02:36.300> really

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
them the next so I think it's really

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.760 
them the next so I think it's really
meaningful<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:37.260> really<00:02:37.470> makes<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.710> think

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
meaningful it really makes you think

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.070 
meaningful it really makes you think
about<00:02:38.100> how<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.430> treat<00:02:38.790> people<00:02:38.820> and<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:39.900> makes

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
about how you treat people and it makes

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.230 
about how you treat people and it makes
you<00:02:40.200> think<00:02:40.380> about<00:02:40.500> homeless<00:02:41.370> people<00:02:41.400> in<00:02:42.060> a

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
you think about homeless people in a

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.360 
you think about homeless people in a
different<00:02:42.600> way<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.080> just<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:43.620> reminds<00:02:44.280> you

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
different way and just that reminds you

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.920 
different way and just that reminds you
that<00:02:44.430> there<00:02:44.730> are<00:02:44.820> people<00:02:44.850> to<00:02:45.360> their<00:02:45.750> own

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
that there are people to their own

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.170 
that there are people to their own
stories<00:02:45.960> and<00:02:46.620> they<00:02:47.520> weren't<00:02:47.730> always<00:02:48.000> like

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
stories and they weren't always like

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.330 
stories and they weren't always like
this<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.990> I<00:02:49.050> just<00:02:49.260> think<00:02:49.590> it's<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:50.010> really<00:02:50.190> good

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
this and I just think it's a really good

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.640 
this and I just think it's a really good
book<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:51.300> read<00:02:51.420> just<00:02:51.870> for<00:02:52.080> that<00:02:52.110> reason<00:02:52.230> alone

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
book to read just for that reason alone

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.760 
book to read just for that reason alone
so<00:02:53.400> read<00:02:53.760> it<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.690> next<00:02:54.930> book<00:02:55.080> I<00:02:55.230> read<00:02:55.470> after

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
so read it the next book I read after

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.250 
so read it the next book I read after

third one for me because I kind of feel
like<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:27.720> figured<00:03:28.140> out<00:03:28.320> a<00:03:28.590> little<00:03:28.860> bit<00:03:29.130> of

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
like I figured out a little bit of

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.460 
like I figured out a little bit of
what's<00:03:29.880> going<00:03:30.090> on<00:03:30.390> just<00:03:31.080> because<00:03:31.320> of<00:03:31.440> the

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
what's going on just because of the

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.020 
what's going on just because of the
names<00:03:31.770> they're<00:03:32.190> not<00:03:32.340> like<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.580> main<00:03:32.760> part<00:03:33.000> of

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
names they're not like the main part of

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.280

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
the story but I think they're really

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.710 
the story but I think they're really
significant<00:03:35.250> especially<00:03:35.640> if<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.150> remember

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720
