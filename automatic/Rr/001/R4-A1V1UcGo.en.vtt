00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.240
Hello, everyone. I'm Asahi.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:13.840
Today I'll make smoky eye with products which were nominated for VOGUE JAPAN Beauty award 2014.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:18.399
I'm gonna tell you how I felt.

00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:20.579
Please watch this video to the end.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.880
I started up by applied &nbsp;primer.&nbsp;

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.760
At first, applied RMK creamy foundation N to your forehead, cheeks, nose, and the tip of your chin and spread it with a gentle massaging motion.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.620
You can spread it with small amount of it in spite of creamy foundation.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.460
Make your skin firm and elastic.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.260
Keep moist skin because of Argan oil and Shea butter.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.980
It's good for autumn and winter.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.500
Use MAC ProLong Wear Concealer to cover dark circles under your eyes and dullness of eyelid.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.440
And get rid of excess oil, fit the foundation in your skin.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.460
I'm gonna use Cover Mark Silky Loose Powder&nbsp;

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:16.400
Light powder makes your skin silky and small pearl gives you elastic and elegant skin.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.960
To shape the eyebrow, use my favorite Shu uemura's pencil and single eyeshadow Mascara of bobbibrown.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.300
Apply GIVENCHY OMBRE COUTURE to entire eyelid area and at the corner of lower eyelid.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.680
This is a cream eyeshadow,but after spread it,It'll transform to powder.&nbsp;

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.500
It was &nbsp;good for fitting in my skin and durability.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.000
I used it for the base of smoky eye because the color get mat finish.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.860
There are three texture like mat, satin and pearly, it's depend on the color.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.000
It's &nbsp;not only for eyeshadow, but good for blush, eyeliner and eye shadow base.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.880
I wanna try in many ways.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.000
To create eye shadows, take up CHANEL Les 4 Ombres No.202

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.883
I think this is improvement on the texture softly and it has bright colored

00:02:09.883 --> 00:02:11.923
It became my best because of satin finish.&nbsp;

00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:16.000
Apply the pink color to entire eyelid, and winter color to at the corner of your eyes.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
To make chiseled face, apply the brown color around the eye hole.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.520
To fit in your skin, blend the shadow by winter color with a brush

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.260
It's easy to make smoky eye because of cream eyeshadow.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:43.000
Before draw lower eye shdow, Use Bobbibrown Perfectly Defined Gel eyeliner Pitch Black and draw a longer line along the water line.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
This is a pencil type of popular Gel eyeliner.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.820
There is no burden on your eyelid and easy to draw because of soft texture.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.300
Shade off the color of lower lash liner with brown color.&nbsp;

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.600
Create a gradient with winter color.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.100
Highlight &nbsp;the Inner corner &nbsp;and eyebrow to make a three-dimension.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.420
I'm gonna use GIVENCHY NOIR COUTURE VOLUME MASCARA

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.000
Before apply it, create the base with KATE LASH MAXIMIZER.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:21.000
The reason why I used it is it's not enough for me to keep the beautiful curves and give the volume.&nbsp;

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.999
Gave me a dense popping eyelashes.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.999
Use BENEFIT SugarBomb for cheeks and shading.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Take up NARS Audacious Lipsthick Silvia

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.260
I was able to draw the shape and it was semi-mat and creamy finish .

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.500
It fit in my lips and the color durability was also very good.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.000

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
