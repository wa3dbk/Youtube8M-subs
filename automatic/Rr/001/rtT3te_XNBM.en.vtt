episode<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.500> about<00:00:16.640> what<00:00:17.640> happens<00:00:18.029> when<00:00:18.210> you

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
episode is about what happens when you

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.140 
episode is about what happens when you
encounter<00:00:18.900> an<00:00:19.050> RV<00:00:19.500> with<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.800> hot<00:00:20.130> skin<00:00:20.550> problem

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
encounter an RV with a hot skin problem

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.929 
encounter an RV with a hot skin problem
so<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:21.900> see<00:00:22.199> here<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.560> have<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.310> little<00:00:23.460> VW

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
so you see here I have a little VW

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.929 
so you see here I have a little VW
Microbus<00:00:24.300> model<00:00:25.170> it's<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.470> diecast<00:00:26.279> model<00:00:26.789> it's

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
Microbus model it's a diecast model it's

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.150 
Microbus model it's a diecast model it's
all<00:00:27.090> metal<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:28.199> have<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.380> ground<00:00:28.710> plane<00:00:28.980> in

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
all metal and I have a ground plane in

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.550 
all metal and I have a ground plane in
the<00:00:29.250> front<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.910> have<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> way<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:31.080> energize

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
the front and I have a way to energize

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.190 
the front and I have a way to energize
the<00:00:31.890> body<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.369> simulate<00:00:32.820> what<00:00:33.030> happens<00:00:33.059> if<00:00:33.840> you

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
the body to simulate what happens if you

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.709 
the body to simulate what happens if you
have<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.410> hot<00:00:34.739> skin<00:00:35.040> problem<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:36.270> let's<00:00:36.540> go

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
have a hot skin problem so let's go

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.869 
have a hot skin problem so let's go
ahead<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.380> turn<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.860> voltage<00:00:38.219> up<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.520> about

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
ahead and turn the voltage up to about

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.220 
ahead and turn the voltage up to about
60<00:00:39.480> volts<00:00:39.780> or<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.760> typical

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
60 volts or so and this is a typical

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.720 
60 volts or so and this is a typical
level<00:00:43.230> voltage<00:00:43.440> as<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:44.010> might<00:00:44.190> encounter<00:00:44.489> if

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
level voltage as you might encounter if

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.930 
level voltage as you might encounter if
you<00:00:44.789> have<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> broken<00:00:45.480> ground<00:00:45.600> wire<00:00:46.940> we're

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
you have a broken ground wire we're

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.209 
you have a broken ground wire we're
using<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.329> little<00:00:48.539> flute<00:00:48.989> volt<00:00:49.260> alert<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:50.010> tell

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
using a little flute volt alert to tell

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.670 
using a little flute volt alert to tell
us<00:00:50.399> whether<00:00:50.610> or<00:00:50.760> not<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.329> skin<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.289> RV<00:00:52.559> is

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
us whether or not the skin of the RV is

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.619 
us whether or not the skin of the RV is
dangerous<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.000> can<00:00:54.180> see<00:00:54.420> when<00:00:54.600> I

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
dangerous so you can see when I

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.220 
dangerous so you can see when I
approached<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.320> RV<00:00:55.789> it<00:00:56.789> tells<00:00:57.180> me<00:00:57.510> by<00:00:57.750> beeping

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
approached the RV it tells me by beeping

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.290 
approached the RV it tells me by beeping
that<00:00:58.739> there<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.129> dangerous<00:00:59.789> hot<00:01:00.000> skin

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
that there is a dangerous hot skin

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.479 
that there is a dangerous hot skin
condition<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.379> do<00:01:01.530> not<00:01:01.680> want<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.039> proceed

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
condition and you do not want to proceed

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.740 
condition and you do not want to proceed
to<00:01:02.760> touch<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:04.250> here<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.460> built<00:01:05.850> flash

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
to touch it so here I have built flash

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.530 
to touch it so here I have built flash
no<00:01:07.590> he's<00:01:07.770> not<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.979> doll<00:01:08.250> he's<00:01:08.640> an<00:01:08.790> action<00:01:09.270> figure

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
no he's not a doll he's an action figure

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.039 
no he's not a doll he's an action figure
and<00:01:09.869> yes<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.920> flash<00:01:11.280> bulb<00:01:11.580> for<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> head

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
and yes that is a flash bulb for a head

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.630 
and yes that is a flash bulb for a head
flash<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.260> going<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.500> show<00:01:13.680> what<00:01:13.920> happens<00:01:14.369> when

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
flash is going to show what happens when

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.630 
flash is going to show what happens when
you<00:01:14.760> touch<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.180> RV<00:01:15.590> so<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:16.830> see<00:01:17.130> he's

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
you touch the RV so you can see he's

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.520 
you touch the RV so you can see he's
walking<00:01:18.150> around<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.509> outer<00:01:18.659> part<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.140> RV

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
walking around the outer part of the RV

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.620 
walking around the outer part of the RV
even<00:01:19.920> though<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.130> RV<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.549> energized<00:01:21.030> there's

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
even though the RV is energized there's

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.600 
even though the RV is energized there's
nothing<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.140> give<00:01:22.290> them<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.500> hint<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:23.040> it's

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
nothing to give them a hint that it's

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.929 
nothing to give them a hint that it's
dangerous<00:01:24.150> if<00:01:25.140> his<00:01:25.439> one<00:01:25.680> foot<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.369> off<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
dangerous if his one foot is off the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.640 
dangerous if his one foot is off the
ground<00:01:27.180> if<00:01:27.360> he<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.479> only<00:01:27.689> touching<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.290> RV

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
ground if he is only touching the RV

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.560 
ground if he is only touching the RV
itself<00:01:29.100> there's<00:01:29.610> no<00:01:29.850> current<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.390> flows

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
itself there's no current that flows

itself there's no current that flows
through<00:01:30.720> his<00:01:31.020> heart<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.530> everything<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.579> okay

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
through his heart and everything is okay

he's touching the body of the RV and

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.260 
he's touching the body of the RV and
this<00:01:34.590> would<00:01:34.770> simulate<00:01:35.040> if<00:01:35.490> you're<00:01:35.850> inside<00:01:36.210> of

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
this would simulate if you're inside of

the RV touching metal nothing's going to
happen

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840
