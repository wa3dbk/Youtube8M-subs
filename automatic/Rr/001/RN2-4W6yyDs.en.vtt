was hungry in the afternoon but then i

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.060 
was hungry in the afternoon but then i
remembered<00:04:52.120> that<00:04:52.300> i<00:04:52.810> still<00:04:53.350> had<00:04:53.560> you<00:04:53.979> know

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
remembered that i still had you know

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.219 
remembered that i still had you know
like<00:04:54.220> one<00:04:54.610> of<00:04:54.639> the<00:04:54.850> snacks<00:04:55.150> like<00:04:55.660> a<00:04:55.720> boiled<00:04:56.139> egg

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
like one of the snacks like a boiled egg

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.469 
like one of the snacks like a boiled egg
or<00:04:56.440> something<00:04:56.560> that<00:04:56.979> i<00:04:57.039> hadn't<00:04:57.310> eaten<00:04:57.490> and<00:04:57.850> so

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.510 
or something that i hadn't eaten and so
i<00:04:58.840> think<00:04:58.930> some<00:04:59.380> of<00:04:59.410> it<00:04:59.590> is<00:04:59.650> just<00:04:59.889> remembering

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
i think some of it is just remembering

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.980 
i think some of it is just remembering
to<00:05:00.970> make<00:05:01.120> sure<00:05:01.300> you<00:05:01.449> get<00:05:01.600> some<00:05:01.840> of<00:05:01.930> these

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
little containers in there because some

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.070 
little containers in there because some
of<00:05:03.669> these<00:05:03.789> are<00:05:04.000> like<00:05:04.120> the<00:05:04.150> healthy<00:05:04.570> fats<00:05:04.840> that

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
of these are like the healthy fats that

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.110 
of these are like the healthy fats that
you<00:05:05.289> can<00:05:05.410> have<00:05:05.590> like<00:05:05.860> avocado<00:05:06.490> that<00:05:06.910> kind<00:05:07.090> of

you can have like avocado that kind of

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.700 
you can have like avocado that kind of
thing<00:05:07.300> so<00:05:07.810> gotta<00:05:07.960> make<00:05:08.020> sure<00:05:08.139> that<00:05:08.470> you<00:05:08.530> got

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
hungry and then my other strategy is

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.870 
hungry and then my other strategy is
that<00:05:13.360> if<00:05:13.539> I<00:05:13.690> really<00:05:14.110> feel<00:05:15.070> like<00:05:15.100> I'm<00:05:15.430> too

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.500 
that if I really feel like I'm too
hungry<00:05:16.090> and<00:05:16.630> need<00:05:17.080> something<00:05:17.410> then<00:05:18.130> my<00:05:18.970> rescue
