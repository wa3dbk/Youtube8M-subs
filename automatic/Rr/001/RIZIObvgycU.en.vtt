00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.750
 and so hi to all his hawks m and 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.649
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:11.010
 new video on lego or world one so 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.509
 it was a new lego game that comes from 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.920
 out is in fact that is that it has 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.750
 especially because already good games 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.510
 lego me I'm not a big fan in 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.160
 done but this one there looks very 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.410
 promising simply because it 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.289
 will try to compete with minecraft in 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.599
 done since it's a game that's like 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.840
 open world construction minecraft 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.710
 with a rather huge universe of 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.300
 construction possibilities 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.100
 extraordinary and here's a big 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.750
 customization so the game is announced 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.489
 very very promising resort you go 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.540
 see in the trailer in the background is enough 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.850
 huge 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.320
 so there it is finally available in access 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.120
 anticipated so be careful 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.649
 since the game is not finished 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.890
 early access so always have to 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.289
 be wary a little but already the game is too 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.670
 well what finally it's really huge 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.810
 so at the level of low qualities like 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.290
 I really said 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.700
 a territory to explore immense 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.470
 a lot of good on two characters 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.190
 and just like in the Lego universes of 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.840
 that is cool 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.310
 and then of course after seeing that they have 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.870
 all licenses there may be 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.610
 Lord of the Rings characters 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.130
 star world characters 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.480
 so it's really cool what 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.310
 because they have the rights what 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.220
 compared to malta has in minecraft you 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.970
 create the stuff you already have 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:31.590
 pretty cool set of things available 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.590
 two creative possibilities 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.220
 there is also a system of editing the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.270
 world actually that is different in the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.100
 coma neither late i take my mistakes I 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.290
 suppose cubes there you can 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.080
 select an entire area in fact like 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.090
 in a little software and increase the 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.860
 ground level lower the level of the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.799
 terrain remove added 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.000
 so it's a lot more complete at 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.850
 much more editing level 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.680
 practice and then especially the game costs 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.930
 not very expensive so it's for 15 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.409
 dollars it is available on steam so 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.039
 for 15 euros what and it's really fun 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.780
 it's really cool 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.190
 on the other hand at the level of the countries well 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.390
 the graphics are not for now 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.580
 not very crazy 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.810
 so that I hope they will improve 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.670
 thereafter is low and early 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.080
 access what then the game is not over 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.209
 so we can not still have all his 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.670
 potential so here and for now 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.470
 there is no workshop steam but 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.700
 when there is going to be the steam workshop 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.080
 which will be added but it will be the 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.299
 madness because people will be able to 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.190
 add modes and all that is going to be 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.510
 clearly madness so this game I you 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.560
 advise to watch him very very 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.459
 close since it is a serious competitor 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.069
 to minecraft and I hope that is going 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.670
 evolve and who will 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.260
 dub has evolved better simply 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.920
 here I hope this little video has you 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.139
 plu je stream sur twitch c'est bon c'est 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.900

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:53.010
 was finally we were 60 cents so 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.090
 frankly I was super happy they 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.389
 have so many people it's great 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.189
 pleasure
