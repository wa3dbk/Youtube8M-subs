very simple for use those of you that

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.230 
very simple for use those of you that
don't<00:02:14.920> really<00:02:15.130> you<00:02:15.340> know<00:02:15.370> yeah<00:02:15.760> well<00:02:16.060> I<00:02:16.090> don't

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
don't really you know yeah well I don't

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.440 
don't really you know yeah well I don't
know<00:02:16.390> if<00:02:17.230> it<00:02:17.980> was<00:02:18.160> valued<00:02:18.610> at<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.760> hundred<00:02:19.060> let's

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
know if it was valued at a hundred let's

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.780 
know if it was valued at a hundred let's
just<00:02:19.540> say<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:20.230> hundred<00:02:20.560> dollars<00:02:21.100> it's<00:02:21.310> not<00:02:21.490> it's

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
just say a hundred dollars it's not it's

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.390 
just say a hundred dollars it's not it's
like<00:02:21.970> 14<00:02:22.390> but<00:02:22.540> make<00:02:22.959> it<00:02:22.990> some<00:02:23.350> simple<00:02:24.069> looking

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
like 14 but make it some simple looking

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.820 
like 14 but make it some simple looking
if<00:02:25.209> it's<00:02:25.390> a<00:02:25.569> hundred<00:02:25.780> dollars<00:02:26.319> and<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.620> dropped

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
if it's a hundred dollars and it dropped

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.320 
if it's a hundred dollars and it dropped
by<00:02:26.920> twenty<00:02:27.220> six<00:02:27.430> percent<00:02:27.490> that<00:02:27.910> means<00:02:28.150> the

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
by twenty six percent that means the

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.660 
by twenty six percent that means the
value<00:02:28.480> drops<00:02:29.020> at<00:02:29.230> seventy-four<00:02:29.800> percent<00:02:29.830> okay

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
value drops at seventy-four percent okay

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.510 
value drops at seventy-four percent okay
so<00:02:31.000> it<00:02:31.090> drops<00:02:31.270> by<00:02:31.510> twenty<00:02:31.840> six<00:02:32.050> percent<00:02:32.110> if<00:02:32.560> the

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
so it drops by twenty six percent if the

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.940 
so it drops by twenty six percent if the
game's<00:02:33.760> release<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:35.440> value<00:02:35.800> of<00:02:35.860> that

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
game's release and the value of that

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.559 
game's release and the value of that
stock<00:02:36.190> just<00:02:36.489> goes<00:02:36.640> back<00:02:36.880> up<00:02:36.910> to<00:02:37.209> where<00:02:37.239> it<00:02:37.480> is

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
record-breaking levels it's just up to

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.870 
record-breaking levels it's just up to
the<00:02:49.510> level<00:02:49.690> it<00:02:49.900> is<00:02:50.019> now<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.830> twenty<00:02:51.640> six

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
the level it is now that twenty six

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.000 
the level it is now that twenty six
percent<00:02:51.970> decrease<00:02:52.570> if<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:53.019> buy<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:53.290> at<00:02:53.560> it<00:02:53.739> now

percent decrease if you buy it at it now

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.430 
percent decrease if you buy it at it now
just<00:02:54.700> coming<00:02:55.090> back<00:02:55.269> up<00:02:55.510> to<00:02:55.660> that<00:02:55.810> normal<00:02:56.170> level

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
just coming back up to that normal level

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.720 
just coming back up to that normal level
you're<00:02:56.709> talking<00:02:57.040> about<00:02:57.250> what<00:02:57.519> is<00:02:57.640> that

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
you're talking about what is that

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.940 
you're talking about what is that
thirty-four<00:02:58.420> thirty-five<00:02:59.050> percent<00:02:59.290> increase

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
thirty-four thirty-five percent increase

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.490 
thirty-four thirty-five percent increase
so<00:03:00.760> it's<00:03:00.970> a<00:03:01.060> 26-percent<00:03:01.810> originally<00:03:02.350> but

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
so it's a 26-percent originally but

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.199 
so it's a 26-percent originally but
because<00:03:02.860> it's<00:03:03.069> you<00:03:03.459> know<00:03:03.489> you're<00:03:03.760> buying<00:03:04.030> it

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.960 
because it's you know you're buying it
at<00:03:04.330> like<00:03:04.510> seventy<00:03:04.930> four<00:03:05.370> cents<00:03:06.370> on<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.819> dollar

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
at like seventy four cents on the dollar

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.630 
at like seventy four cents on the dollar
that<00:03:07.840> increased<00:03:08.440> just<00:03:08.739> back<00:03:08.920> up<00:03:09.100> to<00:03:09.280> normal

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
that increased just back up to normal

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.750 
that increased just back up to normal
levels<00:03:10.150> is<00:03:10.750> a<00:03:10.810> 30<00:03:11.709> some<00:03:11.980> odd<00:03:12.069> percent<00:03:12.280> if<00:03:12.700> you
