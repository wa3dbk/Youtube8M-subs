00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.609
 Girls, fine, I came to make a video today. 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.730

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:10.590
 cnd brand is the brand of enamels 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.969
 that I always tell you there on the blog 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.590
 It's been a long time since I've been 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.580
 talking to you that I like to use 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.600
 the gel enamels of the brand series d 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.850
 chevrolet line already show you 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.119
 chevrolet enamels have the 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.900
 15- day warranty without peeling and they 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.180
 they are gel enamels and they really do not 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.550
 peels the test I already did a lot 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.620
 Time really not peel off or not 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.480
 you have received nails and you 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.840
 direitinhos is applied step-by-step 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.280
 and use the machine as well as uv 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.070
 to dry 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.750
 it really does not peel then like me 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.059
 I have two small children and not always 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.680
 preferably non-peeling enamel 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.960
 Field wants to look beautiful with her fingernails 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.000
 made we do not really have time to 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.800
 stay up-to-date and such 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.140
 so I really like this brand 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.629
 always useful only if these enamels 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.140
 value of them is a little salty each 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.630
 costs around $ 16 on average and 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.869
 you can buy on ebay year websites 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.110
 is one more and they always need the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.420
 them coaching and shopping and if you 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.670
 look there in the blog does not walk in Tag 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.240
 Nails I always explain straight to 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.270
 You even have a story where it says 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.570
 exactly how it works and such as the 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.829
 now launched these enamels here that are 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.140
 o villax there were looks 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.450
 I bought this tiny nail polish 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.189
 Look, everybody comes in this little box, I paid. 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.710
 I'm mistaken about a 20 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.649
 dollars for this little box that with 14 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.200
 colors and one as if it were a varnish that is 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.350
 placed on top of one to make the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.119
 Enamels I found Elek that are Engel Last 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.509
 and nails you have to pass a 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.270
 b layer hides two layers of 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.979
 enamel and a touch layer only 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.290
 each of these here as I said costs 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.509
 around 16 dollars and that has 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.810
 15 days warranty only that this one 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.760
 they now launched where one does not 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.560
 only this little one I bought because 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.480
 none to test but those who 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.790
 are larger in size 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.980
 they cost around $ 10 to 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.569
 compared to 16 compared to the line 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:28.620
 check and they are not in gel are the 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:31.769
 normal glazes only they promise to 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.170
 lasting one week without peeling 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.410
 so I did the test for you guys I painted 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.019
 my nails look and now only missing 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.819
 here I'm going to paint now and I go 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.330
 comment with you as I do 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:49.200
 Are you using two layers straight up? 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.510
 the enamel nail and then you use a 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.260
 layer of this as if it were a 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.030
 varnish say if you put in the sun 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.340
 their advertising is as follows if you 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.349
 To put to dry in the sun I have this 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.180
 7-day non-peeling warranty 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:08.540
 compared to the size enamel 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:12.780
 normal eye is just starting to dry 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:17.160
 not even two minutes already dry 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.260
 Look, kleier has no color whatsoever. 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.410
 promises to make the enamel last 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.150
 for a week here 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.519
 now I'll put it to dry here in 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.519
 front of the light since there is not only outside
