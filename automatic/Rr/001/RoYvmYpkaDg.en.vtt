1.9<00:01:31.500> update<00:01:32.009> I'm<00:01:32.220> not<00:01:32.490> really<00:01:32.729> gonna<00:01:32.850> touch

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
1.9 update I'm not really gonna touch

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.280 
1.9 update I'm not really gonna touch
too<00:01:33.210> much<00:01:33.390> on<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.570> because<00:01:33.720> they're<00:01:34.110> still

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
too much on that because they're still

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.200 
too much on that because they're still
working<00:01:34.500> on<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.130> getting<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.610> out<00:01:35.850> but

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
working on that and getting that out but

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.280 
working on that and getting that out but
you<00:01:36.360> never<00:01:36.570> know<00:01:36.780> when<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.049> comes<00:01:37.170> to

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
you never know when it comes to

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.870 
you never know when it comes to
something<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.710> but<00:01:38.490> something<00:01:38.700> I

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
something like that but something I

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.850 
something like that but something I
would<00:01:39.030> really<00:01:39.390> love<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.720> see<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> new

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
would really love to see is a new

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.130 
would really love to see is a new
hostile<00:01:41.430> mob<00:01:41.670> like<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.119> Guardian<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
hostile mob like the Guardian and the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.539 
hostile mob like the Guardian and the
elder<00:01:43.560> Guardians<00:01:43.979> if<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.189> don't<00:01:44.369> know<00:01:44.430> what

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
elder Guardians if you don't know what

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.190 
elder Guardians if you don't know what
those<00:01:44.700> are<00:01:44.909> they're<00:01:45.390> really<00:01:45.899> really<00:01:45.990> awesome

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
those are they're really really awesome

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.139 
those are they're really really awesome
it's<00:01:46.560> going<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.770> be<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:47.009> world<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.610> trouble<00:01:47.790> for

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
it's going to be a world of trouble for

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.660 
it's going to be a world of trouble for
squids<00:01:48.540> though<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.619> game<00:01:49.829> if<00:01:50.189> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
squids though in the game if the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.370 
squids though in the game if the
Guardians<00:01:51.119> actually<00:01:51.600> come<00:01:51.720> over<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.020> console

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
Guardians actually come over the console

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.749 
Guardians actually come over the console
addition<00:01:52.710> but<00:01:52.829> i<00:01:53.040> think<00:01:53.310> we<00:01:53.430> had<00:01:53.460> like<00:01:53.610> a

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
addition but i think we had like a

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.039 
addition but i think we had like a
guardian<00:01:54.180> update<00:01:54.540> or<00:01:54.659> something<00:01:54.930> like<00:01:54.990> that

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
guardian update or something like that

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.780 
guardian update or something like that
along<00:01:55.259> those<00:01:55.530> lines<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:56.040> will<00:01:56.369> be<00:01:56.490> amazing

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
along those lines it will be amazing

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.700 
along those lines it will be amazing
maybe<00:01:57.390> we<00:01:57.570> can<00:01:57.689> expect<00:01:58.079> something<00:01:58.320> like<00:01:58.500> that

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
maybe we can expect something like that

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.810 
maybe we can expect something like that
after<00:01:59.430> tu<00:01:59.729> 28<00:02:00.180> after<00:02:00.479> if<00:02:00.659> biomes<00:02:01.590> are<00:02:01.860> continue

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
after tu 28 after if biomes are continue

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.609 
after tu 28 after if biomes are continue
to<00:02:02.939> cut<00:02:03.119> if<00:02:03.270> if<00:02:03.479> biomes<00:02:04.049> cover<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.469> whole

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
to cut if if biomes cover the whole

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.649 
to cut if if biomes cover the whole
update<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.250> we

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
update and we

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.199 
update and we
don't<00:02:05.780> get<00:02:05.929> a<00:02:05.960> hostile<00:02:06.350> mob<00:02:06.619> I'm<00:02:07.340> assuming<00:02:07.969> it

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
don't get a hostile mob I'm assuming it

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.999 
don't get a hostile mob I'm assuming it
would<00:02:08.420> possibly<00:02:08.750> after<00:02:09.319> that<00:02:09.500> but<00:02:09.739> if<00:02:09.830> we<00:02:09.920> do

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
would possibly after that but if we do

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.280 
would possibly after that but if we do
get<00:02:10.099> a<00:02:10.160> hostile<00:02:10.489> mob<00:02:10.759> with<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.300> biomes<00:02:11.690> that

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
get a hostile mob with the biomes that

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.990 
get a hostile mob with the biomes that
would<00:02:12.530> be<00:02:12.709> going<00:02:13.129> out<00:02:13.280> I<00:02:13.340> would<00:02:13.580> love<00:02:13.730> that<00:02:13.790> so

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
would be going out I would love that so

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.539 
would be going out I would love that so
much<00:02:14.269> we<00:02:15.140> currently<00:02:15.290> don't<00:02:15.590> have<00:02:15.709> rabbits<00:02:16.370> as

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
much we currently don't have rabbits as

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.009 
much we currently don't have rabbits as
well<00:02:16.879> like<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.239> guys<00:02:17.360> have<00:02:17.629> really<00:02:17.780> been

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
well like you guys have really been

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.960 
well like you guys have really been
requesting<00:02:18.560> rabbits<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:19.459> think<00:02:19.700> that'd<00:02:19.819> be

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
requesting rabbits I think that'd be

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.970 
requesting rabbits I think that'd be
super<00:02:20.269> super<00:02:20.540> awsome<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:21.349> it<00:02:21.620> would<00:02:21.739> be<00:02:21.769> just

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
super super awsome and it would be just

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.740 
super super awsome and it would be just
amazing<00:02:22.280> so<00:02:22.819> since<00:02:23.060> they<00:02:23.120> did<00:02:23.269> add<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.420> killer

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
amazing so since they did add the killer

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.600 
amazing so since they did add the killer
bunny<00:02:24.019> I<00:02:24.260> think<00:02:24.620> that<00:02:24.709> would<00:02:24.799> be<00:02:24.890> just<00:02:25.129> so<00:02:25.340> cool

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
bunny I think that would be just so cool

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.210 
bunny I think that would be just so cool
to<00:02:25.670> have<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:26.420> new<00:02:26.810> like<00:02:27.080> kind<00:02:27.319> of<00:02:27.379> a<00:02:27.470> pet<00:02:27.739> I<00:02:27.950> think

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
to have a new like kind of a pet I think

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.650 
to have a new like kind of a pet I think
that'd<00:02:28.310> be<00:02:28.400> awesome<00:02:28.580> but<00:02:29.209> I<00:02:29.239> think<00:02:29.420> having<00:02:29.540> a

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
that'd be awesome but I think having a

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.229 
that'd be awesome but I think having a
hostile<00:02:30.049> mob<00:02:30.349> would<00:02:30.830> just<00:02:31.099> make<00:02:31.310> minecraft

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
hostile mob would just make minecraft

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.199 
hostile mob would just make minecraft
console<00:02:32.930> just<00:02:33.230> really<00:02:33.680> spark<00:02:34.190> out<00:02:34.370> right<00:02:34.940> now

in last finally last but not least now

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.009 
in last finally last but not least now
we're<00:02:37.849> missing<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.209> chicken<00:02:38.750> jockey

at all I doing my experience on
minecraft<00:02:43.910> console<00:02:44.299> I<00:02:44.450> believe<00:02:44.840> we<00:02:44.959> do<00:02:45.140> not

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
minecraft console I believe we do not

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.319 
minecraft console I believe we do not
have<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.709> on<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.190> console<00:02:46.549> yet<00:02:46.700> that's<00:02:46.910> that's

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.329 
have it on the console yet that's that's

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:49.089 
have it on the console yet that's that's
when<00:02:47.569> a<00:02:47.599> zombie<00:02:48.079> is<00:02:48.260> actually<00:02:48.620> riding<00:02:48.890> a

when a zombie is actually riding a

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:50.979 
when a zombie is actually riding a
chicken<00:02:49.489> so<00:02:50.090> maybe<00:02:50.269> they'll<00:02:50.480> kind<00:02:50.599> of<00:02:50.720> squeeze

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
chicken so maybe they'll kind of squeeze

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.229 
chicken so maybe they'll kind of squeeze
that<00:02:51.200> in<00:02:51.470> later<00:02:51.980> on<00:02:52.220> down<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.459> road<00:02:52.610> I<00:02:53.000> don't

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
that in later on down the road I don't

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.180 
that in later on down the road I don't
know<00:02:53.329> I<00:02:53.360> was<00:02:53.629> I<00:02:53.750> was<00:02:53.930> assuming<00:02:54.590> we<00:02:54.890> would<00:02:55.040> have

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
know I was I was assuming we would have

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.250 
know I was I was assuming we would have
that<00:02:55.400> by<00:02:55.579> now<00:02:55.760> we<00:02:56.239> have<00:02:56.360> spire<00:02:56.690> jockeys<00:02:57.230> and

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
that by now we have spire jockeys and

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.630 
that by now we have spire jockeys and
things<00:02:57.500> like<00:02:57.590> that<00:02:57.650> but<00:02:57.980> we<00:02:58.220> currently<00:02:58.340> don't

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
things like that but we currently don't
