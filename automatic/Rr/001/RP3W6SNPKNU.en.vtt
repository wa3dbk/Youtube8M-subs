00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:09.379 

okay<00:00:01.979> so<00:00:02.280> there's<00:00:02.790> the<00:00:03.030> bike<00:00:08.090> but<00:00:09.090> when<00:00:09.269> we

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
okay so there's the bike but when we

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:21.820 
okay so there's the bike but when we
look<00:00:09.570> underneath<00:00:14.210> to<00:00:15.210> do<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.540> oil<00:00:18.710> it<00:00:19.710> has<00:00:20.810> its

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
look underneath to do the oil it has its

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.259 
look underneath to do the oil it has its
walk<00:00:23.150> has<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.390> big<00:00:25.760> plastic<00:00:26.760> piece

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
walk has this big plastic piece

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.999 
walk has this big plastic piece
underneath<00:00:28.250> and<00:00:29.269> I<00:00:30.269> thought<00:00:30.570> maybe<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:31.380> could

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
underneath and I thought maybe I could

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.610 
underneath and I thought maybe I could
take<00:00:32.340> those<00:00:37.430> those<00:00:38.430> two<00:00:38.460> bolts<00:00:38.910> right<00:00:39.180> there

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
take those those two bolts right there

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.319 
take those those two bolts right there
there's<00:00:40.620> one<00:00:40.710> here<00:00:41.370> there's<00:00:42.210> one<00:00:42.480> over<00:00:42.600> here

just a piece of the forming there's no
bolts<00:00:58.020> inside<00:00:58.379> here<00:00:59.270> but<00:01:00.270> back<00:01:00.510> here<00:01:00.899> when<00:01:01.079> I

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
bolts inside here but back here when I

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.609 
bolts inside here but back here when I
come<00:01:02.390> this<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.570> held<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:04.019> by<00:01:05.360> multiple<00:01:06.619> bolts

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
come this is held on by multiple bolts

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:15.170

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
then I got to take off the top part and

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.270 
then I got to take off the top part and
the<00:01:19.259> right<00:01:20.009> running<00:01:20.310> boards<00:01:21.299> there<00:01:22.040> and<00:01:23.040> I

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
the right running boards there and I

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.800 
the right running boards there and I
just<00:01:23.310> don't<00:01:23.549> know<00:01:23.670> how<00:01:23.850> far<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.210> got<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.689> get

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
just don't know how far I got to get

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.390 
just don't know how far I got to get
into<00:01:25.020> there's<00:01:25.259> another<00:01:25.530> bolt<00:01:25.860> holding<00:01:26.250> on

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
into there's another bolt holding on

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.999 
into there's another bolt holding on
some<00:01:26.700> part<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.299> then<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.320> course<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.650> outside

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
some part and then of course the outside

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.179 
some part and then of course the outside
cowling<00:01:29.869> so<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:31.200> don't<00:01:31.530> know<00:01:31.590> how<00:01:31.710> deep<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.040> need

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
cowling so I don't know how deep I need

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.830 
cowling so I don't know how deep I need
to<00:01:32.280> go<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.520> another<00:01:32.790> thing<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.360> when<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.750> were

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
to go and another thing is when you were

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.380 
to go and another thing is when you were
showing<00:01:34.110> changing<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.829> gear<00:01:35.100> oil<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.939> heavy

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
showing changing the gear oil the heavy

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.450 
showing changing the gear oil the heavy
oil<00:01:36.689> you're<00:01:37.650> showing<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.520> part<00:01:38.880> back<00:01:39.090> here

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
oil you're showing this part back here

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.950 
oil you're showing this part back here
but<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.490> can't<00:01:41.880> find<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:43.530> bolt<00:01:43.820> underneath

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
but I can't find the bolt underneath

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.359 
but I can't find the bolt underneath
there's<00:01:45.960> no<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.320> thought<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.920> was<00:01:47.100> where<00:01:47.340> I

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
there's no I thought that was where I

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.200 
there's no I thought that was where I
would<00:01:47.610> get<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.970> but<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:48.270> not<00:01:48.420> there<00:01:50.180> so<00:01:51.180> I

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
would get it but it's not there so I

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.780 
would get it but it's not there so I
don't<00:01:51.299> know<00:01:51.450> where<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.720> bolt<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.790> thought

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
don't know where the bolt is I thought

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.350 
don't know where the bolt is I thought
maybe<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.890> but<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.159> don't<00:01:56.790> think<00:01:56.969> that's<00:01:57.180> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
maybe this but I don't think that's the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.450 
maybe this but I don't think that's the
bolt<00:01:57.540> for<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.750> oil<00:01:57.990> either<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.130> don't<00:01:59.310> have

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
bolt for the oil either and I don't have

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.880 
bolt for the oil either and I don't have
the<00:01:59.670> filling<00:02:00.119> hole<00:02:00.750> like<00:02:01.140> where<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.500> show<00:02:01.740> on

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
the filling hole like where you show on

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.100 
the filling hole like where you show on
your<00:02:01.920> videos<00:02:02.340> also<00:02:02.579> maybe<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.719> totally

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
your videos also maybe this is a totally

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.539 
your videos also maybe this is a totally
different<00:02:04.140> engine<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.920> guess<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.280> don't<00:02:05.399> know

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
different engine I guess I don't know

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.830 
different engine I guess I don't know
I'm<00:02:05.759> not<00:02:05.909> sure<00:02:08.000> but<00:02:09.000> anyway<00:02:09.270> that's<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.660> let<00:02:09.810> me

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
I'm not sure but anyway that's it let me

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.380
