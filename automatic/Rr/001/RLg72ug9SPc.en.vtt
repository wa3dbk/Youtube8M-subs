00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.960
 hello to all and welcome to and if 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.939
 we lived bio a new program that 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.379
 I propose on btl vtv we will go 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.820
 to meet the different actors of the 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.500
 bio to give you a maximum of ideas 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.570
 and tips for living better because 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.710
 live is good but live organic and ben 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.269
 it's better to go summary in the 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.339
 second part of the program we're going 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.710
 meet frank berton a chocolatier 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.330
 and an organic pastry cook who cook hyper 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.769
 good and gluten free but above all 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.290
 let me introduce you christine 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.000
 place a producer of organic wine that 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.409
 I met for you at the Salon du 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.409
 organic well-being and therapy 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.390
 in fact an organic wine is a lock 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.940
 the inter have not been processed since 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.260
 at least 15 years later we put no 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.240
 pesticides do not put fertilizer 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.190
 it's 100% natural in fact the 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.720
 same bio it's like before it's the 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.410
 respect for the environment and especially 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.270
 respect for the order 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.250
 it's really that grape juice is 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.900
 absolutely nothing against it is a little 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.610
 above a degree of alcohol for the 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.910
 only natural preservative in fact this is 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.910
 the alcohol 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.109
 organic label it takes at least three 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.030
 hills ie five kilometers 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:34.159
 difference between an organic producer is a 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.469
 no bio can be in the label no 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.170
 more if you're on the roadside because 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.700
 that there is pollution of cars from 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.590
 vehicles so we can not have one 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.689
 had it all done by hand with 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.640
 draft horses with everything is cut to 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.860
 the sea harvested by hand 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.390
 with jumps that really old 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.039
 puts in vats competing and by the 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.209
 draft horses is really all a 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:57.110
 path and that's a lot a lot 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:59.299
 handling the bottle 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.920
 and around 5 6 euros which 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.450
 still affordable 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.319
 it's a price because we are direct 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.319
 producer too 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.399
 then the production circuit but 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.920
 it's basically our three stores 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.750
 in the var and that of peace households 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.890
 is it to everyone his scale try to 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.900
 do a little bit if everyone 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.849
 try to consume even if we can not 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.170
 consume everything organic but at least one 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.120
 part whether it's the fruits the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.519
 vegetables here are the things anyway 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.579
 essential is to try to do that 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.560
 every day a saint michel the most 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:34.109
 possible try to consume less but 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.849
 to consume a good advice that we 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.799
 will hear more and more even when he 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.819
 is chocolate and pastries and 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.969
 as I am myself a great 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.870
 consumer of this kind of vegetables 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:44.280
 I wanted to know if it was possible 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.560
 to consume it by doing good to 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.849
 our health as well as that of the 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.329
 planet and to answer my questions 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:54.150
 frank berton to pastry chocolate maker 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:56.489
 for a belief that is simple 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.110
 we are not insects and the 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.540
 pesticides and insecticides that we 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.349
 is ingesting ben it's more and more 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.470
 bad for us our most the without 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.269
 gluten the gluten-free or because because 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.760
 that more and more intolerant more 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.470
 in addition to 2 people who have problems 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.920
 with digestion of 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.319
 fatigue 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.880
 finally here and one more and more I 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.930
 think it will be the health problem 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.930
 in the next ten years 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.740
 we decided to clean the laboratory 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.280
 another way rank with soap from 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.750
 black soap and active oxygen from 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.660
 totally natural products that they have 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.910
 disinfectants and interesting everything is 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.560
 bio fridge and bio bank but products from 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.480
 Cleaning for the best Beauce 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.670
 males and six ovens but the light organic good 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.670
 toothpaste and bio good shampoo and better 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.040
 necessarily we really do not know about me 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.920
 it's not a plus for me it's just 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.420
 natural the fair market in the 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.100
 chocolate for example we will quote that 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.820
 that one 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.140
 today unfortunately in the 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.410
 world we still have families who 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.220
 sell their children to work 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.450
 under the cocoa trees 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.160
 I think the collective consciousness 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.540
 is obligatory us as 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.790
 chocolatier to stop buying a 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.500
 chocolate that is not from the trade 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.660
 fair so as to stop 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.040
 we are in 2015 of slavery must that it 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.650
 stops what is unfortunately in 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.960
 Africa it's going on so I'm talking to you 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.480
 not the four children of the family who 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.130
 come because it's a way 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.390
 ancestral help to parents or 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.310
 grandparents under cocoa trees 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.870
 I'm talking about 50 children who are 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.320
 exploited under a cocoa tree for 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.320
 to work 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.849
 today we are on a big project of 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.129
 solar geothermal energy to heat 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.930
 water and to mount our studies at 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:46.030
 minimum at 50 Â° to make only 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.710
 complement of the thirteen or fourteen degrees 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.470
 which we will miss in electricity from 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.539
 way to there are ecological approaches 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.440
 on many a lot of things in the 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:55.440
 in the good 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.300
 advice that I could give to people 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.650
 mow organic because your friend 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.669
 doctor is beautiful butcher since 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.260
 you manage your body there camp there 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.180
 assimilates and when you will manage 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.320
 pesticides and insecticides and all these 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.000
 kinds of things 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.389
 do not believe that it makes you 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.710
 nothing quite contrary to treating everything 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:17.479
 what one is treating and ingesting his 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.710
 bloody more and more every 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.900
 diseases and all the woes of people 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.790
 this is the first decision 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.889
 lived organic is over talk about it 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.210
 exchange and share this video 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:28.220
 and then never forget to live it's 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.340
 good but live organic is better go 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.340
 Hi
