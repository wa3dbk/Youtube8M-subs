00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.900
 hello youtube friends this time 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.400
 I'm going to show you how to have 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.340
 personality or your android style 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.710
 samsung galaxy s 4 as you are seeing it 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.550
 on the screen maybe you see a little 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.590
 slow but it's because of the capture by the 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.470
 for the video but it's really going very 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.930
 fluid in this case I'm going to upload a 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.740
 file to 47 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:38.310
 and will make a compressed file with 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.650
 two if a battery equal to 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.370
 another is the same file but if not 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:47.870
 it serves them one I have them and the other 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:50.149
 it's called the launcher touch guys and apeca 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.430
 of course and here says the one che bc3 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.890
 but in reality it is the appearance of 154 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.250
 since when to leave is launcher the 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.260
 galaxy s 4 had not yet left but this 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.530
 is the night updated and then I do not know 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.470
 he could change the name 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.650
 in this case we have the same button 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.650
 menu 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.070
 attached here also comes the tab 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.250
 that brings the suns an hour above that the 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.370
 apps and widgets 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.580
 and well the same translation and the 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.300
 same effect when clicking on an icon 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.850
 as you can see on the screen 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.400
 and if we 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.670
 and we put our dice our fingers 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.920
 and we put them together to the center will open 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.509
 this is the tab administrator 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.509
 with which we can move it 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:46.110
 and we can add icons for example and 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.110
 here I want to add a widget 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.880
 you have already added it to me here and if I 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:58.540
 I want to move to another page will open 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.920
 this 3d effect that is very good 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.920
 good friends this 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.090
 the launcher or this launch that the 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.830
 I recommend with the screen lock of 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.880
 widget locker since it looks great 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.880
 I will give a demonstration 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.490
 how can you see that the widget is 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.470
 locker is already active 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.910
 and it looks very good the truth is 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.010
 launcher comes with sensors 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.750
 movement activated since you 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.940
 they move their phone in the background of 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.940
 screen will change I will show you 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.580
 no no 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.360
 as you can see here and in return and if not 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.430
 they want to treat it and they just let 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.800
 pressed they will give you in world pay per 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.340
 and they're going to preserve them and how they're doing 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.950
 to give on wallpapers and if they no longer want 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.569
 that this appears to me always I thought with 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.650
 pressed will give you equal paper and 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.439
 select the option below 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.930
 same paper again because they are already 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:00.379
 will open these are the s 4 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.379
 as you can see 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:10.100
 this dlc of 4 and that this also 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:13.340
 everything that has celestial colors 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.370
 in light blue green yellow and red 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.050
 purple then they are d lc 4 and come apart 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.540
 other backgrounds in high definition by 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.300
 Of course you may like them 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.330
 as users in fact it comes included from 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.580
 some tablet if I'm not wrong that I think 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.160
 that this is from the 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:35.480
 Note 2 I'm not sure 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:38.240
 but this is a sandwich and this is from 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.970
 jelly bean this nexus and already others 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.070
 Well, I do not have a clear definition of what version 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.150
 android are but then with all when 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.700
 sam hd that suits them very well 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.390
 the truth is very very good the 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:55.650
 phone and apart about the hdi they are going to 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.280
