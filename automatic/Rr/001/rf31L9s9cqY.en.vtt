00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.420
 All this with you 20 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.349
 Back here, I already stopped making a video. 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.750
 of gemol di sim those animations 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.480
 Quoted animation, why not? 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.390
 if the animation finally those random 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:28.140
 random look right it was the square is 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:31.140
 Wow, what's up with all the videos? 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:36.510
 everything was done here in this game 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.910
 so I have to speak wrong 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.719
 Because you know you have funk, do not forgive anyone. 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.719
 talk wrong, right? 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:52.230
 It's okay, right? 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:55.430
 It's a game is if the characters can 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.399
 to have everything that is given in regime only 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:02.840
 debut against fla f1 team fortress e 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.840
 several other games of the turn nÃ© 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.450
 It's a pretty cool zone game. 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.610
 for example a random thing here 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.610
 doll, right? 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.770
 the doll is like this 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:31.229
 holding the left fashion, we can 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:37.650
 turn the button is so the like button 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:45.500
 Right, you just freeze and then 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:51.329
 the random things right here 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:55.430
 come to spend time 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.740
 not now because at stake they do not ride like this 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:03.530
 The force you want 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.530
 i sobral 7 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.319

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.760
 some reason 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.190
 I hope not but I think it will stay 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.990
 Yes but 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:23.070
 Does it matter what image I listen to? 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:25.770
 what it becomes leave did shit 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.910
 new movie that made the face visible, right? 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.030
 then it was to make the Latin visible 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.340
 when you choose this collor here 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:43.170

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:59.100

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.710

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:28.080
 yes, that's it , I remember this scene very well 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.560
 it 's not the animation I did 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:40.160
 I think it was the first one I did here 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:40.160
 in which a cigar was expensive I killed 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:53.209
 that's where you know the place where 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:57.290
 I recorded the video gives the fight of the video 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:04:01.920
 animation that I used to stay here 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:05.090
 truck and here the ultimate camera scene 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.760
 no gun in my head 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:12.019
 that's how we could simply 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.019
 I stayed here so O 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:21.150
 A little bit back, please. 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.870
 But that 's how it is in itself, so do not even look at it. 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.810
 top 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.760
 Paulo then it was so I did 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.120
 first animation 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.780
 this game is very cool to make fun is also 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:39.240

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:42.170

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:05.130

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:07.220

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.900
 very cool game 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.360
 I asked how I did it. 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.700
 the program is an extra game can buy 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.660
 in this cheap 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:26.930
 I do not know how much cheaper it is 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:35.970
 truck plus a little joke here 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:38.880
 in shadow options to appear if your 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:43.380
 shadows when you were recording on 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.980

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.680
 to draw the cameras 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:06:02.250
 this is more important here to take ohio 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:06.810
 use of the gun becomes more confusing 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:15.630
 only it is better not small camera 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:17.810
