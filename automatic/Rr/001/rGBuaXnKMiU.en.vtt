00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:09.280
 some hairstyles with which I am these 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.440
 last days pretty obsessed to 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.009
 make me and these are these typical hairstyles of 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:18.820
 super easy to do braids we see 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:22.089
 very much for installing women interest 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.589
 of this hairstyles that you say are pretty 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:26.169
 easy to do and that almost all 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:28.150
 lovely girls that are web 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.710
 that this is your mother was coming for a psychologist 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.349
 for you are you put a nest in the 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.710
 head fits you and is just braids 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:39.940
 that is a super fluffy non-fluffy yes 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:42.130
 and that says I go with four hairs that 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.890
 I have I can not do that piece of 30 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.170
 then I come here to teach the trick of 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.190
 all those girls then redesigning 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.190
 spain americas and clouds 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.899
 good the first hairstyle is the typical 30 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.920
 chubby here then what are we going to 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.180
 do is 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.180
 as our flex 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:18.149
 let's hit this right 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.170
 and nothing simply we catch the three 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.840
 ends and 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.750
 the bottom end we pass to the center 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.770
 down the top to the center by 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.940
 down the center work below the 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:38.270
 from top to center and 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.270
 we add a little bit of long hair 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.380
 the one from below to the center the one at the top 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.610
 center and add a little bit of hair 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.010
 above 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.140
 and between the same village he went down to the center 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.540
 from above the center and add a 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.480
 little bit of hair on top we're just going to 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.910
 do three times to add a one 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:04.250
 time to each end and it is and now we are going to 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.250
 keep triumphing normally 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.610
 is already the trick to have this is a 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:19.750
 attack as you see normal the trick to 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:22.050
 to have it beautiful is that you do not put 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.780
 gummy 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.030
 when is going to go spinal we will go 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.630
 now 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:35.320
 on either side of the 30 or pinching 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:38.280
 and pulling the little hairs off like manu 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.280
 liked big 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.170
 Y 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:52.910
 all right 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:57.790
 and I take an elastic rubber band and 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.790
 now if you hold them 2 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.610
 with a fork we hold here 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.610
 behind 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.530
 i 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.730
 and 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.540
 and the only thing left for us to comb 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.690
 well all the hair if you want to give it a 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.030
 little bit of volume 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.330
 Y 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.330
 yes 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.550
 and it would be ready 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.430
 Y 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:50.450
 and good to the next one that is going to 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.450
 teach in the fishtail braid 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.730
 and here 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.830
 more of the same simply 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.659
 let's take a little more from here 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.659

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:09.440

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.440
 our hair rite 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.629
 and we split it in 2 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.440
 i 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.440
 and we are going to go catching 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:30.630
 from the center above and we had it 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:34.020
 down to the other side 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:38.150
 from the center above and we had it 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.150
 to the other color 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:47.030
 we choose 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:49.780
 from the center boy and from outside 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:53.520

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.520

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:04.390

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.900
 more of them from the center 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.920
 we make 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.920
 and on the other side like the other 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:34.870

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.560
 we see 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.090
 and when you have done it a couple of 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.380
 times 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.790
