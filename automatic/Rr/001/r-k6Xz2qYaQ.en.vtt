00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
days I think we get given a row book

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.219 
days I think we get given a row book
each<00:02:02.350> day<00:02:02.909> row<00:02:03.909> book<00:02:04.179> did<00:02:04.420> say<00:02:04.659> souris<00:02:04.960> them

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
each day row book did say souris them

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.050 
each day row book did say souris them
the<00:02:05.770> distance<00:02:06.100> from<00:02:06.189> point<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.640> point<00:02:06.700> and

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
the distance from point to point and

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.630 
the distance from point to point and
each<00:02:07.959> one<00:02:08.229> of<00:02:08.259> those<00:02:08.380> points<00:02:08.799> adds<00:02:09.130> up<00:02:09.399> to<00:02:09.429> a

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
each one of those points adds up to a

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.820 
each one of those points adds up to a
total<00:02:09.970> distance<00:02:10.269> of<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.569> course<00:02:10.780> so<00:02:11.530> we've

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
total distance of the course so we've

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.430 
total distance of the course so we've
