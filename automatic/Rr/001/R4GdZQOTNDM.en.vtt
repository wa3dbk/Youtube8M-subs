00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.759
 that you have turned on today 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.859
 we samsung galaxy s sixth 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.120
 brand new will soon come to the market 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.250
 and we want to go ahead 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.990
 see what content is in the box 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.210
 if you have the phone then 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.949
 I finally get the delivery I hope 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.949
 This video like what you see here we go 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.789
 and so she looks out of the box are the 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.560
 the first six here in the 32 gb 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.060
 will come home to you 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.220
 is actually a very typical one 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.470
 normal smartphone box and sees the 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.950
 Packaging of the s5 except for the lettering 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.600
 and the color, of course, very similar to 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.360
 First let's remove this paper 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.460
 coat and come to the actual box 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.620
 and when we open these we see whole 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.290
 above the smartphone in his 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.510
 full of splendor but that is six lay 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.360
 Let's just go that short when you 're boxing around 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.829
 the box goes then we have one more 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.780
 small cardboard box in the itself 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.820
 apparently the warranty and the 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.710
 user manual is also located 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.560
 known as the wayne box for whom 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.820
 I'm not interested in seeing that right now 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.649
 we already have the accessories 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.500
 here we have a standard micro usb 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:13.450
 USB cable for charging and for 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.979
 Data transfer that knows many of 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.170
 you already from all devices 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.149
 Here we have the right power supply 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.360
 this and the power supply is me 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.280
 noticed that here on the one 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.080
 starting is what it says which is 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.360
 five power supply not yet stood on it and 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.490
 that just means it's six 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.259
 owns this fast-loading technology 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.399
 and just 50 percent faster 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.569
 loading is still possible here as the s5 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.970
 we still have a small remedy 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.910
 to insert the SIM card not many 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.740
 of you from iphone and other devices 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.720
 next we have by default 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.450
 even higher and of course the 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.740
 suitable place sat down with the victims 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.720
 I also noticed something and that 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.819
 look different than before 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.410
 and whether they sound better or not 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.090
 we'll see in the review 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.729
 so and now finally comes to the mobile phone 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.200
 even the phone is super thin and that 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.770
 You also notice as soon as you in the 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.989
 hand takes 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.489
 but it feels really cool and 

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:08.500
 Elan if you ask me first impression 

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:09.819
 is very positive in any case here 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.280
 below we have our head in front of the entrance 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.020
 Micro USB connection and the speakers 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.239
 if the total remember an iphone 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.190
 you ask me to see the back 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.440
 we still here the 16 megapixel camera 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.020
 which should be significantly better than the 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.120
 predecessors and on the sides we see 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.400
 once the off button with the sim 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.319
 card slot directly down and on the 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.670
 other side the volume control on 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.840
 the top is really just the one 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.540
 infrared sensor 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.069
 worth living and of course I have that 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.450
 only six times up and 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.160
 not just wild through the area 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.319
 clicked with the software a bit 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.420
 looked at and I have to say it works 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.190
 really super fast you push something 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.349
 and it reacts immediately 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.090
 whether that is first impression or whether 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.180
 we see this impression confirmed 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.470
 then last year it was like that 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.910
 again from me , I would be this 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.040
 then drove me thumbs up 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.690
 and subscribe to the channel for more such 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.180
 videos and so you get informed 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.830
 if there are finally more content to the s6 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.390
 I had to test myself now 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.250
 make some cool ones here 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.250
 videos to the s6 have fun
