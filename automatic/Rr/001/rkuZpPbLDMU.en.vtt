00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
choice then remeasure the alignment to

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.550 
choice then remeasure the alignment to
ensure<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.850> results

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.800 

now<00:02:22.160> let's<00:02:22.459> examine<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.120> case<00:02:23.330> where<00:02:23.690> the

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
now let's examine the case where the

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.500 
now let's examine the case where the
moveable<00:02:24.319> machine<00:02:24.680> is<00:02:24.890> bolt<00:02:25.160> bound<00:02:25.510> these

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
moveable machine is bolt bound these

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.720 
moveable machine is bolt bound these
alignment<00:02:27.080> results<00:02:27.560> indicate<00:02:28.130> that<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.520> rear

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
alignment results indicate that the rear

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.580 
alignment results indicate that the rear
feet<00:02:29.060> should<00:02:29.360> be<00:02:29.420> moved<00:02:29.750> in<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.020> direction<00:02:30.050> of

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
feet should be moved in the direction of

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.850 
feet should be moved in the direction of
the<00:02:30.709> arrow<00:02:30.890> 15<00:02:31.580> mils<00:02:32.140> but<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.260> move<00:02:33.470> is<00:02:33.680> not

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
the arrow 15 mils but the move is not

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.150 
the arrow 15 mils but the move is not
possible<00:02:34.550> due<00:02:34.850> to<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:35.120> position<00:02:35.600> of<00:02:35.690> a<00:02:35.810> bolt

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
possible due to the position of a bolt

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.760 
possible due to the position of a bolt
again<00:02:37.360> employ<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.600> feet<00:02:38.810> lock<00:02:39.020> function<00:02:39.620> to
