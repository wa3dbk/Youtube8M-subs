00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.180
Well I got the drawers to one of the base cabinets assembled and installed.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.640
 Then I took a look around the shop and it was in such a state that I decided

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.240
to clean it up a little bit.  So while I do this, why don't you watch that.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.640
In Part one of this Vanity Dresser build,
I assembled the

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.890
two base units and cut the drawer sides while
those were drying in the clamps.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.400
short work of the dadoes I need for the drawer
bottoms.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.910
Make a single pass for each side. Adjust my
fence about an eigth of an inch. make a second pass.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.900
 Check the fit. 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.040
Everything looks good so I'll finish up here.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.660
next I'll cut the drawer bottoms to size.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.960
These eight foot ceilings are a pain in my...ankle.
You thought I was going to say it was a pain

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.660
in something else didn't you. Naughty you.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.760
Cut to width. Then to length.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.160
I've decided on dowels to assemble the drawers
so I need a whole mess of one and a half inch dowels.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.260
Every inch or so should be good on these dowels.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.860
Alright lets assemble some dresser drawers.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.020
Once I got a couple dowels set I realized
I could remove the clamps and do that last dowel.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.400
That'll clean up nice with some light sanding.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.620
Now I can slide the bottom in place.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.480
And finish up the other side.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.980
Sand everything flush and then I'll take a
sponge to those top edges. I'm not trying

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.359
to round over anything over, just take the
bite out of them.

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:00.810
Once that's done I'll start cutting the face
fronts to rough length. This is a solid piece

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.550
of one by eight oak.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.780
I'll cut em a quarter inch longer than I need
and then take them over to the table saw and

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.740
make a pass to square up one side.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.180
Then I'll do a final measurement, add a stop
block and square up the other side.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.490
A quick check to make sure everything came
out ok.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:15.390
Now I'll chamfer the edges. Have I mentioned
I like simple? and easy...I like simple and easy.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.720
A friend of mine came over one day and said
someone gave him an old bed frame that had

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.690
storage underneath. He was going to break
it down for firewood and asked if I wanted

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:37.930
any of the hardware from it.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.760
Ahhhh....yeah!!! I'll find a use for those.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.480
I'll just clean these up a little bit and
they'll work just fine.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.140
There, use found.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.360
I know the overhang measurements so I'll mark
those.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.550
Lay the drawer on top and line em up with
the marks.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.480
Evan though I didn't get to staining I'd say
she's still coming along pretty well.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.920
I'll get to that next time, maybe start adding
some trim pieces and I've gotta start thinking

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:05.820
about 
the top as well.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.920
