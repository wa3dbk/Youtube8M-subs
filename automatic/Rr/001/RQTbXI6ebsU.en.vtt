00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
find as twitchy as this bike is it's

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.370 
find as twitchy as this bike is it's
also<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.090> most<00:00:24.180> precise<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.930> just<00:00:25.140> find

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
also the most precise and I just find

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.839 
also the most precise and I just find
it's<00:00:25.560> it's<00:00:25.769> exceptionally<00:00:26.490> good<00:00:26.640> for<00:00:26.789> this

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
it's it's exceptionally good for this

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.970 
it's it's exceptionally good for this
challenge<00:00:27.119> once<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.960> master<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.830> big

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
challenge once you master it the big

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.320 
challenge once you master it the big
caveat<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.400> there<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.640> need<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.880> master<00:00:30.029> this

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
caveat is there you need to master this

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.910 
caveat is there you need to master this
bike<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.720> need<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.960> have<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> decent<00:00:31.380> feel<00:00:31.679> for

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
bike you need to have a decent feel for

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.740 
bike you need to have a decent feel for
it<00:00:32.009> but<00:00:32.640> again<00:00:32.850> with<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> bit<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.270> practice<00:00:33.450> I

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
it but again with a bit of practice I

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.240 
it but again with a bit of practice I
think<00:00:33.809> you'll<00:00:34.020> do<00:00:34.140> quite<00:00:34.170> well<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:35.100> other

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
think you'll do quite well the other

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.310 
think you'll do quite well the other
thing<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.850> really<00:00:36.090> figure<00:00:36.570> out<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.140> you

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
thing to really figure out is that you

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.780 
thing to really figure out is that you
need<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.559> be<00:00:37.649> as<00:00:37.739> gentle<00:00:38.010> as<00:00:38.190> possible<00:00:38.219> to

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
need to be as gentle as possible to

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.310 
need to be as gentle as possible to
throw<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.239> need<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.450> be<00:00:39.540> precise<00:00:39.899> but<00:00:40.170> like

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
throw on you need to be precise but like

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.380 
throw on you need to be precise but like
with<00:00:40.530> very<00:00:41.100> little<00:00:41.399> touches<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.090> throttle

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
with very little touches of the throttle

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.600 
with very little touches of the throttle
here<00:00:42.710> all<00:00:43.710> right<00:00:43.800> Billy<00:00:44.100> use<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.460> brake<00:00:44.730> I

well<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.369> think<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.580> lot<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.759> people<00:01:27.030> try<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.390> do

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
well I think a lot of people try and do

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.749 
well I think a lot of people try and do
is<00:01:27.869> try<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.619> know<00:01:28.650> transition<00:01:29.369> from<00:01:29.520> one

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
is try and you know transition from one

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.219 
is try and you know transition from one
to<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.000> other<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.540> never<00:01:30.720> let<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.020> front

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
to the other and never let the front

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.109 
to the other and never let the front
wheel<00:01:31.380> touch<00:01:31.650> people<00:01:32.520> will<00:01:32.610> try<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:32.909> sort<00:01:33.090> of

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
wheel touch people will try and sort of

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.640 
wheel touch people will try and sort of
go<00:01:33.299> from<00:01:33.450> here<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.900> I'll<00:01:33.990> try<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.170> bounce<00:01:34.380> off

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
go from here and I'll try and bounce off

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.350 
go from here and I'll try and bounce off
the<00:01:34.770> rear<00:01:34.950> wheel<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.520> I'll<00:01:35.610> bounce<00:01:35.790> off<00:01:36.090> here

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
the rear wheel and I'll bounce off here

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.300 
the rear wheel and I'll bounce off here
and<00:01:36.540> my<00:01:36.900> fault<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.439> what<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.009> everyone

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
and my fault this is what and everyone

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.469 
and my fault this is what and everyone
you're<00:01:38.430> gonna<00:01:38.549> be<00:01:38.670> seeing<00:01:39.060> yourself<00:01:39.299> doing

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
you're gonna be seeing yourself doing

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.060 
you're gonna be seeing yourself doing
quite<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.659> lot<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.530> problem<00:01:40.829> with<00:01:40.950> that

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
quite a lot of the problem with that

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.950 
quite a lot of the problem with that
theory<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.729> you're<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.750> you're

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
theory is that you're you you're

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.859 
theory is that you're you you're
expecting<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.560> land<00:01:43.860> from<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.220> jump<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.869> still

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
expecting to land from a jump and still

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.060 
expecting to land from a jump and still
be<00:01:46.020> able<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.259> stay<00:01:46.350> off<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.649> front<00:01:46.950> wheel

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
be able to stay off the front wheel

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.030 
be able to stay off the front wheel
which<00:01:47.640> like<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.509> can<00:01:49.110> do<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.560> but<00:01:49.950> it

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
which like that you can do it but it

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.950 
which like that you can do it but it
takes<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.280> lot<00:01:50.460> more<00:01:50.520> skill<00:01:50.790> what<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.659> tend<00:01:51.899> to

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
takes a lot more skill what I tend to

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.990 
takes a lot more skill what I tend to
find<00:01:52.170> if<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.740> settle<00:01:53.100> yourself<00:01:53.220> down

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
find if you settle yourself down

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.389 
find if you settle yourself down
alright<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:54.990> even<00:01:55.200> here<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.350> feel<00:01:55.710> slow<00:01:55.950> if<00:01:56.219> I

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
alright so even here I feel slow if I

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.920 
alright so even here I feel slow if I
settle<00:01:56.610> myself<00:01:56.969> down<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.299> then<00:01:57.450> accelerate

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
settle myself down and then accelerate

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.109 
settle myself down and then accelerate
I've<00:01:58.590> been<00:01:58.829> able<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.490> know<00:01:59.610> easily

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
stuff like that but I mean I'm gonna

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.389 
stuff like that but I mean I'm gonna
sort<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.020> make<00:02:04.259> them<00:02:04.469> make<00:02:04.710> my<00:02:04.920> way<00:02:05.100> up<00:02:05.130> that

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399
