00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.450 

all<00:00:07.020> right<00:00:07.230> in<00:00:07.379> this<00:00:07.529> class<00:00:07.770> we<00:00:07.980> were<00:00:08.099> teaching

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
all right in this class we were teaching

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.280 
all right in this class we were teaching
a<00:00:08.550> basic<00:00:08.970> that's<00:00:09.150> attributed<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.480> Dean

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
a basic that's attributed to Dean

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.620 
a basic that's attributed to Dean
Raftery<00:00:10.740> so<00:00:11.099> basically<00:00:11.880> slowed<00:00:12.179> up<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.389> lot

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
Raftery so basically slowed up a lot

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.810 
Raftery so basically slowed up a lot
we're<00:00:13.259> gonna<00:00:13.349> show<00:00:13.620> it<00:00:13.769> solo<00:00:14.070> so<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:14.610> can

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
we're gonna show it solo so you can

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.950 
we're gonna show it solo so you can
practice<00:00:15.179> this<00:00:15.680> so<00:00:16.680> we<00:00:16.830> have<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.240> step<00:00:18.240> together

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
practice this so we have a step together

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.620 
practice this so we have a step together
then<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.740> prepare<00:00:20.250> rotate<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.180> then<00:00:21.359> we<00:00:21.449> have

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
then a prepare rotate and then we have

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.410 
then a prepare rotate and then we have
three<00:00:22.619> which<00:00:23.369> tends<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.760> be<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.880> little<00:00:24.000> shorter

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
three which tends to be a little shorter

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.120 
three which tends to be a little shorter
stuff<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:25.439> then<00:00:25.619> I'm<00:00:25.710> gonna<00:00:25.830> think<00:00:26.039> about

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
stuff and then I'm gonna think about

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.269 
stuff and then I'm gonna think about
fanning<00:00:26.820> open<00:00:27.210> hips<00:00:27.650> ribcage<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.130> then

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
fanning open hips ribcage and then

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.729 
fanning open hips ribcage and then
extending<00:00:29.849> through<00:00:30.179> my<00:00:30.390> end<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.940> four<00:00:33.020> and<00:00:34.020> we

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
extending through my end and four and we

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.319 
extending through my end and four and we
have<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.920> little<00:00:35.190> preparation<00:00:35.550> but<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.120> still

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
have a little preparation but we still

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.500 
have a little preparation but we still
have<00:00:37.370> forward<00:00:38.370> poise<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:39.030> little<00:00:39.329> bit<00:00:39.420> of

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
have forward poise a little bit of

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.610 
have forward poise a little bit of
backwards<00:00:39.870> five<00:00:41.000> six<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.210> seven<00:00:42.530> and<00:00:43.530> eight

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
backwards five six and seven and eight

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.470 
backwards five six and seven and eight
we're<00:00:44.190> taking<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.489> nice<00:00:44.640> reaching<00:00:45.000> step<00:00:45.270> so

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
we're taking the nice reaching step so

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.560 
we're taking the nice reaching step so
one<00:00:45.660> time<00:00:45.840> without<00:00:45.989> stopping<00:00:46.399> one<00:00:47.399> two<00:00:48.180> and

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
one time without stopping one two and

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.540 
one time without stopping one two and
three<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.620> four<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.700> five<00:00:50.820> six<00:00:51.660> seven<00:00:52.559> and

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
three and four and five six seven and

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.369 
three and four and five six seven and
eight<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.329> we<00:00:54.420> also<00:00:54.570> talked<00:00:54.899> about<00:00:54.989> getting

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
eight and we also talked about getting

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.099 
eight and we also talked about getting
their<00:00:55.500> invitation<00:00:56.039> preparing<00:00:57.109> really

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
their invitation preparing really

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.490 
their invitation preparing really
working<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.559> your<00:00:58.620> together<00:00:59.370> weight<00:00:59.730> changes

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
working on your together weight changes

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.729 
working on your together weight changes
dancing<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.590> out<00:01:01.829> we<00:01:02.100> have<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.600> one<00:01:03.600> two<00:01:04.500> and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
dancing this out we have a one two and

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.350 
dancing this out we have a one two and
three<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.850> four<00:01:06.150> five<00:01:06.840> six<00:01:07.700> seven<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.150> eight

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
three and four five six seven and eight

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.990 
three and four five six seven and eight
so<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.780> basic<00:01:10.140> itself<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.650> very<00:01:10.920> linear<00:01:11.159> three

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
so the basic itself is very linear three

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.469 
so the basic itself is very linear three
four<00:01:12.810> we<00:01:12.960> can<00:01:13.170> rotate<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.460> do<00:01:15.030> different

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
four we can rotate it and do different

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.490 
four we can rotate it and do different
angles<00:01:16.100> also<00:01:17.100> we<00:01:17.670> did<00:01:17.850> some<00:01:18.119> one

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
angles also we did some one

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.890 
angles also we did some one
three<00:01:20.160> four<00:01:20.970> five<00:01:21.530> six<00:01:22.530> seven<00:01:23.310> eight<00:01:24.180> one<00:01:24.570> two

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900
