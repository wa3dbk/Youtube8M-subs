 minecraft or my channel and well and the second 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.720
 thing that are themes will affect you to 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.759
 you and there are some people who know 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.920
 will take for good other people then neutral and 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.140
 other people because bad but not good to 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.100
 will I do as I read the title of 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.410
 you have seen and for some other 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.240
 spoiler if I changed my house of 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.860
 tutorials for several reasons the first 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.289
 most important of all is that the map was 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.500
 very very old we are talking about 1.4 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:41.140
 points 7 the map is worth it and well I change it 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.020
 for the part of that reason the map and 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.600
 he was a bit corrupt because he occupied 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.910
 93 you get the map in case you ask is from 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.380
 a rival maybe I have done 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.009
 a long time ago almost a year ago 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.450
 and good, use that map a lot and of course 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.580
 Well, as I had a little bit of grief 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.009
 house then at the end then stop leaving 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.990
 escape the tutorials no and well that 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.539
 map has a lot of weird stuff by 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.430
 there and good uncle camelo for that and 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.720
 also for having a map how good that 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.119
 when that character 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.770
 that is, if someone sees the house 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.660
 comes to the royal house is that the 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.220
 quickly identifies I do not like that 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.470
 indeed the world extraplanes from time to time 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.270
 when or in the voight or things like that 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.250
 I do not mean an area of ​​tutorials like 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.380
 I have in my old house and here 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.940
 I also have one live that is the 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.470
 first so the biggest reason and 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.530
 He decided to change it, also because 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.540
 we are in 1.7 and between a little the 1.8 and 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.610
 I want to change it, well, let's go 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.010
 see her right now is this house is 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.070
 completely new designed by me and 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.800
 well that has the good house like that 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.459
 house is fully automatic it is worth 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.709
 has almost all systems 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.480
 automatic that I made on my channel 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.920
 done all because some that are a 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.080
 little useless in this house because no 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.820
 they have utility well I like style 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.350
 modern as I always say if I make a 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.180
 house will always be modern and I warn you 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.360
 already and I really like this is not this that 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.240
 It has brown I like it enchanted and 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.860
 well hewitt not that he came through here or being 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.050
 first studies or notice is already put 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.550
 spoiler spoiler the next tour the del 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.910
 this more in this I care smart 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:13.050
 we press and this step is opened step 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.310
 it does not close and to leave quickly 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.560
 quite interesting not sure 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.110
 will like to come back inside not us 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.730
 let's delay here we have the 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.560
 receiver through here we come to the area 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.960
 no more head of the house that has 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.450
 so the kitchen the living room a little bit 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.890
 useless and here a small source this 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.440
 Completely decorative of course 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.390
 here then to relax a bit the 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.220
 cook like bomber I really like the 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.860
 change this is the Pablo that when the 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.140
 good default zones that you have here 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.520
 prepared that's my automatic kitchen of 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.950
 all life is worth me here I put the 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.930
 coal disappears around here I put the then 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.510
 food and up the fridge that is here 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.830
 I 'm beating you and not stopping 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.440
 objects when you have nothing because it is 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.940
 cooking well while here we have 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.040
 the living room completely decorative 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.010
 useless I have to say it but good for 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.650
 give a little bit of space that 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.660
 I would upload an item here we have the juke 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.150
 box and a kitchen like that a little bit more for 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.780
 speak for that is not that be about 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.780
 it is correct 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.629
 that charged me things 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.919
 we leave what if I do not charge all the 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.840
 house well we have to serve up that 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.669
 we have top up we have my 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.650
 computer from here and recorded minecraft 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.000
 It's worth promoting it, I'm 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.220
 recording imagine you record in our 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.660
 computer burn minecraft would be as if 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.000
 recording minecraft intermec in and me 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.030
 there is a little paradox but good 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.590
 sleep sensor that basically what 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.810
 what it detects is when it does not 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.550
 we can go to bed or not when 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.050
 turn on this one is lightbulbs and not 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.419
 we can go to bed and if we can not 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.610
 to lie down you have all this in the in the 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.070
 issue of looking for it is already going 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.750
 to go down down one down yet we will not go 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.400
 out first 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.170
 that we have outside so here we have 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.780
 our automatic cultivation in this case 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:03.030
 of carrots as a beautiful pulse 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.740
 the water collects everything and automatically 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.370
 he removes it alone and here we can 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.870
 we take everything and re plant then it is worth 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.210
 what else we have here our retail 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.940
 puddle to automatic like as verbal 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.050
 here I put the wooden blocks 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.020
 imagining things by automatic thanks 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.389
 and infinite coal then in the garage 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.490
 we have the automatic black portal for 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.680
 that does not bother the auxiliary structure to 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.880
 yasmin and obsidian I do not like anything 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.850
 the texture and I do not want it to be in my 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.380
 house that is outside and good this area 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.730
 of course it is completely decorative 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.190
 a small pool where we can 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.680
 To bathe in summer and a jacuzzi 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.350
 for 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.380
 for I do not know if to relax and here a 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:45.050
 small little garden with flowers here

 Balearic saying but where is what 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.470

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.600
 is the tutorials area where are you going to 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.850

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.590
 automate in the channel well and the 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.330
