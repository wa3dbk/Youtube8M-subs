this contraption has a catch at the top
for<00:00:48.899> chaff<00:00:50.390> these<00:00:51.390> are<00:00:51.719> these<00:00:52.170> coffee<00:00:52.469> beans

they had a little bit of a skin on them
that<00:00:57.989> as<00:00:58.170> they<00:00:58.350> heat<00:00:58.590> up<00:00:58.620> they're<00:00:58.949> going<00:00:59.070> to

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129

is<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.070> screened<00:01:02.760> box<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.359> catch<00:01:03.539> that

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
is just a screened box to catch that

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.090 
is just a screened box to catch that
heated<00:01:04.489> chat

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.700 

we<00:01:10.700> could<00:01:10.909> be<00:01:11.000> turn

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
we could be turn

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.370 
we could be turn
so<00:01:13.710> right<00:01:13.950> here<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:15.720> beans<00:01:15.990> are<00:01:16.140> just

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
so right here the beans are just

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.600 
so right here the beans are just
beginning<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.800> roast<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.370> they're<00:01:17.460> being

beginning to roast and they're being

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.580 
beginning to roast and they're being
bubbling<00:01:18.240> under<00:01:18.660> the<00:01:18.780> air<00:01:19.020> that's<00:01:19.290> pressing

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
bubbling under the air that's pressing

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.620 
bubbling under the air that's pressing
through<00:01:20.010> and<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.880> can<00:01:21.000> feel<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> little<00:01:21.390> hot

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
through and you can feel a little hot

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.610 
through and you can feel a little hot
air<00:01:21.810> coming<00:01:21.990> out<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.350> top

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.800 

at<00:01:27.100> this<00:01:27.280> point<00:01:27.520> you<00:01:27.700> can<00:01:27.850> just<00:01:28.120> begin<00:01:28.300> to<00:01:28.480> hear

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
at this point you can just begin to hear

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:36.570 
at this point you can just begin to hear
the<00:01:28.990> first<00:01:29.320> crack

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:56.780 

sounds<00:01:37.180> like<00:01:37.330> popcorn<00:01:37.870> popping

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.940 

at<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.480> point<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.990> crackle<00:01:58.440> is<00:01:58.560> beginning

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
at this point the crackle is beginning

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.010 
at this point the crackle is beginning
to<00:01:59.040> take<00:01:59.100> on<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> different<00:01:59.730> character<00:02:00.510> the

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
to take on a different character the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.050 
to take on a different character the
first<00:02:01.320> boom<00:02:01.590> sounded<00:02:02.130> really<00:02:02.370> thick<00:02:02.820> and

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
first boom sounded really thick and

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.180 
first boom sounded really thick and
hearty<00:02:03.330> and<00:02:03.570> strong<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.260> these<00:02:04.860> are<00:02:05.010> more

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
hearty and strong and these are more

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.820 
hearty and strong and these are more
like<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.460> crackle<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.960> there's<00:02:07.200> actually<00:02:07.800> a

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
like a crackle and there's actually a

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.440 
like a crackle and there's actually a
distinction<00:02:08.280> one<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.790> called<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.179> first

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
distinction one is called the first

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.999 
distinction one is called the first
crack<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.990> others<00:02:10.170> called<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.530> second

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
crack in the others called the second

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:24.370 
crack in the others called the second
time

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.200 

at<00:02:24.680> this<00:02:24.890> point<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.370> beans<00:02:25.580> are<00:02:25.760> getting<00:02:26.030> done

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
at this point the beans are getting done

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.730 
at this point the beans are getting done
so<00:02:26.450> I'm<00:02:26.510> going<00:02:26.750> to<00:02:26.810> pull<00:02:26.990> them<00:02:27.140> off<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:27.500> pull

so I'm going to pull them off and pull

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.830 
so I'm going to pull them off and pull
them<00:02:27.890> quickly<00:02:30.730> here<00:02:31.730> that<00:02:31.910> second<00:02:32.360> track<00:02:32.600> is

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
them quickly here that second track is

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:40.240 
them quickly here that second track is
full<00:02:33.140> roar<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.970> see<00:02:35.270> that<00:02:35.450> smoke<00:02:38.950> turn<00:02:39.950> on<00:02:40.100> the

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.830 

and<00:02:44.890> I<00:02:45.310> shake<00:02:45.579> the<00:02:45.760> beans<00:02:45.970> directly<00:02:46.569> under<00:02:46.810> the
