00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.850
 the psg is the evening debate that we 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.620
 wanted to have with you even before that 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.950
 the interview of thiago motta which is a 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.570
 important interview in my opinion in the 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.990
 Parisian season obviously it's about 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.059
 the site 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.710
 the english version of the lfp website 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.960
 it's also interesting to see 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.869
 that did not send must have felt endangered 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.070
 when he did this interview 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.820
 it was not in a media 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.410
 necessarily very very begins to habas here 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.609
 because it's true that if you want so 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.650
 I am asked interview to the team by 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.920
 example I believe that the month of April 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:39.030
 as host weighed every one of his words he 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.879
 did not then if I agreed with 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.340
 flo is that this principle was broadly 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.890
 modo I was gone 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.850
 no no yes so in fact it was in 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.610
 the mixed zone in Lille 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.170
 these tips of onyx quite often the 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.610
 foreign journalists arrive more 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.500
 easily catch players and 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.930
 thinner it would have been done in Italian and 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.670
 after it's gone on the version 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.920
 English league site yes so 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.149
 we will come back to the words of 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.159
 thiago motta and the debate elsewhere 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.049
 since he's going to feed this debate obviously 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.909
 finally the words of bikers will feed 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.500
 this debate is what the psg handles 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.479
 as some claim or say 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.770
 in press conference or where some 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.479
 explain by saying that they are waiting 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.680
 2015 they do not make the mistake of last year 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.630
 where is the psg really less 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.610
 good is not it okay is that 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.130
 white is finally smoking us 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.420
 sometimes when at the patient level has 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.460
 it does not manage at all then precisely 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.299
 motta gives him an answer to his 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.979
 he says I think we were 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.930
 best last year he responds 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.700
 debate since this is the question we are 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.049
 posed the way we kept the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.430
 balloon said he was very different 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.990
 yes we had a lot of the ball but 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.310
 we knew exactly what to do with 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.320
 and what was needed to put our 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.860
 audenge opponents in danger with or 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.040
 without the ball 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.659
 we played more in team he also said 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.040
 with the team we have and all the 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.299
 high quality players if everyone 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.710
 are dedicated to the team we can be 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.000
 very strong as we showed in 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.950
 the past but when we do not play 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.240
 in a team so that makes us 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.369
 vulnerable and the other thing is the 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.780
 reference to marseille who is very 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.159
 interesting when you look 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.329
 marseille he says you can see that the 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.840
 first defender on the court if 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.430
 Gignac 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.479
 he gives a lot for his team they 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.590
 may not have a level player 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.240
 arms but they have a real team 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.590
 and they showed they showed it 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.629
 sorry when they confronted us 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.489
 maybe the psg can learn two 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.730
 or three om things on this topic 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.470
 to help us 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.049
 but lioret then there obviously it goes 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.099
 talk to a lot of people that's fine 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.599
 also stunned are the supporters of the 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.769
 psg but he responds very clearly 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.980
 finally the question we wanted to 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.540
 ask in this debate but he is right the 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.129
 comparison with the om we must not fall 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.000
 in the home at ibra libre at thiago motta 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.250
 is inspired by the om 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.840
 globally on all points 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.879
 he says just two three things that we 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.019
 could roughly recover the om a 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.660
 certain qualities that paris does not have 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:45.340
 simply the aisles the side 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:47.260
 fierce the collective intensity side where 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.579
 burst to cadix and defend said 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.620
 so here is after the other thing coming out 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.269
 what says motta is that grosso 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.280
 modo it only transcend certain 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.989
 moments and basically it has to be that all the 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.510
 world be motivated by the same goal 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.540
 in big big match whether it's the barca 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.930
 clumsiness and whose match of 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.420
 Wednesday 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.739
 but otherwise they have trouble motivating themselves 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.819
 they have a hard time transcending themselves in 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.769
 team match then after that 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.870
 white the a or thiago motta dick 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.099
 the reckless life of equipped him a problem 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.760
 collective and collective 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.849
 it's a physical problem 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.349
 exactly they do not have the same yes 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.639
 but he can finally anyway 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.709
 still feels that white laurent is 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.989
 extremely annoyed when I talk about everything 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.669
 facing the barÃ§a of the game that is proposed 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.470
 by the pg is obviously to put 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:31.780
 marseille at the top but after in 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.220
 what thiago says motta all that he 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.299
 said is true but you can also add 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.160
 what white laurent says that did not because 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.840
 that actually every player does 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.340
 not the little extra that allowed the year 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.870
 last for example at the psg of a lot 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.440
 better play in any case to be a lot 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.440
 more killer
