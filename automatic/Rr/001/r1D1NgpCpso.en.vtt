 greetings drop okay you check and I cut 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:43.640
 collect the bottom so that there is 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:48.660
 look show that looks very wild 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.730

00:00:50.730 --> 00:01:04.020
 Filling a tray with its just like that 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:06.320
 well we see that the south bullies don't 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.320
 away we 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.940
 hard to imagine what they are pasting 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.830
 each mine did not go there for sure 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.830
 before they were gone with their song 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.770
 still a bit from here cunts 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.520
 pressing the grove well yourself 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.320
 stop algae growth and watched you 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.080
 there 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:45.780
 just a platter of water in terms of move 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.360
 I let the water rise to the 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.580
 water bucket at the top is therefore none 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.450
 give more water to the economical 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.940
 choose 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.940
 tim temperature to be 20 to 20 degrees 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.729
 only a few have come up and 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.759
 they are very stretched 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.560
 tiny plants we still try to 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.560
 to waste them 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:22.560
 take out faces what you fill with 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.240
 a little potting soil I have a plant 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.930
 then you can now mission 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.930
 believe to 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.970
 that is how small they are and it stems 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.930
 way too long the bridge is down that 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.520
 we say put the one plant a little lower 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.100
 so that the stalk actually completely 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.940
 comes underground to the landy trip 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.580
 threads there are just kim brain 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.970
 anything above the earth is possible 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.970
 press on 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.040
 it succeeded with a few more pieces 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.040
 I received in jars 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.740
 now I put the whole in a big one 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.840
 fry with water and drain the water herma 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.310
 pull up then 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.070
 make the roots well in contact with 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.590
 potting soil and catching currants better than 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.640
 I put them in now because there are then 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.230
 small 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.650
 she needs a he on the windowsill or 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.650
 in the greenhouse 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.850
 we have put the palo in a pot for 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.950
 10 liters 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.250
 and who said grown can pick novak 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.250
 to become
