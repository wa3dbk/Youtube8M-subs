think Lexi's there's a whole new level
of<00:02:12.440> authenticity<00:02:12.590> because<00:02:13.130> you<00:02:13.340> kind<00:02:13.520> of<00:02:13.580> get

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
of authenticity because you kind of get

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.190 
of authenticity because you kind of get
fresh<00:02:14.060> data<00:02:14.270> week<00:02:14.540> by<00:02:14.690> week<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.080> game

that<00:02:16.880> for<00:02:17.090> us<00:02:17.210> is<00:02:17.420> perhaps<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.930> most<00:02:18.020> exciting
