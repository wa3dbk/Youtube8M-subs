00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.000
 each of them 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.639
 well, that's good 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.270
 panicked can pay in addition some 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.400
 equations 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.220
 it does not make me fast does not prevent the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.240
 stone there are already things there for free 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.240
 on board there is not necessarily 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.550
 very well it went very well 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.090
 had a little message from the CEO it was 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.949
 really very nice I confuse nothing to 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.880
 to say like the others is very good 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:40.400
 I was a very nice vote 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.450
 and lots of 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.640
 I must tell you full of emotion no 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.930
 no it was damn more than reasonable 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.930
 very good super 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.320
 no half price 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.050
 I think that instead of 2006 we paid 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.269
 our hunger and in fact normal it was we 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.780
 got it right or I do not like it and that's it 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.780
 return 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.020
 480 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.680
 and the songs sure and above all I pray them 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.680
 before pulls so 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.350
 jean us this channel is simple and we have 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.270
 1090-2 paid less say it 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.190
 what should pay with another 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.570
 company in the very happy 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.190
 and the compassion we have left 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.670
 great 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.310
 well done 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.560
 they were 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.149
 for us it was enough ie 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.439
 we are very happy the state you saw 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.509
 it's a real plane a real company 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.189
 we do not exist and the wrists say of 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.780
 that's good and everyone is 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.390
 happy on the plane I think we came 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.490
 with the new plane so the a330 300 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.960
 it was today's gift to come 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.030
 with the last plane that was delivered 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.500
 last week and so who has us 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.450
 does this beautiful flight marseille meeting and 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.220
 so of course we put a point 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.579
 of honor to have at least 10% of our 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.039
 stocks that are sold at the price we 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.619
 there are like the lowest prices 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:06.289
 then from the stopover to sion is 599 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.759
 689 799 euros 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:12.159
 so since the lowest fare 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.920
 are closing because all stocks have 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:18.129
 been hanged the tariff 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.439
 following up opens up and so we can 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.870
 have tickets at rates that 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:24.310
 remain reasonable since I think 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.200
 that it had been some time since we had 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.310
 planned air tickets between the 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.250
 meeting and the metropolis that was starting 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.250
 either by a frame or by 1.5 or even 1 6
