how<00:00:27.599> do<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.840> think<00:00:28.050> things<00:00:28.289> are<00:00:28.470> going<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.800> him

here<00:00:29.220> he's<00:00:29.429> really<00:00:29.730> come<00:00:29.970> into<00:00:30.150> his<00:00:30.420> own<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.080> I

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
think that Paris gives that to a

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.860 
think that Paris gives that to a
designer<00:00:34.170> time<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.980> really<00:00:35.390> not<00:00:36.390> only<00:00:36.540> find

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
designer time to really not only find

I think it's great that he's bringing
back<00:01:42.229> that<00:01:42.649> kind<00:01:43.429> of<00:01:43.610> stripped-down

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
back that kind of stripped-down

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.899 
back that kind of stripped-down

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
toward the end I think obviously

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.180 
toward the end I think obviously

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
his patterns but also in the

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.660 
his patterns but also in the
construction<00:03:38.500> of<00:03:38.590> his<00:03:38.770> garments<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:39.520> he's

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
construction of his garments and he's

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.360 
construction of his garments and he's
just<00:03:39.940> pushed<00:03:40.600> it<00:03:40.870> on<00:03:41.050> every<00:03:41.620> season<00:03:41.890> which<00:03:42.340> is

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
just pushed it on every season which is

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.850 
just pushed it on every season which is
not<00:03:42.670> something<00:03:43.000> that's<00:03:43.300> easy<00:03:43.480> to<00:03:43.690> do<00:03:43.990> he<00:03:44.650> could

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
not something that's easy to do he could

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.620 
not something that's easy to do he could
have<00:03:44.920> been<00:03:45.130> very<00:03:45.160> complacent<00:03:45.850> he<00:03:46.330> could<00:03:46.510> have

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
have been very complacent he could have

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.590 
have been very complacent he could have
just<00:03:46.660> stuck<00:03:47.620> to<00:03:47.830> what<00:03:48.040> he<00:03:48.340> learned<00:03:48.670> but<00:03:49.360> on<00:03:49.480> the

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
just stuck to what he learned but on the

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.780 
just stuck to what he learned but on the
contrary<00:03:49.780> I<00:03:50.260> think<00:03:50.290> what's<00:03:50.890> so<00:03:51.100> exciting<00:03:51.490> is

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
contrary I think what's so exciting is

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.900 
contrary I think what's so exciting is
that<00:03:51.850> tension<00:03:52.480> of<00:03:52.600> each<00:03:52.720> time<00:03:53.020> pushing<00:03:53.350> it<00:03:53.680> and

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
that tension of each time pushing it and

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.760 
that tension of each time pushing it and
experimenting<00:03:54.910> and<00:03:55.110> moving<00:03:56.110> forward<00:03:56.560> and

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
experimenting and moving forward and

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.740 
experimenting and moving forward and
that's<00:03:56.950> really<00:03:57.520> why<00:03:57.730> everybody<00:03:58.180> here<00:03:58.450> is<00:03:58.570> so

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.520 
between between something pure and
