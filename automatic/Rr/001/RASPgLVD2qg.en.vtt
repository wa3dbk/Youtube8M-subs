with v-mon sorry for a little quality

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.680 
with v-mon sorry for a little quality
I'm<00:00:36.570> recording<00:00:37.050> for<00:00:37.140> my<00:00:37.260> iPhone<00:00:37.640> yep<00:00:38.690> there's

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
I'm recording for my iPhone yep there's

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.510 
I'm recording for my iPhone yep there's
the<00:00:39.780> Ammann<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.350> didn't<00:00:40.980> really<00:00:41.129> take<00:00:41.280> care<00:00:41.399> of

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
the Ammann I didn't really take care of

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.860 
the Ammann I didn't really take care of
it<00:00:41.610> because<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:42.030> was<00:00:42.180> too<00:00:42.300> busy<00:00:42.329> playing<00:00:42.750> video

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
it because I was too busy playing video

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.729 
it because I was too busy playing video
games<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.649> guess<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.730> turned<00:00:44.910> into<00:00:45.000> v-mon

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
games so I guess it turned into v-mon

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.010 
games so I guess it turned into v-mon
apparently<00:00:46.739> uh<00:00:47.239> whether<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.390> got<00:00:48.510> autobahn

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
apparently uh whether you got autobahn

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.709 
apparently uh whether you got autobahn
v-mon<00:00:49.410> or<00:00:50.129> guilmon<00:00:50.730> depends<00:00:51.329> on<00:00:51.420> when<00:00:51.690> you

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
v-mon or guilmon depends on when you

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.619 
v-mon or guilmon depends on when you
train<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.110> normally<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.480> your<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
train it normally so you and your the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.270 
train it normally so you and your the
train<00:00:54.840> an<00:00:54.960> afternoon<00:00:55.350> or<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.829> morning<00:00:56.070> or

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
train an afternoon or in the morning or

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.660 
train an afternoon or in the morning or
at<00:00:56.399> night<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:57.239> really<00:00:57.420> randomly<00:00:57.840> depends<00:00:58.670> yeah

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
at night it really randomly depends yeah

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.119 
at night it really randomly depends yeah

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.240 
then you have the normal connect screen
which<00:01:40.200> I'll<00:01:40.409> probably<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.920> middle<00:01:41.220> a

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
which I'll probably like the middle a

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.740 
which I'll probably like the middle a
little<00:01:41.340> battle<00:01:41.759> if<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.030> ever<00:01:42.150> get<00:01:42.329> my<00:01:42.479> armor

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
little battle if I ever get my armor

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.310 
little battle if I ever get my armor
getting<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.079> oh<00:01:43.320> yeah<00:01:44.280> my<00:01:44.579> Armageddon<00:01:45.000> army<00:01:45.240> uh

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.770 

yeah<00:01:49.320> pretty<00:01:49.560> much<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.220> yeah<00:01:51.119> okay

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
yeah pretty much this is it yeah okay

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.469 
yeah pretty much this is it yeah okay
apparently<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.439> keychain<00:01:52.970> part<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.210> really

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
apparently the keychain part is really

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.539 
apparently the keychain part is really
crappy<00:01:54.810> because<00:01:55.140> it's<00:01:55.560> held<00:01:55.770> on<00:01:55.890> by<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.100> plastic

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
crappy because it's held on by a plastic

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.880 
crappy because it's held on by a plastic
part<00:01:56.729> when<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.969> rest<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.270> metal<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.770> like

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
part when the rest is metal so it like

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.800 
part when the rest is metal so it like
snapped<00:01:59.130> off<00:01:59.520> when<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.880> was<00:01:59.969> like<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.090> my<00:02:00.329> bag

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
snapped off when I was like in my bag

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.920 
snapped off when I was like in my bag
like<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.680> first<00:02:01.920> day<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.369> don't<00:02:03.360> put<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.780> on

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
like on the first day so don't put it on

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.109 
like on the first day so don't put it on
a<00:02:03.960> keychain<00:02:04.399> because<00:02:05.399> you'll<00:02:05.729> end<00:02:05.939> up<00:02:05.969> losing

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
a keychain because you'll end up losing

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.969 
a keychain because you'll end up losing
your<00:02:06.329> pendulum<00:02:07.020> if<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.629> so<00:02:09.629> yeah<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:10.050> probably

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
your pendulum if so so yeah I probably

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.890 
your pendulum if so so yeah I probably
another<00:02:11.280> review<00:02:11.640> once<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.209> get<00:02:12.360> my<00:02:12.510> other<00:02:12.720> stuff

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
another review once I get my other stuff

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.120 
another review once I get my other stuff
so

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
so

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.860 
so
like<00:02:13.460> a<00:02:13.820> battle<00:02:14.330> or<00:02:14.420> something<00:02:14.830> yep
