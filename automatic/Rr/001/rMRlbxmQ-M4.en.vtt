00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
proven performance formula that we use

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.900 
proven performance formula that we use
for<00:02:27.750> but<00:02:28.260> it's<00:02:28.440> proven<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.069> make<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.489> crash

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
modern Corvette it's got carbon fiber

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.020 
modern Corvette it's got carbon fiber
it's<00:02:34.320> got<00:02:34.500> magnetic<00:02:35.250> dampers<00:02:35.700> it's<00:02:35.820> got<00:02:35.940> an

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
it's got magnetic dampers it's got an

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.640 
it's got magnetic dampers it's got an
electronic<00:02:36.359> dip<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.930> that's<00:02:37.079> all<00:02:37.230> I'm<00:02:37.380> great

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
electronic dip and that's all I'm great

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.380 
electronic dip and that's all I'm great
but<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.100> was<00:02:38.310> all<00:02:38.459> put<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:38.790> by<00:02:38.970> some<00:02:39.209> guy

the<00:03:41.909> last<00:03:42.150> m3<00:03:42.780> had<00:03:42.959> that<00:03:43.170> high-strung<00:03:43.920> v8<00:03:44.519> in

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
the last m3 had that high-strung v8 in

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.030 
the last m3 had that high-strung v8 in
it<00:03:44.969> and<00:03:45.359> it<00:03:46.049> had<00:03:46.200> a<00:03:46.230> lot<00:03:46.439> of<00:03:46.500> horsepower<00:03:46.980> but

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
it and it had a lot of horsepower but

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.220 
it and it had a lot of horsepower but
not<00:03:47.250> a<00:03:47.280> whole<00:03:47.459> lot<00:03:47.609> of<00:03:47.640> torque<00:03:48.000> so<00:03:48.269> BMW

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
not a whole lot of torque so BMW

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.110 
not a whole lot of torque so BMW
replaced<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.859> with<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.159> more<00:03:50.549> efficient

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
replaced it with a more efficient

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.539 
replaced it with a more efficient
turbocharged<00:03:52.079> engine<00:03:52.409> 96<00:03:52.980> which<00:03:53.250> is<00:03:53.400> their

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
turbocharged engine 96 which is their

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:54.349 
turbocharged engine 96 which is their
bread<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:53.790> butter

bread and butter

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.709 
bread and butter
now<00:03:54.930> horsepower<00:03:55.920> is<00:03:56.010> about<00:03:56.159> the<00:03:56.280> same<00:03:56.489> at<00:03:56.670> 425

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:57.719 
now horsepower is about the same at 425

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:00.140 
now horsepower is about the same at 425
but<00:03:58.200> torque<00:03:58.680> has<00:03:58.829> increased<00:03:59.310> to<00:03:59.579> four<00:03:59.939> hundred

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
111 more than the outgoing car and you

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.559 
111 more than the outgoing car and you
can<00:04:06.989> really<00:04:07.290> feel<00:04:07.500> a<00:04:07.530> difference<00:04:07.980> a<00:04:08.730> lot<00:04:09.420> of

can really feel a difference a lot of

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.030 
can really feel a difference a lot of

sports car companies that go in the way

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.679 
sports car companies that go in the way
for<00:04:11.310> manual<00:04:11.670> transmissions<00:04:12.299> but<00:04:12.480> when<00:04:12.599> you

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:12.689 
for manual transmissions but when you

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:14.179 
for manual transmissions but when you
have<00:04:12.840> one<00:04:12.870> that's<00:04:13.109> as<00:04:13.290> good<00:04:13.409> to<00:04:13.590> use<00:04:13.799> as<00:04:14.010> the

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189 
have one that's as good to use as the
