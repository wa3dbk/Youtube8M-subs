teaching<00:03:24.800> I<00:03:25.010> think<00:03:25.130> it's<00:03:25.790> supposed<00:03:25.970> to<00:03:26.240> be

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
teaching I think it's supposed to be

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.100 
teaching I think it's supposed to be
like<00:03:26.930> a<00:03:27.110> coin<00:03:27.680> purse<00:03:28.070> but<00:03:28.970> I<00:03:29.540> don't<00:03:29.990> know

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
anyway so once you open of it you'll

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.370 
anyway so once you open of it you'll
notice<00:03:32.960> there<00:03:33.110> are<00:03:33.260> some<00:03:33.590> cheese<00:03:34.160> and<00:03:34.550> some

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
notice there are some cheese and some

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.130 
notice there are some cheese and some
googly<00:03:36.380> eyes<00:03:36.530> which<00:03:37.130> I<00:03:37.430> don't<00:03:37.490> even<00:03:37.730> know<00:03:38.150> but

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
googly eyes which I don't even know but

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.050 
googly eyes which I don't even know but
as<00:03:39.650> I've<00:03:39.830> never<00:03:40.040> seen<00:03:40.370> one<00:03:40.460> of<00:03:40.580> these<00:03:40.670> pencil

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
as I've never seen one of these pencil

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.500 
as I've never seen one of these pencil
cases<00:03:41.210> or<00:03:41.570> like<00:03:41.810> these<00:03:42.050> types<00:03:42.470> of<00:03:42.620> bags<00:03:42.860> before

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
cases or like these types of bags before

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.360 
cases or like these types of bags before
basically<00:03:44.510> you<00:03:44.870> just<00:03:44.900> keep<00:03:45.500> unzipping<00:03:46.130> it

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
basically you just keep unzipping it

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.810 
basically you just keep unzipping it
until<00:03:46.700> it<00:03:46.880> unravels<00:03:47.690> itself<00:03:48.050> completely<00:03:48.820> now

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
until it unravels itself completely now

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.670 
until it unravels itself completely now
it<00:03:50.000> is<00:03:50.120> a<00:03:50.300> little<00:03:50.630> bit<00:03:50.780> big<00:03:50.960> for<00:03:50.990> the<00:03:51.230> dolls<00:03:51.410> but

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
it is a little bit big for the dolls but

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.170 
it is a little bit big for the dolls but
I<00:03:51.770> thought<00:03:51.920> it<00:03:52.040> would<00:03:52.100> be<00:03:52.190> a<00:03:52.340> cute<00:03:52.700> kind<00:03:53.090> of
