00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
be two different categories of

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.029 
be two different categories of
multiplayer<00:00:45.780> one<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.829> regular

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
multiplayer one is just a regular

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.799 
multiplayer one is just a regular
multiplayer<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.000> then<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.270> other<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
multiplayer and then the other is the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.720 
multiplayer and then the other is the
campaign<00:00:49.350> multiplayer<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.340> campaign

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
campaign multiplayer so the campaign

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.459 
campaign multiplayer so the campaign
multiplayer<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.449> unlike<00:00:51.809> anything<00:00:52.140> we've

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
multiplayer is unlike anything we've

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.709 
multiplayer is unlike anything we've
ever<00:00:52.500> seen<00:00:52.949> before<00:00:53.160> at<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.120> beginning<00:00:54.390> and

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
ever seen before at the beginning and

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.290 
ever seen before at the beginning and
maybe<00:00:54.960> even<00:00:55.140> throughout<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:56.100> game<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.610> story

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
maybe even throughout the game a story

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.790 
maybe even throughout the game a story
will<00:00:57.480> be<00:00:57.510> taking<00:00:57.989> place<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:58.530> almost

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
will be taking place and it's almost

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.889 
will be taking place and it's almost
like<00:00:59.039> campaign<00:00:59.760> but<00:01:00.059> against<00:01:00.510> other<00:01:00.660> players

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
like campaign but against other players

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.080 
like campaign but against other players
online<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.039> think<00:01:02.520> that's<00:01:02.820> going<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.030> be

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
online so I think that's going to be

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.299 
online so I think that's going to be
absolutely<00:01:03.239> awesome<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.769> can't<00:01:04.979> wait<00:01:05.100> for

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
absolutely awesome and I can't wait for

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.520 
absolutely awesome and I can't wait for
that<00:01:05.430> but<00:01:05.640> anyways<00:01:06.000> unlike<00:01:06.900> call<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.260> duty

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
that but anyways unlike call of duty

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.719 
that but anyways unlike call of duty
where<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:07.950> certain<00:01:08.280> game<00:01:08.430> mode<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.700> you

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
where you have certain game mode so you

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.940 
where you have certain game mode so you
can<00:01:08.909> play<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.119> any<00:01:09.240> map<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.900> titanfall<00:01:10.560> there's

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
can play on any map in titanfall there's

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.200 
can play on any map in titanfall there's
gonna<00:01:11.070> be<00:01:11.220> certain<00:01:11.580> game<00:01:11.790> modes<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.090> are

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
only compatible with certain maps

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.190 
only compatible with certain maps
because<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.729> campaign<00:01:15.060> multiplayer<00:01:15.270> so

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
different maps the first is fracture

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.320 
different maps the first is fracture
which<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.100> described<00:01:23.430> as<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.610> fuel<00:01:23.909> depot

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
which is described as a fuel depot

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.200 
which is described as a fuel depot
multiplayer<00:01:24.960> arena<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.979> second<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.580> lagoon<00:01:27.030> a

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
multiplayer arena the second is lagoon a

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.420 
multiplayer arena the second is lagoon a
run-down<00:01:27.509> shantytown<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.650> then<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.220> third

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
run-down shantytown and then the third

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.399 
run-down shantytown and then the third
is<00:01:29.610> angel<00:01:29.970> city<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.390> futuristic<00:01:31.200> city

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
is angel city a futuristic city

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.740 
is angel city a futuristic city
multiplayer<00:01:32.040> arena<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.700> then<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.540> first

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
multiplayer arena and then the first

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.030 
multiplayer arena and then the first
game<00:01:34.110> mode<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.409> we've<00:01:34.530> heard<00:01:34.680> about<00:01:34.860> is

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
game mode that we've heard about is

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.740 
game mode that we've heard about is
attrition<00:01:35.579> which<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.880> basically<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.509> same<00:01:36.540> as

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
attrition which is basically the same as

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.960 
attrition which is basically the same as
team<00:01:37.079> deathmatch<00:01:37.470> from<00:01:37.710> other<00:01:37.890> FPS<00:01:38.159> games<00:01:38.670> and

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
team deathmatch from other FPS games and

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.090 
team deathmatch from other FPS games and
I<00:01:39.479> believe<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.020> can<00:01:40.110> be<00:01:40.229> plain<00:01:40.530> it's<00:01:40.979> going

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
I believe this can be plain it's going

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.550 
I believe this can be plain it's going
to<00:01:41.159> be<00:01:41.250> played<00:01:41.490> on<00:01:41.610> Angel<00:01:42.000> City<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.170> second

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
to be played on Angel City so the second

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.260 
to be played on Angel City so the second
confirmed<00:01:43.890> game<00:01:44.100> mode<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.399> hard<00:01:44.610> point<00:01:44.850> which

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
confirmed game mode is hard point which

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.910 
confirmed game mode is hard point which
is<00:01:45.420> basically<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.960> same<00:01:45.990> as<00:01:46.170> nomination<00:01:46.799> from

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
is basically the same as nomination from

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.740 
is basically the same as nomination from
call<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.220> duty<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.640> they<00:01:48.060> haven't<00:01:48.360> said<00:01:48.509> what

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
call of duty and they haven't said what

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.359 
call of duty and they haven't said what
maps<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.200> will<00:01:49.320> be<00:01:49.439> compatible<00:01:49.950> for<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.280> I'm

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
maps it will be compatible for so I'm

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.230 
maps it will be compatible for so I'm
guessing<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.790> just<00:01:51.000> going<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.180> be

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
guessing this just going to be

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.910 
guessing this just going to be
compatible<00:01:51.570> for<00:01:52.049> most<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.409> them<00:01:52.590> or<00:01:52.770> maybe

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
compatible for most of them or maybe

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.830 
compatible for most of them or maybe
know<00:01:53.220> them<00:01:53.490> or<00:01:53.939> maybe<00:01:54.119> which<00:01:54.240> one<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.479> them<00:01:54.659> and

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
know them or maybe which one of them and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.480 
know them or maybe which one of them and
they<00:01:54.899> haven't<00:01:55.110> told<00:01:55.170> us<00:01:55.290> yet<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:56.070> something

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
they haven't told us yet so something

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.530 
they haven't told us yet so something
else<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.759> has<00:01:56.850> been<00:01:57.030> confirmed<00:01:57.360> as<00:01:57.509> the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
else that has been confirmed as the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.270 
else that has been confirmed as the
scoring<00:01:58.079> system<00:01:58.200> for<00:01:58.619> attrition<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.100> hard

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
scoring system for attrition and hard

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.800 
scoring system for attrition and hard
point<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.939> I'll<00:02:00.030> throw<00:02:00.210> up<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.390> chart<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:00.719> you

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
point so I'll throw up a chart so you

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.899 
point so I'll throw up a chart so you
guys<00:02:00.960> can<00:02:01.140> see<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.680> as<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.369> guys<00:02:02.430> can

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
guys can see that and as you guys can

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.340 
guys can see that and as you guys can
see<00:02:02.969> them<00:02:03.329> you're<00:02:03.570> going<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.750> get<00:02:03.869> most<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.259> the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
see them you're going to get most of the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.139 
see them you're going to get most of the
points<00:02:04.500> from<00:02:04.649> killing<00:02:05.100> enemies<00:02:05.399> Titans<00:02:06.000> and

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
points from killing enemies Titans and

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.400 
points from killing enemies Titans and
also<00:02:06.390> capturing<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.990> objectives<00:02:07.500> and

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
also capturing the objectives and

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.600 
also capturing the objectives and
our<00:02:08.500> point<00:02:08.710> they're<00:02:08.830> going<00:02:08.860> to<00:02:09.010> be<00:02:09.070> labeled<00:02:09.430> a

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
our point they're going to be labeled a

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.850 
our point they're going to be labeled a
B<00:02:09.820> and<00:02:09.940> C<00:02:10.030> so<00:02:10.780> I'm<00:02:10.900> really<00:02:11.050> curious<00:02:11.320> to<00:02:11.500> see<00:02:11.740> if

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
B and C so I'm really curious to see if

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.470 
B and C so I'm really curious to see if
there's<00:02:12.040> going<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:12.280> be<00:02:12.340> any<00:02:12.430> score<00:02:13.030> streak<00:02:13.300> or

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
there's going to be any score streak or

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.390 
there's going to be any score streak or
point<00:02:13.810> streak<00:02:14.050> or<00:02:14.230> kill<00:02:14.590> streak<00:02:14.830> type<00:02:15.010> system

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
point streak or kill streak type system

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.250 
point streak or kill streak type system
in<00:02:15.520> this<00:02:15.580> game<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:15.970> honestly<00:02:16.750> I<00:02:16.840> kind<00:02:17.050> of<00:02:17.140> hope

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
in this game and honestly I kind of hope

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260 
in this game and honestly I kind of hope
not<00:02:17.320> and<00:02:17.800> this<00:02:18.460> might<00:02:18.640> seem<00:02:18.820> a<00:02:18.880> little<00:02:19.120> bit

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
not and this might seem a little bit

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.120 
not and this might seem a little bit
off-topic<00:02:19.660> but<00:02:19.990> one<00:02:20.560> of<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.710> reasons<00:02:20.950> I've

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
off-topic but one of the reasons I've

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.800 
off-topic but one of the reasons I've
always<00:02:21.310> liked<00:02:21.550> battlefield<00:02:22.060> so<00:02:22.300> much<00:02:22.450> is<00:02:22.630> just

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
always liked battlefield so much is just

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.270 
always liked battlefield so much is just
because<00:02:23.140> there<00:02:23.320> are<00:02:23.440> no<00:02:23.590> killstreaks<00:02:24.100> and

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
because there are no killstreaks and

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.010 
because there are no killstreaks and
nobody<00:02:24.520> really<00:02:24.730> cares<00:02:25.060> much<00:02:25.300> about<00:02:25.330> Katie<00:02:25.720> and

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
nobody really cares much about Katie and

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.450 
nobody really cares much about Katie and
it's<00:02:26.440> pretty<00:02:26.560> much<00:02:26.740> just<00:02:26.800> all<00:02:27.100> about<00:02:27.160> the

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
it's pretty much just all about the

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.550 
it's pretty much just all about the
objective<00:02:27.940> which<00:02:28.120> I<00:02:28.240> really<00:02:28.450> like<00:02:28.750> so<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.260> can't

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
objective which I really like so I can't

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.750 
objective which I really like so I can't
help<00:02:29.710> but<00:02:29.830> hope<00:02:30.040> that<00:02:30.280> there<00:02:30.430> isn't<00:02:30.610> gonna<00:02:30.670> be

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
help but hope that there isn't gonna be

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.150 
help but hope that there isn't gonna be
any<00:02:30.850> killstreak<00:02:31.390> system<00:02:31.780> but<00:02:32.290> anyways<00:02:32.680> the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
any killstreak system but anyways the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.920 
any killstreak system but anyways the
creatives<00:02:33.700> have<00:02:34.030> also<00:02:34.420> said<00:02:34.660> that<00:02:34.690> we're

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
creatives have also said that we're

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.180 
creatives have also said that we're
going<00:02:35.020> to<00:02:35.110> learn<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.260> lot<00:02:35.380> more<00:02:35.770> in<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.070> coming

that happens I'm planning to do a

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.400 
that happens I'm planning to do a
titanfall<00:02:39.940> video<00:02:40.300> for<00:02:40.570> everything<00:02:41.140> you<00:02:41.230> need
