00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.859
 so this productive chain of the

 poultry sector and the federal government 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:25.920

 very rigorous to protect it from all 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.650
 the diseases this company manages the 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.110
 same chronological age is also a 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.970
 immunological help because they are all 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.010
 created at the same time all are vaccinated 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.220
 at the same time that gives them an age 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.200
 same minimum in immunology for a

 850,000 per day 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.190
 This product is subjected to a process of 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.190

 that is not fertilized and optimal 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.070
 conditions to be packaged 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.229
 definitely consume egg is the

 most perfect protein nature 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.720
 has created any protein that is 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.200
