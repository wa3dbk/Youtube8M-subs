00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.790
 Hello dear friends with you about 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.640
 joker and you guessed it by 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.529
 the title of the video I announce the competition for 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.410
 The best screen saver it is called 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.150
 competition for the best screensaver and such 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.990
 competition can participate absolutely 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.460
 any person doesn't have to be like that 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.560
 residents of a particular country or 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.930
 be sure to subscribe to my channel 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.170
 or my VKontakte group at least every 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.450
 should do it so the rules are very 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.970
 simple and drove by the rules and i 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.340
 a little comment on their screen saver 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.770
 should be done in any program 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.170
 sony vegas hell examples and others 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.790
 that is, it doesn't matter to me which program 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.120
 get out and do the main thing that it was 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:03.360
 done like a video and drove on 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.140
 screen saver duration up to 15 seconds test 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.450
 but they also held a long bet so 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.150
 I set a hell for 15 seconds 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.920
 just right next screen saver should not 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.909
 break the rules youtube and beggars 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.390
 copyright 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.969
 beautiful gelatin screensavers should not be 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.829
 look like someone's screensaver so they are here 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:25.229
 we did not swear and also there should 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.390
 used legal music to 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.280
 youtube also did not swear at me and to anyone 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.380
 didn't pay money for what i use 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.100
 their music 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.670
 savers must 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.159
 attend my nickname is probably the most 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.619
 the main thing is that there should be a screensaver 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.719
 Of course wishes not to do mining with 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.119
 capital letters or just big letters 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:48.479
 either just small with a capital letter not 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.310
 Need to go further saver necessarily 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.590
 there must be salt there on any 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.929
 video hosting is certainly desirable 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.770
 must be youtube youtube and that to me in 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:01.139
 a couple of days and also the video should be 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.679
 be called a screensaver for the contest and your 

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:06.749
 nickname also you can use it your 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.520
 some screensaver that you make a 

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:10.500
 ready maybe you will find some 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.230
 such a very wonderful screensaver 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.730
 that everyone will like and maybe she 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.310
 will be used 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.959
 video your work place in 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.530
 special topic in the VKontakte group 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.180
 the link is now in your description there when 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.970
 You will have a special form. 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.410
 under number 1 you insert your nickname by 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:34.310
 number 2 expose leads which 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.410
 contains my screen saver and numeral 3 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.959
 Take a screenshot of your programs in 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.360
 which you did your work to me very 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.069
 I wonder how you work what 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.930
 program and much more 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.599
 if anyone has any 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.849
 questions about the competition do not need them 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.829
 write in the comments do not write them 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.950
 everywhere for this exists 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.629
 special topic is also somewhere among the topics 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.609

 your data on the screen saver of course 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:10.739
 I do not need to specify this description 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:13.530
 in general it seems to me undesirable 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:17.010
 many will ask what kind of a prize 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.090
 freebies where freebies what to get a prize 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.010
 is 2500 golds perhaps the tone 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.440

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.720

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.419

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:45.349
