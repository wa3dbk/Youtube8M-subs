00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.030
 today again from my mistake I 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:08.490
 with you was pulled side promised 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.570
 take and should you in hennef before and 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.339
 I explain you there such a small 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.629
 little bit the construction and the function is 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.369
 a question that is always in the whole 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:18.060
 many reasons comes what is in a f 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:20.310
 how does that clarify today that I am 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.019
 this can show you at two pools 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.769
 which I made new today like 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.619
 before 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.230
 those are the two here and they were 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.789
 previously set exactly like the smoke 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.300
 So, in principle, four times I have 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.190
 here are two cut-offs except at 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.219
 to have two larger pool for bigger 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.170
 animals that we will come in soon 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.870
 I can see you here at the ixs rookies there 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.640
 See you best, I can tell you that 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.899
 show beautiful behind there you see so already 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.739
 a little bit blue the sponge 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.870
 filter yes there before is a small one 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.730
 Piece of plastic around the filter a bit 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.899
 cover 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.899
 I like to show you that from the top here 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.219
 the sponge is just behind it 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.589
 I can only live a small air 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.450
 Getting them out is only possible 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.350
 Plastic tube that is open at the bottom 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.420
 so that you can attract water 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.939
 here is a small opening for one 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.110
 air hose I plug you again 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.590
 right on it will just me 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.259
 Dismantling through the air hose hose 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.759
 air is spiked in our rows 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.479
 then go up and pull like that 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.310
 water on 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.619
 not that now sees rolled into the water 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.960
 it is also equal to the air pressure 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.350
 It will now be due to the air pressure 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:39.119
 pumped it down now and that will 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.520
 simply put behind the filter mat 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.759
 that is what the water is attracted to now 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.969
 will go through the filter and then will 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:51.200
 pulled up without taking out that was 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.200
 once to function 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.480
 ok here it goes on I have you 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.610
 at the end just shown how it works 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.510
 I've built it, of course, there are 12 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.860
 advise hf to install something after basin 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.780
 size is different as I am 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.500
 is now for the train block 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.290
 preferably 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.430
 Here I have also immediately separated 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.400
 I am giving out of the bets 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.850
 I can separate you so 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.050
 show a little more detail 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.030
 That's what you've just seen 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:26.160
 then we have the plastic part afterwards 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:29.870
 increasing the spout gets along that are 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.870
 my filter sponges this square 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.580
 in most of the trade you get 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.290
 However, only filters make the 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.750
 Either I'll show you right away 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.400
 but that's the way it is now 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.780
 turn the whole time around then we can 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.600
 namely from behind the filter 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:50.970
 that's what this page looks like 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.030
 sticks now completely press behind yours 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:58.350
 backdoor here comes then now 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.150
 the hfv so marriage before the fathers mat and 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.340
 you must not necessarily for the air spring 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.750
 Use as I have enough 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.700
 usually a very small one too 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.959
 hose when you work with knives 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.480
 Of course, I have them again soon 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.580
 The biggest thing was in the kitchen 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.260
 you can almost do it on your own 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.470
 just take a piece of hose where you 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:22.170
 you guys pretty far down a little 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:24.420
 hole pure stands it up your 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.100
 put air hose through so that the 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.290
 air is driven upwards 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.489
 If you do that then it will be the whole thing 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:36.540
 Total air hose including air hose 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.860
 plugged in from above and the last 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.790
 that you grain come out again 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.920
 means now rises in the hose pulls 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.680
 look at the water and push your way 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.600
 Out front that is so cheap 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.180
 damned here in my whole basin 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.510
 come but there are still the 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.439
 method 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.909
 to do very differently we stand now 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.950
 especially a valium here is the 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:03.409
 windshield the black should now 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.629
 be your backseat and that one 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:07.329
 side disc with that quite simply the 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.709
 method with a cable duct to the 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:12.409
 Baumarkt for really very small 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.909
 Money gets a winter coat to stick 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:18.019
 and you pick up then just 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:19.789
 aquarium silicone that's something kitchens 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.440
 and aquariums are customers because that is 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:25.190
 In any case, start free for the fish 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.949
 Dries very fast 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.560
 then there is the possibility 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:31.430
 Unfiltered so incorporate if yours 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.410
 rear wheel is so yours 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.240
 then side slices just this 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.699
 cable channel worked apart for that 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.500
 is called two halves that just so far 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.669
 you are also your filter 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.370
 can insert 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:46.250
 that would mean he sticks here 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.889
 a cable channel you stick here 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.840
 a cable channel and then the 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.490
 filter mat from the top into the cable channel 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.510
 then put the mat automatically 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:05:01.370
 stops then we go through the 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:05.449
 filter mat still allowing us to 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:08.060
 Insert tube through the filter mat 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:10.580
 The water could also be at your house 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.990
 out again that is called the movie too 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.380
 turn is you have that in there 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:18.110
 comes the hose behind the filter 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.880
 Matt and then through the filter 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.270
 matte determined by said Konstantin 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.039
 intoxication 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.349
 How can I easily show that? 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:27.380
 if we take a shot from the top 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:29.360
 make basin of crete because I have the 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:33.220
 right out of the filter sponge comes out 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.419
 the lack of water was out again 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:39.199
 I hope it all has you this way 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:41.599
 Little bit helped and should 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.750
 questions were to the room f and we 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:46.850
 need more stimulate 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:49.350
 or ezb comments under the video 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.390
 Also, let's say I'm doing this 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.940
 all with a compressor of 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:57.990
 Movable all my tanks supplied 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.670
 By air I advise you to pick it up 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.290
 a small membrane points that's enough 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.450
 Of course, depending on the basin 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.980
 i hope i could help you with that 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:08.630
 help a little bit because he did ask 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:11.010
 hautz company asking for the video 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.690
 We are then in anything from him I 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.380
 I wish you much fun and had you 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.380
 well then
