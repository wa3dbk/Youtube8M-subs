00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
it might take a bit longer than usual

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.380 
it might take a bit longer than usual
because<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.340> creating<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.759> new<00:01:23.880> account<00:01:24.000> so

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390
