00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:03.800
 ten years ago ten years ago the suzuki hayabusa 7 and the most powerful motorcycle 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.070
 of the market is caught up by competitors from the subject countries which misleads 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.469
 resumes the combat the return to the fight with the new hall abou zahab 1340 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.049
 cubic centimeter a power monster not really road not completely 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.230
 sporty it's a UFO and philippe monneret necessarily to you has them 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.689
 tested alex crockett 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.859
 in 1999 we were on the market a missile 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.109
 which rolls more than 300 kilometers an hour the gsx r 1000 said that 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.989
 ten years later the Japanese hawk comes back with a new look and 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:34.989
 new performances 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.660
 if at first glance we do not see the huge difference with the original 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.850
 the 2008 version on many points it's totally new 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.410
 then new momentum in terms of the cycle part with it 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.900
 a new chassis mm 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.900
 new suspensions and then we redrew it 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.790
 a better aerodynamics 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.720
 so it's worth the engine we also 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.180
 worked a lot apart this year 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.900
 four cylinders online 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.600
 after 140 cubic centimeters 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.860
 4 valves per injection cylinder with a novelty like his friend's subject 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.840
 who does so if some 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.869
 that is to say we have 3 different operating mode for the engine 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.869
 of yahoo according to the weather conditions at the pilotage level 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.470
 suzuki has classified the bouza in the category of road it does not prevent 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.649
 it must be said 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.400
 but we find the sensations of a sportswoman 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.400
 for the current practice part in the world 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.800
 for the parties 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.630
 exactly why the prosecutor 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.950
 christine vernay 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.970
 quite know 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.970
 we see many others 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.290
 the pop-up 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.290
 so a huge job 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.850
 relatively light 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.700
 540 meters 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.840
 quÃ©bec it rolls with this world it is on this that we progressed a lot 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.840
 we suspensions 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.869
 import them from the road rises 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.949
 the most exceptional French exception of 106 horses and not 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:15.299
 not 197 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.399
 on some motorcycles the clamping spoils the pleasure 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:21.979
 this is not the case we have lost a lot of 0 8% in volume 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:27.589
 in order to scare 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:33.839
 you will not compare an equivalent petrol engine 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:36.799
 hayabusa 2008 remains a UFO on the motorcycle market 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.190
 a question however what to make of such a monster on the roads of France 

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:59.299
 its decor we are on the castellet circuit 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.000
 moto change philippe monneret rides the free version and its 197 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:05.549
 horses 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.739
 for the little story besides you stop the fighter plane of the army 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.739
 Japanese 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:15.689
