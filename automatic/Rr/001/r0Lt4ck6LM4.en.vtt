that<00:04:32.370> actually<00:04:33.370> use<00:04:33.490> maybe<00:04:33.730> half<00:04:33.970> so<00:04:34.180> I<00:04:34.240> have<00:04:34.360> a

darker<00:05:22.840> color<00:05:23.440> because<00:05:24.430> of<00:05:24.460> the<00:05:24.640> balsamic

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
darker color because of the balsamic

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.780 
darker color because of the balsamic
vinegar<00:05:25.900> but<00:05:26.650> it<00:05:27.280> still<00:05:27.490> looks<00:05:27.700> pretty

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
vinegar but it still looks pretty

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:28.440 
vinegar but it still looks pretty
similar

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
instructions so this was really good the

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.260 
instructions so this was really good the
chicken<00:05:56.680> was<00:05:56.980> flavorful<00:05:57.460> because<00:05:57.910> it<00:05:58.180> was

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
chicken was flavorful because it was

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.540 
chicken was flavorful because it was
seasoned<00:05:59.230> with<00:05:59.470> salt<00:05:59.800> and<00:06:00.010> pepper

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
seasoned with salt and pepper

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.670 
seasoned with salt and pepper
before<00:06:01.210> the<00:06:01.870> panko<00:06:02.350> parmesan<00:06:03.280> breading<00:06:04.560> so<00:06:05.560> it

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
before the panko parmesan breading so it

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.230 
before the panko parmesan breading so it
still<00:06:05.890> didn't<00:06:06.100> have<00:06:06.190> flavor<00:06:06.520> it<00:06:06.820> was<00:06:06.970> cooked

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
still didn't have flavor it was cooked

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.920 
still didn't have flavor it was cooked
all<00:06:07.360> the<00:06:07.510> way

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
all the way

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.090 
all the way
yay<00:06:09.480> but<00:06:10.480> it<00:06:10.570> wasn't<00:06:10.930> dry<00:06:11.080> it<00:06:11.320> was<00:06:11.410> still<00:06:11.650> juicy

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
yay but it wasn't dry it was still juicy

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.870 
yay but it wasn't dry it was still juicy
and<00:06:13.290> I've<00:06:14.290> had<00:06:14.500> that<00:06:14.680> crispy<00:06:15.220> coating<00:06:15.580> on<00:06:15.820> the

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 
and I've had that crispy coating on the

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.340 
and I've had that crispy coating on the
outside<00:06:16.530> the<00:06:17.530> tomato<00:06:18.300> garlic<00:06:19.300> green<00:06:20.080> onion

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.350 
outside the tomato garlic green onion

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.810 
outside the tomato garlic green onion
salad<00:06:20.890> was<00:06:21.160> really<00:06:21.400> good

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820 
salad was really good

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.460 
salad was really good
basically<00:06:22.720> it's<00:06:22.870> just<00:06:22.900> like<00:06:23.020> roasted

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470 
basically it's just like roasted

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.020 
basically it's just like roasted
tomatoes<00:06:23.830> so<00:06:24.010> they<00:06:24.100> were<00:06:24.190> really<00:06:24.430> soft<00:06:24.700> and

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
tomatoes so they were really soft and

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.790 
tomatoes so they were really soft and
then<00:06:25.660> the<00:06:25.750> potato<00:06:25.990> salad<00:06:26.290> was<00:06:26.350> good<00:06:26.500> as<00:06:26.650> well

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
then the potato salad was good as well

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.620 
then the potato salad was good as well
it<00:06:27.370> did<00:06:27.640> kind<00:06:28.060> of<00:06:28.090> have<00:06:28.180> like<00:06:28.330> a<00:06:28.420> strong

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
it did kind of have like a strong

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.820 
it did kind of have like a strong
balsamic<00:06:29.530> vinegar<00:06:30.160> flavor<00:06:31.440> but<00:06:32.440> it<00:06:32.530> had<00:06:32.650> the

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
balsamic vinegar flavor but it had the

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.400 
balsamic vinegar flavor but it had the
green<00:06:33.070> onion<00:06:33.340> flavor<00:06:33.580> as<00:06:33.760> well<00:06:34.110> so<00:06:35.110> it's

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.410 
green onion flavor as well so it's

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.900 
green onion flavor as well so it's
another<00:06:35.590> success

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 
another success

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.710 
another success
so<00:06:37.600> I<00:06:37.630> had<00:06:37.990> one<00:06:38.230> serving<00:06:38.740> up<00:06:39.040> slick<00:06:39.970> come<00:06:40.300> here

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 
so I had one serving up slick come here

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.130 
so I had one serving up slick come here
I'll<00:06:41.290> probably<00:06:41.560> have<00:06:41.740> the<00:06:42.840> second<00:06:43.840> serving

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.140 
I'll probably have the second serving

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.360 
I'll probably have the second serving
