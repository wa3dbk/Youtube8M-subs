there<00:05:24.700> it<00:05:25.300> won't<00:05:25.630> hold<00:05:25.840> very<00:05:26.320> well<00:05:26.650> but<00:05:26.920> if<00:05:27.400> you

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
there it won't hold very well but if you

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
use a a gray one it will slip out eat

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.120 
use a a gray one it will slip out eat
least<00:05:34.360> I<00:05:34.600> recommend<00:05:35.200> that<00:05:35.500> if<00:05:35.680> you<00:05:35.830> try<00:05:36.070> the

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
least I recommend that if you try the

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.250 
least I recommend that if you try the
same<00:05:36.460> technique<00:05:36.940> you<00:05:37.300> use<00:05:37.510> the<00:05:37.720> black<00:05:37.960> ones

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
same technique you use the black ones

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.980 
same technique you use the black ones
because<00:05:38.620> they<00:05:38.830> have<00:05:39.010> more<00:05:39.960> durability<00:05:40.960> than

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
because they have more durability than

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.830 
because they have more durability than
the<00:05:41.890> great<00:05:42.550> ones<00:05:42.850> if<00:05:43.090> we<00:05:43.240> bring<00:05:43.420> ones<00:05:43.660> are

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
the great ones if we bring ones are
