00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
but it gets so difficult like I'm

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.330 
but it gets so difficult like I'm
looking<00:01:09.960> at<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.350> leaderboards<00:01:10.920> right<00:01:11.130> now

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
like level 30 31 it gets to a point

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.100 
like level 30 31 it gets to a point
where<00:01:23.369> even<00:01:23.610> when<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.090> have<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> mark<00:01:24.689> 20

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.039 
weapon it's just not strong enough like
a<00:01:27.990> level<00:01:28.530> 31<00:01:28.890> most<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.119> time<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.630> was<00:01:30.720> taking

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
a level 31 most the time it was taking

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.719 
a level 31 most the time it was taking
two<00:01:31.290> shots<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.920> be<00:01:32.040> able<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.280> kill<00:01:32.520> zombies

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
two shots to be able to kill zombies

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.670 
two shots to be able to kill zombies
with<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.630> know<00:01:33.720> mark<00:01:33.960> 20<00:01:34.229> cauterizer

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
with that you know mark 20 cauterizer

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.469 
with that you know mark 20 cauterizer
and<00:01:34.979> that's<00:01:35.340> going<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.610> be<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:36.150> got<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.420> be

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
and that's going to be it's got to be

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.819 
and that's going to be it's got to be
like<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.720> strongest<00:01:36.960> gun<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.409> game<00:01:37.590> right

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
like the strongest gun in the game right

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.530 
like the strongest gun in the game right
so<00:01:38.070> it's<00:01:38.189> just<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.610> gets<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:39.119> point<00:01:39.299> where

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
so it's just it gets the point where

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.179 
so it's just it gets the point where
it's<00:01:39.689> just<00:01:39.840> absolutely<00:01:40.350> nuts<00:01:40.590> if<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.100> guys

are<00:01:41.400> trying<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.700> go<00:01:41.880> for<00:01:42.119> those<00:01:42.540> big<00:01:42.840> rounds

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
are trying to go for those big rounds

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.310 
are trying to go for those big rounds
the<00:01:43.640> kind<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.670> like<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.030> know<00:01:45.060> swarm<00:01:45.899> thing

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
the kind of like you know swarm thing

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.899 
the kind of like you know swarm thing
that<00:01:46.560> attracts<00:01:47.100> all<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.310> zombies<00:01:47.610> it's<00:01:47.729> kind

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.490 
that attracts all the zombies it's kind
of<00:01:47.939> like<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.299> monkey<00:01:48.930> bomb<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.290> really

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
of like the the monkey bomb is really

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.010 
of like the the monkey bomb is really
crucial<00:01:49.710> as<00:01:49.979> well<00:01:50.579> as<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.000> nano<00:01:51.210> grenades<00:01:51.780> so

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.430 
mistake of getting myself three all the
way<00:02:46.340> to<00:02:46.400> level<00:02:46.580> 20<00:02:46.970> way<00:02:47.180> too<00:02:47.240> quickly<00:02:47.690> and<00:02:48.050> I

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
way to level 20 way too quickly and I

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.680 
way to level 20 way too quickly and I
ended<00:02:48.650> up<00:02:48.770> running<00:02:49.070> out<00:02:49.370> of<00:02:49.430> ammo<00:02:49.940> whereas<00:02:50.420> if

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
ended up running out of ammo whereas if

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.510 
ended up running out of ammo whereas if
I<00:02:50.810> would<00:02:50.990> have<00:02:51.080> saved<00:02:51.410> it<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:51.830> just<00:02:52.010> upgraded

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
I would have saved it and just upgraded

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.430 
I would have saved it and just upgraded
it<00:02:52.640> once<00:02:52.880> every<00:02:53.090> round<00:02:53.480> I<00:02:53.780> would<00:02:54.260> have<00:02:54.350> been

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
it once every round I would have been

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.230 
it once every round I would have been
able<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:54.680> get<00:02:54.860> a<00:02:54.890> max<00:02:55.220> ammo<00:02:55.550> every<00:02:55.910> single

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
able to get a max ammo every single

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.100 
able to get a max ammo every single
round<00:02:56.360> which<00:02:56.630> would<00:02:56.750> have<00:02:56.840> been<00:02:56.930> much<00:02:57.080> more

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
round which would have been much more

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.080 
round which would have been much more
useful<00:02:57.680> so<00:02:57.920> that's<00:02:58.520> something<00:02:58.730> just<00:02:58.940> for<00:02:59.030> you
