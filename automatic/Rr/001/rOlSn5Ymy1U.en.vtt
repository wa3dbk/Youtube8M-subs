the column stacks when you push down on
them<00:01:46.619> they<00:01:46.649> actually<00:01:46.860> expand<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.030> they're

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
them they actually expand and they're

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.429 
flex like kind of fibers and stuff and
that's<00:01:51.119> kind<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.360> how<00:01:51.450> they<00:01:51.600> show<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.320> me

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
technology this is crazy it's gonna be a

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.410 
technology this is crazy it's gonna be a
game-changer<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.889> then<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.819> wasn't<00:02:36.120> very

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
game-changer and then it wasn't very

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.209 
game-changer and then it wasn't very
well<00:02:36.599> received<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.260> then<00:02:37.409> I<00:02:37.620> don't<00:02:37.920> know<00:02:38.010> why

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:38.219

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.740 
I'm not a historian about all this stuff
but<00:02:49.950> as<00:02:50.459> far<00:02:50.669> as<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.849> remember<00:02:50.879> this<00:02:51.480> was<00:02:51.659> the

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
but as far as I remember this was the

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.740 
but as far as I remember this was the
first<00:02:51.959> shoe<00:02:52.109> that<00:02:52.139> I<00:02:52.290> saw<00:02:52.680> with<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.569> Zoom<00:02:54.569> air

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
first shoe that I saw with the Zoom air

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.740 
first shoe that I saw with the Zoom air
the<00:02:55.019> visible<00:02:55.680> Zoom<00:02:55.859> air<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.189> then<00:02:56.970> now<00:02:57.689> we

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
the visible Zoom air and then now we
