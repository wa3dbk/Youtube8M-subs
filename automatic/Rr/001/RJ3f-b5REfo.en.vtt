and tell them I started working with it

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.180 
and tell them I started working with it
for<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.240> little<00:00:12.300> while

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190

and Charles you've got three different
types<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.699> charging<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.240> got<00:00:27.420> 55<00:00:27.960> amp

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
types of charging you got 55 amp

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.589 
types of charging you got 55 amp
charging<00:00:28.920> which<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.340> when<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.119> want<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.359> start

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
charging which is when you want to start

your vehicle to give it the most juice
possible<00:00:33.590> you<00:00:34.590> have<00:00:34.829> an<00:00:34.920> amp<00:00:35.250> high<00:00:36.030> rate<00:00:36.329> of

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
possible you have an amp high rate of

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.280 
possible you have an amp high rate of
charge<00:00:36.780> which<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.350> 10<00:00:38.010> amps<00:00:39.050> which<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.200> going

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
charge which is 10 amps which is going

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.850 
charge which is 10 amps which is going
to<00:00:40.350> be<00:00:40.590> your<00:00:40.860> um<00:00:41.540> your<00:00:42.540> rapid<00:00:43.020> charging<00:00:43.500> and

to be your um your rapid charging and

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.830 
to be your um your rapid charging and
then<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.190> got<00:00:44.399> 2<00:00:44.879> amps<00:00:45.270> which<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.539> your<00:00:45.719> low

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
then you got 2 amps which is your low

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.750 
then you got 2 amps which is your low
rate<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.079> charge<00:00:46.410> or<00:00:46.739> your<00:00:46.920> trickle<00:00:47.309> charger

hooked<00:01:06.630> up<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.049> car<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.619> don't<00:01:07.920> want<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.100> start

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
hooked up to a car I don't want to start

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.340 
hooked up to a car I don't want to start
it<00:01:08.430> right<00:01:08.460> now<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.939> put<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:09.810> one<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.200> red

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
it right now I put this one on the red

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.750 
it right now I put this one on the red
I'm<00:01:10.650> gonna<00:01:10.770> start<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.840> put<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:13.110> 55<00:01:13.760> and

I'm gonna start I put that on 55 and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.039 
I'm gonna start I put that on 55 and
that<00:01:14.850> gives<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.210> much<00:01:15.330> power<00:01:15.390> as<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.840> can

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
that gives you so much power as you can

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.590 
that gives you so much power as you can
get<00:01:17.420> since<00:01:18.420> we're<00:01:18.570> not<00:01:18.659> doing<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:20.600> what

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
get since we're not doing that what

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.149 
get since we're not doing that what
we're<00:01:21.689> gonna<00:01:21.750> do<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.409> we're<00:01:22.799> gonna<00:01:22.860> trickle

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
we're gonna do is we're gonna trickle

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.760 
we're gonna do is we're gonna trickle
charge<00:01:23.490> this<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:24.240> rapid<00:01:24.960> charge<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.350> excuse<00:01:25.590> me

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
charge this a rapid charge it excuse me

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.530 
charge this a rapid charge it excuse me
so<00:01:26.460> that's<00:01:26.580> gonna<00:01:26.759> go<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.210> left<00:01:27.390> which

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
so that's gonna go in to the left which

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.810 
so that's gonna go in to the left which
is<00:01:27.659> on<00:01:27.780> charge<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.409> then<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.070> have<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.490> start

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
is on charge and then you have the start

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.300 
is on charge and then you have the start
function<00:01:30.570> which<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> first<00:01:31.409> one<00:01:31.560> we're

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
function which is the first one we're

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.270 
function which is the first one we're
not<00:01:32.460> gonna<00:01:32.579> use<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.710> even<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.979> first

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
not gonna use that even have the first

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.300 
not gonna use that even have the first
switch<00:01:35.549> which<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.810> fast<00:01:37.079> charge<00:01:37.470> which<00:01:38.280> is

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
switch which is the fast charge which is

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.569 
switch which is the fast charge which is
10<00:01:38.729> amps<00:01:39.439> you<00:01:40.439> have<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.920> second<00:01:41.310> switch

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
10 amps you have the second switch

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.649 
10 amps you have the second switch
setting<00:01:43.670> which<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.820> 2<00:01:45.119> amps<00:01:45.619> which<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.829> for
