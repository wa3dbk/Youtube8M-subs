00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.260
 my second video I'm going to talk about 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.660
 myths and legends the first one will be of 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.610
 a game of sega called are iker the 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.980
 which one of the characters is the 'times' 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.380
 2 is a myth that was formed years ago 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.330
 when in california angels a 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.940
 mother found her son dead while 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.980
 he was playing in his sega saturn console 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.690
 they are iker the mother when doing her 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.970
 statement said the child would 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.920
 he spent a lot of time playing his console 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.960
 and that he is obsessed with taking a 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.970
 doll or something like that when he called him 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.220
 third time to go for dinner in the afternoon 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.470
 of Thanksgiving the child does not 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.420
 he answered and it seemed strange because 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.369
 his grandparents had come to dinner as 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.640
 every year and he always treated them like 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.590
 kings because they always brought him gifts 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.570
 the mother went to see him on the second floor and 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.850
 stated that he played insistently the 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.070
 door but the child did not respond to 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.140
 enter he found it with blue lips 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.780
 and the dilated pupils and foam in the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.790
 mouth the worst according to notes is that the child 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.710
 I was face up with my eyes lost 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.780
 on the roof and the television is 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.990
 repeated over and over again a song that 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.710
 he said can you was the one of his cinema you can 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.440
 feel 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.570
 of the sun 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.520
 according to the reports of the angels 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.410
 police department the child died 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.170
 suffocated while suffering an attack 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.150
 epileptic which was pretty weird already 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.610
 that there was no family history of 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.770
 the disease assumed that the child was 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.870
 he got too excited and he suffered from spasms 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.510
 what scared him to the degree of not being able 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.150
 breathing the myth arose when the 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.180
 family after the funeral decided to donate 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.260
 his things common thing in families 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.450
 Americans but gave away the 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.210
 console child's best friend who 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.340
 he began to browse and play the sega 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.980
 saturn came with the last cd he played 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.600
 the boy are iker to prove it he saw that what 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.170
 last I had made according to memory 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.720
 of the game was to unlock times doll 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.820
 this was posted by iron 71 the friend 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.850
 of the child who died in a forum and then 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.420
 spread the rumor of the damn game of 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.580
 fact 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.590
 sega never used the character again 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.600
 another game because of the psychosis that 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.700
 formed and to this day the legend 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.800
 of the 'times' I'm damn persists there 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.840
 in several internet forums that is still 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.239
 sony version that retains the supposed 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.830
 damn only that here has a 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.330
 stamp to block the curse 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.940
 that miyamoto created for this version 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.400
 they say gringos had to be x 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.350
 notwithstanding this seal has a 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.330
 weakness and is next play the 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.800
 mode tag four characters choose a 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.200
 times day and play with him 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.690
 the goal is to pursue and capture 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.490
 all the characters if you chase after 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.920
 super sonic secret character and what 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.320
 catches then the seal breaks and even 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.220
 then your soul x the times where it will continue 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.220
 the set 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.600
 Y 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.840

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:53.000

 the account is a replica of his 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.990

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.730
 to remind a great what whole 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.550
 that he retired from the stuffing and those shits 

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:40.410
