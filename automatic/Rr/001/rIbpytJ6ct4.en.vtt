00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.379
 delicate riche creams cannellini beans are a joy for the palate 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:13.900
 these your products suitable in the province of frosinone in other neighboring municipalities 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.159
 they are special 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:19.810
 the particular property of atine cannellino in the digestibility pocket 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.029
 because the peel of this bean 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.499
 it's very subtle so given data entry we know that in short I wanted the thing 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:29.779
 fundamental 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.140
 and danke 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.890
 we are not particularly interested in the culture of this legume because 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.400
 you don't have to be soaked so let's say an average time of 50 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.440
 minutes 60 minutes of cooking 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.050
 about the terrain of the time caricatures of that manganese fed by 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.679
 rino gaetano spring stream 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:52.440
 but the fact 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.790
 a traditional culture of the place you think was in danger of being lost and 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.380
 was rediscovered in 2001 by a group of farmers 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.150
 this league 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.570
 to me it was the 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.420
 film people since in 1840 a moth the wrinkle a moth had 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.850
 invaded the area for which 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.020
 eh if they had lost the original price lists the merit of this cooperative and of 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.040
 these peasants have been precisely this to find the old one again 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.600
 peasant families in the area and present them again with the flooded Tyrrhenian and valleys 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.500
 of this area 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.000
 now the cannellino bean of atina about to look for the denomination 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.910
 Doc 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.400
 15 days so 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.120
 t2s the viaduct documentation rossella and then 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.810
 immediately we would like to require transitional doctors then 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.520
 commercialize this product. 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.630
 a quality recognition for a product still cultivated with a time i 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.799
 beans are collected in bunches hanging from the facts dry 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.020
 after about a month at a time of the typing that was still manual with 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.140
 the sieve the residues of earth and leaves are eliminated thanks to the fan 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.380
 what you see in operation dates back to 1800 and finally the cernitur 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.360
 the cannellino is ready to be vacuum packed in a jar 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.339
 cooked 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:14.879
 here the typical dish of pasta and beans called pappafico chieti there is 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.669
 still those like Mrs. Lucia cook beans in the fireplace with the pignata espana 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:24.469
 handmade but cannellini beans are very versatile, also excellent as 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:26.910
 soup with broccoli on salad 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.060
 and even sweet like the creamy filling of this fried cake
