two dots to line it up so it's correct
you<00:02:03.849> put<00:02:04.060> thread<00:02:04.299> lock<00:02:04.479> in<00:02:04.720> to<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.380> bolts<00:02:05.709> for

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
you put thread lock in to the bolts for

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.320 
you put thread lock in to the bolts for
the<00:02:05.890> chain<00:02:06.159> slider<00:02:06.490> so<00:02:06.759> it<00:02:06.880> will<00:02:07.030> hold<00:02:07.179> the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
the chain slider so it will hold the

the chain slider so it will hold the
chain<00:02:07.509> slider<00:02:07.810> in<00:02:07.990> place<00:02:08.549> thread<00:02:09.549> lock<00:02:09.899> okay

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
chain slider in place thread lock okay

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.280 
chain slider in place thread lock okay
there's<00:02:11.860> our<00:02:11.950> chain<00:02:12.190> put<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.819> on<00:02:13.049> he's<00:02:14.049> one

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
there's our chain put it on he's one

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.770 
there's our chain put it on he's one
link<00:02:14.530> longer<00:02:14.890> than<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.160> other<00:02:15.280> chains<00:02:15.780> it's

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
link longer than the other chains it's

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.680 
link longer than the other chains it's
one<00:02:16.959> link<00:02:17.170> better<00:02:17.380> than<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.709> other<00:02:17.859> chains

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690
