00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.120 
it's pretty darn good come on focus okay
um<00:00:20.720> it's<00:00:21.720> hard<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:21.990> tell<00:00:22.230> but<00:00:22.439> we<00:00:22.560> sanded<00:00:23.010> it

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
um it's hard to tell but we sanded it

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.990 
um it's hard to tell but we sanded it
and<00:00:23.310> then<00:00:23.400> we<00:00:23.490> painted<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.970> Brown<00:00:25.789> they're<00:00:26.789> so

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
and then we painted it Brown they're so

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.510 
and then we painted it Brown they're so
natural<00:00:30.140> it's<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.230> texture<00:00:31.740> from<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.250> sand

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
natural it's a texture from the sand

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.410 
natural it's a texture from the sand
which<00:00:32.730> makes<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.090> look<00:00:33.180> all<00:00:33.420> nice<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.290> natural

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
which makes it look all nice and natural

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:44.380 
which makes it look all nice and natural

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
rice and we made it a little bit more

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.389 
rice and we made it a little bit more
flat<00:00:58.850> and<00:01:00.680> this<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.920> one<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.129> kind<00:01:02.340> of

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
flat and this is the one that kind of

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.299 
flat and this is the one that kind of
turned<00:01:02.579> out<00:01:02.699> most<00:01:02.910> interesting<00:01:03.650> we<00:01:04.650> used<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
turned out most interesting we used a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.780 
turned out most interesting we used a
lot<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.000> got<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> lot<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.780> wet<00:01:06.960> sand<00:01:07.229> and

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
lot of the got a lot of the wet sand and

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.320 
lot of the got a lot of the wet sand and
it<00:01:08.790> created<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.390> really<00:01:09.840> interesting<00:01:10.170> effect

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
it created a really interesting effect

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.680 
it created a really interesting effect
here

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.610 

actually<00:01:16.690> turned<00:01:16.900> out<00:01:16.960> pretty<00:01:17.020> cool<00:01:17.260> we're

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
actually turned out pretty cool we're

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.310 
actually turned out pretty cool we're
going<00:01:17.710> to<00:01:17.800> try<00:01:17.920> to<00:01:17.980> use<00:01:18.280> this<00:01:19.120> open<00:01:19.660> these

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
going to try to use this open these

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.950 
going to try to use this open these
these<00:01:20.620> open<00:01:21.040> spots<00:01:21.430> as<00:01:21.700> like<00:01:22.210> a<00:01:22.240> pond<00:01:22.660> or<00:01:22.900> a

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
these open spots as like a pond or a

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.480 
these open spots as like a pond or a
marsh<00:01:24.120> looking<00:01:25.120> area<00:01:25.590> that's<00:01:26.590> we<00:01:27.070> have<00:01:27.190> to<00:01:27.310> fix

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
marsh looking area that's we have to fix

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.470 
marsh looking area that's we have to fix
that<00:01:27.610> but<00:01:28.500> try<00:01:29.500> that<00:01:30.000> turned<00:01:31.000> out<00:01:31.120> pretty<00:01:31.300> cool

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
that but try that turned out pretty cool

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.710 
that but try that turned out pretty cool
I<00:01:32.160> think<00:01:33.160> we're<00:01:33.790> going<00:01:33.880> to<00:01:33.970> be<00:01:34.030> doing<00:01:34.150> some<00:01:34.420> dry

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
I think we're going to be doing some dry

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.560 
I think we're going to be doing some dry
brushing<00:01:35.260> with<00:01:35.440> some<00:01:35.650> greens<00:01:35.950> and<00:01:36.190> blues<00:01:36.570> to

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
brushing with some greens and blues to

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.900 
brushing with some greens and blues to
try<00:01:37.720> to<00:01:37.780> make<00:01:37.930> it<00:01:37.990> look<00:01:38.200> more<00:01:38.410> marshy<00:01:38.860> and<00:01:39.190> I'll
