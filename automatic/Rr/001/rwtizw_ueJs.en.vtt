00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.469
 hello I am mirko we are here too 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.720
 the module event in frankfurt on the topic 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.130
 windows 8 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.130
 always such a nice convertible 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.660
 the tablet or with foldable 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.270
 keyboard the first impression is 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.830
 actually pretty good, of course 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.280
 touch optimizes but also with the mouse 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.290
 that works quite well by funny 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.210
 trackpad that can also be used earlier by lenovo 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.920
 built that works as far as synonymous 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.170
 very good but also the dance movements 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.760
 great and there is actually one 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.460
 regular desktop not many 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.320
 We believe we also have a few devices 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.910
 around the stand only with the mouse 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.050
 can operate also that works 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.450
 quite well 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.180
 I'm not totally new, I have that 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.410
 system at least as beta for a few 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.910
 months at home also run in the 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.739
 living room pc works on the 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.079
 actually quite good 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.699
 corner data starts much faster 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.710
 it has not worked out yet 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.629
 hung windows 7 was there a bit 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:10.110
 jagged not much but at least one 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.110
 bit and how to see here 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.190
 It also does it extremely fast 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.190
 Another tip for the people 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.220
 the menus are looking for each other or themselves 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.380
 ask where to download the calculator 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.830
 either actually drive over 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.530
 the attitudes or there comes namely 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.350
 the old keyboard users back to 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.630
 advantage over windows here 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.800
 Show below camera off so 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.210
 was of course the question is 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.350
 why you turn that off? 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.180
 If you want it is easy in standby 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.070
 let go and later on 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.020
 use 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.649
 yes I am at gizmodo windows 8 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.899
 events and we test today the machine 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:53.729
 white on the windows 8 8 among others 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:56.050
 here is the new tablet from Sony two 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.340
 as you can already see 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.740
 Here is the standard surface 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.179
 kept very intuitive by windows 8 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.200
 very user-friendly in any case 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:04.240
 something completely different 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.250
 in comparison to the previous products 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.250
 from apple and android 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.959
 want a total of the 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.090
 I like the interface very well 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:18.770
 just because it is something else it is 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:21.459
 arranged very structured we can 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.459
 maybe now 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.840
 just start app and others can 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.460
 We take the music apps states plan 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.100
 moment but relatively well it is on everyone 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.550
 case 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.360
 and everything here in this cafÃ© 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.680
 You can not be a method anymore 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.890
 but tell the tile design of 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.150
 microsoft arranged everything very nicely and 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.680
 the special now here with the bavaria 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.980
 it will now always be on 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.720
 the hardware goes back to that one 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.210
 simply just normal tablet 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.550
 tablet has is synonymous so completely 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.040
 good use they serve as quite nice 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.130
 yes, I have the food here now 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.110
 tried windows 8 and I like it 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.270
 at first attempt actually pretty good here 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.630
 I like the design with the tiles 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.730
 Well 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:11.720
 the service is much easier 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.720
 become satisfied and determined 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.099
 what will happen 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.900
 I just tested windows 8 so 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.840
 I would recommend it now 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.310
 So for everyday use is okay 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.100
 this is made quite cool in apps 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.410
 and yes, the desktop is me too 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.120
 find him better than expected so if 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.950
 we look at the desktop 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.480
 I think it's great if I have several now 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.210
 want to work on things at the same time 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.350
 I can just be at home between zb 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.720
 The weather just look a little short 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.610
 I just want to do something again 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.640
 return 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.680
 i have everything at one glance so i 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.530
 I am here today for the first time - 8 here 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.120
 Merkel fabric servers and that feels 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.510
 Very good at flows very quickly 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.220
 the keyboard is pretty flat so 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.710
 I felt it is really only 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.690
 anyway not very thin mat one can 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.620
 tap what's missing is that 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.060
 haptic feedback 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.440
 So as you can see here 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.360
 you quickly tilt and the buttons 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.610
 g are still relatively fast 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.230
 but simply by this missing tip 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.250
 feel it is a relatively exhausting long 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.990
 to write texts 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.290
 This makes it always suitable 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.360
 somehow chat with skype or or 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:41.140
 short e-mail to write but also the 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.450
 long duration is quite exhausting yes what 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.890
 It will soon be very nice that's it 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:49.510
 is relatively flat so if that is 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:51.760
 one has worked up here back up 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.890
 The keyboard is made of fabric 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.790
 and it can be practically like a book in 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.330
 put the bag 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.550
 that is very pleasant 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.960
 otherwise if you can work that way 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.789
 a stand made of smooth can directly 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.770
 put down 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:10.620
 The angle is quite good for the keyboard 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:13.949
 and that natural from making the 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:17.400
 the rest is magnetically suspect is 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:20.870
 the angle is relatively difficult to operate 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.870
 there you will lie down on her
