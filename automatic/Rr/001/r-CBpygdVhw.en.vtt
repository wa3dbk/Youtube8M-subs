West one let's take the West one now
we're<00:00:38.470> going<00:00:38.559> to<00:00:38.620> go<00:00:38.710> north<00:00:39.010> past<00:00:39.400> this

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
we're going to go north past this

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.830 
we couldn't get up before and we get a
special<00:01:30.520> sphere<00:01:30.850> let's<00:01:31.210> not<00:01:31.479> go<00:01:31.630> down<00:01:31.780> that

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
special sphere let's not go down that

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.910 
special sphere let's not go down that
waterfall<00:01:32.290> go<00:01:33.159> back<00:01:33.369> this<00:01:33.520> way<00:01:33.580> and<00:01:34.920> we're

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
waterfall go back this way and we're

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:45.250 
waterfall go back this way and we're
gonna<00:01:36.009> go<00:01:36.190> north<00:01:36.610> instead<00:01:37.149> of<00:01:37.450> South

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.840 

to<00:01:46.260> the<00:01:46.350> west<00:01:46.590> there's<00:01:46.890> an<00:01:46.980> elixir

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:57.130 

now<00:01:50.780> let's<00:01:50.990> head<00:01:51.200> east

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.819 

south

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.999 

takes<00:02:02.829> us<00:02:02.979> to<00:02:03.159> a<00:02:03.189> wizard<00:02:03.759> Lance<00:02:04.710> what<00:02:05.710> to<00:02:05.829> get

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
let's see we got the Phantom ring got

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.480 
let's see we got the Phantom ring got
the<00:02:38.010> special<00:02:38.220> sphere<00:02:38.690> got<00:02:39.690> our<00:02:39.810> elixir<00:02:40.490> got

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
the special sphere got our elixir got

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:52.440 
the special sphere got our elixir got
the<00:02:41.610> little<00:02:41.850> keys<00:02:42.140> level<00:02:43.140> three<00:02:43.350> keys<00:02:43.560> fear

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450
