00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
TC 410 now I'm about two hours into the

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.620 
TC 410 now I'm about two hours into the
build<00:00:19.439> now<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.699> build<00:00:20.910> has<00:00:21.090> taken<00:00:21.510> me

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
build now and the build has taken me

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.740 
build now and the build has taken me
pretty<00:00:22.080> far<00:00:22.350> along<00:00:22.470> actually<00:00:23.340> if<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.119> take<00:00:24.689> a

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
pretty far along actually if you take a

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.050 
pretty far along actually if you take a
look<00:00:24.990> at<00:00:25.109> what's<00:00:25.350> really<00:00:25.439> been<00:00:25.920> built<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.910> the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
look at what's really been built in the

look at what's really been built in the
build<00:00:27.240> updates<00:00:27.539> I'm<00:00:27.720> gonna<00:00:27.869> be<00:00:27.990> going<00:00:28.289> over

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
build updates I'm gonna be going over

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.519 
build updates I'm gonna be going over
you<00:00:29.429> know<00:00:29.550> some<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.000> items<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.529> maybe

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
you know some of the items that maybe

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.610 
you know some of the items that maybe
have<00:00:31.859> roadblocked<00:00:32.430> me<00:00:32.669> or<00:00:33.230> you<00:00:34.230> know<00:00:34.350> some

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
have roadblocked me or you know some

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.139 
have roadblocked me or you know some
troubles<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.250> may<00:00:35.430> have<00:00:35.520> had<00:00:35.579> during<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
troubles that I may have had during the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.880 
troubles that I may have had during the
build<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.600> I'm<00:00:36.960> also<00:00:37.079> going<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.350> show<00:00:37.530> and

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
build and I'm also going to show and

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.139 
build and I'm also going to show and
talk<00:00:38.399> about<00:00:38.579> some<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.420> parts<00:00:39.809> fitment<00:00:40.800> and

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
talk about some of the parts fitment and

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.310 
talk about some of the parts fitment and
any<00:00:42.149> other<00:00:42.360> things<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.840> may<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.079> come<00:00:43.260> up

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
any other things that may have come up

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.619 
any other things that may have come up
during<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.890> build<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:45.120> first<00:00:45.329> two<00:00:45.480> hours

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
during the build so the first two hours

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.440 
during the build so the first two hours
was<00:00:45.930> very<00:00:46.140> successful<00:00:46.640> it<00:00:47.640> takes<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.120> kind<00:00:48.390> of

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
was very successful it takes you kind of

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.389 
was very successful it takes you kind of
step-by-step<00:00:48.690> through<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.590> first<00:00:50.219> part

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
step-by-step through the first part

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.799 
step-by-step through the first part
which<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.789> actually<00:00:51.149> doing<00:00:51.390> all<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.570> your

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
which is actually doing all of your

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.260 
which is actually doing all of your
carbon<00:00:52.320> prep<00:00:52.559> now<00:00:52.770> if<00:00:53.280> you've<00:00:53.550> done<00:00:53.789> any<00:00:54.000> type

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
carbon prep now if you've done any type

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.470 
carbon prep now if you've done any type
of<00:00:54.680> carbon<00:00:55.680> parts<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.820> past<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.449> know

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
of carbon parts in the past you know

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.000 
of carbon parts in the past you know
it's<00:00:57.750> definitely<00:00:58.109> important<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.590> go<00:00:58.890> ahead

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
it's definitely important to go ahead

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.340 
it's definitely important to go ahead
and<00:00:59.309> prep<00:00:59.579> your<00:00:59.760> carbon<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.809> what<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.140> means

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
and prep your carbon and what that means

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.619 
and prep your carbon and what that means
is<00:01:01.530> basically<00:01:01.920> protecting<00:01:02.579> all<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.030> edges

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
is basically protecting all of the edges

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.929 
is basically protecting all of the edges
now<00:01:04.199> what<00:01:04.439> team<00:01:04.769> Durango<00:01:05.129> recommends<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.790> go

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
now what team Durango recommends is go

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.140 
now what team Durango recommends is go
ahead<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.450> see<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> gluing<00:01:08.100> all<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.549> your<00:01:08.700> edges

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
ahead and see a gluing all of your edges

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.289 
ahead and see a gluing all of your edges
and<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.450> can<00:01:09.570> kind<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.810> see<00:01:10.020> here<00:01:10.380> hopefully

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
and you can kind of see here hopefully

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.890 
and you can kind of see here hopefully
kind<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.510> glassy<00:01:13.170> edge<00:01:14.119> right<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
kind of that glassy edge right on the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.960 
kind of that glassy edge right on the
edge<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.259> carbon<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.860> what<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.369> like<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.729> do

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
edge of the carbon so what I like to do

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.550 
edge of the carbon so what I like to do
personally<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.659> like<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.869> go<00:01:19.110> ahead<00:01:19.229> and

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
personally is I like to go ahead and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.859 
personally is I like to go ahead and
take<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.159> little<00:01:20.280> bit<00:01:20.400> step<00:01:20.759> further<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.299> like

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
take it a little bit step further I like

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.969 
take it a little bit step further I like
to<00:01:23.360> just<00:01:24.360> kind<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.720> sand<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.350> edges<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.890> it

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
to just kind of sand the edges of it

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.609 
to just kind of sand the edges of it
very<00:01:26.400> very<00:01:26.909> lightly<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.689> then<00:01:28.259> what<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.409> do<00:01:28.530> is

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
very very lightly and then what I do is

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.740 
very very lightly and then what I do is
I<00:01:28.829> take<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.280> black<00:01:29.610> sharpie<00:01:30.030> just<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.600> basically

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
I take a black sharpie just to basically

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.800 
I take a black sharpie just to basically
seal<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.530> edges<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.100> then<00:01:32.850> go<00:01:33.119> ahead<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.570> use

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
seal the edges and then go ahead and use

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.670 
seal the edges and then go ahead and use
some<00:01:34.200> CA<00:01:34.829> glue<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.369> happen<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.390> like<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:37.049> Sapa<00:01:37.350> gap

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
some CA glue I happen to like a Sapa gap

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.340 
some CA glue I happen to like a Sapa gap
it<00:01:38.009> kind<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.000> what<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.180> had<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.479> hand<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.140> and

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
it kind of what I had on hand and and

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.980 
it kind of what I had on hand and and
what<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.130> using<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.729> anyway<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:42.689> that's

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
what I like using so anyway so that's

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.510 
what I like using so anyway so that's
the<00:01:43.170> carbon<00:01:43.380> prep<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.920> that's<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.250> first

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
the carbon prep and that's the first

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.889 
the carbon prep and that's the first
step<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.030> want<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.299> do<00:01:45.390> right<00:01:45.659> out<00:01:45.840> of

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
step that you want to do right out of

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.230 
step that you want to do right out of
the<00:01:46.079> gate<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.430> know<00:01:47.549> later<00:01:47.790> on<00:01:47.850> once

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
the gate so you know later on once

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.850 
the gate so you know later on once
you're<00:01:48.390> done<00:01:48.479> building<00:01:48.750> Shox<00:01:49.170> turnbuckles

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
you're done building Shox turnbuckles

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.499 
you're done building Shox turnbuckles
and<00:01:49.920> everything<00:01:50.250> else<00:01:50.430> you're<00:01:51.090> ready<00:01:51.299> to

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
and everything else you're ready to

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.389 
and everything else you're ready to
actually<00:01:51.659> start<00:01:51.869> using<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.649> chassis<00:01:53.130> and

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
actually start using the chassis and

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.100 
actually start using the chassis and
start<00:01:53.759> building<00:01:54.000> up<00:01:54.299> some<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.659> bulkheads

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
start building up some of the bulkheads

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.940 
start building up some of the bulkheads
so<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:56.610> first<00:01:56.880> few<00:01:57.060> steps<00:01:57.299> here<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:58.469> takes<00:01:58.710> you

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
so the first few steps here it takes you

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.219 
so the first few steps here it takes you
through<00:01:59.189> building<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.880> shocks<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.630> the

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
through building the shocks and the

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.200 
through building the shocks and the
turnbuckles<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.070> some<00:02:02.490> things<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.909> you

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
turnbuckles and some things that you

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.300 
turnbuckles and some things that you
definitely<00:02:03.420> need<00:02:03.719> on<00:02:04.020> hand<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.920> makes<00:02:05.159> the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
definitely need on hand that makes the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.760 
definitely need on hand that makes the
build<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.850> little<00:02:06.000> bit<00:02:06.119> easier<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:07.079> definitely

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
build a little bit easier is definitely

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.219 
build a little bit easier is definitely
a<00:02:07.829> good<00:02:08.190> set<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.700> calipers<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.599> definitely

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
a good set of calipers you definitely

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.869 
a good set of calipers you definitely
need<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.410> for<00:02:10.950> especially<00:02:11.310> building<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
need that for especially building the

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.260 
need that for especially building the
turnbuckles<00:02:12.480> and

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
turnbuckles and

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.020 
turnbuckles and
so<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.540> shocks<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:14.200> actually<00:02:14.530> gives<00:02:14.740> you<00:02:15.030> very

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
so the shocks it actually gives you very

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.780 
so the shocks it actually gives you very
specific<00:02:16.870> measurements<00:02:17.800> after<00:02:18.400> building

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
specific measurements after building

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.600 
specific measurements after building
those<00:02:19.060> things<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:20.110> turnbuckles<00:02:20.680> definitely

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
those things the turnbuckles definitely

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.020 
those things the turnbuckles definitely
use<00:02:21.820> a<00:02:22.620> four<00:02:23.620> millimeter<00:02:23.860> turnbuckle<00:02:24.820> wrench

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
use a four millimeter turnbuckle wrench

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.090 
use a four millimeter turnbuckle wrench
which<00:02:25.270> is<00:02:25.420> what<00:02:25.570> I<00:02:25.600> use<00:02:25.930> is<00:02:26.170> TLR<00:02:26.620> version<00:02:26.950> right

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
which is what I use is TLR version right

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.160 
which is what I use is TLR version right
here<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.670> then<00:02:28.120> also<00:02:28.270> another<00:02:28.600> tool<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:28.900> I

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
here and then also another tool that I

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.410 
here and then also another tool that I
definitely<00:02:29.650> recommend<00:02:29.920> are<00:02:30.700> some<00:02:31.090> shock

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
definitely recommend are some shock

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.530 
definitely recommend are some shock
shaft<00:02:32.020> pliers<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:33.730> know<00:02:33.820> I<00:02:33.850> have<00:02:34.090> these<00:02:34.210> tail

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
shaft pliers you know I have these tail

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.170 
shaft pliers you know I have these tail
are<00:02:34.690> ones<00:02:34.870> here<00:02:35.110> as<00:02:35.260> well<00:02:35.500> so<00:02:35.830> very<00:02:36.640> useful

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
are ones here as well so very useful

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.550 
are ones here as well so very useful
items<00:02:37.840> during<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:39.520> build<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:40.180> your<00:02:40.390> det<00:02:41.020> c4

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
items during the build of your det c4

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.600 
items during the build of your det c4
ten<00:02:41.920> now<00:02:42.910> on<00:02:43.150> down<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:44.050> road<00:02:44.200> here<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.740> couple

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
ten now on down the road here a couple

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.200 
ten now on down the road here a couple
of<00:02:45.700> things<00:02:45.790> I<00:02:45.970> wanted<00:02:46.210> to<00:02:46.360> note<00:02:46.540> was<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:48.430> do

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
of things I wanted to note was you do

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.590 
of things I wanted to note was you do
not<00:02:49.360> get<00:02:49.990> any<00:02:50.290> shock<00:02:50.740> oils<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:51.490> the<00:02:52.120> kit<00:02:52.360> which

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
not get any shock oils and the kit which

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.620 
not get any shock oils and the kit which
you<00:02:52.810> know<00:02:52.900> is<00:02:53.110> expected<00:02:53.710> for<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.630> serious

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
you know is expected for a serious

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.260 
you know is expected for a serious
racing<00:02:56.020> kit<00:02:56.440> so<00:02:56.740> I<00:02:56.980> went<00:02:57.520> ahead<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:57.790> built<00:02:58.060> the

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
racing kit so I went ahead and built the

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.520 
racing kit so I went ahead and built the
shocks<00:02:58.540> up<00:02:58.810> to<00:02:59.110> spec<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.770> I<00:03:00.340> believe<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:01.270> is

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
shocks up to spec and I believe it is

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.990 
shocks up to spec and I believe it is
550<00:03:02.530> weight<00:03:02.740> fluid<00:03:03.370> so<00:03:03.580> that's<00:03:03.790> what<00:03:03.910> they

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
550 weight fluid so that's what they

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.610 
550 weight fluid so that's what they
recommended<00:03:04.540> I'm<00:03:04.750> building<00:03:05.440> this<00:03:05.560> thing

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
recommended I'm building this thing

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.990 
recommended I'm building this thing
exactly<00:03:06.310> to<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.390> spec<00:03:07.720> of<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:09.000> owner's

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
exactly to the spec of the owner's

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.510 
exactly to the spec of the owner's
manual<00:03:10.030> so<00:03:10.570> but<00:03:11.470> all<00:03:11.620> in<00:03:11.740> all<00:03:11.860> everything<00:03:12.310> was

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
manual so but all in all everything was

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.640 
manual so but all in all everything was
very<00:03:12.850> well<00:03:13.180> laid<00:03:13.390> out<00:03:13.420> I<00:03:13.600> mean<00:03:13.990> here's<00:03:14.230> just<00:03:14.470> an

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
very well laid out I mean here's just an

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.770 
very well laid out I mean here's just an
example<00:03:14.950> of<00:03:15.220> how<00:03:15.400> they<00:03:15.580> tell<00:03:15.820> to<00:03:16.450> build<00:03:16.660> the

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
example of how they tell to build the

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.230 
example of how they tell to build the
shocks<00:03:17.050> and<00:03:17.580> also<00:03:18.580> gives<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:19.000> specific

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
shocks and also gives you specific

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.080 
shocks and also gives you specific
measurements<00:03:20.050> here<00:03:20.380> as<00:03:21.340> far<00:03:21.550> as<00:03:21.610> front<00:03:21.970> and

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
measurements here as far as front and

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.840 
measurements here as far as front and
rear<00:03:22.770> also<00:03:23.770> you<00:03:23.830> know<00:03:24.070> all<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.310> turnbuckles

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
rear also you know all the turnbuckles

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.090 
rear also you know all the turnbuckles
are<00:03:25.000> very<00:03:25.390> well<00:03:25.660> laid<00:03:25.870> out<00:03:25.980> you<00:03:26.980> know

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
are very well laid out you know

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.040 
are very well laid out you know
turnbuckles<00:03:27.730> can<00:03:27.850> be<00:03:27.970> very<00:03:28.330> very<00:03:28.870> difficult

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
turnbuckles can be very very difficult

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.050 
turnbuckles can be very very difficult
to<00:03:29.290> build<00:03:29.500> sometimes<00:03:29.980> because<00:03:30.850> of<00:03:30.970> the

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
to build sometimes because of the

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.449 
to build sometimes because of the
orientation<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:32.380> which<00:03:32.650> side<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:32.980> hash<00:03:33.160> mark

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
orientation and which side the hash mark

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.550 
orientation and which side the hash mark
is<00:03:33.580> on<00:03:33.730> but<00:03:34.510> team<00:03:34.810> Durango<00:03:35.140> has<00:03:35.170> done<00:03:35.410> a<00:03:35.440> very

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
is on but team Durango has done a very

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.490 
is on but team Durango has done a very
very<00:03:36.400> good<00:03:36.610> job<00:03:36.670> of<00:03:37.150> laying<00:03:37.750> out<00:03:37.959> this<00:03:38.140> owners

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
very good job of laying out this owners

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.080 
very good job of laying out this owners
manual<00:03:38.860> so<00:03:39.010> very<00:03:39.310> impressed<00:03:39.640> with<00:03:39.760> that<00:03:39.790> so

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
manual so very impressed with that so

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.730 
manual so very impressed with that so
far

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
far

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.870 
far
but<00:03:41.740> let's<00:03:42.130> take<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.310> look<00:03:42.490> at<00:03:42.550> the<00:03:42.610> chassis

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
but let's take a look at the chassis

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.690 
but let's take a look at the chassis
really<00:03:43.240> quick<00:03:43.480> I<00:03:43.690> I<00:03:44.410> have<00:03:44.860> gotten<00:03:45.280> all<00:03:45.490> the

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
really quick I I have gotten all the

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.199 
really quick I I have gotten all the
bulkheads<00:03:46.209> on<00:03:46.560> I've<00:03:47.560> built<00:03:47.950> also<00:03:48.520> the<00:03:48.880> front

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
bulkheads on I've built also the front

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.960 
bulkheads on I've built also the front
and<00:03:49.450> rear<00:03:49.660> differentials<00:03:50.650> I'm<00:03:51.610> sorry

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
and rear differentials I'm sorry

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.580 
and rear differentials I'm sorry
actually<00:03:52.209> just<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:52.750> rear<00:03:52.959> differential<00:03:53.350> the

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
actually just the rear differential the

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.190 
actually just the rear differential the
front<00:03:53.830> is<00:03:53.980> just<00:03:54.040> a<00:03:54.370> locked<00:03:54.670> front<00:03:55.270> and<00:03:55.570> the

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
front is just a locked front and the

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.970 
front is just a locked front and the
rear<00:03:56.440> is<00:03:56.740> going<00:03:57.070> to<00:03:57.160> be<00:03:57.280> a<00:03:57.459> plastic<00:03:58.120> geared

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
rear is going to be a plastic geared

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.170 
rear is going to be a plastic geared
differential<00:03:59.980> which<00:04:00.130> also<00:04:00.400> does<00:04:00.970> not<00:04:01.120> include

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
differential which also does not include

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.230 
differential which also does not include
any<00:04:01.990> dip<00:04:02.350> fluid<00:04:02.620> so<00:04:02.890> you<00:04:03.430> will<00:04:03.580> need<00:04:03.730> diff<00:04:04.000> lude

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
any dip fluid so you will need diff lude

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.430 
any dip fluid so you will need diff lude
depending<00:04:04.690> on<00:04:04.780> what<00:04:04.959> you're<00:04:05.140> going<00:04:05.260> to<00:04:05.320> be

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
depending on what you're going to be

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.360 
depending on what you're going to be
setting<00:04:05.650> up<00:04:05.920> so<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:07.510> diff<00:04:08.410> went<00:04:08.650> of<00:04:08.770> it<00:04:08.890> went

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
setting up so the diff went of it went

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.940 
setting up so the diff went of it went
together<00:04:09.610> very<00:04:09.940> well<00:04:10.000> it's<00:04:10.780> actually<00:04:11.350> plastic

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
together very well it's actually plastic

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.680 
together very well it's actually plastic
spider<00:04:12.580> geared<00:04:13.090> on<00:04:13.830> diffs<00:04:14.830> inside<00:04:15.220> there<00:04:15.690> you

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
spider geared on diffs inside there you

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.750 
spider geared on diffs inside there you
can<00:04:16.840> see<00:04:17.080> here<00:04:17.500> you<00:04:18.370> have<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.609> metal

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
can see here you have the metal

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.120 
can see here you have the metal
outdrives<00:04:19.359> looks<00:04:20.350> like<00:04:20.500> they're<00:04:20.650> lightened

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
outdrives looks like they're lightened

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.300 
outdrives looks like they're lightened
somewhat<00:04:21.640> so<00:04:21.820> they<00:04:21.940> have<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:22.210> cutouts<00:04:22.630> and

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
somewhat so they have the cutouts and

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.330 
somewhat so they have the cutouts and
then<00:04:24.310> on<00:04:24.490> to<00:04:24.910> the<00:04:25.390> center<00:04:25.810> pulley<00:04:26.320> right<00:04:26.590> here

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
then on to the center pulley right here

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.210 
then on to the center pulley right here

all everything is went very well so far
two<00:05:05.770> hours<00:05:06.100> into<00:05:06.370> the<00:05:06.490> build<00:05:06.630> so<00:05:07.630> next<00:05:07.930> step<00:05:08.080> is

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
two hours into the build so next step is

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.800 
two hours into the build so next step is
going<00:05:08.350> to<00:05:08.410> be<00:05:08.530> going<00:05:08.680> on<00:05:08.889> to<00:05:09.450> building<00:05:10.450> the

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
going to be going on to building the

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.240 
going to be going on to building the
front<00:05:11.320> and<00:05:11.560> rear<00:05:11.710> CV<00:05:12.100> DS<00:05:12.250> also<00:05:12.669> building

front and rear CV DS also building

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.830 
front and rear CV DS also building
getting<00:05:15.250> into<00:05:15.610> the<00:05:15.729> hinge<00:05:15.910> pin<00:05:16.090> holders<00:05:16.510> and
