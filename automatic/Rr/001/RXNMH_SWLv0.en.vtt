00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:14.280
 well we are seeing believe it or not this is 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.710
 a street completely flooded the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.600
 road you see there on that side 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.369
 it's highway 281 that connects from north 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.660
 south to the city ​​of san antonio this is 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.450
 the area of ​​what is 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.010
 the soul curry and well then obviously 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.370
 we have here people who came 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.879
 also to see 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:41.530
 what is going on like this is 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:43.810
 an incredible vision of what the 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.210
 rains 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.890
 and they left from this morning here in the 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:54.220
 City of San Antonio is simply 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.010
 just being here one can believe 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:00.840
 what is it that is here below this water 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.670
 It was a completely flooded road 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.100
 this gives us an idea the highway 281 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.770
 is closed on that in that stretch 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.940
 while obviously the water is 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:16.840
 begins to lower this is going to take several 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:20.060
 hours before it completely goes down 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:26.130
 water level 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:29.969
 were recorded more than 10 inches 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.219
 in a span of 3 hours it's a lot 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:34.890
 water but then we will raise it 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:36.600
 I ask here that person this 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.420
 young man who is here with us as 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.909
 let's say alejandro alejandro that ramírez 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.789
 moving away what you think of what is 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.759
 behind us right now what to do 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:49.429
 has how can you rate this is 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.590
 too much water that fell in this place 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:56.070
 too much is amazing I've gone through 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.190
 this road quite a few times 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.979
 it's amazing to see this looks like a lake 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.690
 it looks like the sea, it looks like a river 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.490
 as if there were a river here all 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.080
 time is amazing 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.550
 unfortunately, there were three 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.760
 people who have already lost their lives 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.910
 They are Antonio, two women, a young man 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.820
 that is apparently gone 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.920
 surprised they wanted to cross paths 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.870
 flooded and good because the authors are 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.959
 precisely asking for that the people who 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.490
 do not cross when you do not have to cross 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.070
 exact of most people think 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.160
 which is mild but not really 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.530
 they come and put themselves at risk and apart 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.290
 put firefighters in the department of 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.300
 policemen at risk to save them when 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.410
 they put the 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:46.820
 signs that do not happen people want 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.820
 pass as if it were nothing and look 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.940
 Alejandro Ramírez thank you very much many 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.250
 thank you, well, here we have several 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.920
 people I repeat they are seeing as 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.590
 well that's a show a few times 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.610
 actually seen here in san antonio and 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.710
 Well, just like it looks like 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.430
 nice to say it indicates also 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:14.460
 the latent danger that exists in case of 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.800
 that can continue to rain in the city 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.600
 San Antonio County béjar the 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.180
 meteorology service is pointing 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.240
 has until tomorrow a 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.890
 warning of possible floods in 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.210
 the county of béjar and everything that its 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.400
 traffic jams to medina wilson and 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.410
 guadalupe for the same thing because if you 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.780
 can see the sky is still with 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.170
 enough clouds and any change in 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:43.190
 atmospheric conditions can can 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.900
 at a given moment and start rains 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.450
 again so it 's 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:53.530
 still it is a night that there is 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:55.930
 be quite careful going out 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.660
 to any part of the city that you 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.680
 do not know that you do not know exactly which 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.000
 it's the situation with the streets 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.020
 I'm Antonio and in for news 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.020
