00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:05.030
 they occupy shit the damn mascara already has me until the mother first had to 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.120
 insulting duranguense the most mop music genre of all 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.059
 times later to the sound of which I have up to 700 thousand copies in my mp3 code 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.000
 then that apocalypse and is closer than we suspect just because 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.520
 we think of arming the cricket even by the fluff of our navels and apart from 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:28.600
 you have to call to record at eleven o'clock in the morning to see now what boludes 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.029
 it's going to happen to say to the asshole 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.420
 take off the chinganas the cane if you take the script today 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.270
 no mames 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.290
 is going to talk about the 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.290
 6 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.770
 to al chile with this diarrheal introduction 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.520
 my name is rick 3 3 2 2 mecca and this time I'm going to present one of my 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.190
 first critics to the seventh art 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.740
 since the occasion was 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.409
 I'm going to tell you the sad story of one of the films that with more 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.810
 longing I waited for so long i 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.500
 because of destiny marketing or human stupidity disappointed me 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.299
 degree of wanting to throw me from the eleventh floor of a building with a view to 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.520
 a foundry hahahahaha xd xd xd 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.340
 Not that much 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.770
 but believe me when I tell you that I was greatly disappointed 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.680
 Of course 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.900
 I'm talking about spa and derman 3 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.880
 one of the most anticipated films in 2007 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.530
 but if that movie from the stone age 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.649
 it's been two years now that shit is going to happen to tell the audience 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.479
 shut up asshole 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.259
 this is my criticism and here I say what sticks my recontra grinds every 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.319
 mother if I want to criticize the damn smurfs and say because I think they are 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:01.220
 satanic 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.450
 I say it, just stick to the camera 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.530
 that for that they pay you 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.879
 in the first instance I will mention the rescutable aspects of the film 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.979
 that are certainly enough 

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:15.979
 the enviable little mother special effects for any other 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:20.079
 gringa production I must say that I especially loved the scene in the 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:21.620
 who asks for bizarri they split the 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.610
 little hahahahaha this was one of the main provinces that took her to 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.309
 breaking record at the box office 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:28.420
 the soundtrack 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.170
 delectable 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.450
 shocking first quality even though it was not directed by 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.840
 danny elfman and a legend in terms of the production of soundtracks in the 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.869
 two other films in the saga 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:41.209
 the performances 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.029
 very good 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:45.099
 equally good as in the two previous films 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.550
 it will be because the same assholes appear in the center of the story 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.599
 juas juas juas hahaha 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:51.689
 the locations 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:52.670
 excellent 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.269
 the images about new york are incredible 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.269
 I would like to have the opportunity to go to the Big Apple 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.370
 up here all very good 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.980
 If everything is very good 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.980
 so why did you put her in this criticism 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.599
 It's one thing to have a whole string of good ingredients and elements for the 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.050
 creation of a movie 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.969
 and another is knowing how to combine them on a solid basis 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:15.760
 if you have already seen the movie 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.449
 they will know what I am talking about and 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:20.449
 oo then I do not know what the fuck they went to see the movies 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:24.479
 pra hahahahaha xd xd xd 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:26.999
 there is only one bad aspect in this movie 

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:31.120
 however, it is perhaps the most important aspect in every film before 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.549
 all 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.619
 first of all 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:34.760
 first of all 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.680
 what is that of putting three villains in one movie 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.510
 indian night 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.019
 now they're going to break the sacrosanct things 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.329
 the spider man 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.749
 second the twists that the story presents are many 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:47.859
 and some are little credible 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.199
 bring attention 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.719
 complain and hates spiderman and wants to kill him 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:53.169
 well that was expected 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:56.929
 that the garden was about to skewer the spider when the spider was 

00:03:56.929 --> 00:04:00.549
 turn on the fucking focus and apply the almighty and classic trap trap 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.649
 the cartoons 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:07.549
 pure hahahahaha xd xd xd that jarry accommodates a super ultra mega whores or 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:08.790
 those in the head 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.290
 that jarry loses his memory 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.510
 complaint recovers the memory that comes up with a sinister plan to end 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.070
 the spider that the spider has been rejected with because they lowered it to the mad 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.879
 medellin 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:20.549
 that they split the mucus again 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.909
 complain and is more disfigured than shit 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:26.279
 They kidnap medellin to prostitute her in a cheap brothel in the 

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:30.110
 border that the asterisk is wrinkled and will ask for help from the 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.569
 garden to rescue her 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:33.919
 that Jarry sends him to fuck his fucking mother 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.819
 that the spider throws itself as you erase it to rescue it 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:40.189
 that they took out a damn butler of the sleeve and clarify the misunderstandings 

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:45.160
 that there was between jarry the spider riva complaint to the rescue that they hold on to fucking 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:48.789
 jarry the spider the sandbox and avenged that they see one is about to kill the 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:52.509
 spider when it crosses jarry to him is to whom they skewer what is the 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:55.899
 spider throws him to the banner the first thing that is found to come is 

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:59.749
 extremely allergic to pumpkins and therefore explodes before so 

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:00.960
 very powerful weapon 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.110
 and after all 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.689
 I never knew if the spider and Melilla 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:05.699
 they were content 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:08.999
 or they were crazy before so much drama and action suspense 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:11.999
 that was the movie 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.259
 now I did mark myself 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:17.669
 and that does not take into account the individual stories of Benoni the 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:21.909
 the existentialist conflict of the spiderman and the backgrounds of the 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:23.720
 loving triangle between jarry 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.919
 piter and medellÃ­n 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:25.860
 apparently 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.460
 the reason for this script so saturated and compressed was due to conflicts 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.360
 of the director with the producer 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.710
 which would not get more movies after the third part 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.610
 ip without saying all the material 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:37.280
 the cast 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.229
 and of course 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:39.639
 of your services 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:40.889
 third and last 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:44.509
 the touches of humor that they tried to put in the story did not give laughter 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:48.389
 Maybe because the story was very fast, they just bored you 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.460
 I know this is an action movie 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.650
 but in the second movie I remember a memorable scene 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.650
 that by the way I had the pleasure of seeing her in the cinema 

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:14.119
 two 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:16.659
 I sleep well 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:19.659
 I exercise children like those vegetables 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:23.139
 my mother always says 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:26.099
 efe jajajajajajajajajajajaja 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:28.069
 the whole room started to stink 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:30.960
 because everyone absolutely cussed with laughter 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.520
 from the most noses to the oldest 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.189
 that kind of white humor 

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:38.669
 interspersed with the action scenes they gave the second part 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:40.389
 all my approval and respect 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:44.150
 few people perform this kind of work without falling into the ridiculous or 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.150
 pathetic 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.830
 pink 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.460
 efe 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.080
 4 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.080
 I expected 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.069
 the third quarter by the camera 

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:07.069
 now 

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:10.639
 the net 

00:07:16.619 --> 00:07:19.619
 you have to attack 

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:25.009
 get out of here 

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:26.520
 the centenary hotel 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.990
 the sheriff of this city there 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.960
 in conclusion 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.870
 the first movie was novel 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.800
 the second one was fucking him master but the third part 

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.749
 despite the special effects 

00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:40.960
 the excellent performances and the soundtrack of the stable 

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.030
 but with a second, if not third, script 

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.870
 it became just one more movie of the bunch 

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.870
 only revered by the geeks or heirs of the action hero 

00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:55.319
 that's all for the moment little braggarts pendejitos and shit and tossal 

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:59.399
 anti-castro 2008 and the whole community what in deraa de youtube
