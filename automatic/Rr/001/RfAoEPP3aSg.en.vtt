that<00:01:06.920> we're<00:01:07.070> just<00:01:07.310> we're<00:01:07.610> just<00:01:07.640> working<00:01:08.240> them

that we're just we're just working them

that we're just we're just working them
terribly<00:01:08.899> hard<00:01:09.280> is<00:01:10.280> one<00:01:10.880> of<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.060> things

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
terribly hard is one of the things

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.930 
terribly hard is one of the things
that's<00:01:11.450> happened<00:01:11.899> along<00:01:12.560> with<00:01:12.979> then

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
that's happened along with then

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.539 
that's happened along with then
attempting<00:01:14.690> to<00:01:14.840> get<00:01:15.049> the<00:01:15.710> median<00:01:16.130> ascend<00:01:16.430> the

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
animal and so forth while we've we've

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.789 
animal and so forth while we've we've
made<00:01:19.729> them<00:01:19.909> more<00:01:20.090> fragile<00:01:20.360> as<00:01:21.140> a<00:01:21.200> consequence

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
made them more fragile as a consequence

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.460 
made them more fragile as a consequence
of<00:01:22.009> breeding<00:01:22.850> hogs<00:01:23.090> in<00:01:23.330> that<00:01:23.479> direction<00:01:23.690> using

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
of breeding hogs in that direction using

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.919 
of breeding hogs in that direction using
hogs<00:01:24.890> in<00:01:25.100> this<00:01:25.280> way<00:01:25.490> then<00:01:26.330> we<00:01:26.479> find<00:01:26.720> that<00:01:26.780> we

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
hogs in this way then we find that we

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:28.660 
hogs in this way then we find that we
run<00:01:27.170> into<00:01:27.350> problems<00:01:27.590> with<00:01:27.979> hogs<00:01:28.250> that<00:01:28.399> have

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
run into problems with hogs that have

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.490 
run into problems with hogs that have
foot<00:01:29.149> problems<00:01:29.600> or<00:01:29.750> they<00:01:29.899> have<00:01:30.050> breathing

problems or they have tail biting and
things<00:01:34.399> of<00:01:34.610> this<00:01:34.700> nature<00:01:34.759> we've<00:01:35.600> heard<00:01:35.840> of

20% and we we know that we are rotating

20% and we we know that we are rotating

the herd probably at the present time we
will<00:01:50.360> we<00:01:50.569> will<00:01:50.720> add<00:01:52.090> near<00:01:53.090> 50%<00:01:53.509> of<00:01:54.080> the<00:01:54.619> herd

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
will we will add near 50% of the herd

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.910 
will we will add near 50% of the herd
and<00:01:55.160> you<00:01:55.459> animals<00:01:55.910> each<00:01:56.090> year<00:01:56.739> whenever<00:01:57.739> they

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
and you animals each year whenever they

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.130 
and you animals each year whenever they
have<00:01:58.129> a<00:01:58.160> turnover<00:01:58.459> 50<00:01:59.060> %<00:01:59.450> sales<00:01:59.750> because

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
have a turnover 50 % sales because

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.380 
have a turnover 50 % sales because
they're<00:02:00.590> so<00:02:02.020> badly<00:02:03.020> abused<00:02:03.679> I<00:02:05.830> just<00:02:06.830> sold<00:02:07.039> some

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
they're so badly abused I just sold some

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.570 
they're so badly abused I just sold some
sows<00:02:08.390> this<00:02:08.720> spring<00:02:09.050> that<00:02:09.080> was<00:02:09.470> five<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.459> a

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
sows this spring that was five and a

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.369 
sows this spring that was five and a
half<00:02:10.610> years<00:02:11.060> old<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:11.750> still<00:02:12.470> producing<00:02:13.270> any

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
half years old and still producing any

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.780 
half years old and still producing any
movement<00:02:15.379> that<00:02:15.560> uses<00:02:16.010> up<00:02:16.190> energy<00:02:16.610> that

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
movement that uses up energy that

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.729 
movement that uses up energy that
doesn't<00:02:17.060> turn<00:02:17.209> energy<00:02:17.690> into<00:02:17.989> me<00:02:18.170> they're<00:02:18.379> into

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
doesn't turn energy into me they're into

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.800 
doesn't turn energy into me they're into
into<00:02:19.519> the<00:02:19.640> hog<00:02:19.819> askin<00:02:20.239> seen<00:02:20.480> as<00:02:20.660> being

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
into the hog askin seen as being

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.960 
into the hog askin seen as being
wasteful<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.890> so<00:02:22.250> you<00:02:22.310> move<00:02:22.670> away<00:02:22.849> from

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
wasteful and so you move away from

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.869 
wasteful and so you move away from
