00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
and this is a huge shell because this is

and this is a huge shell because this is
a<00:00:54.120> single<00:00:54.600> shell<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.590> look<00:00:55.710> at<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.600> this

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
a single shell you look at it and this

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.599 
a single shell you look at it and this
the<00:00:57.960> actual<00:00:58.079> self<00:00:58.559> starts<00:00:58.859> right<00:00:59.100> here<00:00:59.129> where

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
the actual self starts right here where

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.060 
the actual self starts right here where
my<00:00:59.640> thumb<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.359> end<00:01:00.870> up<00:01:01.050> here<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.039> a

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
my thumb is and end up here so this is a

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.119 
my thumb is and end up here so this is a
huge<00:01:02.489> show<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.149> i<00:01:03.960> thought<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:04.470> was<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> multi

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
huge show and i thought this was a multi

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.429 
huge show and i thought this was a multi
break<00:01:05.369> but<00:01:06.180> i<00:01:06.210> could<00:01:06.479> see<00:01:06.630> from<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.930> label<00:01:07.170> so

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
break but i could see from the label so

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.050 
break but i could see from the label so
i<00:01:07.500> always<00:01:07.619> make<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.979> label<00:01:08.280> accurate<00:01:08.820> and

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
i always make the label accurate and

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.700 
i always make the label accurate and
this<00:01:09.540> was<00:01:09.689> made<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.869> long<00:01:10.020> time<00:01:10.260> ago<00:01:10.320> actually

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710

know<00:02:07.439> PVC<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.039> stuff<00:02:08.340> like<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.910> he<00:02:09.420> said

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
know PVC and stuff like that and he said

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.559 
know PVC and stuff like that and he said
this<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> gold<00:02:10.410> peony<00:02:10.979> shell<00:02:11.280> but<00:02:11.970> any<00:02:12.150> pini

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
this is a gold peony shell but any pini

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.760 
this is a gold peony shell but any pini
that<00:02:12.870> I've<00:02:12.959> ever<00:02:12.989> seen<00:02:13.410> is

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
that I've ever seen is

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.650 
that I've ever seen is
a<00:02:15.920> spherical<00:02:16.920> shell<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.160> ball<00:02:17.400> fail<00:02:17.670> but<00:02:18.600> i

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
a spherical shell a ball fail but i

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.450 
a spherical shell a ball fail but i
don't<00:02:18.840> know<00:02:18.870> i<00:02:18.960> might<00:02:19.110> be<00:02:19.170> wrong<00:02:19.320> but<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.830> still

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
don't know i might be wrong but I still

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.680 
don't know i might be wrong but I still
wanted<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.820> start<00:02:21.120> when<00:02:21.270> he<00:02:21.360> wasn't<00:02:21.540> looking

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
wanted to start when he wasn't looking

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.260 
wanted to start when he wasn't looking
and<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.080> tested<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.710> it<00:02:22.770> burns<00:02:23.130> it<00:02:23.550> burns

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
and I tested it and it burns it burns

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.410 
and I tested it and it burns it burns
like<00:02:24.740> chrysanthemum<00:02:25.740> type<00:02:26.280> star<00:02:26.610> but<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.270> has

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
like chrysanthemum type star but it has

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.600 
like chrysanthemum type star but it has
a<00:02:27.450> lot<00:02:27.540> more<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:28.020> visible<00:02:28.560> flame<00:02:28.860> so<00:02:29.490> it's

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
a lot more of that visible flame so it's

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.060 
a lot more of that visible flame so it's
probably<00:02:29.820> going<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.090> be<00:02:30.150> basic<00:02:30.630> tacular<00:02:34.070> these

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
probably going to be basic tacular these

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.630 
probably going to be basic tacular these
to<00:02:35.630> think<00:02:36.630> your<00:02:36.720> dismissal<00:02:37.050> aeneus<00:02:37.640> aerial

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
to think your dismissal aeneus aerial

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.370 
to think your dismissal aeneus aerial
shells<00:02:38.910> because<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.300> don't<00:02:39.870> really<00:02:39.900> like<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.260> do

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
shells because I don't really like to do

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.100 
shells because I don't really like to do
in<00:02:40.500> these<00:02:40.650> because<00:02:41.130> my<00:02:41.790> mortar<00:02:42.120> for<00:02:42.300> 2.5<00:02:42.870> inch

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
in these because my mortar for 2.5 inch

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.890 
in these because my mortar for 2.5 inch
and<00:02:43.380> these<00:02:43.530> Hemis<00:02:43.980> are<00:02:44.160> two<00:02:44.610> inches<00:02:44.970> so<00:02:45.660> I<00:02:45.690> have

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
and these Hemis are two inches so I have

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.740 
and these Hemis are two inches so I have
to<00:02:46.050> spend<00:02:46.320> you<00:02:47.190> know<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.520> total<00:02:48.000> like<00:02:48.180> half<00:02:48.450> inch

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
to spend you know a total like half inch

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.690 
to spend you know a total like half inch

of pasting like one-fourth inch on
either<00:02:50.850> side<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.390> it's<00:02:51.900> just<00:02:52.080> kind<00:02:52.260> of<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.380> pain

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
either side and it's just kind of a pain

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
in the ass it's not too much trouble but

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.630 
in the ass it's not too much trouble but
it<00:02:54.360> just<00:02:54.510> doesn't<00:02:54.690> make<00:02:54.930> up<00:02:55.110> look<00:02:55.320> that<00:02:55.640> good

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
it just doesn't make up look that good

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.640 
it just doesn't make up look that good
you<00:02:57.030> know<00:02:57.180> but<00:02:57.510> they<00:02:57.960> do<00:02:58.080> work<00:02:58.260> these<00:02:58.440> both

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
you know but they do work these both

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
have volume rising effects on them I

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.760 
have volume rising effects on them I
think<00:03:00.750> these<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:01.050> think<00:03:01.230> this<00:03:01.320> one's<00:03:01.500> willow

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.420 
of cool little shells and i have no idea
what<00:03:11.130> this<00:03:11.250> is<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:12.140> found<00:03:13.140> it<00:03:13.290> in<00:03:13.320> this<00:03:13.560> box<00:03:13.800> from

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
what this is I found it in this box from

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.050 
what this is I found it in this box from
like<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:14.940> don't<00:03:15.780> know<00:03:16.020> new<00:03:16.530> years<00:03:16.770> or<00:03:16.980> i<00:03:17.010> don't<00:03:17.370> i

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
like I don't know new years or i don't i

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.670 
like I don't know new years or i don't i
don't<00:03:18.090> know<00:03:18.300> what<00:03:18.420> this<00:03:18.540> is<00:03:18.600> and<00:03:18.990> it<00:03:19.380> has<00:03:19.500> that

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
don't know what this is and it has that

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.410 
don't know what this is and it has that
quick<00:03:19.890> tiny<00:03:20.160> disco<00:03:20.670> on<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.030> i<00:03:21.090> know<00:03:21.180> it's

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
quick tiny disco on it so i know it's

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.400 
quick tiny disco on it so i know it's
old<00:03:21.630> but<00:03:21.780> i<00:03:21.930> like<00:03:22.800> this<00:03:22.920> would<00:03:23.190> plug<00:03:23.550> i<00:03:24.030> I<00:03:24.410> don't

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
old but i like this would plug i I don't

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.070 
old but i like this would plug i I don't
know<00:03:25.620> if<00:03:25.709> this<00:03:25.860> is<00:03:26.360> so<00:03:27.360> I<00:03:27.630> think<00:03:27.810> I'll<00:03:28.050> just

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
know if this is so I think I'll just

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.390 
know if this is so I think I'll just
light<00:03:28.440> it<00:03:28.470> on<00:03:28.620> fire<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:29.390> no<00:03:30.390> clue<00:03:30.600> what<00:03:30.750> that<00:03:30.780> is

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
light it on fire I no clue what that is

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.980 
light it on fire I no clue what that is
so<00:03:32.400> let<00:03:32.670> me<00:03:32.700> get<00:03:32.880> you<00:03:32.970> above<00:03:33.270> line<00:03:33.540> up<00:03:33.720> view<00:03:33.930> of

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
so let me get you above line up view of

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.920 
so let me get you above line up view of
all<00:03:34.230> these<00:03:34.520> now<00:03:35.520> i'm<00:03:35.880> probably<00:03:36.330> going<00:03:36.570> to<00:03:36.780> make

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
all these now i'm probably going to make

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.440 
all these now i'm probably going to make
some<00:03:37.200> more<00:03:37.350> shells<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:38.010> i'll<00:03:38.820> do<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.060> final

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
some more shells and i'll do a final

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.360 
some more shells and i'll do a final
overview<00:03:40.140> because<00:03:40.440> i'm<00:03:40.560> doing<00:03:40.800> i'm<00:03:41.100> doing

that whole series on you know my actual

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:51.260 
that whole series on you know my actual
display<00:03:46.430> so<00:03:48.860> this<00:03:49.860> is<00:03:50.040> just<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.400> silent<00:03:50.970> some<00:03:51.150> of

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.990 
so but I think about it I have eight
mortars<00:04:10.160> and<00:04:10.340> there<00:04:11.000> are<00:04:11.180> 1<00:04:11.600> 2<00:04:11.630> 3<00:04:11.810> 4<00:04:12.380> 5<00:04:12.620> 6<00:04:12.860> 7

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
mortars and there are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.790 
mortars and there are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
shells<00:04:14.000> here<00:04:14.290> so<00:04:15.290> what<00:04:15.410> I'm<00:04:15.500> going<00:04:15.590> to<00:04:15.680> try<00:04:15.770> to

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
shells here so what I'm going to try to

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.280 
shells here so what I'm going to try to
do<00:04:16.040> I'm<00:04:16.220> going<00:04:16.250> to<00:04:16.430> try<00:04:16.610> to<00:04:16.640> get<00:04:16.940> maybe<00:04:17.299> maybe

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
do I'm going to try to get maybe maybe

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.750 
do I'm going to try to get maybe maybe
I'll<00:04:18.530> do<00:04:18.680> a<00:04:18.709> finale<00:04:19.130> you<00:04:19.340> know<00:04:19.489> with<00:04:19.730> that

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
I'll do a finale you know with that

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.390 
I'll do a finale you know with that
large<00:04:20.239> rack<00:04:20.540> that<00:04:20.720> I<00:04:20.780> have<00:04:21.250> you<00:04:22.250> know<00:04:22.370> two

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
large rack that I have you know two

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.070 
large rack that I have you know two
quick<00:04:22.970> fuse<00:04:23.210> them<00:04:23.360> all<00:04:23.450> together<00:04:23.600> but<00:04:23.930> I'd

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
quick fuse them all together but I'd

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.650 
quick fuse them all together but I'd
rather<00:04:24.230> just<00:04:24.560> have<00:04:24.820> two<00:04:25.820> mortars<00:04:26.240> out<00:04:26.420> there

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
rather just have two mortars out there

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.350 
rather just have two mortars out there
one<00:04:27.140> hot<00:04:27.410> and<00:04:27.560> one<00:04:27.620> cold<00:04:27.770> so<00:04:28.700> I<00:04:28.730> can<00:04:29.000> just<00:04:29.150> keep

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
one hot and one cold so I can just keep

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.910 
one hot and one cold so I can just keep
alternating<00:04:29.960> I<00:04:30.170> can<00:04:30.200> just<00:04:30.470> bring<00:04:30.650> them<00:04:30.740> out

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
alternating I can just bring them out

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.590 
alternating I can just bring them out
one<00:04:31.100> at<00:04:31.220> a<00:04:31.250> time<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:31.730> do<00:04:31.850> them<00:04:31.970> and<00:04:32.120> you<00:04:32.510> know

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
one at a time and do them and you know

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.940 
one at a time and do them and you know
because<00:04:32.930> I<00:04:32.960> don't<00:04:33.170> want<00:04:33.200> to<00:04:33.380> have<00:04:33.530> this<00:04:33.560> I

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
because I don't want to have this I

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.770 
because I don't want to have this I
don't<00:04:34.400> have<00:04:34.520> enough<00:04:34.850> to<00:04:35.090> change<00:04:35.360> fees<00:04:35.600> them

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
don't have enough to change fees them

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.420 
don't have enough to change fees them
all<00:04:35.870> and<00:04:36.080> how<00:04:36.200> about<00:04:36.410> this<00:04:36.530> giant<00:04:36.980> long<00:04:37.100> so<00:04:37.400> i

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
all and how about this giant long so i

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.890 
all and how about this giant long so i
think<00:04:37.610> it's<00:04:37.910> just<00:04:38.000> going<00:04:38.240> to<00:04:38.270> be<00:04:38.330> more<00:04:38.660> for

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
think it's just going to be more for

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.930 
think it's just going to be more for
show-and-tell<00:04:39.680> for<00:04:40.280> people<00:04:40.550> that<00:04:40.730> come<00:04:40.910> here

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
show-and-tell for people that come here

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.330 
show-and-tell for people that come here
because<00:04:41.210> they're<00:04:41.390> not<00:04:41.480> expecting<00:04:41.900> this<00:04:42.340> giant

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
because they're not expecting this giant

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.360 
because they're not expecting this giant
huge<00:04:43.550> display<00:04:44.950> say<00:04:45.950> I'm<00:04:46.070> going<00:04:46.190> to<00:04:46.250> make<00:04:46.340> some

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
huge display say I'm going to make some

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.210 
huge display say I'm going to make some
more<00:04:46.700> probably<00:04:47.090> make<00:04:47.240> a<00:04:47.270> lot<00:04:47.390> out<00:04:47.750> of<00:04:47.810> these

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
more probably make a lot out of these

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.030 
more probably make a lot out of these
with<00:04:49.220> these<00:04:49.250> firecrackers<00:04:49.670> I<00:04:50.800> might<00:04:51.800> try<00:04:51.980> to

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
with these firecrackers I might try to

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.470 
with these firecrackers I might try to
make<00:04:52.220> one<00:04:52.370> with<00:04:52.490> black<00:04:52.730> cats<00:04:53.060> in<00:04:53.240> it<00:04:53.360> because

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
make one with black cats in it because

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.910 
make one with black cats in it because
it'd<00:04:53.720> be<00:04:53.750> kind<00:04:54.050> of<00:04:54.110> cool<00:04:54.170> to<00:04:54.350> make<00:04:54.620> a<00:04:54.650> shell

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
it'd be kind of cool to make a shell

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.920 
it'd be kind of cool to make a shell
that<00:04:54.950> it<00:04:55.220> was<00:04:55.340> plated<00:04:55.670> and<00:04:55.730> shoot<00:04:55.970> just<00:04:56.750> the

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
that it was plated and shoot just the

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.720 
that it was plated and shoot just the
rocket<00:04:57.350> part<00:04:57.590> of<00:04:57.680> exid<00:04:58.040> spin<00:04:58.280> it<00:04:58.370> i'd<00:04:58.460> be<00:04:58.550> kind

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
rocket part of exid spin it i'd be kind

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.720 
rocket part of exid spin it i'd be kind
of<00:04:58.760> like<00:04:58.850> a<00:04:58.910> Hummer<00:04:59.210> I<00:04:59.480> don't<00:05:00.080> know<00:05:00.170> and<00:05:00.740> then

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
of like a Hummer I don't know and then

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.130 
of like a Hummer I don't know and then
all<00:05:02.180> I<00:05:02.600> might<00:05:02.960> I<00:05:03.230> mean<00:05:03.950> I<00:05:04.070> will<00:05:04.310> actually<00:05:04.640> i

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
all I might I mean I will actually i

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.130 
all I might I mean I will actually i
might<00:05:06.140> change<00:05:06.440> to<00:05:06.650> use<00:05:06.800> am<00:05:07.190> a<00:05:07.540> smaller<00:05:08.540> display

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
might change to use am a smaller display

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.409 
might change to use am a smaller display
I<00:05:09.350> might<00:05:09.860> have<00:05:10.010> like<00:05:10.190> a<00:05:10.220> board<00:05:10.640> with<00:05:10.760> you<00:05:11.240> know
