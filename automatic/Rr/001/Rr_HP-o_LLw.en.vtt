hello<00:00:06.290> this<00:00:06.710> is<00:00:06.770> ric<00:00:07.640> KY<00:00:08.060> the<00:00:08.480> android<00:00:09.350> guy<00:00:09.620> hey

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
hello this is ric KY the android guy hey

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.860 
hello this is ric KY the android guy hey
guys<00:00:10.610> today<00:00:10.940> we're<00:00:11.120> going<00:00:11.270> to<00:00:11.330> be<00:00:11.480> going<00:00:11.630> over

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
guys today we're going to be going over

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.870 
guys today we're going to be going over
the<00:00:12.139> benchmark<00:00:12.770> test<00:00:13.100> for<00:00:13.910> the<00:00:14.090> note<00:00:14.660> pro<00:00:15.110> 12.2

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:15.880 
the benchmark test for the note pro 12.2

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.600 
the benchmark test for the note pro 12.2
now<00:00:16.880> this<00:00:17.029> is<00:00:17.090> the<00:00:17.210> Wi-Fi<00:00:18.020> model<00:00:18.619> not<00:00:18.920> the<00:00:18.950> LTE

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:19.610 
now this is the Wi-Fi model not the LTE

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.220 
now this is the Wi-Fi model not the LTE
version<00:00:20.000> why<00:00:20.630> does<00:00:20.840> that<00:00:20.960> make<00:00:21.110> a<00:00:21.140> difference

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
version why does that make a difference

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.830 
version why does that make a difference
well<00:00:22.099> because<00:00:22.460> it<00:00:22.610> has<00:00:22.790> different<00:00:23.029> internals

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
well because it has different internals

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.370 
well because it has different internals
namely<00:00:24.650> the<00:00:24.950> processor<00:00:25.669> so<00:00:26.000> let's<00:00:26.300> go<00:00:26.419> to<00:00:26.599> this

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
namely the processor so let's go to this

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.909 
namely the processor so let's go to this
processor<00:00:27.980> and<00:00:28.099> see<00:00:28.220> what<00:00:28.369> it<00:00:28.460> has<00:00:28.610> so<00:00:29.419> this<00:00:29.810> is

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919 
processor and see what it has so this is

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:33.910 
processor and see what it has so this is
Samsung's<00:00:30.919> Exynos<00:00:31.460> octa<00:00:31.610> core<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:33.710> version

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
Samsung's Exynos octa core the version

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.279 
Samsung's Exynos octa core the version
is<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:34.810> 5420<00:00:35.810> which<00:00:36.020> is<00:00:36.200> a<00:00:36.309> 1.9<00:00:37.309> quad<00:00:38.059> core<00:00:38.539> are

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:39.289 
is the 5420 which is a 1.9 quad core are

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.290 
is the 5420 which is a 1.9 quad core are
sorry<00:00:39.680> quad<00:00:40.100> core<00:00:40.370> on<00:00:40.460> one<00:00:40.670> side<00:00:40.940> and<00:00:41.149> then<00:00:41.210> we

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
sorry quad core on one side and then we

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.689 
sorry quad core on one side and then we
have<00:00:41.480> a<00:00:41.510> lower<00:00:42.410> quad<00:00:42.859> core<00:00:43.070> I<00:00:43.100> want<00:00:43.340> to<00:00:43.399> say<00:00:43.519> one

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
have a lower quad core I want to say one

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:46.509 
have a lower quad core I want to say one
point<00:00:43.969> to<00:00:44.239> a<00:00:45.079> quad<00:00:45.590> core<00:00:45.859> so<00:00:46.160> you<00:00:46.250> have<00:00:46.340> two

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
point to a quad core so you have two

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:48.400 
point to a quad core so you have two
quad<00:00:46.760> cores<00:00:47.000> for<00:00:47.179> running<00:00:47.449> not<00:00:48.109> at<00:00:48.230> the<00:00:48.379> same

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
quad cores for running not at the same

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.250 
quad cores for running not at the same
time<00:00:48.829> but<00:00:49.039> separately<00:00:49.579> one<00:00:50.030> is<00:00:50.179> in<00:00:50.329> a<00:00:50.449> 15<00:00:50.960> and

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
time but separately one is in a 15 and

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.729 
time but separately one is in a 15 and
one<00:00:51.890> is<00:00:52.039> an<00:00:52.160> ace<00:00:52.339> older<00:00:52.820> a7<00:00:53.420> processor<00:00:53.739> so

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
one is an ace older a7 processor so

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.590 
one is an ace older a7 processor so
again<00:00:54.949> to<00:00:55.280> four<00:00:55.609> cores<00:00:55.940> but<00:00:56.210> not<00:00:56.300> running<00:00:56.539> at

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
again to four cores but not running at

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.360 
again to four cores but not running at
the<00:00:56.719> same<00:00:56.899> time<00:00:57.140> to<00:00:57.350> run<00:00:57.559> separately<00:00:58.039> from

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
the same time to run separately from

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.779 
the same time to run separately from
each<00:00:58.519> other<00:00:59.440> so<00:01:00.440> we<00:01:00.559> have<00:01:00.710> the<00:01:00.890> four<00:01:01.129> and

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
each other so we have the four and

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.600 
each other so we have the four and
showing<00:01:02.149> you<00:01:02.239> how<00:01:02.390> each<00:01:02.629> run<00:01:03.040> for<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.159> main

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
showing you how each run for the main

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.020 
showing you how each run for the main
ones<00:01:04.909> and<00:01:05.740> important<00:01:06.740> as<00:01:06.890> well<00:01:07.220> as<00:01:07.460> this<00:01:07.760> isn't

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
ones and important as well as this isn't

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.300 
ones and important as well as this isn't
the<00:01:08.870> Snapdragon<00:01:09.470> one<00:01:09.590> which<00:01:09.800> also<00:01:09.980> has<00:01:10.160> an

actually very well on the gaming aspect
if<00:01:21.080> you<00:01:21.290> check<00:01:21.500> out<00:01:21.620> the<00:01:21.770> game<00:01:21.890> interview<00:01:22.190> it's

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
if you check out the game interview it's

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.780 
if you check out the game interview it's
done<00:01:22.640> very<00:01:22.970> well<00:01:23.350> now<00:01:24.350> if<00:01:24.620> if<00:01:24.890> we<00:01:25.280> go<00:01:25.550> to<00:01:25.640> the

only about seventeen percent at this

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.530 
only about seventeen percent at this
time<00:01:52.070> i'm<00:01:52.520> guessing<00:01:52.910> i<00:01:52.970> have<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.120> lot<00:01:53.270> running

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.229 
battery 9800 milliamps definitely I've
experienced<00:02:05.780> at<00:02:05.840> about<00:02:06.080> eight<00:02:06.470> hours<00:02:06.740> of

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:07.239 
experienced at about eight hours of

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:10.029 
experienced at about eight hours of

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
movie well nine hour movie play

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.449 
movie well nine hour movie play
back<00:02:10.189> so<00:02:11.030> yeah<00:02:11.209> so<00:02:11.659> let's<00:02:11.900> check<00:02:12.110> out<00:02:12.260> the

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
back so yeah so let's check out the

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.179 
back so yeah so let's check out the
results<00:02:13.459> starting<00:02:14.150> off<00:02:14.239> with<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.689> 22<00:02:15.079> so<00:02:15.980> for

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:16.189 
results starting off with and 22 so for

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.319 
results starting off with and 22 so for
the<00:02:16.280> intuitive<00:02:16.670> benchmark<00:02:17.090> test<00:02:17.450> we<00:02:17.659> got<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.900> 35

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:19.329 
the intuitive benchmark test we got a 35

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.899 
the intuitive benchmark test we got a 35
347<00:02:20.329> which<00:02:20.540> does<00:02:21.230> prevail<00:02:21.620> over<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:22.609> existing

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
347 which does prevail over the existing

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:28.809 
347 which does prevail over the existing
note<00:02:23.870> 3<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:24.670> g2<00:02:25.670> Adreno<00:02:26.859> 330<00:02:27.859> and<00:02:28.220> Snapdragon

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
note 3 and g2 Adreno 330 and Snapdragon

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.410 
note 3 and g2 Adreno 330 and Snapdragon
800<00:02:29.299> processor<00:02:29.329> and<00:02:30.109> graphics<00:02:30.140> card<00:02:31.000> so<00:02:32.000> it

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
800 processor and graphics card so it

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.770 
800 processor and graphics card so it
does<00:02:32.870> cut<00:02:33.349> a<00:02:33.379> little<00:02:33.620> bit<00:02:33.859> above<00:02:34.159> the<00:02:34.480> top<00:02:35.480> ones

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
does cut a little bit above the top ones

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.539 
does cut a little bit above the top ones
right<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.680> top<00:02:37.129> one<00:02:37.370> right<00:02:37.549> now<00:02:38.560> although<00:02:39.560> I

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
right the top one right now although I

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.300 
right the top one right now although I
don't<00:02:41.319> obviously<00:02:42.319> compared<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:42.980> real<00:02:43.099> world

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
don't obviously compared to real world

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.550 
don't obviously compared to real world
that's<00:02:43.609> another<00:02:43.909> story<00:02:44.139> and<00:02:45.139> when<00:02:45.290> we<00:02:45.409> go<00:02:45.530> to

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
that's another story and when we go to

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.069 
that's another story and when we go to
the<00:02:45.980> comparison<00:02:46.579> side-by-side<00:02:47.000> compared<00:02:47.989> to

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
the comparison side-by-side compared to

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.170 
the comparison side-by-side compared to
the<00:02:48.139> note<00:02:48.319> 3<00:02:48.620> we<00:02:49.220> can<00:02:49.340> see<00:02:49.489> that<00:02:49.669> it<00:02:49.790> definitely

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
the note 3 we can see that it definitely

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.080 
the note 3 we can see that it definitely
goes<00:02:51.079> back<00:02:51.439> and<00:02:51.650> forth<00:02:51.709> between<00:02:52.159> the<00:02:52.430> two<00:02:52.459> in

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
goes back and forth between the two in

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.640 
goes back and forth between the two in
terms<00:02:53.299> of<00:02:53.450> multitasking<00:02:53.930> it<00:02:54.290> does<00:02:54.439> a<00:02:54.470> better

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
terms of multitasking it does a better

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.309 
terms of multitasking it does a better
job<00:02:54.769> here<00:02:55.519> in<00:02:56.090> terms<00:02:56.299> of<00:02:56.450> runtime<00:02:56.900> it<00:02:57.139> does<00:02:57.290> a

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
job here in terms of runtime it does a

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.460 
job here in terms of runtime it does a
very<00:02:57.409> much<00:02:58.250> so<00:02:58.489> a<00:02:58.519> better<00:02:58.700> job<00:02:58.939> here<00:02:59.510> and<00:02:59.720> in

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
very much so a better job here and in

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.750 
very much so a better job here and in
terms<00:03:00.620> of<00:03:00.950> ram<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:01.819> 2d<00:03:02.540> graphics<00:03:03.579> actually<00:03:04.579> in

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
terms of ram and 2d graphics actually in

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.789 
terms of ram and 2d graphics actually in
terms<00:03:04.970> of<00:03:05.120> RAM<00:03:05.329> to<00:03:05.840> do<00:03:05.930> graphics<00:03:06.260> and<00:03:06.290> 3d

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
terms of RAM to do graphics and 3d

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.140 
terms of RAM to do graphics and 3d
graphics<00:03:07.220> it<00:03:07.400> takes<00:03:07.760> it<00:03:07.970> right<00:03:08.180> here<00:03:08.659> and<00:03:09.010> and

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
graphics it takes it right here and and

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.670 
graphics it takes it right here and and
storage<00:03:11.150> seems<00:03:11.689> to<00:03:11.780> run<00:03:11.870> a<00:03:11.959> little<00:03:12.079> bit<00:03:12.260> faster

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
storage seems to run a little bit faster

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.409 
storage seems to run a little bit faster
but<00:03:12.859> slightly<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.579> so<00:03:13.819> does<00:03:13.879> database

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:14.419 
but slightly and so does database

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.649 
but slightly and so does database
slightly<00:03:15.459> so<00:03:16.459> a<00:03:16.849> little<00:03:17.060> bit<00:03:17.269> different

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:17.659 
slightly so a little bit different

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:21.339 
slightly so a little bit different
between<00:03:17.840> those<00:03:18.139> two<00:03:19.389> now<00:03:20.389> let's<00:03:20.959> actually

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
between those two now let's actually

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.180 
between those two now let's actually
test<00:03:22.069> out<00:03:22.340> see<00:03:22.790> what<00:03:23.419> the<00:03:23.690> graphics<00:03:24.260> how<00:03:25.010> it

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
test out see what the graphics how it

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.979 
test out see what the graphics how it
ranked<00:03:25.519> well<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.120> graphics<00:03:26.479> didn't<00:03:26.690> ring<00:03:26.810> too

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
ranked well the graphics didn't ring too

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:33.629 
ranked well the graphics didn't ring too
high<00:03:27.199> actually<00:03:27.859> so<00:03:28.669> we<00:03:28.790> had<00:03:28.940> a<00:03:29.379> 93<00:03:30.379> 82<00:03:31.780> on<00:03:32.780> the

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
high actually so we had a 93 82 on the

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:37.899 
high actually so we had a 93 82 on the
level<00:03:34.639> for<00:03:35.229> the<00:03:36.229> extreme<00:03:36.799> so<00:03:37.220> if<00:03:37.340> we<00:03:37.430> go<00:03:37.579> to<00:03:37.639> the

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
level for the extreme so if we go to the

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.589 
level for the extreme so if we go to the
extreme<00:03:38.919> 93<00:03:39.919> as<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:40.879> can<00:03:40.970> see<00:03:41.120> a<00:03:41.150> lot<00:03:41.419> of<00:03:41.449> these

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
extreme 93 as you can see a lot of these

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.509 
extreme 93 as you can see a lot of these
get<00:03:42.019> maxed<00:03:42.590> out<00:03:42.769> so<00:03:43.579> like<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.599> Tegra<00:03:44.900> shield

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
get maxed out so like the Tegra shield

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.670 
get maxed out so like the Tegra shield
Nexus<00:03:46.519> 5<00:03:46.729> and<00:03:46.760> some<00:03:47.299> of<00:03:47.389> these<00:03:47.479> really<00:03:48.229> do<00:03:48.470> get

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
Nexus 5 and some of these really do get

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.039 
Nexus 5 and some of these really do get
maxed<00:03:49.129> out<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:49.549> we're<00:03:49.729> over<00:03:50.180> around<00:03:50.419> here

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
maxed out and we're over around here

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:56.439 
maxed out and we're over around here
which<00:03:51.590> was<00:03:52.180> 9036<00:03:53.180> I've<00:03:54.079> had<00:03:54.769> more<00:03:55.040> than<00:03:55.099> 93<00:03:55.849> but

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:56.449 
which was 9036 I've had more than 93 but

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:59.110 
which was 9036 I've had more than 93 but
again<00:03:56.689> that's<00:03:56.989> still<00:03:57.260> against<00:03:57.949> devices<00:03:58.849> such

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
again that's still against devices such

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.809 
again that's still against devices such
as<00:03:59.180> even<00:03:59.540> like<00:03:59.629> the<00:03:59.750> Kobo<00:04:00.549> which<00:04:01.549> has<00:04:01.699> the

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
as even like the Kobo which has the

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.670 
as even like the Kobo which has the
Tegra<00:04:02.090> 4<00:04:02.329> and<00:04:02.510> it's<00:04:02.689> a<00:04:02.810> lot<00:04:03.049> of<00:04:03.139> tabor<00:04:03.349> for

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
Tegra 4 and it's a lot of tabor for

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.780 
Tegra 4 and it's a lot of tabor for
devices<00:04:04.280> here<00:04:04.790> and<00:04:05.799> over<00:04:06.799> here<00:04:06.829> we<00:04:07.220> have<00:04:07.250> more

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
devices here and over here we have more

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.699 
devices here and over here we have more
of<00:04:07.939> the<00:04:08.709> Snapdragon<00:04:09.709> 800<00:04:10.220> from<00:04:10.669> the<00:04:10.879> Sony<00:04:11.709> to

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
of the Snapdragon 800 from the Sony to

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:18.670 
of the Snapdragon 800 from the Sony to
the<00:04:13.299> LG<00:04:14.299> flex<00:04:14.659> and<00:04:16.239> even<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.359> s4<00:04:17.750> one<00:04:17.989> I<00:04:18.320> think

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
the LG flex and even the s4 one I think

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.129 
the LG flex and even the s4 one I think
the<00:04:18.889> note<00:04:19.099> 3<00:04:19.370> actually<00:04:19.789> maxed<00:04:20.359> out<00:04:20.479> as<00:04:20.719> well<00:04:20.930> in

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
the note 3 actually maxed out as well in

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.140 
the note 3 actually maxed out as well in
this<00:04:21.229> one<00:04:21.469> yeah<00:04:21.739> see<00:04:21.950> a<00:04:21.979> g2<00:04:22.490> maxed<00:04:22.880> out

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
this one yeah see a g2 maxed out

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.290 
this one yeah see a g2 maxed out
here<00:04:23.330> so<00:04:23.840> a<00:04:23.870> lot<00:04:24.080> of<00:04:24.169> these<00:04:24.290> Snapdragon<00:04:24.770> 800

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
here so a lot of these Snapdragon 800

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.010 
here so a lot of these Snapdragon 800
maxed<00:04:26.300> out<00:04:26.479> in<00:04:27.110> comparison<00:04:28.630> when<00:04:29.630> we<00:04:29.810> go<00:04:29.960> to

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
maxed out in comparison when we go to

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.860 
maxed out in comparison when we go to
the<00:04:30.290> ultimate<00:04:30.949> again<00:04:31.910> a<00:04:32.210> little<00:04:32.449> bit<00:04:32.600> lower

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
the ultimate again a little bit lower
