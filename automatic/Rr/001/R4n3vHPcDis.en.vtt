to<00:01:52.390> have<00:01:52.509> a<00:01:52.539> layered<00:01:52.869> look<00:01:53.200> and<00:01:53.560> I<00:01:53.619> didn't<00:01:53.800> want

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
to have a layered look and I didn't want

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.749 
to have a layered look and I didn't want
to<00:01:54.009> chop<00:01:54.310> too<00:01:54.729> much<00:01:55.030> of<00:01:55.390> my<00:01:56.110> left<00:01:56.409> off<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.729> I

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
to chop too much of my left off so I

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.550 
to chop too much of my left off so I
figured<00:01:57.940> just<00:01:58.360> get<00:01:58.600> one<00:01:58.840> shorter<00:01:59.259> and<00:01:59.409> then

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
figured just get one shorter and then

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.179 
figured just get one shorter and then
one<00:01:59.770> longer<00:02:00.250> and<00:02:00.659> this<00:02:01.659> is<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.409> back<00:02:02.740> of<00:02:03.040> the

clear<00:04:45.240> gel<00:04:45.680> around<00:04:46.680> my<00:04:46.800> edges<00:04:47.250> just<00:04:48.410> my

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
clear gel around my edges just my

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.050 
clear gel around my edges just my
natural<00:04:49.470> hair<00:04:50.010> is<00:04:50.160> not<00:04:50.310> perm<00:04:50.610> doing<00:04:50.880> anything
