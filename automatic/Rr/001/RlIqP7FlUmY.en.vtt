00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
my impression about the patch is the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.080 
my impression about the patch is the
crafting<00:00:37.380> system<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.829> amazing<00:00:38.340> if<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.879> go<00:00:39.030> to

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
crafting system is amazing if you go to

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.700 
crafting system is amazing if you go to
the<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.360> blue<00:00:39.600> grass<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.110> look<00:00:40.230> for<00:00:40.469> rare

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.779 
pieces on certain items that you can
craft<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:46.079> best<00:00:46.350> items<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.340> world<00:00:47.579> are

craft the best items in the world are

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.770 
craft the best items in the world are
all<00:00:48.030> crafted<00:00:48.660> now<00:00:49.160> and<00:00:50.360> it's<00:00:51.360> really<00:00:51.600> cool

all crafted now and it's really cool

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.569

that<00:00:51.840> you're<00:00:52.050> finally<00:00:52.289> able<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.680> get<00:00:53.160> items

for<00:00:53.730> yourself<00:00:54.090> now<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.600> think<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.960> cost<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.379> a

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
for yourself now I think the cost is a

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.099 
for yourself now I think the cost is a
bit<00:00:55.620> high<00:00:55.860> especially<00:00:56.309> for<00:00:56.879> people<00:00:57.449> who<00:00:57.930> don't

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
bit high especially for people who don't

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.160 
bit high especially for people who don't
have<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.500> much<00:00:58.649> gold<00:00:58.920> or<00:00:59.100> new<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.550> game

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
have that much gold or new to the game

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.429 
have that much gold or new to the game
but<00:01:01.170> overall<00:01:01.500> or<00:01:02.250> other<00:01:02.899> you<00:01:03.899> could<00:01:04.049> also<00:01:04.199> see

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
but overall or other you could also see

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.560 
but overall or other you could also see
that<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:05.129> new<00:01:05.280> people<00:01:05.760> they<00:01:05.909> don't<00:01:06.060> need<00:01:06.330> that

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
get better gear but in my opinion that

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.280 
get better gear but in my opinion that
still<00:03:46.400> needs<00:03:46.640> to<00:03:46.730> be<00:03:46.820> one<00:03:47.269> incentive<00:03:47.959> to<00:03:48.170> do

like the best players or the players
that<00:03:58.190> let's<00:03:59.120> say<00:03:59.239> for<00:03:59.420> example<00:03:59.450> if<00:03:59.840> they

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
that let's say for example if they

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:01.449 
that let's say for example if they
decide<00:04:00.410> okay<00:04:00.709> the<00:04:00.829> challenge<00:04:01.130> is<00:04:01.220> going<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:01.400> be

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
decide okay the challenge is going to be

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.670 
decide okay the challenge is going to be
an<00:04:01.609> endless<00:04:01.880> tension<00:04:02.359> that<00:04:02.690> gets<00:04:02.930> harder<00:04:03.620> and

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
an endless tension that gets harder and

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.009 
an endless tension that gets harder and
harder<00:04:03.769> the<00:04:04.220> more<00:04:04.370> your<00:04:04.519> progress<00:04:04.819> rate<00:04:05.150> they

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
harder the more your progress rate they

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.539 
harder the more your progress rate they
just<00:04:06.260> make<00:04:06.410> leader<00:04:06.650> but<00:04:06.829> like<00:04:07.040> who<00:04:07.190> is<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.430> guy

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
just make leader but like who is the guy

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.970 
just make leader but like who is the guy
that<00:04:07.579> was<00:04:08.090> able<00:04:08.420> to<00:04:08.480> progress<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:09.560> flattest

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
that was able to progress the flattest

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.410 
that was able to progress the flattest
in<00:04:10.190> it<00:04:11.290> those<00:04:12.290> would<00:04:12.440> be<00:04:12.560> really<00:04:12.769> cool<00:04:12.980> things

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
in it those would be really cool things

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.050 
in it those would be really cool things
another<00:04:14.420> thing<00:04:14.720> that<00:04:14.959> could<00:04:15.470> be<00:04:15.639> if<00:04:16.639> they

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
another thing that could be if they

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.800 
another thing that could be if they
don't<00:04:17.090> want<00:04:17.479> to<00:04:17.600> make<00:04:18.820> or<00:04:19.820> if<00:04:20.060> they<00:04:20.269> want<00:04:20.750> to

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
don't want to make or if they want to

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.010 
don't want to make or if they want to
make<00:04:21.080> it<00:04:21.320> accessible<00:04:21.680> for<00:04:22.340> everyone<00:04:22.789> because

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
make it accessible for everyone because

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.719 
make it accessible for everyone because
would<00:04:24.199> still<00:04:24.410> be<00:04:24.530> another<00:04:24.740> bug<00:04:24.889> ghia<00:04:25.099> but<00:04:25.639> they

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
would still be another bug ghia but they

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.189 
would still be another bug ghia but they
could<00:04:25.879> be<00:04:25.910> fingering<00:04:26.210> about<00:04:26.419> okay<00:04:26.720> this

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
could be fingering about okay this

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.409 
could be fingering about okay this
system<00:04:27.470> in<00:04:27.949> this<00:04:28.220> system<00:04:28.460> everyone<00:04:29.120> has<00:04:29.270> the

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
system in this system everyone has the

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.170 
system in this system everyone has the
same<00:04:29.449> gear<00:04:30.020> everyone<00:04:31.009> exactly<00:04:31.160> gets<00:04:31.669> the<00:04:31.940> same

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
same gear everyone exactly gets the same

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.029 
same gear everyone exactly gets the same
gear<00:04:32.509> like<00:04:32.690> maybe<00:04:32.990> pre-made<00:04:33.500> characters<00:04:33.919> or

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
gear like maybe pre-made characters or

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.610 
gear like maybe pre-made characters or
something<00:04:34.430> if<00:04:34.550> you<00:04:34.639> go<00:04:34.759> in<00:04:34.940> and<00:04:35.120> then<00:04:35.870> just<00:04:36.500> let

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
something if you go in and then just let

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.050 
something if you go in and then just let
the<00:04:36.740> leader<00:04:36.919> bugs<00:04:37.220> because<00:04:37.460> then<00:04:37.759> it<00:04:37.879> doesn't

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
the leader bugs because then it doesn't

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.990 
the leader bugs because then it doesn't
affect<00:04:38.479> the<00:04:38.659> normal<00:04:39.050> game<00:04:39.229> at<00:04:39.500> all<00:04:39.879> that<00:04:40.879> will

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
affect the normal game at all that will

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.969 
affect the normal game at all that will
also<00:04:41.150> be<00:04:41.330> a<00:04:41.360> really<00:04:41.569> good<00:04:41.720> option<00:04:41.930> but<00:04:42.440> let's

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
also be a really good option but let's

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:44.950 
also be a really good option but let's
go<00:04:43.159> to<00:04:43.220> the<00:04:43.400> next<00:04:43.580> plan<00:04:43.879> items<00:04:44.720> and<00:04:44.900> the

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:12.949 
into the game so that it actually feels

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:14.559

that many items on the ground but the

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.510 
that many items on the ground but the
items<00:05:39.409> on<00:05:39.590> the<00:05:39.740> ground<00:05:39.979> are<00:05:40.190> going<00:05:40.370> to<00:05:40.430> be

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
items on the ground are going to be

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.450 
items on the ground are going to be
better<00:05:40.759> so<00:05:41.599> as<00:05:42.259> I<00:05:42.440> say<00:05:42.620> they're<00:05:42.919> gonna<00:05:43.039> improve

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
better so as I say they're gonna improve

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.760

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
the general quality of the items so

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.140 
the general quality of the items so
because<00:05:46.159> there's<00:05:46.310> no<00:05:46.400> point<00:05:46.669> to<00:05:46.789> see<00:05:46.940> like
