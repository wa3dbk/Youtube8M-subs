maybe even heaven as the Lord goes and
you're<00:00:16.800> probably<00:00:17.039> wondering<00:00:17.580> why<00:00:17.910> we

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
you're probably wondering why we

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.300 
you're probably wondering why we
stripped<00:00:18.690> out<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.080> old<00:00:19.260> design<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.890> went<00:00:20.070> for

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
stripped out the old design and went for

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.410 
stripped out the old design and went for
this<00:00:20.460> new<00:00:20.820> funky<00:00:21.420> like<00:00:22.939> one<00:00:23.939> block<00:00:24.180> high

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
this new funky like one block high

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.570 
this new funky like one block high
design<00:00:24.779> which<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.410> vel<00:00:25.619> which<00:00:26.430> will

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
design which of the vel which will

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.660 
design which of the vel which will
develop<00:00:26.820> did<00:00:27.060> all<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.390> designing<00:00:27.840> for<00:00:28.260> well

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
develop did all the designing for well

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.840 
develop did all the designing for well
as<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:30.599> probably<00:00:30.750> saw<00:00:31.050> from<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:32.009> first<00:00:32.219> sky

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
as you probably saw from the first sky

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.299 
as you probably saw from the first sky
town<00:00:33.750> like<00:00:34.079> episode<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:35.540> could<00:00:36.540> be<00:00:36.630> told<00:00:36.870> that

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
town like episode you could be told that

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.490 
town like episode you could be told that
it<00:00:38.309> didn't<00:00:38.670> really<00:00:38.940> look<00:00:39.090> very<00:00:39.570> good<00:00:40.290> it

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
it didn't really look very good it

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.260 
it didn't really look very good it
wasn't<00:00:40.800> very<00:00:40.890> professional<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.579> didn't<00:00:42.000> spend

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
wasn't very professional I didn't spend

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.160 
wasn't very professional I didn't spend
hardly<00:00:42.960> any<00:00:43.230> time<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.340> actual<00:00:44.899> sky<00:00:45.899> town

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
hardly any time on the actual sky town

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.270 
hardly any time on the actual sky town
and<00:00:46.610> I<00:00:47.610> thought<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.539> was<00:00:48.780> my<00:00:49.110> worst<00:00:49.410> build<00:00:49.860> ever

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
and I thought it was my worst build ever

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.760 
and I thought it was my worst build ever
so<00:00:50.940> all<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.480> villain<00:00:51.690> like<00:00:51.780> we<00:00:51.960> sat<00:00:52.170> down<00:00:52.230> and

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
so all the villain like we sat down and

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.139 
so all the villain like we sat down and
were<00:00:52.920> like<00:00:53.160> right<00:00:53.399> let's<00:00:53.640> make<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.820> better

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
were like right let's make this better

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.540 
were like right let's make this better
so<00:00:54.239> we<00:00:54.570> just<00:00:54.750> removed<00:00:55.559> every<00:00:55.949> single<00:00:56.219> building

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
so we just removed every single building

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.849 
so we just removed every single building
apart<00:00:57.059> from<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.390> shop<00:00:57.660> everything<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.710> feel

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
apart from the shop everything we feel

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.200 
apart from the shop everything we feel
like<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.100> shop<00:00:59.309> was<00:00:59.550> probably<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.000> best

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
like the shop was probably the best

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.490 
like the shop was probably the best
building<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.840> rest<00:01:01.050> were<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.379> there

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
building and the rest were just there

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.460 
building and the rest were just there
which<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.710> rubbish<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:04.170> then<00:01:04.379> we're

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
which is rubbish so and then we're

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.960 
which is rubbish so and then we're
trying<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.739> decide<00:01:05.159> what<00:01:05.369> kind<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.729> house

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
trying to decide what kind of house

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.390 
trying to decide what kind of house
could<00:01:06.390> be<00:01:06.570> like<00:01:07.380> design<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.890> house<00:01:08.010> could<00:01:08.250> we

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
could be like design of a house could we

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.120 
could be like design of a house could we
have<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:09.930> decided<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.380> go<00:01:10.530> for<00:01:10.560> these<00:01:10.860> like

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
have so we decided to go for these like

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.420 
have so we decided to go for these like
stilts<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:12.930> one<00:01:13.049> block<00:01:13.200> high<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.830> this

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
stilts so it's one block high and this

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.859 
stilts so it's one block high and this
was<00:01:14.549> actually<00:01:14.670> designed<00:01:14.939> by<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.479> Vale<00:01:15.630> he

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
was actually designed by of the Vale he

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.719 
was actually designed by of the Vale he
did<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.110> first<00:01:16.259> house<00:01:16.530> then<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.430> kind<00:01:17.670> of

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
did the first house then I kind of

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.740 
did the first house then I kind of
copied<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.830> here<00:01:19.830> we<00:01:19.979> have<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.850> kind<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.659> a

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
copied it here we have a kind of a

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.990 
copied it here we have a kind of a
healing<00:01:22.200> alchemy<00:01:22.799> shop<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.880> owls

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
bring the watermelons from the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.520

watermelon<00:01:27.540> farm<00:01:27.689> over<00:01:27.900> there<00:01:28.020> which<00:01:28.320> I'll

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
watermelon farm over there which I'll

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.770 
watermelon farm over there which I'll
explain<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.850> bit<00:01:29.880> what<00:01:30.180> all<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.960> about

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
explain in a bit what all that is about

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.800 
explain in a bit what all that is about
just<00:01:33.780> some<00:01:33.930> general<00:01:34.229> housing<00:01:34.799> here<00:01:35.540> we<00:01:36.540> can't

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
just some general housing here we can't

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.620 
just some general housing here we can't
actually<00:01:37.280> build<00:01:38.280> stuff<00:01:38.579> on<00:01:38.820> half<00:01:39.150> slabs<00:01:39.479> you

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
actually build stuff on half slabs you

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.149 
actually build stuff on half slabs you
can<00:01:39.810> see<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.259> all<00:01:40.380> half<00:01:40.560> slabs<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.100> then

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
can see this is all half slabs and then

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.850 
can see this is all half slabs and then
it's<00:01:41.549> at<00:01:41.729> one<00:01:41.880> block<00:01:42.090> high<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:43.110> if<00:01:43.470> we<00:01:43.649> want<00:01:43.799> to

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
it's at one block high so if we want to

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.289 
it's at one block high so if we want to
build<00:01:44.009> stuff<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:44.520> top<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.939> house<00:01:45.030> we<00:01:45.210> have

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
build stuff on top of the house we have

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.210 
build stuff on top of the house we have
the<00:01:45.390> port<00:01:45.570> half<00:01:45.750> blocks<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.799> that's<00:01:47.040> why

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
the port half blocks so that's why

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.580 
the port half blocks so that's why
things<00:01:47.939> are<00:01:48.119> raised<00:01:48.390> but<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.320> still<00:01:49.470> looks

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
things are raised but it still looks

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.560 
things are raised but it still looks
pretty<00:01:49.649> nice<00:01:49.920> we<00:01:50.130> got<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.549> nice<00:01:50.939> garden<00:01:51.240> area

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
pretty nice we got a nice garden area

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.840 
pretty nice we got a nice garden area
here<00:01:51.810> some<00:01:52.409> nice<00:01:52.649> chairs<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.310> obviously<00:01:53.640> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
here some nice chairs and obviously the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.020

out<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.049> veils<00:03:42.230> done<00:03:42.470> got<00:03:43.010> a<00:03:43.040> flower<00:03:43.310> there

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
out the veils done got a flower there

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.759 
out the veils done got a flower there
got<00:03:43.760> a<00:03:43.790> chest<00:03:44.180> and<00:03:44.480> you<00:03:45.049> got<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.470> white

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
got a chest and you got the white

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.099 
got a chest and you got the white
spawner<00:03:46.400> where<00:03:46.819> all<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:47.180> whites<00:03:47.420> will<00:03:47.840> come

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
spawner where all the whites will come

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:49.990 
spawner where all the whites will come
out<00:03:48.260> of<00:03:48.470> so<00:03:48.650> all<00:03:48.829> no<00:03:49.040> I<00:03:49.069> think<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.459> church<00:03:49.670> is<00:03:49.730> a

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
out of so all no I think the church is a

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.059 
out of so all no I think the church is a
really<00:03:50.420> nice<00:03:50.600> build<00:03:50.930> of<00:03:51.170> develop<00:03:51.530> design<00:03:51.799> this

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
really nice build of develop design this

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:53.349 
really nice build of develop design this
so<00:03:52.310> it's<00:03:52.489> a<00:03:52.549> really<00:03:52.700> nice<00:03:52.850> build

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
so it's a really nice build

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.569 
so it's a really nice build
so<00:03:53.780> it's<00:03:54.019> also<00:03:54.170> keeps<00:03:54.500> in<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:54.769> same<00:03:55.010> design<00:03:55.340> as

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
so it's also keeps in the same design as

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.280 
so it's also keeps in the same design as
one<00:03:55.910> block<00:03:56.120> I<00:03:56.299> we've<00:03:56.540> you<00:03:56.690> know<00:03:56.720> stilts

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
one block I we've you know stilts

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.349 
one block I we've you know stilts
holding<00:03:57.560> it<00:03:57.620> up<00:03:57.739> having<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.519> foundation<00:03:59.120> so

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
holding it up having the foundation so

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.150 
holding it up having the foundation so
it<00:03:59.450> isn't<00:03:59.720> fall<00:03:59.959> onto<00:04:00.109> the<00:04:00.260> ground<00:04:00.319> just

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
it isn't fall onto the ground just

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.160 
it isn't fall onto the ground just

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
general general seating areas here so

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.860

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
actually add into the sky town all the

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.840 
actually add into the sky town all the
clay<00:05:06.470> subjects<00:05:06.980> in<00:05:07.190> a<00:05:07.580> whole<00:05:09.310> moving<00:05:10.310> on<00:05:10.490> down

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
clay subjects in a whole moving on down

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.570 
clay subjects in a whole moving on down
here<00:05:11.300> I<00:05:11.480> can<00:05:12.200> see<00:05:12.230> we've<00:05:12.770> started<00:05:13.070> to<00:05:13.220> add<00:05:13.250> some

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
here I can see we've started to add some

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.580 
here I can see we've started to add some
more<00:05:13.700> Vice<00:05:13.970> to<00:05:14.210> the<00:05:14.270> second<00:05:14.570> island<00:05:14.660> so<00:05:15.410> yeah

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
more Vice to the second island so yeah

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.080 
more Vice to the second island so yeah
it<00:05:15.830> looks<00:05:16.220> like<00:05:16.310> the<00:05:16.490> same<00:05:16.669> on<00:05:16.880> the<00:05:16.970> bottom

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
it looks like the same on the bottom

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.840 
it looks like the same on the bottom
just<00:05:17.270> looks<00:05:17.720> like<00:05:17.810> an<00:05:18.020> extra<00:05:18.260> island<00:05:18.590> and<00:05:18.850> I

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
just looks like an extra island and I

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.060 
just looks like an extra island and I
think<00:05:20.030> it<00:05:20.150> readers<00:05:20.450> fit<00:05:20.690> really<00:05:21.110> well<00:05:21.260> in<00:05:21.650> the

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070

clay Soldiers world it stands out nicely
and<00:05:25.540> surprisingly<00:05:27.160> the<00:05:28.160> clay<00:05:28.340> soldiers

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
and surprisingly the clay soldiers

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
and surprisingly the clay soldiers
haven't<00:05:29.000> actually<00:05:29.330> committed<00:05:29.690> suicide

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
haven't actually committed suicide

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.409 
haven't actually committed suicide
they've<00:05:30.410> kind<00:05:30.710> of<00:05:30.800> they<00:05:31.790> kind<00:05:32.030> of<00:05:32.120> stain<00:05:32.300> on

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
they've kind of they kind of stain on

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:33.760 
they've kind of they kind of stain on
the<00:05:32.510> ground<00:05:32.750> there's<00:05:32.990> there's<00:05:33.320> not<00:05:33.410> many<00:05:33.590> on

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
the ground there's there's not many on

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.010 
the ground there's there's not many on
this<00:05:33.950> side<00:05:34.160> because<00:05:35.000> it's<00:05:35.300> because<00:05:35.660> the<00:05:35.750> spawn

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
this side because it's because the spawn

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.510 
this side because it's because the spawn
is<00:05:36.050> over<00:05:36.440> there<00:05:36.590> but<00:05:36.830> every<00:05:37.130> now<00:05:37.250> and<00:05:37.400> then

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
is over there but every now and then

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.700 
is over there but every now and then
obviously<00:05:38.180> the<00:05:38.480> look<00:05:38.780> that<00:05:38.960> once<00:05:39.380> crushing

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
obviously the look that once crushing

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.370 
obviously the look that once crushing
the<00:05:39.800> bridge<00:05:40.010> so<00:05:40.850> yeah<00:05:41.000> it<00:05:41.270> looks<00:05:41.510> I<00:05:41.870> think<00:05:42.200> the

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
the bridge so yeah it looks I think the

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.690 
the bridge so yeah it looks I think the
new<00:05:42.500> design<00:05:42.770> look<00:05:42.950> was<00:05:43.070> really<00:05:43.370> really<00:05:43.520> nice

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
new design look was really really nice

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.280 
new design look was really really nice
and<00:05:43.760> obviously<00:05:44.270> they<00:05:44.360> can<00:05:44.510> walk<00:05:44.660> with<00:05:44.780> me<00:05:44.960> and

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
and obviously they can walk with me and

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.659 
and obviously they can walk with me and
the<00:05:45.560> clay<00:05:45.710> Soldiers<00:05:46.040> others<00:05:46.340> that<00:05:46.460> before

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
the clay Soldiers others that before

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.230 
the clay Soldiers others that before
they<00:05:46.850> don't<00:05:47.150> commit<00:05:47.419> suicide<00:05:47.990> the<00:05:48.860> clay

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
they don't commit suicide the clay

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.590 
they don't commit suicide the clay
they're<00:05:50.240> really<00:05:50.570> quite<00:05:50.780> smart<00:05:51.260> so<00:05:52.480> they<00:05:53.480> won't

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
they're really quite smart so they won't

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.390 
they're really quite smart so they won't
jump<00:05:53.840> off<00:05:54.050> or<00:05:54.230> anything<00:05:54.500> unless<00:05:54.860> they've<00:05:55.370> got

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
jump off or anything unless they've got

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.130 
jump off or anything unless they've got
feathers<00:05:55.669> I've<00:05:56.090> actually<00:05:56.300> tested<00:05:56.780> that<00:05:56.870> but

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
feathers I've actually tested that but

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.300 
feathers I've actually tested that but
they<00:05:57.260> will<00:05:57.410> probably<00:05:57.470> jump<00:05:57.830> off<00:05:57.919> with<00:05:58.100> our

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
they will probably jump off with our

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.610 
they will probably jump off with our
feathers<00:05:58.730> but<00:05:58.940> I'll<00:05:59.390> make<00:05:59.630> it<00:05:59.690> so<00:05:59.990> only<00:06:00.200> a<00:06:00.350> few

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
feathers but I'll make it so only a few

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.580 
feathers but I'll make it so only a few
can<00:06:00.770> actually<00:06:01.220> have<00:06:01.340> feathers<00:06:01.610> I<00:06:02.380> mean<00:06:03.380> they

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
can actually have feathers I mean they

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.040 
can actually have feathers I mean they
may<00:06:03.740> still<00:06:04.040> jump<00:06:04.340> off<00:06:04.520> by<00:06:05.150> accident<00:06:05.480> if<00:06:05.870> the

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
may still jump off by accident if the

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.290 
may still jump off by accident if the
pushed<00:06:06.290> off<00:06:06.500> or<00:06:06.710> if<00:06:06.890> they<00:06:07.040> slip<00:06:07.520> this<00:06:08.030> guy<00:06:08.240> is
