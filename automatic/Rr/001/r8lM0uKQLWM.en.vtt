00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.260 
clear in the back solid or vice versa
but<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.920> can't<00:01:44.159> do<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.460> half<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.850> half<00:01:45.030> unless

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
but you can't do it half in half unless

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.020 
but you can't do it half in half unless
you<00:01:45.509> paint<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:46.130> now<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.189> get<00:01:47.369> your<00:01:47.490> choice<00:01:47.670> of

on<00:01:51.960> these<00:01:52.140> socks<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.189> went<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.149> far<00:01:54.299> as<00:01:54.479> beca's

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
on these socks I went so far as beca's

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.030 
on these socks I went so far as beca's
to<00:01:55.049> look<00:01:55.200> at<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.409> original<00:01:55.500> Mobile<00:01:55.920> Suit

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
to look at the original Mobile Suit

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.709 
to look at the original Mobile Suit
Gundam<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.460> see<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.850> char's<00:01:57.180> z'gok<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.659> the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
Gundam to see that char's z'gok in the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.359 
Gundam to see that char's z'gok in the
anime<00:01:58.020> actually<00:01:58.170> had<00:01:58.500> three<00:01:58.770> claws<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.219> that's

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
anime actually had three claws so that's

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.719 
anime actually had three claws so that's
what<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.520> used

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
what I used

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.310 
what I used
those<00:02:02.240> rubber<00:02:02.509> parts<00:02:02.780> like<00:02:02.930> I<00:02:03.049> said<00:02:03.229> are

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
those rubber parts like I said are

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.260 
those rubber parts like I said are
mostly<00:02:03.619> used<00:02:03.860> in<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:04.250> joints<00:02:04.670> just<00:02:05.030> to<00:02:05.150> give

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
mostly used in the joints just to give

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.400 
mostly used in the joints just to give
it<00:02:05.360> a<00:02:05.390> little<00:02:05.479> more<00:02:05.659> detail<00:02:06.229> and<00:02:06.380> effect<00:02:08.410> and

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
it a little more detail and effect and

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.930 
it a little more detail and effect and
you<00:02:09.500> can<00:02:09.530> see<00:02:09.649> there<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.009> waste<00:02:10.220> there<00:02:10.459> has<00:02:10.670> to

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
you can see there the waste there has to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.820 
you can see there the waste there has to
bowl<00:02:11.720> joints<00:02:12.080> on<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:12.290> one<00:02:12.410> on<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.560> top<00:02:12.680> on<00:02:12.800> the

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
bowl joints on it one on the top on the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.050 
bowl joints on it one on the top on the
bottom<00:02:12.980> so<00:02:13.130> you<00:02:13.190> go<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.310> lot<00:02:13.580> of<00:02:13.610> movement<00:02:13.849> out

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
bottom so you go a lot of movement out

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.600 
bottom so you go a lot of movement out
of<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.209> ways<00:02:14.300> which<00:02:14.480> is<00:02:14.599> nice<00:02:15.400> one<00:02:16.400> feature

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
of the ways which is nice one feature

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.520 
of the ways which is nice one feature
which<00:02:16.760> I<00:02:16.880> thought<00:02:17.000> was<00:02:17.120> kind<00:02:17.330> of<00:02:17.480> neat<00:02:17.630> you<00:02:17.900> get

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
which I thought was kind of neat you get

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.740 
which I thought was kind of neat you get
these<00:02:18.620> two<00:02:18.920> rubber<00:02:19.459> cables<00:02:20.030> that<00:02:20.270> run<00:02:20.330> down

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
these two rubber cables that run down

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.080 
these two rubber cables that run down
the<00:02:21.260> length<00:02:21.440> of<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.739> arms<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.489> legs<00:02:22.520> and

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
the length of the arms and the legs and

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.420 
the length of the arms and the legs and
you<00:02:23.840> can<00:02:23.870> see<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.560> cables<00:02:24.920> running<00:02:25.250> through

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
you can see the cables running through

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.949 
you can see the cables running through
the<00:02:25.520> kit<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:25.940> get<00:02:26.060> some<00:02:26.180> really<00:02:26.390> nice<00:02:26.569> effect

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959

area but I wanted a little bit of

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.570 
area but I wanted a little bit of
half-and-half<00:03:00.260> so<00:03:00.709> you<00:03:00.769> can<00:03:00.890> see<00:03:01.040> what<00:03:01.459> it

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
half-and-half so you can see what it

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.370 
half-and-half so you can see what it
looks<00:03:01.730> like<00:03:01.790> with<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:02.299> without<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.690> armor<00:03:05.380> as
