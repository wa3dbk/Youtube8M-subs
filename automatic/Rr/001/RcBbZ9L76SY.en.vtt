originally<00:00:31.710> released<00:00:32.009> by<00:00:32.279> Ferrari<00:00:32.879> as<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:34.230> a

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
originally released by Ferrari as a a

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.900 
originally released by Ferrari as a a
lower<00:00:36.300> priced<00:00:36.780> vehicle<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.679> it<00:00:38.429> was<00:00:38.579> going<00:00:38.820> to

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
lower priced vehicle and it was going to

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.900 
lower priced vehicle and it was going to
be<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> relatively<00:00:39.539> low<00:00:39.839> low<00:00:40.710> cost<00:00:40.739> sports<00:00:41.489> car

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
be a relatively low low cost sports car

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.529 
be a relatively low low cost sports car
and<00:00:42.890> the<00:00:43.890> Dino<00:00:44.249> was<00:00:44.460> was<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.300> first

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
and the Dino was was the the first

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.930 
and the Dino was was the the first
Ferrari<00:00:45.780> without<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.559> 12-cylinder<00:00:47.249> engine

Ferrari without the 12-cylinder engine

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.720 
Ferrari without the 12-cylinder engine
and<00:00:48.409> I<00:00:50.329> think<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.420> Dino<00:00:51.749> the<00:00:52.409> original<00:00:52.890> Dino

and I think the Dino the original Dino

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.029 
and I think the Dino the original Dino
which<00:00:53.969> was<00:00:54.210> came<00:00:54.449> out<00:00:54.569> as<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.719> two<00:00:55.379> oh<00:00:55.409> six<00:00:55.829> or

which was came out as a two oh six or

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.869 
which was came out as a two oh six or
the<00:00:56.100> two<00:00:56.420> two<00:00:57.420> four<00:00:57.809> six<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.859> 206<00:00:59.429> was<00:00:59.670> a

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
the two two four six the 206 was a

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.590 
the two two four six the 206 was a
slightly<00:01:00.559> detuned<00:01:01.789> one<00:01:02.789> for<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.149> Italian

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
slightly detuned one for the Italian

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.490 
slightly detuned one for the Italian
market<00:01:03.809> because<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.559> tax<00:01:04.830> tax<00:01:05.520> thresholds

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
vehicle there itself there the later

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.740 
vehicle there itself there the later
Dino's<00:01:19.620> which<00:01:19.890> became<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.400> 308<00:01:20.850> which<00:01:21.450> came
