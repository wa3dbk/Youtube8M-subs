I've got some silicone all kinds of

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.830 
I've got some silicone all kinds of
garbage<00:02:17.980> on<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:18.459> so<00:02:18.700> somebody's<00:02:19.690> probably

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
garbage on it so somebody's probably

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.509 
garbage on it so somebody's probably
been<00:02:20.079> in<00:02:20.200> here<00:02:20.319> before<00:02:20.379> but<00:02:20.829> it<00:02:20.950> leaks<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:21.459> I

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
been in here before but it leaks and I

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.160 
been in here before but it leaks and I
don't<00:02:21.700> like<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:21.970> so<00:02:22.269> let's<00:02:22.510> get<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:22.720> fixed

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
don't like that so let's get a fixed

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.619 
don't like that so let's get a fixed
that<00:02:24.069> these<00:02:24.340> bolts<00:02:24.700> just<00:02:24.910> come<00:02:25.090> up<00:02:25.239> fairly

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
that these bolts just come up fairly

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:31.510 
that these bolts just come up fairly
easy<00:02:25.810> all<00:02:26.410> you<00:02:26.560> got<00:02:26.709> to<00:02:26.799> do<00:02:26.950> is<00:02:27.129> spit<00:02:27.370> them<00:02:27.459> out

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.580 

well<00:02:32.090> what<00:02:32.870> we<00:02:32.960> found<00:02:33.140> I'm<00:02:33.380> not<00:02:33.470> really

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
well what we found I'm not really

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.830 
well what we found I'm not really
surprised<00:02:33.980> about<00:02:34.160> if<00:02:34.460> you<00:02:34.580> look<00:02:34.730> at<00:02:34.850> this<00:02:35.030> you

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
surprised about if you look at this you

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.110 
surprised about if you look at this you
can<00:02:35.870> see<00:02:36.140> all<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.410> nasty<00:02:36.830> blue<00:02:37.040> silicone<00:02:37.700> some

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
can see all the nasty blue silicone some

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.540 
can see all the nasty blue silicone some
dummy<00:02:38.510> put<00:02:38.720> on<00:02:38.870> it<00:02:39.050> but<00:02:39.890> if<00:02:39.980> you<00:02:40.100> look<00:02:40.280> at<00:02:40.430> this

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
dummy put on it but if you look at this

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.210 
dummy put on it but if you look at this
gasket<00:02:40.880> I<00:02:41.360> mean<00:02:41.870> there's<00:02:42.020> really<00:02:42.230> no<00:02:42.590> gasket

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
gasket I mean there's really no gasket

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.040 
gasket I mean there's really no gasket
left<00:02:43.490> all<00:02:43.760> this<00:02:43.910> left<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.300> silicone<00:02:44.780> so<00:02:44.960> they

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
left all this left to silicone so they

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.420 
left all this left to silicone so they
didn't<00:02:45.230> want<00:02:45.380> to<00:02:45.440> spend<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.710> here's<00:02:46.310> like

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
didn't want to spend the here's like

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.610 
didn't want to spend the here's like
three<00:02:46.820> dollars<00:02:47.270> the<00:02:47.840> three<00:02:48.050> dollars<00:02:48.350> give<00:02:48.500> me

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
three dollars the three dollars give me

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.930 
three dollars the three dollars give me
one<00:02:48.770> of<00:02:48.860> these<00:02:48.950> so<00:02:49.280> they<00:02:49.400> did<00:02:49.550> is<00:02:49.700> they<00:02:49.820> just

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
one of these so they did is they just

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.540 
one of these so they did is they just
put<00:02:50.180> crap<00:02:50.990> all<00:02:51.290> over<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.770> top<00:02:51.950> of<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.130> tank<00:02:52.400> so

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
put crap all over the top of the tank so

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.710 
put crap all over the top of the tank so
now<00:02:52.670> I<00:02:52.700> have<00:02:52.910> to<00:02:53.000> clean<00:02:53.180> it<00:02:53.210> off

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
now I have to clean it off

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.430 
now I have to clean it off
luckily<00:02:54.230> I've<00:02:54.500> already<00:02:54.800> drained<00:02:54.980> all<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.280> gas

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
luckily I've already drained all the gas

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.890 
luckily I've already drained all the gas
so<00:02:57.440> that<00:02:57.740> it<00:02:58.640> won't<00:02:58.850> get<00:02:58.970> stuck<00:02:59.420> in<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.630> tank

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
so that it won't get stuck in the tank

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.780 
so that it won't get stuck in the tank
and<00:03:00.590> I'm<00:03:00.740> going<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:00.950> go<00:03:01.190> ahead<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:01.490> just<00:03:01.610> clean

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
and I'm going to go ahead and just clean

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.070 
and I'm going to go ahead and just clean
out<00:03:01.850> the<00:03:02.090> tank<00:03:02.300> while<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:02.510> have<00:03:02.720> this<00:03:02.870> off

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
out the tank while I have this off

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.280 
out the tank while I have this off
anyway<00:03:03.940> but<00:03:04.940> yes<00:03:05.120> this<00:03:05.330> is<00:03:05.390> why<00:03:05.630> you<00:03:05.690> do<00:03:06.140> your

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
anyway but yes this is why you do your

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.470 
anyway but yes this is why you do your
own<00:03:06.380> work<00:03:06.620> and<00:03:07.610> no<00:03:07.760> anybody<00:03:08.060> else<00:03:08.270> do<00:03:08.450> it

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
own work and no anybody else do it

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.150 
own work and no anybody else do it
because<00:03:08.930> they<00:03:09.230> do<00:03:09.290> stuff<00:03:09.560> like<00:03:09.590> this<00:03:09.860> so<00:03:10.310> all

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
because they do stuff like this so all

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.440 
because they do stuff like this so all
we'll<00:03:13.160> see<00:03:13.370> what<00:03:13.550> we<00:03:13.670> can<00:03:13.820> do<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:14.060> clean<00:03:14.240> it<00:03:14.360> up

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
we'll see what we can do to clean it up

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.270 
we'll see what we can do to clean it up
but<00:03:14.600> I'm<00:03:14.750> pretty<00:03:14.990> sure<00:03:15.170> this<00:03:15.710> is<00:03:15.770> the<00:03:15.980> reason

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
but I'm pretty sure this is the reason

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.680 
but I'm pretty sure this is the reason
why<00:03:16.400> I<00:03:16.430> was<00:03:16.670> getting<00:03:16.970> water<00:03:17.150> in<00:03:17.360> my<00:03:17.450> gas<00:03:17.660> tank

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
why I was getting water in my gas tank

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.640 
why I was getting water in my gas tank
all<00:03:18.410> right<00:03:18.530> I<00:03:18.560> got<00:03:18.860> all<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:20.200> nasty<00:03:21.200> silicone

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
all right I got all the nasty silicone

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.050 
all right I got all the nasty silicone
off<00:03:21.830> as<00:03:22.100> you<00:03:22.280> can<00:03:22.400> tell<00:03:22.580> there's<00:03:22.820> more

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
off as you can tell there's more

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.200 
off as you can tell there's more
silicone<00:03:23.480> than<00:03:23.720> gasket<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:25.790> other<00:03:25.940> thing

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
silicone than gasket the other thing

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.390 
silicone than gasket the other thing
that<00:03:26.240> was<00:03:26.420> interesting<00:03:26.630> was<00:03:27.140> when<00:03:27.890> I<00:03:27.950> did<00:03:28.190> take

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
that was interesting was when I did take

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.190 
that was interesting was when I did take
it<00:03:28.430> off<00:03:28.670> it<00:03:28.970> was<00:03:29.120> actually<00:03:29.600> quite<00:03:29.750> squishy

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
it off it was actually quite squishy

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.100 
it off it was actually quite squishy
like<00:03:31.190> either<00:03:31.370> it<00:03:31.640> have<00:03:31.820> been<00:03:32.000> letting<00:03:32.900> water

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
like either it have been letting water

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.930 
like either it have been letting water
in<00:03:33.380> or<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:33.770> gas<00:03:33.920> that<00:03:34.130> started<00:03:34.490> dissolve<00:03:34.790> it

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
in or the gas that started dissolve it

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.750 
in or the gas that started dissolve it
or<00:03:35.060> both<00:03:35.320> in<00:03:36.320> other<00:03:36.500> words<00:03:36.740> it<00:03:37.160> didn't<00:03:37.490> seal<00:03:37.640> it

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
or both in other words it didn't seal it

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.120 
or both in other words it didn't seal it
very<00:03:37.940> well<00:03:38.090> so<00:03:38.330> here's<00:03:38.650> there's<00:03:39.650> a<00:03:39.740> new<00:03:39.890> gasket

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
very well so here's there's a new gasket

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.070 
very well so here's there's a new gasket
I<00:03:40.400> also<00:03:40.610> want<00:03:40.880> to<00:03:40.910> show<00:03:41.090> you<00:03:41.150> guys<00:03:41.240> the<00:03:41.900> gas

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
I also want to show you guys the gas

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.230 
I also want to show you guys the gas
that<00:03:42.260> came<00:03:42.410> out<00:03:42.560> at<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:42.680> very<00:03:42.740> bottom<00:03:43.040> as<00:03:43.460> you

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
that came out at the very bottom as you

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.330 
that came out at the very bottom as you
know<00:03:44.360> gas<00:03:44.660> I<00:03:45.050> don't<00:03:45.770> think<00:03:45.920> it's<00:03:46.040> supposed<00:03:46.250> to

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
know gas I don't think it's supposed to

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.750 
know gas I don't think it's supposed to
be<00:03:46.520> this<00:03:46.670> color<00:03:46.910> um<00:03:47.810> there<00:03:48.440> was<00:03:48.560> a<00:03:48.620> lot<00:03:48.740> of<00:03:48.890> what

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
be this color um there was a lot of what

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.980 
be this color um there was a lot of what
looked<00:03:49.940> like<00:03:49.970> water<00:03:50.270> at<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.540> bottom<00:03:50.660> of<00:03:50.900> the

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
looked like water at the bottom of the

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.820 
looked like water at the bottom of the
tank<00:03:51.260> so<00:03:51.560> I'm<00:03:52.280> hoping<00:03:52.610> now<00:03:52.820> with<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:54.680> new

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
tank so I'm hoping now with the new

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.530 
tank so I'm hoping now with the new
gaskets<00:03:55.340> and<00:03:55.520> the<00:03:55.580> new<00:03:55.670> seals<00:03:56.030> and<00:03:56.360> all<00:03:56.450> the

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
gaskets and the new seals and all the

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.680 
gaskets and the new seals and all the
other<00:03:56.660> new<00:03:56.840> stuff<00:03:57.140> that<00:03:58.120> will<00:03:59.120> be<00:03:59.270> good<00:03:59.480> from

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
other new stuff that will be good from

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.100 
other new stuff that will be good from
here<00:03:59.870> on<00:04:00.020> out<00:04:00.260> so<00:04:01.060> that's<00:04:02.060> really<00:04:02.780> how<00:04:03.050> you

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
here on out so that's really how you

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.870 
here on out so that's really how you
take<00:04:03.530> it<00:04:03.680> apart<00:04:03.980> how<00:04:04.250> you<00:04:04.310> put<00:04:04.580> it<00:04:04.610> back

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
take it apart how you put it back

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.590 
take it apart how you put it back
together<00:04:05.120> is<00:04:05.510> opposite<00:04:06.020> of<00:04:06.230> that<00:04:07.040> so<00:04:07.460> if<00:04:08.450> this

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
together is opposite of that so if this

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.350 
together is opposite of that so if this
helps<00:04:08.840> you<00:04:08.900> out<00:04:08.960> I<00:04:09.020> hope<00:04:09.260> it<00:04:09.440> does<00:04:09.650> and<00:04:10.360> good

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
helps you out I hope it does and good

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.200 
helps you out I hope it does and good
luck<00:04:11.510> with<00:04:11.660> your<00:04:11.720> Corvette
