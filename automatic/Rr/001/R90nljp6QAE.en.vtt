cover<00:00:09.360> up<00:00:09.599> so<00:00:10.380> we<00:00:10.889> prefer<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.490> use<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:12.090> smaller

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
cover up so we prefer to use the smaller

end<00:00:12.900> of<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.500> brush<00:00:15.619> not<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:17.039> wider<00:00:17.609> end

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
end of the brush not the wider end

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.359 
end of the brush not the wider end
because<00:00:18.390> there's<00:00:18.600> more<00:00:18.869> control<00:00:19.410> with<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
because there's more control with the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.910 
because there's more control with the
small<00:00:20.640> end<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.119> when<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.840> put<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.590> brush

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
small end and when you put the brush

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.820 
small end and when you put the brush
into<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.310> powder<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:24.029> really<00:00:24.750> want<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.050> press

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
into the powder you really want to press

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.000 
into the powder you really want to press
it<00:00:25.859> into<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.430> powder<00:00:26.990> not<00:00:27.990> just<00:00:28.260> lightly<00:00:28.769> dab

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
it into the powder not just lightly dab

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.140 
it into the powder not just lightly dab
it<00:00:29.160> across<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:29.640> you're<00:00:29.789> going<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.970> see<00:00:30.119> a

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
it across so you're going to see a

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.730 
it across so you're going to see a
little<00:00:30.420> powder<00:00:30.630> breaking<00:00:31.140> up<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.470> want<00:00:31.650> to

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
little powder breaking up you want to

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.230

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:35.240 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.470 

and<00:00:35.470> then<00:00:36.470> you<00:00:36.680> hold<00:00:37.070> the<00:00:37.700> side<00:00:37.970> of<00:00:38.150> the<00:00:38.270> hair

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
and then you hold the side of the hair

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.560 
and then you hold the side of the hair
down<00:00:38.870> that<00:00:39.710> you're<00:00:39.950> working<00:00:40.130> on<00:00:40.460> and<00:00:40.730> you<00:00:40.790> just

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
down that you're working on and you just

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:49.710 
down that you're working on and you just
press<00:00:42.940> the<00:00:43.940> powder<00:00:46.510> right<00:00:47.510> on<00:00:47.750> to<00:00:47.990> the<00:00:48.080> hair

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
press the powder right on to the hair

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.440 
press the powder right on to the hair
like<00:00:50.720> that<00:00:53.950> so<00:00:54.950> a<00:00:55.220> lot<00:00:55.580> of<00:00:55.730> people<00:00:56.030> don't<00:00:56.240> put

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
like that so a lot of people don't put

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.410 
like that so a lot of people don't put
enough<00:00:56.690> powder<00:00:56.930> on<00:00:57.230> the<00:00:57.350> brush<00:00:57.590> or<00:00:58.270> what<00:00:59.270> they

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
do is they just kind of lightly go they

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.660 
do is they just kind of lightly go they
leave<00:01:02.570> their<00:01:02.750> hair<00:01:02.960> open<00:01:03.350> like<00:01:03.530> this<00:01:03.740> and<00:01:03.950> they

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
leave their hair open like this and they

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.660 
leave their hair open like this and they
dust<00:01:05.089> it<00:01:05.330> onto<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:05.780> top<00:01:06.020> you're<00:01:06.980> not<00:01:07.190> going<00:01:07.550> to

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
dust it onto the top you're not going to

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.040 
dust it onto the top you're not going to
get<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:07.970> results<00:01:08.360> you<00:01:08.420> want<00:01:08.600> that<00:01:08.870> way<00:01:08.990> you

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
get the results you want that way you

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.900 
get the results you want that way you
really<00:01:09.590> have<00:01:09.740> to<00:01:09.830> put<00:01:09.979> enough<00:01:10.250> powder<00:01:10.550> on<00:01:10.790> the

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
really have to put enough powder on the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.440 
really have to put enough powder on the
brush<00:01:11.350> hold<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.530> hair<00:01:12.740> down<00:01:13.010> and<00:01:13.360> sort<00:01:14.360> of

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
brush hold the hair down and sort of

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.700 
brush hold the hair down and sort of
push<00:01:14.830> the<00:01:15.830> powder<00:01:18.190> push<00:01:19.190> the<00:01:19.400> powder<00:01:19.640> right<00:01:20.180> on

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
push the powder push the powder right on

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.219 
push the powder push the powder right on
to<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.860> gray<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:22.369> if<00:01:22.670> it's<00:01:22.820> not<00:01:23.229> sticking

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
to the gray and if it's not sticking

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.140 
to the gray and if it's not sticking
it's<00:01:24.590> because<00:01:25.280> you<00:01:25.400> haven't<00:01:25.880> put<00:01:26.119> enough

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
it's because you haven't put enough

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.010 
it's because you haven't put enough
powder<00:01:26.830> onto<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:28.790> brush<00:01:29.030> like<00:01:29.300> just<00:01:29.600> then<00:01:29.780> I

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
powder onto the brush like just then I

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.320 
powder onto the brush like just then I
didn't<00:01:30.590> have<00:01:30.710> quite<00:01:31.040> so<00:01:31.400> much<00:01:31.580> powder<00:01:34.090> but<00:01:35.090> you

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
didn't have quite so much powder but you

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.460 
didn't have quite so much powder but you
can<00:01:35.540> see<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.930> difference<00:01:37.390> immediately

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
can see the difference immediately

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.139 
can see the difference immediately
blends<00:01:39.470> seamlessly<00:01:39.890> because<00:01:40.610> it<00:01:40.729> has<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.030> many

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
blends seamlessly because it has so many

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.600 
blends seamlessly because it has so many
different<00:01:41.420> pigments<00:01:41.780> in<00:01:42.140> it<00:01:42.259> so<00:01:42.950> what<00:01:43.220> you<00:01:43.250> use

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
different pigments in it so what you use

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.450 
different pigments in it so what you use
this<00:01:43.850> side<00:01:44.119> of<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:44.390> brush<00:01:44.600> for<00:01:44.899> is<00:01:45.200> if

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
this side of the brush for is if

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.830 
this side of the brush for is if
particularly<00:01:46.460> with<00:01:46.580> a<00:01:46.610> really<00:01:46.940> dark<00:01:47.270> brown<00:01:47.509> or

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
particularly with a really dark brown or

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.249 
particularly with a really dark brown or
black<00:01:48.050> if<00:01:48.380> you<00:01:48.830> put<00:01:49.039> too<00:01:49.460> much<00:01:49.910> powder<00:01:50.300> on<00:01:50.660> the

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
black if you put too much powder on the

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.190 
black if you put too much powder on the
powder<00:01:51.500> doesn't<00:01:52.039> stick<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:52.429> powder<00:01:52.780> so<00:01:53.780> it

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
powder doesn't stick to powder so it

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.020 
powder doesn't stick to powder so it
might<00:01:54.470> if<00:01:54.649> you're<00:01:54.770> touching<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:55.250> hair<00:01:55.460> after

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
might if you're touching the hair after

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.210 
might if you're touching the hair after
you<00:01:56.330> do<00:01:56.479> it<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:56.780> you<00:01:57.229> haven't<00:01:57.530> let<00:01:57.710> it<00:01:57.830> settle

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
you do it and you haven't let it settle
