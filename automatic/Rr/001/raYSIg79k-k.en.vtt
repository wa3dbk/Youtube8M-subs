have it falling on paper doesn't mean

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.859

and<00:00:36.750> we<00:00:37.320> came<00:00:37.530> about<00:00:37.800> mastercam<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.850> couple<00:00:39.300> of

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
and we came about mastercam a couple of

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.610 
and we came about mastercam a couple of
years<00:00:39.600> ago<00:00:39.739> where<00:00:41.360> we<00:00:42.360> decided<00:00:42.960> we<00:00:43.140> needed<00:00:43.379> a

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
years ago where we decided we needed a

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.459 
years ago where we decided we needed a
capstone<00:00:44.219> class<00:00:44.719> capstone<00:00:45.719> class<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.320> class

capstone class capstone class a class

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.740 
capstone class capstone class a class
that<00:00:46.800> basically<00:00:47.219> combines<00:00:47.610> all<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.239> skills

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
that basically combines all the skills

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.779 
that basically combines all the skills
out<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.289> several<00:00:49.739> different<00:00:50.160> classes<00:00:50.640> that

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
out of several different classes that

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.639 
out of several different classes that
our<00:00:50.879> students<00:00:51.329> groan<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.870> put<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.500> together

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
our students groan and put it together

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.880 
our students groan and put it together
into<00:00:53.100> something<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.789> makes<00:00:54.059> sense<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.930> we

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
into something that makes sense and we

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.950 
into something that makes sense and we
decided<00:00:56.190> on<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> cnc<00:00:57.090> project<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.750> cost

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
decided on a cnc project in cost

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.290 
decided on a cnc project in cost
analysis<00:00:58.530> class<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:59.309> found<00:00:59.489> out<00:00:59.760> very<00:01:00.210> early

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
analysis class we found out very early

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.299 
analysis class we found out very early
on<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.840> some<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> things<00:01:01.500> we<00:01:01.739> wanted<00:01:02.250> to

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
on that some of the things we wanted to

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.380 
on that some of the things we wanted to
do<00:01:02.820> are<00:01:03.180> very<00:01:03.660> hard<00:01:04.049> by<00:01:04.500> hand<00:01:04.890> coding<00:01:05.369> E&amp;M<00:01:06.150> code

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
do are very hard by hand coding E&amp;M code

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.630 
do are very hard by hand coding E&amp;M code
so<00:01:07.290> we<00:01:07.500> were<00:01:07.619> looking<00:01:07.740> at<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.100> couple<00:01:08.369> of

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
so we were looking at a couple of

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.280 
so we were looking at a couple of
different<00:01:09.030> things<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.540> fellow<00:01:09.840> novice

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
different things and fellow novice

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.530 
different things and fellow novice
master<00:01:10.470> chem<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.549> set<00:01:11.760> up<00:01:11.880> sheet<00:01:12.060> option<00:01:12.270> in

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
master chem to set up sheet option in

master chem to set up sheet option in
master<00:01:12.840> chem<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.140> fantastic<00:01:14.180> especially<00:01:15.180> with

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
master chem is fantastic especially with

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.420 
master chem is fantastic especially with
the<00:01:15.540> idea<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.110> mind<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.560> other<00:01:16.770> students<00:01:17.280> are

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
the idea in mind that other students are

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.249 
the idea in mind that other students are
going<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.210> find<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.630> program<00:01:19.049> that

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
going to have to find the program that

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.130 
going to have to find the program that
they<00:01:19.409> did<00:01:19.619> not<00:01:19.650> generate<00:01:20.060> so<00:01:21.060> stocks<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.840> are

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
they did not generate so stocks that are

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.039 
they did not generate so stocks that are
which<00:01:22.890> tools<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.610> which<00:01:23.790> sequence<00:01:24.420> we<00:01:24.810> are<00:01:24.900> is

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
which tools in which sequence we are is

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.170 
which tools in which sequence we are is
my<00:01:25.229> work<00:01:25.470> co-located<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.520> important<00:01:27.060> is

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
my work co-located is important is

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.990 
my work co-located is important is
vitally<00:01:27.630> important<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.350> have<00:01:28.680> anybody<00:01:29.280> to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
vitally important to have anybody to

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.609 
vitally important to have anybody to
three<00:01:30.450> years<00:01:30.689> down<00:01:30.900> over<00:01:31.170> than<00:01:31.409> everybody

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
three years down over than everybody

three years down over than everybody
else<00:01:31.920> federated<00:01:32.600> needs<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.720> be<00:01:33.810> able<00:01:33.960> to

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
else federated needs to be able to

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.289 
else federated needs to be able to
unlatch<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.799> for<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.549> master<00:01:36.000> chem<00:01:36.150> is

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
unlatch and for that master chem is

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.999 
unlatch and for that master chem is
absolutely<00:01:36.780> fantastic<00:01:36.930> because<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.860> have

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.060 
may ask how can you make that Pokemon
more<00:01:58.210> efficient<00:01:58.660> so<00:01:59.290> they<00:01:59.500> need<00:01:59.710> to<00:01:59.740> be<00:01:59.890> able

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
more efficient so they need to be able

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.690 
more efficient so they need to be able
to<00:02:00.370> read<00:02:00.940> code<00:02:01.300> they<00:02:01.690> need<00:02:01.900> to<00:02:02.020> be<00:02:02.080> able<00:02:02.320> to

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
to read code they need to be able to

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.150 
to read code they need to be able to
recode<00:02:03.700> it<00:02:03.730> for<00:02:04.180> master<00:02:04.540> chem<00:02:04.720> so<00:02:05.470> even<00:02:06.040> if

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
recode it for master chem so even if

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.550 
recode it for master chem so even if
you're<00:02:06.280> not<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:06.550> true<00:02:06.880> machining<00:02:07.360> program

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
you're not a true machining program

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.610 
you're not a true machining program
there<00:02:08.560> is<00:02:08.710> still<00:02:09.369> so<00:02:10.360> much<00:02:10.620> flexibility

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
there is still so much flexibility

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.380 
there is still so much flexibility
within<00:02:12.010> master<00:02:12.580> chem<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:12.970> pretty<00:02:13.180> much<00:02:13.330> make

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
within master chem to pretty much make

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.540 
within master chem to pretty much make
that<00:02:13.810> fit<00:02:14.110> any<00:02:14.350> curriculum<00:02:14.920> that<00:02:15.370> you're

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
that fit any curriculum that you're

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:26.180 
that fit any curriculum that you're
learning

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190
