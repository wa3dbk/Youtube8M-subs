00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:06.569
 hello dear friends today i am 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.450
 I want to share with you information as 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.240
 do here is such a wonderful tree i 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.120
 I call him Karina can Putin someone 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.000
 it seems like love but it is judging your knee 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.859
 national tree of Ukraine and twigs 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.080
 viburnum can be used in 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.260
 different compositions for example such 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.859
 I lead my own and by the hand of classmates 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.949
 so invite you to join 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:36.570
 if you like needlework and are interested 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:39.300
 beadwork so let's start for a start I 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.309
 would like to tell you how I wove the leaves 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.510
 knees 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.120
 for this I used the technique 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.460
 parallel weaving and but im not 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.210
 children helped the circle skillful wolves 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.940
 so every part of this leaf we 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.840
 weave separately first taken alone 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.760
 bead connects two beads 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.100
 lasts a row of three beads in length 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.820
 Well, the top sheet it should be 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:12.270
 a little less further joins 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:16.020
 5 more parts it turns out one continuous 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.380
 sheet of course if in the process of weaving them 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.840
 it will connect more accurately and 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.009
 look beautiful here is such a sheet with us 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.200
 It is the result if for someone 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.270
 the picture changes too fast you 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.710
 have the opportunity to pause and 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.930
 see exactly this leaf 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.630
 bunches are made using twisting technique 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.880
 first take 5 beads forged by scientists 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.840
 and such branches 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.600
 no no twigs do five tricks then 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.630
 every five of these twigs combine one 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.970
 a big bunch and that's such a sadness with us 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:00.220
 it turns out clusters 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:02.730
 we add leaflets and already with this wing 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:07.030
 here the leaves begin to form 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:09.160
 tree to form a bush 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.790
 viburnum we need to do a few 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.600
 smaller twigs combine them more here 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.570
 I formed 2 smaller sprigs 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.680
 with thicker wire I them 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.200
 uniting 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.340
 and starting to shape thicker 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.830
 branches 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.300
 to form a bush of viburnum if i 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:34.300
 need i help myself with merchants when 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.330
 the branches come together they have to feast 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.130
 churn and not only twist but also 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.070
 make thicker 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:47.500
 for this I first use just on 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:49.420
 shelf and then masking tape or thread 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.940
 just paper in this case 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.050
 used upandi 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:58.150
 thicken our trunk or 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:01.300
 so that our tree is quite good 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:05.470
 I looked from all the branches wrapped 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:08.970
 thread floss and only then began to bend 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.110
 Owl Vat pour plaster 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.540
 water so that it is not 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.840
 very fluid quickly set on 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:20.650
 then it will be steady and not 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.200
 encroach but also in conclusion so that our 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.269
 the tree looked good plaster base 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.209
 need to conquer 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:30.090
 acrylic paints undesirable and top 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.269
 varnish 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.450
 I did it so you can manifest 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.599
 your creativity or do a little bit 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.080
 on their own so that you success and good 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.080
 moods
