00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
what we put in recent weeks is start

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.000 
what we put in recent weeks is start
fast<00:02:15.640> which<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.030> is<00:02:16.690> different<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.890> know

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
fast which is is different you know

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.770 
fast which is is different you know
sometimes<00:02:18.430> you<00:02:18.519> expose<00:02:18.790> us<00:02:18.940> up<00:02:19.090> when<00:02:19.299> you<00:02:19.390> take

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
sometimes you expose us up when you take

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.150 
sometimes you expose us up when you take
chances<00:02:20.200> when<00:02:20.380> you<00:02:20.410> start<00:02:20.680> quick<00:02:20.920> when<00:02:21.070> you

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
chances when you start quick when you

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.470 
chances when you start quick when you
build<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.400> tempo<00:02:21.790> when<00:02:21.940> you're<00:02:22.090> trying<00:02:22.359> to

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.490 
were always pretty confident that we can
finish<00:02:53.120> strong<00:02:53.210> them<00:02:53.570> we've<00:02:54.170> proven<00:02:54.440> that

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
finish strong them we've proven that

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.780 
finish strong them we've proven that
even<00:02:54.620> against<00:02:55.040> our<00:02:55.160> sins<00:02:55.400> away<00:02:55.490> this<00:02:55.730> year

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
even against our sins away this year

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.370 
even against our sins away this year
that<00:02:56.150> we<00:02:56.240> had<00:02:56.330> a<00:02:56.360> big<00:02:56.540> last<00:02:56.720> 20<00:02:56.960> minutes<00:02:57.140> or<00:02:57.350> so

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
that we had a big last 20 minutes or so

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.130 
that we had a big last 20 minutes or so
but<00:02:57.800> we<00:02:58.160> just<00:02:58.310> left<00:02:58.430> it<00:02:58.580> too<00:02:58.700> late<00:02:58.900> this<00:02:59.900> time

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
but we just left it too late this time

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.540 
but we just left it too late this time
around<00:03:00.170> go<00:03:00.590> start<00:03:00.890> a<00:03:00.920> bit<00:03:01.040> quicker<00:03:01.280> but

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
around go start a bit quicker but

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.430 
around go start a bit quicker but
remember<00:03:01.880> more<00:03:02.030> pressure<00:03:02.300> and<00:03:02.660> realize<00:03:03.410> that

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
remember more pressure and realize that

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.250 
remember more pressure and realize that
we're<00:03:03.770> in<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.460> game<00:03:04.580> from<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.850> start<00:03:05.120> and<00:03:05.270> not

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
we're in the game from the start and not

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.650 
we're in the game from the start and not
be<00:03:06.440> enough<00:03:06.590> before<00:03:06.890> so<00:03:07.700> that<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:08.180> weather<00:03:08.390> one

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
be enough before so that the weather one

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.690 
be enough before so that the weather one
Saturday<00:03:09.080> interim<00:03:09.800> doesn't<00:03:10.280> look<00:03:10.400> like<00:03:10.520> it's

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
Saturday interim doesn't look like it's

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.920 
Saturday interim doesn't look like it's
too<00:03:10.820> bad<00:03:10.970> but<00:03:11.180> at<00:03:11.240> the<00:03:11.300> minor<00:03:11.420> obviously<00:03:11.840> is

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
too bad but at the minor obviously is

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.900 
too bad but at the minor obviously is
very<00:03:11.990> soggy<00:03:12.440> do<00:03:13.070> do<00:03:13.490> you<00:03:13.580> think<00:03:13.730> that<00:03:13.820> either

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
very soggy do do you think that either

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.280 
very soggy do do you think that either
of<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.330> sides<00:03:14.660> are<00:03:14.840> going<00:03:15.020> to<00:03:15.080> prefer<00:03:16.070> that<00:03:16.370> I

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
of the sides are going to prefer that I

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.360 
of the sides are going to prefer that I
think<00:03:18.290> that<00:03:18.320> honestly<00:03:18.500> a<00:03:18.800> wet<00:03:19.040> they<00:03:19.190> would

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
think that honestly a wet they would

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.980 
think that honestly a wet they would
probably<00:03:19.610> suit<00:03:19.970> Saracens<00:03:20.480> in<00:03:20.600> many<00:03:20.780> ways

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
probably suit Saracens in many ways

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.560 
probably suit Saracens in many ways
they're<00:03:21.230> pragmatic<00:03:21.800> side<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.570> discipline

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
they're pragmatic side the discipline

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.150 
they're pragmatic side the discipline
they<00:03:23.750> keep<00:03:23.960> chase<00:03:24.200> well<00:03:24.470> and<00:03:24.710> they<00:03:24.800> put<00:03:24.980> you<00:03:25.040> in

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
they keep chase well and they put you in

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.940 
they keep chase well and they put you in
the<00:03:25.220> pressure<00:03:26.170> having<00:03:27.170> said<00:03:27.440> that<00:03:27.470> i<00:03:27.650> like<00:03:27.860> to

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
the pressure having said that i like to

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.230 
the pressure having said that i like to
think<00:03:28.070> out<00:03:28.250> forwards<00:03:28.670> are<00:03:28.790> much<00:03:28.940> of<00:03:29.060> anybody

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
think out forwards are much of anybody

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.850 
think out forwards are much of anybody
and<00:03:29.600> if<00:03:29.660> we<00:03:29.750> come<00:03:29.960> down<00:03:29.990> to<00:03:30.230> a<00:03:30.260> scrum<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:30.620> more

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
and if we come down to a scrum and more

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.200 
and if we come down to a scrum and more
buckle<00:03:31.220> nothing<00:03:31.460> like<00:03:31.580> think<00:03:31.820> we'll<00:03:31.910> be<00:03:31.940> right

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
buckle nothing like think we'll be right

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.730 
buckle nothing like think we'll be right
in<00:03:32.240> there<00:03:32.570> so<00:03:32.690> it's<00:03:33.050> a<00:03:33.140> pretty<00:03:33.290> difficult<00:03:33.470> one

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
in there so it's a pretty difficult one

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.250 
in there so it's a pretty difficult one
to<00:03:33.770> call<00:03:34.120> it<00:03:35.120> largely<00:03:35.600> comes<00:03:35.840> down<00:03:36.050> to<00:03:36.170> who

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
to call it largely comes down to who

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.110 
to call it largely comes down to who

gets the momentum swings on the day you

can start while if you can catch those

can start while if you can catch those
first<00:03:39.560> couple<00:03:39.680> of<00:03:39.800> five<00:03:39.980> balls<00:03:40.220> really<00:03:40.490> why

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
first couple of five balls really why

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.980 
first couple of five balls really why
they<00:03:40.790> keep<00:03:40.910> getting<00:03:41.090> more<00:03:41.360> into<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.660> game<00:03:41.870> and

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
they keep getting more into the game and

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.440 
they keep getting more into the game and
get<00:03:42.110> it<00:03:42.200> going<00:03:42.230> forward<00:03:42.650> then<00:03:42.980> you<00:03:43.910> started

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
get it going forward then you started

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.790 
get it going forward then you started
reading<00:03:44.690> a<00:03:44.750> chance<00:03:44.990> if<00:03:45.200> you<00:03:45.260> drop<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.620> first

couple in the nerve start creeping in
and<00:03:47.450> you<00:03:47.540> start<00:03:47.630> looking<00:03:47.840> at<00:03:48.020> each<00:03:48.170> other
