 Yoon starts and maintenance of the engine is pending and sentenced 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:18.630
 each combustion process generates waste that is deposited in the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.679
 food and that negatively affects long-term 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.679
 performance and performance of the engine 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:31.589
 the company deposited in the segments of both the compression and those of 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:35.449
 class and its accommodations this causes a decrease in the compression before

 Of customers 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.240
 of the deterioration of the combustion quality of the fuel mixture 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.650
 time does not result in a reduction in engine performance 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.490
 In turn, this promotes an increase in the consumption of oil and fuel in 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.410
 penalties 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.160
 is what it means, I'm going to see a considerable increase in waste 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.130
 of combustion and schism and therefore a deterioration of the quality of the 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.130
 escape and promotes greater wear of the pads 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.140
 whipped a part of the combustion gases and that is able to pass towards 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.350
 the engine crankcase through the segments causing a rapid 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.320
 aging of 20 hrs 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.060
 the accelerated oxidation of the oil produces a functioning deficiencies

 be deposited in cooler areas of the engine co as for example the arpu 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.970
 phone you can eliminate this waste with an oil change 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.940
 what we used to think was falling behind since the process of oil change 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.680
 includes the total evacuation of used oil by a new announcement in 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.090
 france however nothing 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.790
 the evacuation of the faith and that does not totally eliminate the waste derived from the 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.880
 engine combustion distracted much of them remain deposited in the 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.030
 basis of the public communication system and without ceasing 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.810
 if we simply perform the evacuation of aged oil lincopi what 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.460
 we substitute for the new oil this will absorb the deposited waste 11 and 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.310
 will get dirty again after a very short time so on court 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.589
 manifested 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:17.879
 It is clear that this situation will have a negative effect on benefits 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.199
 of oil 9 united gold 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.969
 in order to maintain the performance and optimal performance of the engines 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:27.639
 both have recommended doing a cleaning of the entire circuit of 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:31.989
 Lubrication session before each change of air eight years 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.989
 to this we must add the jiménez insulin cleaner to the aged oil 3 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.019
 mandy put the engine running at idle merentes 10 and fifteen minutes 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:44.559
 during this time in free zinc and dissolved at molecular level all 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:46.489
 waste derived from combustion 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.489
 and its use those that have been deposited in problem areas 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:53.879
 these are the elements of the pistons in their entirety 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:59.699
 ventilation of the engine freighter 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.239
 and the lubrication zone of the camshaft

 the dam in palm ismo time with its high distinction the inability to 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.719
 lubrication in who protects the engine during the cleaning process the star 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:19.549
 does not damage the elastomers of the joints and keeps the elasticity in good condition 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.339
 of the segments 

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:24.989
 a good with the oil change we also evacuate all the waste 

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:29.459
 three after this process the oil circuit is completely 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.889
 clean ready for newell's at 29 h from britney 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:38.839
 nao we have been so that the 29 work optimally nestlé in a 

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:42.810
 environment they purify just and that they meet the specified requirements 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.640
 such as lubrication, leak tightness, cooling, 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.640
 cleaning and the suspension of the particles 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.189
 it is expected that the fed again to sound impurities that combustion 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:58.359
 could generate immunity and you can say but your benefits if you have no longer 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.449
 are limited by waste to motives 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:05.639
 before that the results are a new oil in an engine free of 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:09.909
 waste a painted consumption of oil and fuel 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:14.420
 an increase in engine performance, less wear on rafts 

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:17.279
 a reduction of emissions gases 

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.059
 of an increase in the duration of catalytic converters
