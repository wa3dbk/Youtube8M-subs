00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.490
 tenth victory of the season for the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.280
 Atletico Madrid's new stadium 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.959
 the cármenes in the day number 11 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.629
 in front of a grenade that was close 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.730
 of putting in a lot of trouble the box of 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.950
 diego pablo simeone the party with 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.560
 a lot of controversy because gonzález 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.090
 Gonzalez noted two penalties in favor of 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.640
 Atlético de Madrid- that ended up being 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.800
 decisive this is the clearest occasion 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.500
 of the first minutes for the grenade 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.120
 with this powerful shot that 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.660
 He not hits the crossbar after 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.980
 to play a player from the atletico de madrid 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.719
 the first minutes were for the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.089
 nazarí team another arrival more 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.219
 interesting that again with tough as 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:46.350
 protagonist and this time thymus 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.469
 courtois who failed on his first outing 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.769
 he ended up solving it by sending the ball 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.769
 to corner 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.600
 but the one that would mark first would be the 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.910
 athletic of madrid- center of juanfran 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.530
 there we see the first great occasion for 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.199
 Diego Costa 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.080
 nod offshore in the center of the player 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:09.060
 of crevillente but roberto won a 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.070
 meter to catch that ball 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.930
 I was pushing the box a lot 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.570
 mattress and in one of those arrivals 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.780
 I was going to get this move put the chest 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.460
 there I fell David Villa and the referee 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.619
 see clear penalty 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.810
 there we see how mind comes running over to 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.030
 david villa that then puts some of his 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.190
 part in any case it seems penalty and 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.860
 Diego Costa ends up marking him out of that 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.780
 way top scorer of the category 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.280
 right now alone exceeds 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.250
 Cristiano Ronaldo with this release 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.050
 penalty sent the fans to silence 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.710
 of the grenade that was rebuking her 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:47.409
 always creating some antipathy when 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.090
 plays as a visitor diego costa on 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.880
 all so hard it makes life 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.440
 the local defenders there we saw another 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.390
 arrival for the athletic one of madrid in 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.789
 this time it was Adrian who was 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.940
 close to mark the second great 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:03.729
 combination of the simeone picture the 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.759
 ball that had bounced and adrián with 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.259
 everything in favor sent the leather out already in 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.269
 the second part would reach the second 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.000
 penalty action we see the center of 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.540
 juanfran juanfran put the ball of a 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.420
 point and now the second 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.410
 well placed roberto was done with the 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.450
 mastery of the leather 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.880
 iturra who made a great game finished 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.890
 losing that ball and almost caused the 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.720
 second goal of Diego thing in the match 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.420
 finally save the situation again 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.420
 Roberto was the best minutes of the 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.000
 simeone picture 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.800
 demonstrating how he always plays outside 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.599
 home waiting for the opponent back in the 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.599
 first part and from minute 50 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:46.330
 goes through the game that 's that he went back to 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:49.910
 happen and it came back to be close to 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.220
 score the Olympic goal in this play 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.800
 Iturra was multiplying in tasks 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.040
 defensive however there we see another 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.120
 bargain against and in the end it seems 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.900
 a matter of time that the 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.930
 second and so came villa alone against 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.150
 murillo this one puts the knee and ends 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.400
 knocking down the Asturian forward who 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.950
 caused so is a second criminal has 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.570
 the party that clever david villa- 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.060
 waiting for him to run over 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.890
 Colombian and the same video decided 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.870
 who threw the penalty and shines for the 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.320
 center of the goal cheated again 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.350
 to roberto 0 to 2 in minute 77 of 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.350
 match 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.819
 two penalties caused by life 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.769
 clearly the man of the party 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.549
 he sent the very clear message to 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:39.290
 coast to this occasion is for me could 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.510
 mark the athletic one of madrid- the third 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.150
 in several cons there we see one of them 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.980
 with coke as the protagonist finally 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.409
 the coke center looking for the second 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.489
 stick and the opportunity for raúl garcía 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.739
 that had just entered the game 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.540
 finally the action would end that 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.269
 way he plays filipe Luis the ball with the 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.400
 hand and that costs the second yellow 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.739
 therefore the red ones went to the 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.599
 costumes before now filipe luís 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.560
 that will not play against the athletic club of 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.560
 bilbao the next day 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.880
 action as childish as it is unnecessary 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.240
 part of filipe luís who already knew that 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.240
 I was admonished 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.730
 and when it seemed that the party was 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.930
 sentenced arrived this move filipe 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.720
 Luis was not in the left lane 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:28.170
 center to the area and the head of odion 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:31.650
 ighalo does not arrive active courtois remained 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:34.170
 about 4 minutes and has added but the 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.030
 Granada would no longer be able to achieve 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.700
 tie goal 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.640
 that goal came too late with a 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.070
 good ighalo end odion center 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.200
 encounter with final tangana / iturra and 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.000
 diego costa in any case the most 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.190
 important is that he won the athletic of 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.240
 madrid- for simeone granada one 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.240
 athletic of madrid- 2 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.150
 there we see the play that unleashed the 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.740
 events a mere anecdote 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.740
 Second place victory
