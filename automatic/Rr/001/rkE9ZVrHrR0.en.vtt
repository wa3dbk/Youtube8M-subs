00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:07.960 
now by keeping them on one needle you're

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.110 
now by keeping them on one needle you're
in<00:00:08.109> complete<00:00:08.650> control<00:00:08.890> of<00:00:09.460> everything<00:00:09.880> that's

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.120 
in complete control of everything that's

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.190 
in complete control of everything that's
happening<00:00:11.429> on<00:00:12.429> that<00:00:12.790> part<00:00:13.059> of<00:00:13.210> your<00:00:13.389> sock<00:00:13.719> and

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000 
it's also going to help you to shape the

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.020 
it's also going to help you to shape the
gusset<00:00:16.500> in<00:00:17.500> exactly<00:00:17.980> the<00:00:18.160> right<00:00:18.310> place<00:00:18.640> at<00:00:18.910> the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.030 
gusset in exactly the right place at the

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.420 
gusset in exactly the right place at the
join<00:00:19.269> of<00:00:19.449> those<00:00:19.630> two<00:00:19.900> needles<00:00:20.350> we've<00:00:21.160> joined

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 
join of those two needles we've joined

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.640 
join of those two needles we've joined
one<00:00:21.850> side<00:00:22.090> of<00:00:22.269> the<00:00:22.390> heel<00:00:22.750> we've<00:00:23.320> got<00:00:23.529> the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
one side of the heel we've got the

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.540 
one side of the heel we've got the
instep<00:00:24.130> so<00:00:24.939> now<00:00:25.119> we<00:00:25.180> need<00:00:25.480> to<00:00:25.769> join<00:00:26.769> this<00:00:27.340> side

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
instep so now we need to join this side

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.980 
instep so now we need to join this side
of<00:00:27.730> the<00:00:27.820> hill<00:00:28.000> and<00:00:28.330> we're<00:00:28.480> going<00:00:28.630> to<00:00:28.689> do<00:00:28.840> that

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
of the hill and we're going to do that

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.830 
of the hill and we're going to do that
on<00:00:29.140> the<00:00:29.259> third<00:00:29.289> needle<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:31.179> we're<00:00:31.330> going<00:00:31.480> to<00:00:31.570> go

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
on the third needle so we're going to go

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.740 
on the third needle so we're going to go
upwards<00:00:32.740> but<00:00:33.460> using<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.090> same<00:00:34.330> technique

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
upwards but using the same technique

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.200 
upwards but using the same technique
that<00:00:34.780> we<00:00:34.960> did<00:00:35.110> before<00:00:35.260> by<00:00:35.710> picking<00:00:36.250> up<00:00:36.610> making

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
that we did before by picking up making

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.200 
that we did before by picking up making
a<00:00:37.390> stitch<00:00:37.719> in<00:00:37.960> those<00:00:38.649> loops<00:00:39.010> so<00:00:39.790> we<00:00:39.910> put<00:00:40.090> the

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
a stitch in those loops so we put the

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.970 
a stitch in those loops so we put the
needle<00:00:40.480> through<00:00:42.870> pull<00:00:43.870> the<00:00:44.050> yarn<00:00:44.260> through<00:00:44.379> and

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
needle through pull the yarn through and

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.380 
needle through pull the yarn through and
again<00:00:45.280> make<00:00:45.520> sure<00:00:45.550> that's<00:00:45.789> quite<00:00:45.969> tight

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
again make sure that's quite tight

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:54.380 
again make sure that's quite tight
that's<00:00:46.750> a<00:00:46.930> join

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.170 

so<00:00:55.390> we've<00:00:55.540> got<00:00:56.070> some<00:00:57.070> stitches<00:00:57.880> on<00:00:58.030> this

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
so we've got some stitches on this

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.870 
so we've got some stitches on this
needle<00:00:58.380> that<00:00:59.380> we<00:00:59.530> picked<00:00:59.800> up<00:00:59.980> the<00:01:00.340> stitches<00:01:00.640> we

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880

picked<00:01:01.120> up<00:01:01.270> on<00:01:01.420> this<00:01:01.540> needle<00:01:02.020> and<00:01:02.650> the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
picked up on this needle and the

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.640 
picked up on this needle and the
stitches<00:01:03.280> that<00:01:03.550> we<00:01:03.850> did<00:01:04.030> for<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:04.330> heal<00:01:04.570> so<00:01:05.560> to

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.400 
one pass fit ditch over decrease which
is<00:02:27.310> exactly<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.150> same<00:02:28.420> as<00:02:28.720> when<00:02:29.230> we<00:02:29.260> were

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
is exactly the same as when we were

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.750 
is exactly the same as when we were
turning<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.040> heel<00:02:31.769> and<00:02:32.769> then<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.459> remaining

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
turning the heel and then the remaining

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.490 
turning the heel and then the remaining
stitches<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:35.290> we<00:02:35.470> do<00:02:36.090> one<00:02:37.090> round<00:02:37.360> with<00:02:37.630> shaping

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
stitches so we do one round with shaping

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.370 
stitches so we do one round with shaping
and<00:02:38.829> then<00:02:39.070> we<00:02:39.190> do<00:02:39.340> one<00:02:39.370> round<00:02:40.030> with<00:02:40.780> no<00:02:41.049> shaping

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
and then we do one round with no shaping

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.180 
and then we do one round with no shaping
so<00:02:41.860> we<00:02:41.950> just<00:02:42.130> knit<00:02:42.519> all<00:02:42.790> of<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.209> stitches<00:02:44.190> and

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
so we just knit all of the stitches and

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.610 
so we just knit all of the stitches and
of<00:02:45.340> course<00:02:45.579> on<00:02:45.880> needle<00:02:46.209> 2<00:02:46.450> we<00:02:46.900> would<00:02:47.110> do<00:02:47.320> our

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
of course on needle 2 we would do our

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.860 
of course on needle 2 we would do our
pattern<00:02:48.160> if<00:02:48.310> we<00:02:48.459> have<00:02:48.610> a<00:02:48.640> pattern<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:49.660> then

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
pattern if we have a pattern and then

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.819 
pattern if we have a pattern and then
we'll<00:02:50.079> continue<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.860> do<00:02:51.040> alternate<00:02:51.790> rows<00:02:52.030> of

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
we'll continue to do alternate rows of

00:02:52.829 --> 00:03:00.780 
we'll continue to do alternate rows of
shaping<00:02:53.829> and<00:02:54.160> no<00:02:54.700> shaping<00:02:55.739> until<00:02:58.860> needles<00:02:59.860> 1

in your knitting pattern it will tell
you<00:03:51.250> when<00:03:51.400> you<00:03:51.520> get<00:03:51.700> to<00:03:51.940> at<00:03:52.120> this<00:03:52.240> point<00:03:52.720> in

I've just started to share this toe it's

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.400 
I've just started to share this toe it's
not<00:03:58.240> going<00:03:58.360> to<00:03:58.450> be<00:03:58.540> as<00:03:58.660> easy<00:03:58.960> to<00:03:59.080> see<00:03:59.290> the

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
not going to be as easy to see the

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.290 
not going to be as easy to see the
tillage<00:03:59.650> black<00:03:59.980> but<00:04:00.580> you<00:04:00.610> can<00:04:00.790> just<00:04:00.940> start<00:04:01.150> to

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
tillage black but you can just start to

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.800 
tillage black but you can just start to
see<00:04:02.520> when<00:04:03.520> I<00:04:03.550> started<00:04:04.030> to<00:04:04.090> decrease<00:04:04.510> in

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
see when I started to decrease in

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.230 
see when I started to decrease in
exactly<00:04:05.170> the<00:04:05.320> same<00:04:05.350> way<00:04:05.830> that<00:04:06.490> we<00:04:06.640> did<00:04:06.880> the

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
exactly the same way that we did the

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.590 
exactly the same way that we did the
shaping<00:04:08.200> the<00:04:08.500> heel<00:04:09.370> turning<00:04:09.820> the<00:04:09.910> heel<00:04:10.120> and

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
shaping the heel turning the heel and

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.150 
shaping the heel turning the heel and
when<00:04:10.810> we<00:04:10.900> did<00:04:11.020> shaping<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.530> gusset

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
when we did shaping the gusset

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.090 
when we did shaping the gusset
it's<00:04:12.550> just<00:04:12.790> knit<00:04:13.360> two<00:04:13.630> together<00:04:13.840> decreases<00:04:14.800> on

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
it's just knit two together decreases on

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.660 
it's just knit two together decreases on
one<00:04:15.310> side<00:04:15.640> and<00:04:16.709> slip<00:04:17.709> one<00:04:17.890> knit<00:04:17.920> one<00:04:18.220> pass<00:04:18.400> one

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
one side and slip one knit one pass one

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.200 
one side and slip one knit one pass one
over<00:04:19.150> decreases<00:04:19.870> on<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.110> other<00:04:20.290> side<00:04:21.210> witness

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
over decreases on the other side witness

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.000 
over decreases on the other side witness
saying<00:04:22.510> we<00:04:23.170> use<00:04:23.200> a<00:04:23.410> technique<00:04:23.950> called

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
saying we use a technique called

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.320 
saying we use a technique called
grafting<00:04:24.760> which<00:04:25.570> allows<00:04:25.960> you<00:04:26.230> to<00:04:27.150> join<00:04:28.150> the

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
grafting which allows you to join the

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.620 
grafting which allows you to join the
stitches<00:04:28.870> without<00:04:29.680> leaving<00:04:30.280> a<00:04:30.520> scene<00:04:30.790> and<00:04:31.060> if

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
stitches without leaving a scene and if

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.510 
stitches without leaving a scene and if
you<00:04:31.810> can<00:04:31.960> imagine<00:04:32.170> for<00:04:32.560> socks<00:04:32.920> acquire<00:04:33.280> that

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
you can imagine for socks acquire that

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.720 
you can imagine for socks acquire that
would<00:04:33.670> be<00:04:33.790> really<00:04:34.750> comfortable<00:04:35.490> I'll<00:04:36.490> show

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
would be really comfortable I'll show

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.120 
would be really comfortable I'll show
you<00:04:36.790> on<00:04:36.970> one<00:04:37.290> that's<00:04:38.290> finished<00:04:38.530> what<00:04:38.950> it
