00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.629
 well guys back on my second 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.259
 channel and we're back here with a game 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:08.820
 mobile 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.889
 today we are a new game because 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.170
 I sincerely prefer to show you more 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.630
 possible games that stop me anyway 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.529
 on a single game like I did for 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.000
 surveyors born I did two episodes 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.420
 anyway the one there obviously 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.640
 I will continue and today we are on a stickman 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.349
 possible try this game is similar to 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.330
 to the same gm mechanics as the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.009
 science what we have instead of 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.120
 a Corato we have a little man 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.030
 go from one side to the other of the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:42.140
 path without brutally dying then 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:46.800
 as you can see there are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.390
 11 ok 11 stage the first I did that is 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.160
 11 levels each level is divided into 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.960
 stage that as you see the rigor of 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.160
 reach the stage 3 percent for 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.149
 one hundred I've done for three long enough 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.219
 phase I'll show you a little bit like 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:01.500
 obviously works by pressing the there 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.750
 by pressing the touchscreen you skip more 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.080
 hold down plus sum up and 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:12.150
 very difficult because it is quite ok 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:15.360
 ok ok it's quite difficult to coordinate 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.180
 as you can see, however, my 4 profoto 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.729
 perfect record the first level 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.409
 now let's try blue green we have to 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.600
 add the stand c42 one hundred percent 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.340
 I already have the wrong coffee as you see below 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:32.250
 there is the countdown for the stages that 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.950
 you don't understand a shit at random from 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.320
 dead thor festina a dorina 100 200 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.079
 pounds of bananas however recommend themes 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.790
 more and more games can tyson dead 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.070
 where i am before 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.170
 opens the possible games similar to 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.610
 these but what is needed by tim is necessary 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.950
 but as it goes, that is, we didn't want to 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.270
 pieces of shit then example I do 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.250
 nuisance hangings puts us a black band 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.040
 they are pieces of shit 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.720
 you will see this video 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.880
 I don't know when a lot of record a 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.400
 midnight because practically tomorrow 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.760
 that is, I do not come from tomorrow 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.790
 past 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.240
 I have to leave and I still have to make millions 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.929
 of videos for you because I only think about 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.000
 money 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.480
 ok perfect then what they play 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.430
 baila only the big frog breakthrough but 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.650
 these 4 and 4 gentlemen per hundred 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.060
 hundred for us go on go on go on 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.420
 of the view 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.430
 I read I read shit shit 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.140
 gentlemen this world record this is 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.510

 gentlemen tg9 from record minus on menu 216 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.630
 percent seems easier than the 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.190
 newspaper of now god as pilot 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.470
 famous last words 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.550

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.800
 however , a hundred dogs understand it put also 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:57.230

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.730
 game smobile at least I know if you 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.900

 100 200 years 2 that seemed to fall though 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.900
 it seems to me much easier than in comparison 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.319
 I leave young because it is much more 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.530
 linear 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:38.579
 the ass fan I have not seen two seats 5 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:40.379

 program to bear has turned the 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.590
 program to create had a 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:50.400
 technical problem that was really 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.129
 died the course for registered were the 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.650
 v version let's go away

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:07.250

 the jump of the Magliana pro 60 percent 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:32.220
 it's a piece of incredible shit piece after 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:34.380
 the long jump there is what back to game that 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.120
 weighs in the ass there are frequent lawyers 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.970
 that are at 500 percent frequencies per 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.570
 one hundred percent gentlemen one hundred percent 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:47.310
