hey<00:00:00.900> guys<00:00:01.530> in<00:00:01.589> this<00:00:02.010> video<00:00:02.220> we're<00:00:02.580> just<00:00:02.730> gonna

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
hey guys in this video we're just gonna

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.820 
hey guys in this video we're just gonna
have<00:00:03.060> a<00:00:03.090> quick<00:00:03.419> look<00:00:03.570> at<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:03.899> molar<00:00:04.560> heat

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
have a quick look at a molar heat

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.909 
have a quick look at a molar heat
capacity<00:00:04.940> example<00:00:06.319> it's<00:00:07.319> quite<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:07.529> big<00:00:07.770> one

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
capacity example it's quite a big one

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.589 
capacity example it's quite a big one
but<00:00:08.160> what's<00:00:08.340> nice<00:00:08.580> about<00:00:08.610> it<00:00:08.910> is<00:00:09.120> that<00:00:09.179> it<00:00:09.510> will

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
but what's nice about it is that it will

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.810 
but what's nice about it is that it will
pretty<00:00:09.929> much<00:00:10.050> join<00:00:10.590> together<00:00:11.010> everything

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
pretty much join together everything

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.669 
pretty much join together everything
we've<00:00:11.969> learned<00:00:12.269> so<00:00:12.509> far<00:00:12.540> in<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.230> thermal

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
we've learned so far in the thermal

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.860 
we've learned so far in the thermal
physics<00:00:13.920> topic<00:00:14.519> right<00:00:15.000> so<00:00:15.240> let's<00:00:15.420> have<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.630> look

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
physics topic right so let's have a look

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.410 
physics topic right so let's have a look
at<00:00:15.990> what<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.230> says<00:00:16.490> the<00:00:17.490> temperature<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:18.000> seven

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
at what it says the temperature of seven

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.630 
at what it says the temperature of seven
moles<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:18.930> an<00:00:19.050> ideal<00:00:19.170> diatomic<00:00:19.980> gas<00:00:20.340> is

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
moles of an ideal diatomic gas is

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.849 
moles of an ideal diatomic gas is
increased<00:00:21.390> from<00:00:21.630> two<00:00:21.960> hundred<00:00:22.740> degrees

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
increased from two hundred degrees

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.620 
increased from two hundred degrees
Kelvin<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.640> two<00:00:23.760> hundred<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.060> sixty<00:00:24.390> four

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
Kelvin to two hundred and sixty four

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.480 
Kelvin to two hundred and sixty four
degrees<00:00:24.930> Kelvin<00:00:25.350> if<00:00:25.529> this<00:00:25.980> process<00:00:26.460> is

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
degrees Kelvin if this process is

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.630 
degrees Kelvin if this process is
isobaric<00:00:27.090> find<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.199> work<00:00:28.439> done<00:00:28.470> by<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.310> gas

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
isobaric find the work done by the gas

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.770 
isobaric find the work done by the gas
right<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.349> need<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.769> find<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.279> work<00:00:32.780> first

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
right so I need to find the work first

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.100 
right so I need to find the work first
thing<00:00:34.020> I'm<00:00:34.140> thinking<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.790> of<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.300> first<00:00:36.750> law

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
thing I'm thinking is of the first law

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.030 
thing I'm thinking is of the first law
of<00:00:37.140> thermodynamics<00:00:38.780> and<00:00:39.780> I'm<00:00:40.410> thinking<00:00:40.890> that

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
of thermodynamics and I'm thinking that

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.729 
of thermodynamics and I'm thinking that
if<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.280> can<00:00:41.489> find<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.910> heat<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:43.260> change<00:00:43.559> in

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
if I can find the heat and the change in

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.979 
if I can find the heat and the change in
internal<00:00:44.070> energy<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.579> can<00:00:44.820> actually<00:00:44.969> find<00:00:45.450> this

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
internal energy I can actually find this

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.540 
internal energy I can actually find this
work<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:48.210> we've<00:00:48.620> discussed<00:00:49.620> formulas<00:00:50.219> for

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
work and we've discussed formulas for

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.060 
work and we've discussed formulas for
both<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.300> these<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.840> will<00:00:51.989> allow<00:00:52.289> us<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.559> find

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
both of these that will allow us to find

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.069 
both of these that will allow us to find
their<00:00:53.760> values<00:00:54.239> based<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.780> information

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
their values based on the information

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.740 
their values based on the information
we've<00:00:55.559> been<00:00:55.739> given<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:57.090> that'll<00:00:57.420> help<00:00:57.449> us

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
we've been given and so that'll help us

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.020 
we've been given and so that'll help us
find<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.379> work<00:00:58.770> right<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.460> first<00:00:59.730> let's<00:00:59.969> look

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
find the work right so first let's look

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.620 
find the work right so first let's look
at<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.329> heat<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:01.350> from<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.280> previous<00:01:02.550> video

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.320 

we<00:01:06.630> discussed<00:01:07.560> molar<00:01:07.979> specific<00:01:08.369> heat<00:01:08.790> now

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
we discussed molar specific heat now

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.039 
we discussed molar specific heat now
which<00:01:09.540> on<00:01:09.780> C<00:01:10.350> do<00:01:10.560> we<00:01:10.680> use<00:01:10.890> well<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:12.450> process<00:01:12.869> is

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
which on C do we use well the process is

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.260 
which on C do we use well the process is
isobaric<00:01:13.409> meaning<00:01:14.130> constant<00:01:14.610> pressure<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.150> we

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
isobaric meaning constant pressure so we

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:23.090 
isobaric meaning constant pressure so we
use<00:01:15.509> CP<00:01:16.290> right<00:01:18.290> CP<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.979> recall<00:01:20.400> was<00:01:21.299> f<00:01:22.100> plus

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
use CP right CP if you recall was f plus

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.890 
use CP right CP if you recall was f plus
2<00:01:23.490> over<00:01:24.000> 2<00:01:24.420> R<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.939> in<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.150> case<00:01:27.450> we've<00:01:27.689> got<00:01:27.720> a

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
2 over 2 R and in this case we've got a

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.840 
2 over 2 R and in this case we've got a
diatomic<00:01:28.619> gas<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.000> it's<00:01:30.750> above<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.850> hundred

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
diatomic gas and it's above a hundred

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.030 
diatomic gas and it's above a hundred
degrees<00:01:33.360> Kelvin<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:33.930> below<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> thousand<00:01:34.890> and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
degrees Kelvin but below a thousand and

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.920 
degrees Kelvin but below a thousand and
so<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.700> actually<00:01:35.850> has<00:01:36.060> five<00:01:36.360> degrees<00:01:36.810> of

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
so it actually has five degrees of

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.710 
so it actually has five degrees of
freedom<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.590> gives<00:01:37.799> us<00:01:38.090> CP<00:01:39.090> equals<00:01:39.420> 7

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
freedom so that gives us CP equals 7

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.710 
freedom so that gives us CP equals 7
over<00:01:39.930> 2<00:01:40.079> R<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:41.009> our<00:01:41.100> new<00:01:41.280> formula<00:01:41.759> for<00:01:42.659> our

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
over 2 R and so our new formula for our

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.480 
over 2 R and so our new formula for our
Q<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.590> equal<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.159> n<00:01:44.479> times<00:01:45.479> 7<00:01:46.290> over<00:01:46.530> 2<00:01:47.460> R<00:01:48.439> times

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
Q is equal to n times 7 over 2 R times

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.630 
Q is equal to n times 7 over 2 R times
triangle<00:01:50.490> T<00:01:51.079> right<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.920> now<00:01:53.250> we<00:01:53.310> can<00:01:53.520> start

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
triangle T right so now we can start

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.170 
triangle T right so now we can start
subbing<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.180> some<00:01:54.390> values<00:01:54.720> our<00:01:54.960> n<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.530> 7<00:01:57.140> R<00:01:58.140> was

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
subbing in some values our n is 7 R was

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.700 
subbing in some values our n is 7 R was
8.314<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.950> our<00:02:01.950> change<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:03.030> temperature<00:02:03.710> to

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
8.314 and our change in temperature to

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.660 
8.314 and our change in temperature to
64<00:02:05.430> minus<00:02:05.850> 200<00:02:06.590> right<00:02:07.590> put<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.039> all<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.520> the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
64 minus 200 right put that all in the

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.609 
64 minus 200 right put that all in the
calculator<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.509> we<00:02:09.840> end<00:02:09.989> up<00:02:10.050> with<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.379> heat

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
calculator and we end up with the heat

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.550 
calculator and we end up with the heat
added<00:02:10.890> being<00:02:11.430> 1/3

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
added being 1/3

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
added being 1/3
zero<00:02:12.770> three<00:02:13.489> six<00:02:14.000> point<00:02:14.690> three<00:02:14.900> five<00:02:15.620> two<00:02:16.069> just

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
zero three six point three five two just

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.030 
zero three six point three five two just
gonna<00:02:16.730> put<00:02:16.940> those<00:02:17.120> on<00:02:17.200> so<00:02:18.200> that<00:02:18.410> we<00:02:18.890> don't

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
gonna put those on so that we don't

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.309 
gonna put those on so that we don't
round<00:02:19.280> off<00:02:19.489> anything<00:02:20.000> important<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:20.599> that's

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
round off anything important and that's

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.570 
round off anything important and that's
in<00:02:21.590> joules<00:02:22.120> right<00:02:23.120> so<00:02:23.569> new<00:02:24.050> page<00:02:24.380> now<00:02:25.340> what

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
in joules right so new page now what

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.740 
in joules right so new page now what
we're<00:02:25.730> going<00:02:25.880> to<00:02:25.940> do<00:02:26.180> is<00:02:27.160> look<00:02:28.160> at<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.750> another

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
we're going to do is look at the another

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.800 
we're going to do is look at the another
formula<00:02:30.440> that<00:02:30.769> we've<00:02:30.950> seen<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:31.580> few<00:02:31.880> times<00:02:31.910> now

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
formula that we've seen a few times now

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:40.710 
formula that we've seen a few times now
of<00:02:33.709> our<00:02:34.250> formula<00:02:34.700> sheet<00:02:35.410> which<00:02:36.410> is<00:02:36.620> this<00:02:36.769> one

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.580 

right<00:02:41.720> so<00:02:42.500> um<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:44.480> normal<00:02:45.019> one<00:02:45.140> we<00:02:45.319> use

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
right so um the normal one we use

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:52.059 
right so um the normal one we use
actually<00:02:46.250> has<00:02:46.580> n<00:02:47.470> K<00:02:48.470> be<00:02:49.340> over<00:02:50.000> there<00:02:51.069> they're

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
actually has n K be over there they're

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.449 
actually has n K be over there they're
both<00:02:52.280> on<00:02:52.519> your<00:02:52.700> formula<00:02:53.150> sheet<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.660> basically

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
both on your formula sheet and basically

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.440 
both on your formula sheet and basically
n<00:02:55.459> R<00:02:55.850> is<00:02:56.120> equal<00:02:56.810> to<00:02:56.840> n<00:02:57.019> whoops<00:02:57.799> sorry<00:02:58.099> and<00:02:58.450> KB

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
n R is equal to n whoops sorry and KB

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.270 
n R is equal to n whoops sorry and KB
and<00:02:59.720> I'll<00:02:59.810> leave<00:03:00.019> that<00:03:00.049> as<00:03:00.290> an<00:03:00.440> exercise<00:03:00.560> for

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
and I'll leave that as an exercise for

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.100 
and I'll leave that as an exercise for
you<00:03:01.430> if<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:01.819> want<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.060> prove<00:03:02.330> that<00:03:02.390> but

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
you if you want to prove that but

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.750 
you if you want to prove that but
otherwise<00:03:03.380> we're<00:03:03.799> going<00:03:03.920> to<00:03:03.980> use<00:03:04.280> on<00:03:04.519> this

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
otherwise we're going to use on this

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.610 
otherwise we're going to use on this
formula<00:03:05.120> because<00:03:05.510> we're<00:03:05.660> given<00:03:05.930> moles<00:03:06.200> rather

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
formula because we're given moles rather

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.589 
formula because we're given moles rather
than<00:03:06.920> number<00:03:07.670> of<00:03:07.790> molecules<00:03:08.330> so<00:03:10.299> the<00:03:11.299> degrees

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
than number of molecules so the degrees

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.500 
than number of molecules so the degrees
of<00:03:11.780> freedom<00:03:12.170> if<00:03:12.319> you<00:03:12.440> recall<00:03:12.739> is<00:03:12.920> five<00:03:13.510> the

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
of freedom if you recall is five the

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.099 
of freedom if you recall is five the
number<00:03:14.660> of<00:03:14.900> moles<00:03:15.080> was<00:03:15.290> seven<00:03:16.450> gas<00:03:17.450> constant

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
number of moles was seven gas constant

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:25.020 
number of moles was seven gas constant
8.314<00:03:19.780> times<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:21.170> change<00:03:21.709> in<00:03:21.799> temperature

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.970 

right<00:03:26.030> put<00:03:26.660> that<00:03:26.840> all<00:03:27.049> in<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.320> calculator<00:03:27.799> and

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
right put that all in the calculator and

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.410 
right put that all in the calculator and
we<00:03:28.040> find<00:03:28.310> that<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:28.519> change<00:03:28.760> in<00:03:29.060> internal

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
we find that the change in internal

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.599 
we find that the change in internal
energy<00:03:29.660> is<00:03:30.109> nine<00:03:30.739> thousand<00:03:31.250> three<00:03:31.459> hundred

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
energy is nine thousand three hundred

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:35.130 
energy is nine thousand three hundred
and<00:03:31.880> eleven<00:03:31.940> point<00:03:32.660> six<00:03:33.049> eight<00:03:33.769> joules<00:03:34.519> right

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
and eleven point six eight joules right

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.059 
and eleven point six eight joules right
so<00:03:36.140> from<00:03:36.560> our<00:03:36.799> first<00:03:37.100> law<00:03:37.489> of<00:03:39.069> thermodynamics

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
so from our first law of thermodynamics

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:48.460 
so from our first law of thermodynamics
equation<00:03:40.760> we<00:03:41.389> get<00:03:41.569> this<00:03:41.780> one<00:03:46.540> right<00:03:47.540> so<00:03:48.350> it's

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
equation we get this one right so it's

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.080 
equation we get this one right so it's
just<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:48.739> simple<00:03:49.100> rearrangement<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:49.880> then<00:03:49.970> we

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
just a simple rearrangement and then we

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.660 
just a simple rearrangement and then we
can<00:03:50.269> now<00:03:50.420> sub<00:03:50.840> in<00:03:51.079> our<00:03:51.350> values<00:03:51.889> that<00:03:52.190> we<00:03:52.370> just

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
can now sub in our values that we just

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.670 
can now sub in our values that we just
worked<00:03:53.389> out<00:03:53.569> which<00:03:54.139> was<00:03:54.410> our<00:03:54.590> change<00:03:54.889> in<00:03:55.069> e<00:03:55.220> int

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
worked out which was our change in e int

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.340 
worked out which was our change in e int
9:31<00:03:57.680> one<00:03:57.920> point<00:03:58.280> six<00:03:58.609> eight<00:03:58.880> and<00:03:59.209> our<00:03:59.780> heat

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
9:31 one point six eight and our heat

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:07.569 
9:31 one point six eight and our heat
added<00:04:01.180> from<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.329> other<00:04:02.510> page<00:04:06.250> right<00:04:07.250> now<00:04:07.400> we

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
added from the other page right now we

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.160 
added from the other page right now we
can<00:04:07.819> just<00:04:07.850> put<00:04:08.150> that<00:04:08.299> in<00:04:08.420> our<00:04:08.510> calculator<00:04:08.750> and

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
can just put that in our calculator and

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.509 
can just put that in our calculator and
we<00:04:09.319> find<00:04:09.709> that<00:04:09.859> the<00:04:10.010> work<00:04:10.280> done<00:04:10.639> -<00:04:12.010> three<00:04:13.010> seven

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
we find that the work done - three seven

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:19.330 
we find that the work done - three seven
two<00:04:13.790> four<00:04:14.480> point<00:04:15.170> six<00:04:15.729> seven<00:04:16.729> joules<00:04:18.130> cool<00:04:19.130> so

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
two four point six seven joules cool so

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.430 
two four point six seven joules cool so
from<00:04:19.669> very<00:04:19.910> little<00:04:20.359> information<00:04:20.659> we<00:04:21.200> found

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
from very little information we found

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.850 
from very little information we found
this<00:04:22.220> value<00:04:22.729> and<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.960> way<00:04:24.050> we<00:04:24.229> interpret<00:04:24.530> it

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
this value and the way we interpret it

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:25.390 
this value and the way we interpret it
is

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
is

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.180 
is
the<00:04:25.490> work<00:04:26.090> was<00:04:26.480> done<00:04:26.540> by<00:04:27.230> the<00:04:27.290> gas<00:04:27.620> on<00:04:27.919> its

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
the work was done by the gas on its

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.000 
the work was done by the gas on its
surroundings<00:04:28.850> because<00:04:29.240> it<00:04:30.050> resulted<00:04:30.680> in<00:04:30.860> the

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
surroundings because it resulted in the

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.090 
surroundings because it resulted in the
loss<00:04:31.220> of<00:04:31.280> this<00:04:31.820> amount<00:04:32.210> of<00:04:32.330> energy<00:04:32.720> and<00:04:33.100> that

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
loss of this amount of energy and that

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.000 
loss of this amount of energy and that
concludes<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.240> molar<00:04:35.600> heat<00:04:35.690> capacity

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
concludes the molar heat capacity

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.389 
concludes the molar heat capacity
example<00:04:37.010> and<00:04:37.220> this<00:04:37.430> video<00:04:37.850> thanks<00:04:38.360> guys
