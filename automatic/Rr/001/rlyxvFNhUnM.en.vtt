00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.680

 February talking about it and here 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.260
 we are young and logical news 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.120
 They changed over time or actually is 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.220
 that we had information back there 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.350
 of the first is that now in the month of June

 between June and July will launch the game and 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.400
 was actually announced between June and 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.860
 July is the first video made in 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.830
 February the information was very cold 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.650
 it is still very recent launched however 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.470
 that is already killing the foot is the turnip and 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.640
 yesterday I put on twitter mom dyná 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.340
 because we on the samba staff 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.189
 before the time so it's only reason to 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.259
 people celebrate in the galera she was very 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.390
 The fuck was very strong the moment yesterday. 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.400
 hour spent in the middle of the presentation 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.560
 in some companies where they are 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.950
 launch the few games that are not at home 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.110
 just announced gta 5 for the new generation 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.880
 they take moments in the companies 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.680
 highly anticipated and put their games there 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.930
 this adds to the company that put 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.030
 then add to sony and add also 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.770
 the public to post however a 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.810
 Fine advantage for searches 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.759
 and then the action was in the middle 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.380
 She stopped when she began to cheer with 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.659
 a deadly world title kombat was 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.700
 so that's where you put that hand training 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.920
 director has already spoken for 15 years that 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.170
 Did not say anything, did not say much about 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.840
 They are already started. 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.640
 filming is the animals in that part 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.950
 silversea 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.260
 the game so the day raising the head and 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.150
 shark swirling I've already started to go 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.720
 although that the training already started to jump 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.390
 old 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.069
 There passed the tractor zeu filmed Trevor I 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.910
 already was hugging good galvão there 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.020
 screaming is tetra is nóis é peixe 14 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.330
 epc 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.550
 It was a very cool night, shall we say so? 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.030
 It's turning already it's midnight. 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.160
 shouting and scared dubai fires was 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.590
 I picked up but it was cool, it was cool because 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.140
 was really a long-awaited ad 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.170
 I did not expect much and so with laio gta5 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.510
 for pc xbox and playstation frame and by 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.690
 young people because those who expected to see 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.730
 you expect to improve pc to 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.620
 see if a practical frame rate and let 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.739
 in the description, I'll tell you mine 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.000
 humble opinion i think its good 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.459
 first of all by the way may have already 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.860
 graphical improvement is're sure the game 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.330
 will be remastered to 1080p 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.220
 is what was promised by rockstar and 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.060
 rockstar of the kind that promises and 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.830
 meets 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.060
 then he was promised remastered to 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.680
 1080p 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.209
 which even if it does not have large 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.010
 improvements will already give a 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.390
 look a much better look the game 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.110
 which I particularly think it already has 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.340
 stunning graphics then so 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.690
 put military pm she will get one 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.850
 little older has a little secret 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.310
 always a square shadow a deal 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.130
 strange this probably will not 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.390
 have no improvement in texture either 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.940
 needs improvement but he does not 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.950
 improve the texture they will improve 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.450
 finally graphically I think I will not 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.090
 achieve will not see an improvement of 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.160
 with the absurd but will rather improve the 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.709
 graphics are already we can be happy 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.140
 with that and I also think what I 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.360
 I hope it's more MPS is a city more 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.480
 crowded is a more troubled transit 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.250
 more people but a wo kassab 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.200
 unfortunately the console can not handle much 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.060
 We have people, we even had a preview of the 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.890
 enrolled five crowded squares 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.720
 so I think the trend is that by 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.100
 For example, the central region 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.970
 more people will have a lot of training 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.660
 best 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.730
 agent saw little business deal right 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.280
 game is just the same ad for the new 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.350
 generation is but still knows how good it is 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.970
 missing me yet designed the 50 people 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.870
 You know you 're not missing, you should be 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.000
 single player 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.280
 we know it's missing is stealing 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.990
 bank I think that everything you 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.849
 will be released now 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.250
 the launch to gt so to the new 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:30.710
 generation is the fall of this year ie from 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.020
 September to December I think it 's a 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.419
 good date maybe it's a birthday 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.160
 a year of play but when they go 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.509
 work well on top of that there maybe 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.849
 apa December we can also 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:43.310
 being is a break in the updates is not 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:45.319
 Guys, I think it's going to be a good idea. 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.849
 from updates until you launch this 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:49.940
 version was confirmed by the new generation 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:53.539
 And man, that's what you've broken. 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.550
 records will skyrocket sales shoot 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.979
 will dominate the best selling game of the 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.470
 school but will break all business 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:02.449
 entertainment the numbers because they 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.539
 I was breaking everything now in 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.680
 legislation is going to be a waste of 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:08.270
 overwhelmingly the trailer you can see the 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.949
 trailer and the confirmation you can see 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.949
 on the rockstar channel I'll leave the link 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:14.000
 in the description all channels annotated 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.069
 simultaneously with the conference of the 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.479
 sony will release this video because in 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:19.940
 true as you see at the sony conference 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:21.800
 will only announce Playstation 4 and 6 3 but there 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.530
 official communication channels of the 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.960
 rockstar also announced for pc and 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.039
 xbox one is an interesting thing is that 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.289
 We will be able to take our 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:32.180
 playstation 3 character for the 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.860
 playstation 4 has not yet been announced yet 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.930
 synthetic substances on the box 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.789
 year and nothing about whether it will have a bearing on 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.440
 pc I think from sony to the pc will be 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:41.360
 difficult because it does not make sense for 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.780
 sony boot a player from your console 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.250
 and put Stephano perfect so I I 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.870
 I find it particularly difficult, but there 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.520
 goes from rockstar to the then we do not have 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.020
 how to know very well how it goes 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.000
 get this situation it is able to speak 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.039
 of this character size or not 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.949
 I just know that we can get very 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:06:01.699
 happy with this gt so the folks go
