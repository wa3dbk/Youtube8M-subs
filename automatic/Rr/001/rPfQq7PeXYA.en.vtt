00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:05.350 
fast eighties racing videos and we're

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:06.599 
fast eighties racing videos and we're
here<00:00:05.470> to<00:00:05.560> talk<00:00:05.680> about<00:00:05.740> the<00:00:06.040> modifications

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:06.609 
here to talk about the modifications

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:08.970 
here to talk about the modifications
required<00:00:06.700> for<00:00:07.330> the<00:00:07.779> short<00:00:08.110> block<00:00:08.350> to<00:00:08.680> flip<00:00:08.860> the

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:08.980 
required for the short block to flip the

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.280 
required for the short block to flip the
cylinder<00:00:09.280> head<00:00:09.430> we've<00:00:10.180> had<00:00:10.330> customers<00:00:10.540> ask<00:00:11.020> us

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:11.290 
cylinder head we've had customers ask us

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.930 
cylinder head we've had customers ask us
if<00:00:11.740> they<00:00:11.920> could<00:00:12.070> send<00:00:12.250> us<00:00:12.340> the<00:00:12.430> cylinder<00:00:12.790> head

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
if they could send us the cylinder head

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.820 
if they could send us the cylinder head
and<00:00:13.150> just<00:00:13.390> have<00:00:13.480> us<00:00:13.600> modify<00:00:14.020> it<00:00:14.080> any<00:00:14.620> way<00:00:14.710> they

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
and just have us modify it any way they

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.770 
and just have us modify it any way they
could<00:00:14.950> take<00:00:15.040> it<00:00:15.100> back<00:00:15.310> to<00:00:15.370> their<00:00:15.610> own<00:00:15.910> shop<00:00:16.570> and

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:16.780 
could take it back to their own shop and

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.540 
could take it back to their own shop and
put<00:00:16.870> it<00:00:16.990> on<00:00:17.050> the<00:00:17.140> ends<00:00:17.260> and<00:00:17.320> themselves<00:00:17.550> that

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
put it on the ends and themselves that

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.190 
put it on the ends and themselves that
would<00:00:18.670> not<00:00:18.880> be<00:00:19.030> possible<00:00:19.210> because<00:00:19.690> there<00:00:20.110> are

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.200 
would not be possible because there are

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.230 
would not be possible because there are
many<00:00:20.380> modifications<00:00:20.800> need<00:00:21.370> to<00:00:21.400> take<00:00:21.610> place<00:00:21.789> on

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
many modifications need to take place on

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.820 
many modifications need to take place on
the<00:00:22.420> short<00:00:22.630> block<00:00:22.840> as<00:00:22.990> well<00:00:23.140> we're<00:00:23.619> here<00:00:23.710> to

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830 
the short block as well we're here to

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.560 
the short block as well we're here to
point<00:00:23.920> those<00:00:24.070> out<00:00:24.250> to<00:00:24.400> you<00:00:24.490> if<00:00:25.300> you<00:00:25.390> come<00:00:25.539> down

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
point those out to you if you come down

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.140 
point those out to you if you come down
here<00:00:25.750> and<00:00:26.230> this<00:00:27.039> is<00:00:27.190> the<00:00:27.369> top<00:00:27.550> of<00:00:27.580> our<00:00:27.820> engine

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
here and this is the top of our engine

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.060 
here and this is the top of our engine
block<00:00:28.330> as<00:00:28.510> it<00:00:28.539> is<00:00:28.780> modified<00:00:29.080> and<00:00:29.710> you'll<00:00:29.890> see

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
block as it is modified and you'll see

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.389 
block as it is modified and you'll see
in<00:00:30.279> this<00:00:30.699> corner<00:00:31.060> right<00:00:31.779> here<00:00:31.810> and<00:00:32.349> as<00:00:33.100> well<00:00:33.280> as

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 
in this corner right here and as well as

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:34.649 
in this corner right here and as well as
back<00:00:33.550> here<00:00:33.819> we've<00:00:33.969> actually<00:00:34.120> had<00:00:34.420> to<00:00:34.510> add

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:34.659 
back here we've actually had to add

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:36.720 
back here we've actually had to add
material<00:00:35.350> to<00:00:35.379> the<00:00:35.920> aluminum<00:00:36.249> deck<00:00:36.429> on<00:00:36.640> the

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
material to the aluminum deck on the

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.309 
material to the aluminum deck on the
engine<00:00:37.030> block<00:00:37.059> by<00:00:37.449> welding<00:00:37.629> it<00:00:37.839> on<00:00:37.960> and<00:00:38.199> then

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:38.319 
engine block by welding it on and then

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:40.139 
engine block by welding it on and then
smoothing<00:00:39.129> it<00:00:39.249> over<00:00:39.339> when<00:00:39.760> we<00:00:39.850> had<00:00:39.940> the<00:00:40.030> head

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
smoothing it over when we had the head

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.419 
smoothing it over when we had the head
of<00:00:40.239> the<00:00:40.539> deck<00:00:40.749> resurfaced<00:00:41.289> we<00:00:41.859> also<00:00:42.069> had<00:00:42.339> to

00:00:42.419 --> 00:00:42.429 
of the deck resurfaced we also had to

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:45.239 
of the deck resurfaced we also had to
port<00:00:42.670> the<00:00:42.819> oil<00:00:43.089> return<00:00:43.269> galleys<00:00:43.749> here<00:00:44.249> here

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:45.249 
port the oil return galleys here here

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:48.389 
port the oil return galleys here here
here<00:00:45.999> in<00:00:46.149> here<00:00:46.839> this<00:00:47.379> allows<00:00:47.589> it<00:00:47.949> to<00:00:47.979> match<00:00:48.190> up

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
here in here this allows it to match up

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.189 
here in here this allows it to match up
to<00:00:48.489> the<00:00:48.609> cylinder<00:00:48.940> head<00:00:49.120> and<00:00:49.300> gets<00:00:49.839> good<00:00:49.989> oil

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
to the cylinder head and gets good oil

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.590 
to the cylinder head and gets good oil
flow<00:00:50.440> with<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:51.039> head<00:00:51.159> reversed<00:00:51.549> the<00:00:52.479> other

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
flow with the head reversed the other

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.029 
flow with the head reversed the other
thing<00:00:52.839> we<00:00:52.960> have<00:00:52.989> to<00:00:53.139> modify<00:00:53.379> is<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:53.710> Pistons

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 
thing we have to modify is the Pistons

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:56.009 
thing we have to modify is the Pistons
themselves<00:00:54.460> even<00:00:55.120> though<00:00:55.269> the<00:00:55.539> Pistons<00:00:55.899> are

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
themselves even though the Pistons are

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:57.719 
themselves even though the Pistons are
reversed<00:00:56.350> to<00:00:56.530> match<00:00:56.679> the<00:00:56.799> cylinder<00:00:57.100> head<00:00:57.249> we

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:57.729 
reversed to match the cylinder head we

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:59.160 
reversed to match the cylinder head we
have<00:00:57.760> to<00:00:58.030> cut<00:00:58.179> this<00:00:58.329> valve<00:00:58.569> relief<00:00:58.839> a<00:00:58.959> little

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
have to cut this valve relief a little

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.139 
have to cut this valve relief a little
bit<00:00:59.289> a<00:00:59.319> little<00:00:59.620> bit<00:00:59.829> bigger<00:01:00.010> that<00:01:00.850> way<00:01:01.030> it

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
bit a little bit bigger that way it

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:02.669 
bit a little bit bigger that way it
would<00:01:01.269> clear<00:01:01.479> the<00:01:01.690> intake<00:01:01.989> valve<00:01:02.229> because<00:01:02.559> it

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
would clear the intake valve because it

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:04.079 
would clear the intake valve because it
is<00:01:02.799> not<00:01:02.949> a<00:01:02.979> perfect<00:01:03.370> line<00:01:03.489> up<00:01:03.670> when<00:01:03.850> it's<00:01:03.999> all

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
is not a perfect line up when it's all

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.090 
is not a perfect line up when it's all
reversed<00:01:04.449> backwards<00:01:04.930> now<00:01:05.740> if<00:01:05.860> you<00:01:05.950> come<00:01:06.070> over

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
reversed backwards now if you come over

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.600 
reversed backwards now if you come over
here<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:07.780> have<00:01:07.990> our<00:01:08.259> actual<00:01:08.890> meal<00:01:09.100> brown<00:01:09.340> head

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
here we have our actual meal brown head

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.969 
here we have our actual meal brown head
gasket<00:01:10.090> which<00:01:10.869> we<00:01:11.049> used<00:01:11.289> as<00:01:11.469> a<00:01:11.500> template<00:01:11.920> for

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
gasket which we used as a template for

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.330 
gasket which we used as a template for
modifying<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:12.789> deck<00:01:13.000> of<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.299> block<00:01:13.869> and<00:01:14.340> if

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.090 
modifying the deck of the block and if
for<00:01:15.820> comparison<00:01:16.420> we've<00:01:17.049> also<00:01:17.500> brought<00:01:17.890> out<00:01:18.070> a

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
for comparison we've also brought out a

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.609 
for comparison we've also brought out a
standard<00:01:18.609> h22<00:01:19.240> head<00:01:19.509> gasket<00:01:19.960> now<00:01:20.409> when<00:01:20.560> you
