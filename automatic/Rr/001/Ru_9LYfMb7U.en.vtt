effect<00:00:24.980> but<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.630> finally<00:00:27.630> decided<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.080> go<00:00:28.560> with

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
effect but I finally decided to go with

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.349 
effect but I finally decided to go with
this<00:00:28.830> one<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.519> really<00:00:29.789> like<00:00:30.029> how<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.240> turned

you<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.329> see<00:00:39.510> in<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.719> winds<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:41.100> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
you can see in the winds and on the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.990 
you can see in the winds and on the
edges<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.030> armor<00:00:42.890> not<00:00:43.890> sure<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.550> does

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
edges of the armor not sure and does

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.380 
edges of the armor not sure and does
actually<00:00:45.270> made<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.020> know<00:00:46.190> nicer<00:00:47.190> or<00:00:47.430> could

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
actually made it you know nicer or could

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.209 
actually made it you know nicer or could
be<00:00:48.420> made<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.750> worse<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.200> let<00:00:49.469> me<00:00:49.590> know<00:00:49.950> what<00:00:50.129> you

guys think about that one I'm just gonna

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.720 
guys think about that one I'm just gonna
rotate<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.360> base<00:00:58.010> again<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> hamachi

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
rotate the base again this is a hamachi

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.190 
rotate the base again this is a hamachi
stage<00:01:00.329> 5<00:01:00.600> act<00:01:02.870> it's<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.989> really<00:01:04.199> nice<00:01:04.409> base

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
stage 5 act it's a really nice base

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:22.580 
stage 5 act it's a really nice base
there<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.290> go<00:01:09.409> and<00:01:10.490> time<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.700> switch<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.150> heads

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:30.649 

alright<00:01:23.590> so<00:01:23.920> now<00:01:24.189> we<00:01:24.250> have<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:24.549> EPI<00:01:24.880> and<00:01:24.909> head

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.940 

as<00:01:31.170> well<00:01:31.380> as<00:01:31.499> the<00:01:31.710> beam<00:01:32.310> effect<00:01:32.700> right<00:01:32.880> there

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
as well as the beam effect right there

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.069 
as well as the beam effect right there
actually<00:01:34.950> painting<00:01:35.219> this<00:01:35.310> one<00:01:35.520> with<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
go so my final thoughts on this kid I

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.899 
go so my final thoughts on this kid I
really<00:01:51.000> like<00:01:51.209> this<00:01:51.420> one<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:52.099> think<00:01:53.099> I<00:01:53.250> highly

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
really like this one I think I highly

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.179 
really like this one I think I highly
recommend<00:01:54.030> actually<00:01:54.479> getting<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:55.349> resin<00:01:56.009> kit

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
recommend actually getting a resin kit

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.559 
recommend actually getting a resin kit
or<00:01:56.929> particularly<00:01:57.929> this<00:01:58.140> one<00:01:58.789> and<00:01:59.789> then<00:01:59.909> night

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
or particularly this one and then night

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:03.169 
or particularly this one and then night
FBI<00:02:00.959> and<00:02:01.670> probably<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.789> whole<00:02:02.849> thing<00:02:03.060> that

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
FBI and probably the whole thing that

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.600 
FBI and probably the whole thing that
will<00:02:03.360> hinder<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:03.959> the<00:02:04.110> price<00:02:04.429> yeah<00:02:05.429> it's

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
will hinder you is the price yeah it's

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.819 
will hinder you is the price yeah it's
kind<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:06.060> pricey<00:02:07.009> but<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:09.110> i<00:02:10.110> mean<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.590> mold

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:10.829 
kind of pricey but I i mean the mold

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:14.089 
kind of pricey but I i mean the mold
itself<00:02:11.129> is<00:02:11.459> pretty<00:02:11.730> good<00:02:12.319> although<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.739> I

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
itself is pretty good although the I

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.500 
itself is pretty good although the I
think<00:02:14.370> there<00:02:14.459> are<00:02:14.489> certain<00:02:14.819> parts<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.360> are

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
think there are certain parts that are

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.050 
think there are certain parts that are
kind<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.780> warp<00:02:16.079> and<00:02:17.040> for<00:02:17.310> this<00:02:17.400> one<00:02:17.670> it's<00:02:17.940> very

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
kind of warp and for this one it's very

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.199 
kind of warp and for this one it's very
much<00:02:18.450> this<00:02:18.720> side<00:02:19.230> fin<00:02:19.739> here<00:02:20.010> let's<00:02:20.849> look<00:02:21.030> paid

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
much this side fin here let's look paid

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.059 
much this side fin here let's look paid
on<00:02:21.329> my<00:02:21.420> finger<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:22.620> side<00:02:22.829> fin<00:02:23.069> is<00:02:23.250> not<00:02:24.950> if<00:02:25.950> you

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
on my finger the side fin is not if you

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.920 
on my finger the side fin is not if you
can<00:02:26.220> get<00:02:26.370> see<00:02:26.579> that<00:02:26.730> but<00:02:26.940> it's<00:02:27.150> not<00:02:27.510> aligned

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
can get see that but it's not aligned

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.349 
can get see that but it's not aligned
properly<00:02:28.109> it's<00:02:28.799> kind<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.069> warm<00:02:29.239> but<00:02:30.239> other

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
properly it's kind of warm but other

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.710 
properly it's kind of warm but other
than<00:02:30.569> that<00:02:30.629> it's<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.650> whole<00:02:31.799> thing<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.160> nice

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
than that it's the whole thing is nice

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.190
