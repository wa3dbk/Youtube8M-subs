 it's about the novel by megan maxwell the 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.770

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.120
 what 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.790
 good is this novel is one more among 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.010
 the all I'm reading 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.260
 lately of erotic novel but only 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.960
 I can tell you and josh advanced that is what 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.810
 little better than I have read yes that is true 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.390
 how good I understood that megan 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.130
 maxwell was not a novel author 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.170
 erotic in fact I think it's the first 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.330
 because he has already published things from 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.730
 highlanders and others but above all 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.740
 I knew her as a novel with forgiveness 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.780
 as author of chiklis novelties but 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.840
 well I have to say that I had a 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.570
 pleasant surprise with this first novel 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.160
 his erotic before he starts explaining 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.990
 those who appeared to me I see the synopsis 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.650
 so you know a little if it is not 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.850
 you know what this novel says after 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.470
 His dad's death 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.869
 the prestigious German businessman eric 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.729
 timerman decides to travel to spain to 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.210
 supervise the delegations of the 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.460
 company 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.950

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.420

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.500
 nice girl who was infatuated with 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.360
 righ now 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.040
 Judith succumbs to the attraction that 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.510
 German exercises on her and accepts 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.990
 be part of those sex games 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.750
 full of fantasies and hate 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:56.350
 next to him he will learn that we all carry 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.509
 inside a cowherd and that people 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.939
 they divide into submerged and dominant but 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.770
 time passes the relationship intensifies and 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.659
 eric begins to fear that his 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.720
 secret something that could mark the 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.670
 beginning the end of the relationship and they say 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.080
 then the publisher there says tell me what 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.790
 what you want is undoubtedly a daring novel 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.040
 in which the morbid fantasies 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.819
 are the order of the day and it is 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.160
 the pure truth 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.890
 This is one of the last 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.690
 erotic novels that I'm reading that 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.580
 every time I realized that lately it 's 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.280
 having more erotic novels the 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.269
 editorial landscape as you know is 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.510
 totally replete with this kind of 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.560
 novels because I have to tell you that this 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.610
 novel is very 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.190
 and very erotic 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.260
 therefore if you want something read something 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.150
 really risqué in this novel 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.480
 you can find it from the first 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.430
 page on the first page and judith 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.800
 that is the protagonist and is the one that is the 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.420
 narrator is the narrator of the novel 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.720
 describes us then 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.420
 it is not then it is not the advanced thing to dare 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.569
 to read it and good to tell you before we have 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.940
 forgotten that of megan maxwell recently 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:06.900
 we publish an interview with megan is a 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.550
 Super girl is super friendly and she 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.440
 offered to collaborate with us so 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.720
 I encourage you that if you feel like it here 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.030
 below we will let you leave the link to the 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.650
 interview and well worth it because 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.980
 so I can know something else something more than 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.010
 she's good what I told you is a novel 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:28.110
 very very erotic in which the scenes of 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:32.830
 sex are ubiquitous and are really 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.640
 very very very very explicit has also 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.370
 touches of humor 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.870
 this novel something that something also 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.000
 I found in another novel by an author 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.500
 Spanish as it is I have not married the novel 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.660
 it's called thirty nights with Olivia from the 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.160
 also published review also will 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.600
 I will leave the link and also the 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.030
 we interviewed an author in the block 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.610
 also surpasses super super nice os 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.019
 I recommend that you see a look then 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.640
 good has touches of humor so it's 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.080
 true that nine's married the humor 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.730
 is more present but good here has 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.380
 then observations of the protagonist 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.740
 that good 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:04.320
 a laugh and really let go 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.700
 What else did I want to tell you about the relationship? 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.820
 between the protagonists who are called 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.770
 erik 'el and judith she is good 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.020
 typical of the erotic novels 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.790
 they are a continuous stretched loose what 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.040
 good that increases the tension between them 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.830
 the tension of the relationship and the tension 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.160
 sexual the purpose of this of this type 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.690
 of novels you already know and good is a 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.570
 history, well, that's good 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.060
 well woven to see yes it is true that 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.830
 literally, it will not be the novel that 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.990
 will go down in the history of literature 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.030
 like the great novel of the 21st century but 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.600
 really to be the kind of novel that 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.130
 is an erotic novel and for the 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.810
 literature as pure entertainment 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.700
 it's a novel that's worth it if the 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.590
 reader is not looking for more than that they are going to 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.660
 have a good time because we get hooked 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.890
 I also tell you that this is 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.300
 novel I get hooked on a lot no 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.060
 you can not stop reading I wanted to 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.370
 continually know what what they 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.800
 happened and in fact I wait like a crazy 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.930
 what essence does the second one get me 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.850
 part because I'm really like crazy 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.710
 for knowing how this story ends and 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.990
 discover then good those mysteries that 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.840
 torment eric 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.270
 all this finding that in this new 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.590
 Erotic novel fashion that there are all 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.710
 Male characters are beings 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:18.920

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.580

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.280

 he liked it, I do not know, for me it's a 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:33.479
 100% recommendable novel I consider that 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.460
 if you do not know the friend Maxwell like 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.860
 You must give her a graphic novel 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.599
 an opportunity already and good now 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.270
 taking advantage of the fact that the second one comes out 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:44.129
 second part that they already publish it because 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.529
 you think about it 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:49.739
 It's worth it without a doubt 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:52.529
 you want to read a grandmother told me 'you'll 

00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:54.509

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:59.219
