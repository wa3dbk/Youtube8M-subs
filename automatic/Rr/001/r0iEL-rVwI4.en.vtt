00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
ok let's talk about the design first of

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.789 
ok let's talk about the design first of
all<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.450> old-school<00:02:06.780> on/off<00:02:07.469> switch

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.260 
all the the old-school on/off switch
what<00:02:08.039> do<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.160> think<00:02:08.310> about<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.849> toggle

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
what do you think about that the toggle

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.210

switch<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.599> also<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:10.050> mean<00:02:10.170> it's<00:02:10.500> it's<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.860> simple

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
switch is also I mean it's it's a simple

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.619 
switch is also I mean it's it's a simple
tool<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.640> they<00:02:11.700> kept<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.060> simple<00:02:12.209> they<00:02:12.420> didn't

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
tool and they kept it simple they didn't

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.150 
tool and they kept it simple they didn't
try<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.750> make<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.080> crazy

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
try to make it crazy

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.180 
try to make it crazy
so<00:02:14.730> toggle<00:02:15.360> switch<00:02:15.480> is<00:02:15.630> cool<00:02:15.840> yep<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.530> design

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
so toggle switch is cool yep the design

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
about the quality of it because here we

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.150 
about the quality of it because here we
are<00:02:47.040> it's<00:02:47.880> just<00:02:48.210> a<00:02:48.330> big<00:02:48.600> heavy<00:02:49.110> hunk<00:02:50.040> of

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
are it's just a big heavy hunk of

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
are it's just a big heavy hunk of
machine<00:02:50.490> right<00:02:50.670> here<00:02:50.790> do<00:02:50.880> you<00:02:50.910> think<00:02:50.970> it's

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
machine right here do you think it's

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.300
