00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
the objects to do something okay so back

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.259 
the objects to do something okay so back
to<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.539> object<00:00:25.260> I'm<00:00:26.189> gonna<00:00:26.430> do<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.910> couple<00:00:27.240> of

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
to the object I'm gonna do a couple of

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.169 
to the object I'm gonna do a couple of
things<00:00:27.330> when<00:00:28.080> I'm<00:00:28.349> going<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.529> add<00:00:28.650> an<00:00:28.830> event

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
things when I'm going to add an event

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.500 
things when I'm going to add an event
that<00:00:30.179> when<00:00:30.570> it's<00:00:30.750> created<00:00:31.679> okay<00:00:32.579> basically

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
that when it's created okay basically

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.959 
that when it's created okay basically
this<00:00:33.690> means<00:00:33.930> if<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.410> ball<00:00:34.829> appears<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.880> the

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
this means if the ball appears in the

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.569 
this means if the ball appears in the
screen<00:00:36.180> it's<00:00:37.050> gonna<00:00:37.230> start<00:00:37.710> automatically

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
screen it's gonna start automatically

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.459 
screen it's gonna start automatically
doing<00:00:38.879> what<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.210> tell<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.750> because<00:00:40.110> it's<00:00:40.260> based

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
doing what I tell it because it's based

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.459 
doing what I tell it because it's based
on<00:00:40.710> what<00:00:40.890> it's<00:00:41.040> created<00:00:41.370> okay<00:00:42.350> there<00:00:43.350> are

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
on what it's created okay there are

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.029 
on what it's created okay there are
other<00:00:43.590> ways<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.030> to<00:00:45.030> do<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.480> -<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:46.050> fact<00:00:46.320> I'll

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
other ways to to do this - in fact I'll

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.819 
other ways to to do this - in fact I'll
show<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:48.230> different<00:00:49.230> way<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:49.440> could<00:00:49.649> do<00:00:49.800> it

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
show you a different way we could do it

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.549 
show you a different way we could do it
we<00:00:50.129> could<00:00:50.399> say<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.870> ball<00:00:52.050> should<00:00:52.350> do

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
we could say that the ball should do

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.240 
we could say that the ball should do
this<00:00:53.090> under<00:00:54.090> other<00:00:54.360> when<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.379> game<00:00:55.649> or<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
this under other when the game or the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.720 
this under other when the game or the
room<00:00:56.460> starts<00:00:57.180> okay<00:00:57.989> or<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.949> game<00:00:59.160> starts

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
room starts okay or the game starts

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
again for now I'm going to keep it as

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.460 
again for now I'm going to keep it as
when<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.100> ball<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.340> created<00:01:03.199> now<00:01:04.199> when<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
when the ball is created now when the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.920 
when the ball is created now when the
ball<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.680> created<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.610> want<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.210> just<00:01:06.240> move

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
ball is created I want it to just move

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.640 
ball is created I want it to just move
randomly<00:01:07.970> around<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.299> room<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:10.409> I'm<00:01:10.470> going<00:01:10.590> to

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
means that I'm going to tell it kind of

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.700 
means that I'm going to tell it kind of
which<00:01:15.270> direction<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.869> could<00:01:15.930> tell<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.590> that

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
which direction I could tell it that

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.380 
which direction I could tell it that
it's<00:01:16.860> only<00:01:17.070> going<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.340> move<00:01:17.520> up<00:01:17.700> automatically

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
it's only going to move up automatically

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.660 
it's only going to move up automatically
I<00:01:18.570> wanted<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.380> move<00:01:19.530> randomly<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.460> I'm<00:01:20.520> gonna

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
I wanted to move randomly so I'm gonna

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.780 
I wanted to move randomly so I'm gonna
choose<00:01:20.909> all<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.330> these<00:01:21.630> arrows<00:01:22.549> except<00:01:23.549> for

wall<00:01:56.759> any<00:01:57.540> reason<00:01:57.869> why<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.079> went<00:01:58.290> right

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
wall any reason why it went right

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.070 
wall any reason why it went right
through<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.799> wall<00:01:59.689> Valerie

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.500 

right<00:02:04.040> I<00:02:04.070> didn't<00:02:04.460> program<00:02:04.820> it<00:02:04.940> to<00:02:05.030> do<00:02:05.150> anything

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
right I didn't program it to do anything

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.980 
right I didn't program it to do anything
if<00:02:06.020> it<00:02:06.230> hit<00:02:06.440> the<00:02:06.620> wall<00:02:06.830> okay<00:02:07.400> so<00:02:08.300> why<00:02:08.780> don't<00:02:08.930> we

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
if it hit the wall okay so why don't we

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.400 
if it hit the wall okay so why don't we
do<00:02:09.110> that<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:09.590> now<00:02:09.880> I<00:02:10.880> don't<00:02:11.270> actually<00:02:11.780> want<00:02:12.350> to

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
do that and now I don't actually want to

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.950 
do that and now I don't actually want to
prove<00:02:12.680> them<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.250> wall<00:02:13.610> in<00:02:14.000> this<00:02:14.240> situation<00:02:14.840> I

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
prove them the wall in this situation I

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.320 
prove them the wall in this situation I
want<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.230> program<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.680> ball<00:02:16.210> you're<00:02:17.210> gonna

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
want to program the ball you're gonna

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.990 
want to program the ball you're gonna
want<00:02:17.600> to<00:02:17.660> often<00:02:18.050> think<00:02:18.380> it's<00:02:18.950> I<00:02:19.280> could<00:02:19.790> do

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
want to often think it's I could do

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.270 
want to often think it's I could do
either<00:02:20.180> I<00:02:20.510> could<00:02:20.780> have<00:02:20.990> it<00:02:21.200> be<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:21.740> when<00:02:22.040> the

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
either I could have it be that when the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.340 
either I could have it be that when the
ball<00:02:23.180> hits<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.260> wall<00:02:24.620> it<00:02:25.100> bounces<00:02:25.670> or<00:02:26.360> I<00:02:26.870> could

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
ball hits the wall it bounces or I could

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.300 
ball hits the wall it bounces or I could
make<00:02:27.620> it<00:02:27.860> that<00:02:28.130> when<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:29.270> wall<00:02:30.130> collides<00:02:31.130> with

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
make it that when the wall collides with

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.760 
make it that when the wall collides with
the<00:02:31.580> ball<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:32.240> ball<00:02:32.660> balances<00:02:33.200> it<00:02:33.380> makes<00:02:33.530> more

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
the ball the ball balances it makes more

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.650 
the ball the ball balances it makes more
sense<00:02:34.070> to<00:02:34.160> me<00:02:34.400> since<00:02:34.700> it's<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:35.060> ball<00:02:35.330> that's

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
sense to me since it's the ball that's

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.470 
sense to me since it's the ball that's
gonna<00:02:35.900> bounce<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.950> program<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.490> ball<00:02:37.700> so

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
gonna bounce to program the ball so

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.550 
gonna bounce to program the ball so
another<00:02:38.750> thing<00:02:38.930> I'm<00:02:39.020> going<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.170> do<00:02:39.290> for<00:02:39.500> the

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
another thing I'm going to do for the

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.920 
another thing I'm going to do for the
fall<00:02:39.770> is<00:02:40.220> I'm<00:02:40.400> going<00:02:40.490> to<00:02:40.550> add<00:02:40.790> what's<00:02:41.570> called<00:02:41.840> a

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
fall is I'm going to add what's called a

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.650 
fall is I'm going to add what's called a
collision<00:02:42.620> event<00:02:42.980> meaning<00:02:43.880> when<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.210> collides

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
collision event meaning when it collides

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.080 
collision event meaning when it collides
with<00:02:44.870> something<00:02:44.990> and<00:02:45.710> in<00:02:46.280> this<00:02:46.340> case<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:46.850> wall

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
with something and in this case the wall

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.600 
with something and in this case the wall
and<00:02:47.720> what<00:02:48.560> do<00:02:48.620> we<00:02:48.680> want<00:02:48.920> it<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.100> do<00:02:49.340> if<00:02:49.490> it

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
and what do we want it to do if it

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.370 
and what do we want it to do if it
collides<00:02:49.880> with<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.090> wall<00:02:50.390> we<00:02:50.750> want<00:02:50.930> it<00:02:51.110> to

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
collides with the wall we want it to

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.330 
collides with the wall we want it to
basically<00:02:52.070> just<00:02:52.610> bounce<00:02:52.970> okay<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:54.160> we<00:02:55.160> could

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
basically just bounce okay and we could

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.490 
basically just bounce okay and we could
keep<00:02:55.490> this<00:02:55.700> as<00:02:56.000> not<00:02:56.180> precisely<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.260> bounce

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
keep this as not precisely and bounce

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.590 
keep this as not precisely and bounce
against<00:02:57.980> solid<00:02:58.520> objects<00:02:59.030> if<00:02:59.120> you<00:02:59.150> remember

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
against solid objects if you remember

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.050 
against solid objects if you remember
before<00:02:59.750> I<00:03:00.020> made<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:00.500> wall<00:03:00.710> solid<00:03:01.340> if<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.880> wall

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
before I made the wall solid if the wall

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.700 
before I made the wall solid if the wall
was<00:03:02.210> not<00:03:02.360> solid<00:03:02.900> it<00:03:02.990> would<00:03:03.110> still<00:03:03.350> go<00:03:03.500> right

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
was not solid it would still go right

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.400 
was not solid it would still go right
through<00:03:03.950> it<00:03:04.070> so<00:03:04.370> I'm<00:03:04.790> gonna<00:03:04.880> click<00:03:05.060> OK<00:03:05.510> now<00:03:06.320> I'm

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
through it so I'm gonna click OK now I'm

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.170 
through it so I'm gonna click OK now I'm
gonna<00:03:06.530> play<00:03:06.770> my<00:03:06.800> game<00:03:06.980> again<00:03:07.520> now<00:03:07.910> it's<00:03:08.030> gonna

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
gonna play my game again now it's gonna

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:16.060 
gonna play my game again now it's gonna
get<00:03:08.330> so<00:03:08.630> much<00:03:08.780> more<00:03:09.020> exciting<00:03:10.300> and<00:03:14.860> okay<00:03:15.860> I'm

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
get so much more exciting and okay I'm

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.729 
get so much more exciting and okay I'm
very<00:03:16.310> nice<00:03:16.550> huh<00:03:17.170> anytime<00:03:18.170> it<00:03:18.290> hits<00:03:18.440> a<00:03:18.560> wall

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
very nice huh anytime it hits a wall

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.550 
very nice huh anytime it hits a wall
it's<00:03:18.890> gonna<00:03:19.040> balance<00:03:19.340> now<00:03:20.090> in<00:03:20.239> theory<00:03:20.630> it's

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
it's gonna balance now in theory it's

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.310 
it's gonna balance now in theory it's
funny<00:03:21.770> both<00:03:22.040> times<00:03:22.400> so<00:03:22.520> far<00:03:22.850> it<00:03:22.970> went<00:03:23.120> down<00:03:23.570> it

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
funny both times so far it went down it

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.040 
funny both times so far it went down it
should<00:03:24.800> be<00:03:25.459> choosing<00:03:25.700> a<00:03:25.970> random<00:03:26.450> direction

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
should be choosing a random direction

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.290 
should be choosing a random direction
not<00:03:27.470> just<00:03:27.830> up<00:03:27.980> or<00:03:28.160> down<00:03:28.340> so<00:03:28.370> see<00:03:28.820> how<00:03:28.970> it's

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
not just up or down so see how it's

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.070 
not just up or down so see how it's
going<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:29.570> different<00:03:29.720> way

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
going a different way

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.790 
going a different way
okay<00:03:30.920> so<00:03:31.730> right<00:03:31.940> now<00:03:32.209> my<00:03:33.170> game

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
okay so right now my game

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.340 
okay so right now my game
which<00:03:34.070> I<00:03:34.580> cannot<00:03:35.540> interact<00:03:36.020> with<00:03:36.410> as<00:03:36.830> a<00:03:37.610> ball

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
which I cannot interact with as a ball

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.080 
which I cannot interact with as a ball
