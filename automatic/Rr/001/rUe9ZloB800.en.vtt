00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hi to all the guys in the minutes that 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.770
 are amount of making mode today not 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.020
 we'll talk about a fashion but we'll talk 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.730
 always uznach other guys a lot 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.910
 particular because it is another of the 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.250
 choices that are coming out of this period 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.010
 for 1.7 point it says 1.8 created on purpose 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.109
 for computers with low performance 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.390
 guys this is a jade air outlet 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.150
 from the chocapic then we say it was 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.849
 grated on the basis of the chocapic piÃ¹ or 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.980
 minus me in fast mode with everything though 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.550
 at most I can do it 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.350
 quietly business 76 fps for a 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.149
 average computer should be among the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.129
 40 and 60 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.329
 in fact if I put ferns arrived around 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.530
 40 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.420
 then guys, I'll show you now 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.180
 one as it is called you see the name 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.850
 directly you here it is here falling nck 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.590
 jade air force kate 702 I don't know who he is 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.300
 surely you know better than me 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.190
 now I'm going to activate it to do it for you 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.829
 see then guys 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.520
 here it is look at the light effects 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.289
 it's not too bright it's enough 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.149
 particular not to dynamic clouds 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.729
 so it's a small problem but it doesn't 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.950
 nothing the effects of light and reflections 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.479
 he does them very well even during the day 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.510
 from what I know the lava has been touched 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.040
 just the movement is just like 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.540
 you can see but only the movement 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.729
 wavy, however, the lava is more or less 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.700
 remained with the same texture instead 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.090
 look at the water guys 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:28.290
 guys I'm in fast at 72 fps no 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.090
 look at the water look under the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.040
 wavy movement the water does it 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:40.170
 even below that is amazing 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:43.500
 look and repeat I am there now 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.720
 now let's see quietly between 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.180
 the 60 and 70 2 to calculate that I now 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.399
 I'm recording then from market to fps 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.700
 you notice when I register 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.799
 but I'm going very fluid, that is, one 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.860
 great thing and now i try to put it 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.680
 in higher mode let's get into it 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.180
 france i don't move to show you 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.549
 more than anything else water movement e 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.899
 look like I 'm standing in fanci 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:12.330
 I'm doing 60 70 in france now is 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.530
 loading the chunks again yes now mine 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.190
 way to give a corato 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.950
 no not at all guys I'm unhappy that is 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.780
 it's an amazing thing that would be 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.640
 fancy I said bad as usual though 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.150
 look at the water now i want to see in 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.709
 fancy underwater or fantastic underground 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.480
 then now I show it at night 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.420
 because rightly this thing goes instead 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.100
 first midnight 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.140
 here it is, look at the shadow that is beautiful 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.360
 that is watching the beautiful sunset no 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:45.350
 fantastic girl i like personam e 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:47.519
 then let's look halfway at night 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.360
 that was dawn this sunset 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:53.550
 here it is rare the amazing sunset 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.900
 light effects really well done look 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.600
 it would be enough to put those clouds in it 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:02.040
 dynamics would be perfect 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.319
 nice is at night let's see how it does 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.430
 ok it's totally night even at night 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.040
 the moon makes light reflections 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.989
 pretty or look look not 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.250
 it's too heavy, maybe a little too dark 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.959
 at night, however, to look at that beautiful 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.420
 I don't know if you can get water at night 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.380
 see it from the video we go next to one 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.209
 light source like lava look 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.239
 real had the effect is this all 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.579
 without any texture pack resources pat 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.250
 boys is so it really is really 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:31.769
 a jade air made as it should be 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.870
 it is very light can be used 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.480
 also from a medium quality computer 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.250
 so average low quality and nothing 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.530
 guys that will be left air today 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.359

 1.8 rightly there will be textures and 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.370
