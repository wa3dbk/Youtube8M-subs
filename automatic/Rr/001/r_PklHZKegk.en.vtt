about those two guns both of them have

about those two guns both of them have
extremely<00:00:24.750> high<00:00:24.900> rpm<00:00:25.859> 940<00:00:26.849> 18<00:00:27.470> 854<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.619> f2000

extremely high rpm 940 18 854 the f2000
but<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.390> really<00:00:30.689> small<00:00:31.080> difference

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
but that is a really small difference

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.130 
but that is a really small difference

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
and f 2000 there are not so many

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.000 
and f 2000 there are not so many
differences<00:00:46.050> there<00:00:46.260> I'm<00:00:46.410> not<00:00:46.530> gonna<00:00:46.710> like

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
differences there I'm not gonna like

differences there I'm not gonna like
stay<00:00:47.430> there<00:00:47.789> an<00:00:47.940> analyzer<00:00:48.390> enjoyed<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> little

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
stay there an analyzer enjoyed a little

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.500 
stay there an analyzer enjoyed a little
bit<00:00:49.379> because<00:00:49.530> both<00:00:50.489> weapons<00:00:50.730> have<00:00:51.030> extremely

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
bit because both weapons have extremely

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.979 
bit because both weapons have extremely
similar<00:00:52.340> horizontal<00:00:53.340> wrinkle<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.989> also

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
similar horizontal wrinkle and the also

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.170 
similar horizontal wrinkle and the also
they<00:00:55.140> got<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.739> same<00:00:56.039> exactly<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.579> same<00:00:56.850> first

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
they got the same exactly the same first

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.639 
they got the same exactly the same first
bullet<00:00:57.690> recall<00:00:58.079> at<00:00:58.289> what<00:00:58.800> times<00:00:59.719> 3.0<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
bullet recall at what times 3.0 so the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.410 
bullet recall at what times 3.0 so the
recall<00:01:01.980> they<00:01:02.129> got<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.579> vertical<00:01:02.940> ruler<00:01:03.059> take

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
recall they got the vertical ruler take

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.320 
recall they got the vertical ruler take
God<00:01:03.690> recalls<00:01:04.589> three<00:01:04.890> times<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:06.150> is

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
God recalls three times that and that is

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.390 
God recalls three times that and that is
a<00:01:06.360> lot<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.810> its<00:01:07.020> really<00:01:07.320> expectable<00:01:07.950> for

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
a lot and its really expectable for

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.149 
a lot and its really expectable for
weapons<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.880> have<00:01:08.939> nine<00:01:09.420> hundred<00:01:09.810> rpm<00:01:10.320> both

the chamber if your gun is it totally

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.660 
the chamber if your gun is it totally
empty<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.200> need<00:01:28.380> 3.5<00:01:29.009> seconds<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.430> reload

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
empty you need 3.5 seconds to reload

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.120 
empty you need 3.5 seconds to reload
them<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.090> try<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.750> reload<00:01:31.320> even<00:01:31.680> with<00:01:31.890> one

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
one second that one second is crucial if

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.929 
one second that one second is crucial if
you're<00:01:37.590> playing<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.100> especially<00:01:38.520> if<00:01:38.790> you're

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
you're playing and especially if you're

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.359 
you're playing and especially if you're
playing<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.540> aggressively<00:01:40.409> now<00:01:40.979> about<00:01:41.189> the

playing and aggressively now about the
f2000<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.000> little<00:01:42.210> bit<00:01:42.360> Dave<00:01:42.840> 2000<00:01:43.380> has<00:01:43.710> a

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
f2000 a little bit Dave 2000 has a

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.530 
f2000 a little bit Dave 2000 has a
little<00:01:44.009> bit<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.430> little<00:01:44.460> bit<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> more

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
little bit a little bit of a more

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.870 
little bit a little bit of a more
vertical<00:01:46.110> recoil<00:01:46.560> there<00:01:47.070> but<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.490> has<00:01:47.640> less

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
vertical recoil there but it has less

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.450 
vertical recoil there but it has less
rpm<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.540> it's<00:01:48.659> it's<00:01:48.930> logical<00:01:49.560> whenever<00:01:50.250> you

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
rpm so it's it's logical whenever you

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.550 
rpm so it's it's logical whenever you
got<00:01:50.640> less<00:01:50.939> rpm<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.540> need<00:01:51.689> more<00:01:51.899> Rico<00:01:52.320> and

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
got less rpm you need more Rico and

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.039 
got less rpm you need more Rico and
whenever<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.280> have<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.490> higher<00:01:54.149> p.m.<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.869> need

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
whenever you have a higher p.m. you need

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.440 
whenever you have a higher p.m. you need
less<00:01:55.290> recoil<00:01:55.590> because<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.310> highest<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.090> RPM

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
less recoil because the highest the RPM

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.630 
less recoil because the highest the RPM
you<00:01:57.600> got<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.320> more<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.740> recall<00:01:59.070> affects<00:01:59.219> the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
you got the more the recall affects the

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.580 
you got the more the recall affects the
weapon<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.149> like<00:02:00.420> starts<00:02:00.810> kicking<00:02:01.049> all<00:02:01.320> over

the<00:02:46.639> sights<00:02:46.790> in<00:02:47.239> two<00:02:47.629> I<00:02:47.659> think<00:02:47.870> or<00:02:48.169> 2.5<00:02:48.709> for

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:48.919 
the sights in two I think or 2.5 for

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.490 
the sights in two I think or 2.5 for
hipfire<00:02:49.370> so<00:02:50.060> it's<00:02:50.209> a<00:02:50.299> great<00:02:50.449> weapon<00:02:50.780> the

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
hipfire so it's a great weapon the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.319 
hipfire so it's a great weapon the
spread<00:02:51.829> the<00:02:52.069> accuracy<00:02:52.459> is<00:02:52.609> pretty<00:02:52.939> good<00:02:53.180> the

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
spread the accuracy is pretty good the

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.990 
spread the accuracy is pretty good the
recall<00:02:53.659> is<00:02:53.750> kinda<00:02:54.109> retarded<00:02:54.290> but<00:02:55.099> you<00:02:55.310> can<00:02:55.459> you

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
recall is kinda retarded but you can you

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.209 
recall is kinda retarded but you can you
can<00:02:56.150> benefit<00:02:57.139> from<00:02:57.199> the<00:02:57.500> foregrip<00:02:57.829> a<00:02:57.980> lot<00:02:58.189> i

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:58.219 
can benefit from the foregrip a lot i

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.550 
can benefit from the foregrip a lot i
think<00:02:58.579> the<00:02:58.699> f2000<00:02:59.269> is<00:02:59.419> the<00:02:59.569> gun<00:02:59.780> that<00:02:59.989> gets

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
think the f2000 is the gun that gets

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.490 
think the f2000 is the gun that gets
benefited<00:03:01.280> from<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.209> fur<00:03:02.389> group<00:03:02.599> way<00:03:03.230> better

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
benefited from the fur group way better

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.979 
benefited from the fur group way better
extremely<00:03:04.219> better<00:03:04.400> than<00:03:04.819> any<00:03:05.090> other<00:03:05.419> gun<00:03:05.810> in

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
extremely better than any other gun in

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.189 
extremely better than any other gun in
battle<00:03:06.379> 3<00:03:06.760> even<00:03:07.760> though<00:03:07.969> it<00:03:08.299> gives<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:09.019> little

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:09.199 
battle 3 even though it gives a little

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:12.159 
battle 3 even though it gives a little
bit<00:03:09.290> of<00:03:09.439> small<00:03:10.310> like<00:03:11.030> bullet<00:03:11.449> spread<00:03:11.659> penalty

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:12.169 
bit of small like bullet spread penalty

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:14.110 
bit of small like bullet spread penalty
over<00:03:12.319> there<00:03:12.530> but<00:03:12.739> it's<00:03:12.980> really<00:03:13.250> small<00:03:13.639> to<00:03:13.939> run

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
over there but it's really small to run

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.999 
over there but it's really small to run
like<00:03:14.299> ten<00:03:14.810> percent<00:03:15.229> fifteen<00:03:15.530> percent<00:03:15.829> it's

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:16.009 
like ten percent fifteen percent it's

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:18.069 
like ten percent fifteen percent it's
really<00:03:16.340> small<00:03:16.669> and<00:03:16.909> you<00:03:17.239> already<00:03:17.389> got<00:03:17.750> a<00:03:17.780> good

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
really small and you already got a good

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
really good bullets read the fur group

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.089 
really good bullets read the fur group
doesn't<00:03:20.629> really<00:03:20.930> affect<00:03:21.319> the<00:03:21.530> bullet<00:03:21.919> spread

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
doesn't really affect the bullet spread

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.789 
doesn't really affect the bullet spread
that<00:03:22.340> mat<00:03:22.609> and<00:03:22.849> it<00:03:23.060> really<00:03:23.359> helps<00:03:24.049> the<00:03:24.139> gun<00:03:24.409> to

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
that mat and it really helps the gun to

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.759 
that mat and it really helps the gun to
reduce<00:03:25.400> that<00:03:25.639> horizontal<00:03:26.000> recall<00:03:26.689> that<00:03:26.840> 0.5

reduce that horizontal recall that 0.5
recall<00:03:28.189> it<00:03:28.310> drops<00:03:28.609> it<00:03:28.790> to<00:03:29.409> 0.37<00:03:30.409> which<00:03:30.590> is<00:03:30.769> a

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
recall it drops it to 0.37 which is a

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.030 
recall it drops it to 0.37 which is a
lot<00:03:31.129> it's<00:03:31.609> a<00:03:31.819> lot<00:03:31.849> of<00:03:32.060> recoil<00:03:33.019> taken<00:03:33.680> away<00:03:33.979> for

doesn't benefit it a lot even though
it's<00:05:15.030> one<00:05:15.270> of<00:05:15.450> those<00:05:15.600> weapons<00:05:15.840> that<00:05:16.110> actually

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
it's one of those weapons that actually

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.010 
it's one of those weapons that actually
get<00:05:16.740> nice<00:05:17.520> benefits<00:05:18.120> from<00:05:18.270> the<00:05:18.450> foregrip<00:05:18.780> but

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
get nice benefits from the foregrip but

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.110 
get nice benefits from the foregrip but
if<00:05:19.470> you're<00:05:19.650> gonna<00:05:19.770> go<00:05:20.010> eat<00:05:20.280> more<00:05:20.520> medium<00:05:20.910> rates

hip<00:05:23.820> firing<00:05:24.060> with<00:05:24.240> the<00:05:24.360> AK<00:05:24.480> doesn't<00:05:25.050> have<00:05:25.170> that

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
hip firing with the AK doesn't have that

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.710 
hip firing with the AK doesn't have that

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
good of a hip fire accuracy so you need

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.990 
good of a hip fire accuracy so you need
