00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
medium-sized barrel so it's not gigantic

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.430

size<00:02:55.099> but<00:02:55.430> it's<00:02:55.579> also<00:02:55.760> not<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.390> really<00:02:56.720> thin<00:02:57.140> one

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
size but it's also not a really thin one

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.089 
size but it's also not a really thin one
and<00:02:57.760> my<00:02:58.760> hair<00:02:59.000> is<00:02:59.239> braided<00:03:00.079> as<00:03:00.470> you<00:03:00.709> can<00:03:00.860> tell

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
and my hair is braided as you can tell

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.670 
and my hair is braided as you can tell
so<00:03:01.819> it<00:03:01.970> will<00:03:02.209> have<00:03:02.420> a<00:03:02.629> lot<00:03:02.840> of<00:03:02.870> texture<00:03:03.440> to<00:03:03.650> it

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
so it will have a lot of texture to it

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.400 
so it will have a lot of texture to it
um<00:03:04.129> I<00:03:04.579> kind<00:03:05.299> of<00:03:05.360> just<00:03:05.540> like<00:03:05.629> this<00:03:05.959> because<00:03:06.140> my

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
um I kind of just like this because my

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.819 
um I kind of just like this because my
hair<00:03:06.650> is<00:03:06.680> really<00:03:07.069> like<00:03:07.579> flat<00:03:08.239> if<00:03:08.629> I<00:03:08.780> don't<00:03:09.049> do

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
hair is really like flat if I don't do

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.339 
hair is really like flat if I don't do
this<00:03:09.890> because<00:03:10.220> even<00:03:10.640> with<00:03:10.910> having<00:03:11.810> braids<00:03:12.110> in

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
this because even with having braids in

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:13.839 
this because even with having braids in
as<00:03:12.560> you<00:03:12.680> can<00:03:12.799> tell<00:03:13.010> I<00:03:13.040> don't<00:03:13.340> have<00:03:13.519> that<00:03:13.549> much

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
as you can tell I don't have that much

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.150 
as you can tell I don't have that much
body<00:03:14.150> so<00:03:14.870> this<00:03:15.049> will<00:03:15.170> just<00:03:15.319> make<00:03:15.440> it<00:03:15.650> look<00:03:15.920> like

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
body so this will just make it look like

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.520 
body so this will just make it look like
I<00:03:16.310> have<00:03:16.610> more<00:03:17.620> texture<00:03:18.620> to<00:03:18.650> my<00:03:19.099> hair<00:03:19.400> then<00:03:20.530> just

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
I have more texture to my hair then just

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.160 
I have more texture to my hair then just
like<00:03:21.709> my<00:03:21.859> normal<00:03:22.220> straight<00:03:22.549> hair<00:03:22.850> but<00:03:23.329> you<00:03:23.900> can

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
like my normal straight hair but you can

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.319 
like my normal straight hair but you can
start<00:03:24.799> off<00:03:24.980> with<00:03:25.160> straight<00:03:25.489> hair<00:03:25.519> if<00:03:25.819> you<00:03:25.970> want

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
start off with straight hair if you want

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.390 
start off with straight hair if you want
to<00:03:26.600> and<00:03:27.319> I<00:03:27.410> just<00:03:27.590> brush<00:03:27.859> it<00:03:27.889> through<00:03:28.100> because

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
to and I just brush it through because

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.539 
to and I just brush it through because
it<00:03:28.609> was<00:03:28.700> stream<00:03:29.600> Lee<00:03:29.750> messy<00:03:30.109> so<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.250> first

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
it was stream Lee messy so the first

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.160 
it was stream Lee messy so the first
step<00:03:31.700> is<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.030> actually<00:03:32.359> put<00:03:32.810> in<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.019> hair

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
step is to actually put in the hair

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.009 
step is to actually put in the hair
extensions<00:03:33.799> so<00:03:34.730> you<00:03:35.060> take<00:03:35.299> the<00:03:35.329> bigger<00:03:35.720> pieces

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
extensions so you take the bigger pieces

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.539 
extensions so you take the bigger pieces
and<00:03:36.410> put<00:03:36.560> them<00:03:36.590> at<00:03:36.739> the<00:03:36.799> bottom<00:03:37.220> and<00:03:37.370> then

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
and put them at the bottom and then

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.170 
and put them at the bottom and then
layer<00:03:37.760> upwards<00:03:38.329> so<00:03:39.260> starting<00:03:39.950> at<00:03:40.099> about<00:03:40.250> right

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
layer upwards so starting at about right

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.379 
layer upwards so starting at about right
the<00:03:41.690> middle<00:03:42.079> of<00:03:42.260> your<00:03:42.440> ears<00:03:42.829> or<00:03:43.280> so<00:03:43.549> this<00:03:44.239> is
