00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:07.350
 or the flames to the channel of practical guides 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:10.469
 Today I bring you a clean face playing with 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.049
 good principles with the hacr but you go 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.900
 to see that the acb used it rather little 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.390
 is about launch area and good at 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.890
 first place to thank the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.359
 tactics sp 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.599
 for giving us the opportunity to participate 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.580
 in your channel for giving us the opportunity to 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.590
 be part of that great project of 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.960
 this great project that is taking away 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.829
 out which is taking taking color not 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.070
 taking taking shape 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.859
 I have said so many thanks and now 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.589
 I will present a little bit I that the voice 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:47.190
 mine is a bit unknown to all 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:51.899
 for almost everyone my name is my name is 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.269
 theme the hd I'm starting a channel with 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.479
 This same name h gamer week 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:01:00.059
 suits are badly dry the headquarters and what said 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:02.579
 I bring you a game in the zone of 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.510
 launch a game that does not start 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.510
 using as I say with him 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.950
 but what 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.350
 during the game in a few 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.000
 instants in fact here I charge everything 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.939
 the world that is with the rifle not that 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.729
 there are many people 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:23.100
 championing with double sniper 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.289
 a lot of people there you see what I said 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.500
 change to one of your rifles and the 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:30.630
 I start to roll with that gun 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.580
 and comment that for those who do not know 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.560
 what is the launch zone of 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.700
 it's about a game number in which 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.280
 there's a one area let's say process 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.560
 launch where packets fall and fall 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.020
 packages to those who are in that area 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.380
 here in packages only for those who 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:54.240
 are in the circle or in the radius of that 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:57.930
 zone and the more people the more points 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.540
 get the team not the victory is 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.490
 try to get in a suv the maximum 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.460
 possible points 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.850
 and good to try to use the 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.350
 packages that you fall to get it not 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.550
 that is the main idea of areas of 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.160
 launch so good there are two 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.310
 options or two ways to play this this 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.680
 way the first the first way would be 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.810
 get into the launch area to sack 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.950
 to get good packages like 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.080
 I'm seeing here that I'm going to do 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.600
 now to get packages or steal from 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.120
 the packages to the enemy here I'm going to 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.730
 steal a package then had two 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.630
 options or you meteis area Friday 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.120
 Release here 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.220
 he killed another one more 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.049
 is the problem of methods in the 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.989
 be in launch area for 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.010
 fall to rain of everything then if you 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.730
 metÃ©is is to carry the shield 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.709
 protective vale 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.000
 and the rest of advantage whatever it is but not 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.310
 the case is the protective game for 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.629
 avoid being killed with grenades and 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.360
 try to use the maximum number of 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:00.810
 packages that you like would be the 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.260
 forms the way to get out of 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.580
 packages and release together another option 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.900
 and defend access in the area of 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.489
 launch to me this option I like 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.299
 more but simply for the fact that 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:15.020
 I dominate the game so I play that 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:18.410
 way or I defend 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:22.620
 the letters from far not from close 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:25.170
 I do not like to be in the area 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.690
 of domain because good is the same as always 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.700
 you drop bombs grenades not here to 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.400
 everything and end up dying a lot of 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.409
 times then my idea has always been 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.049
 here you see lame the msr I will not let go 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:40.079
 throughout the game in my idea has always 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.409
 been the following are four in the group 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:46.560
 because he plays two people playing 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:48.870
 taking the flag and two more defending 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.790
 the access to the flag is the most 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.819
 appropriate to catch a flag that does not 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.370
 they kill you that good that of that it is 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.349
 fruitful the attack or the attempt to 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.060
 achieve that goal and submit 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.069
 four to a flag because the same thing happens 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.799
 what happens in the oscar launch zone 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.440
 a grenade or climb a rpg or a 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:11.400
 predator minimally and if all dead 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.590
 so well said that you can see 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.489
 on my channel it's worth on my channel you can see 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.160
 well a more daily that always and then 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:24.400
 mini craft videos 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.669
 from a lot of non-black games 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.729
 dark souls of a 12 of all a little but 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:33.669
 as I say a daily always and as I say 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.860
 always always modern warfare 3 either 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.919
 because I also have an initial lacquer 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.990
 and I'm going to start one of each type of weapon 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.840
 until all the weapons of the 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.900
 game little by little there disk of using the 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.090
 msr there is not little left there is not much left 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.560
 although with 15 minutes good really not 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.300
 there are five minutes left because the game 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.789
 it ends at 7,500 points if not 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.440
 I remember badly so there are already some 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.600
 few a few few points per 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:03.880
 get and I charge again to that of the 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:06.300
 insertion charge by twice the msr that 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.849
 it goes really well 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.669
 for me it is the rifle my favorite rifle 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:13.470
 Without any doubt he says he kills from a 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.379
 shot almost always very little 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:19.650
 Very few marquet are very few failures 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:21.509
 a lot of precision projection and a lot of damage 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.949
 not what you really want to be a 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:26.270
 says he has a single shot and here is 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.840
 where will I get to manage and to 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.020
 get it 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.849
 Weisman, all I bend down is like you see 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.979
 I'm defending access to the area 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:36.990
 launch there is a head shot like 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.969
 You see, I'm defending the zone, the zone 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.740
 for access to the launch area 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:42.360
 that is here to my right that are 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.210
 taking three of my colleagues I 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.039
 I'm here a little causing terror and 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.479
 distracting by distracting people I 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.550
 this moment I did not even think that I was going to 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:53.669
 take out nothing and I took out the mufa and just 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.860
 just the game why on my channel 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:58.259
 it's like ending modding and that's why 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.479
 well then the title because I do not 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:02.400
 let's not throw it you see bottom end there 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:04.710
 killed one and this is where I take the 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.960
 fashion so good nothing I hope that you 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:10.139
 I liked that you enjoyed and that 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.500
 good you go through my channel and see you a 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:12.500
 greeting
