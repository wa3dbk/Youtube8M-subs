are hard cases and then I have one

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.920 
are hard cases and then I have one
silicon<00:00:14.759> that's<00:00:15.030> black<00:00:15.330> on<00:00:15.540> black<00:00:15.809> silicon

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
silicon that's black on black silicon

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.910 
silicon that's black on black silicon
then<00:00:18.930> these<00:00:19.230> are<00:00:20.060> hard<00:00:21.060> cases<00:00:21.600> hard<00:00:22.380> snap<00:00:22.740> on

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
then these are hard cases hard snap on
