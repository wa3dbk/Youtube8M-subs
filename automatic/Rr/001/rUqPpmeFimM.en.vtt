00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.189
 The project starts with the acquisition of 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.619
 tilapia fingerlings of 1 centimeter of 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.189
 length the fry were divided into 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.330
 three ponds of 1500 liters 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.390
 they remained in the containers with 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.570
 fresh water for a month and a half until 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.640
 that weighed 5 grams the adaptation of 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.769
 the organisms to sea water was 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.559
 gradual for the tests were formed 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:47.400
 three groups the first one was transferred in 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:51.030
 15 days the second in 10 days and the 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.340
 last group in 5 days subsequently 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.489
 placed in three 30- meter ponds 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.910
 cubic one with three thousand 300 tilapia 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.940
 another one thousand forty-one plus two 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.700
 one thousand 20 fish only three were needed 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.479
 experiments to know the time 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.729
 minimum that is required when transferring 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:16.140
 slowly to the fish of a kind of 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.899
 water to another and from there to grow every month 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.970
 Biometries were made which allowed 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.740
 gradually register the rate of 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.570
 growth of tilapia 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.759
 adjust the percentage of food that is 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.979
 was going to add the conditions were 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.470
 controlled by taking advantage of the heat of 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.509
 sun through a greenhouse could 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.700
 keep the temperature of the 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.210
 water in the ponds on average the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.729
 Water temperature remained at 28.4 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.090
 Celsius degrees the objective of the project 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.189
 was designing build and operate a 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.350
 Three - dimensional recirculation system 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.780
 for the intensive cultivation of species of 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.369
 economic importance in which they stand out 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.159
 the control of the parameters of 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.170
 production and health management these 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.179
 recirculation systems were 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.580
 designed and built in the 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:05.069
 aquaculture department the advantages 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.470
 several are reused water with a 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:10.259
 minimum percentage of change is had 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.630
 greater sanitary control, less impact on 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.700
 environment and better control in the 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.890
 water quality parameters was a 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.470
 eight month process so that the 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.690
 specimens acquired the ideal size and 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.080
 make the first harvest of tilapia 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.989
 in which 361 kilograms were obtained 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.280
 months later the second 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.430
 harvest with 4 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.310
 170 kilos in the third and last harvest 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.340
 the result was seven hundred and thirty 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.620
 and seven kilograms part of the fish was 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.870
 donated to the nursing home association 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.700
 of lifeguard and rescue center 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.650
 rehabilitation and in the colonies of the 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.650
 periphery through the municipal dif 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.830
 successfully thank you and so you know the 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.880
 the two do not exist that and we 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.880
 we saved the game 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.390
 definitely a way to check 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.900
 how science contributes to well-being 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.900
 of the society
