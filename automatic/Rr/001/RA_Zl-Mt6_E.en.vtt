let's<00:03:19.120> start<00:03:19.299> out<00:03:19.390> with<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.540> first<00:03:19.690> one<00:03:19.959> and

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
let's start out with the first one and

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.509 
let's start out with the first one and
what<00:03:20.680> is<00:03:20.799> that<00:03:20.830> maneuver<00:03:21.220> that<00:03:21.310> we're<00:03:21.430> gonna

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
what is that maneuver that we're gonna

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.280 
what is that maneuver that we're gonna
talk<00:03:21.670> about<00:03:21.790> first<00:03:22.390> maneuver<00:03:22.600> we<00:03:22.840> did<00:03:22.989> was<00:03:23.140> the

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
talk about first maneuver we did was the

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.530 
talk about first maneuver we did was the
elevator<00:03:23.760> basically<00:03:24.760> you're<00:03:25.030> holding<00:03:25.360> full

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
elevator basically you're holding full

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.960 
elevator basically you're holding full
elevator<00:03:25.989> in<00:03:26.350> a<00:03:26.470> stalled<00:03:26.830> manner<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.549> the

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
elevator in a stalled manner and the

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.900 
elevator in a stalled manner and the
planes<00:03:28.209> coming<00:03:28.480> straight<00:03:28.840> down<00:03:29.730> we've<00:03:30.730> got

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
planes coming straight down we've got

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.250 
planes coming straight down we've got
about<00:03:31.000> three<00:03:31.299> flights<00:03:31.600> on<00:03:31.780> this<00:03:31.900> plane<00:03:32.080> so<00:03:32.200> I

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
about three flights on this plane so I

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.539 
about three flights on this plane so I
haven't<00:03:32.380> uh<00:03:32.470> no<00:03:32.590> lot<00:03:32.860> of<00:03:32.950> setup<00:03:33.130> so<00:03:33.400> in<00:03:33.459> the

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
haven't uh no lot of setup so in the

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:34.830 
haven't uh no lot of setup so in the
video<00:03:33.760> you're<00:03:33.880> going<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.060> see<00:03:34.209> some<00:03:34.390> wing<00:03:34.600> rock

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
video you're going to see some wing rock

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.410 
video you're going to see some wing rock
that's<00:03:35.140> fairly<00:03:35.500> normal<00:03:35.769> with<00:03:36.160> planes<00:03:36.700> it's

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
that's fairly normal with planes it's

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.390 
that's fairly normal with planes it's
got<00:03:37.600> to<00:03:37.720> let<00:03:37.840> it<00:03:37.930> do<00:03:38.080> it<00:03:38.230> it's<00:03:38.709> not<00:03:38.890> going<00:03:39.070> to<00:03:39.160> do

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
got to let it do it it's not going to do

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.880 
got to let it do it it's not going to do
anything<00:03:39.580> crazy<00:03:39.820> so<00:03:40.720> basically<00:03:41.410> to<00:03:41.530> enter<00:03:41.739> the

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
anything crazy so basically to enter the

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.550 
anything crazy so basically to enter the
maneuver<00:03:42.340> you<00:03:42.459> come<00:03:42.670> in<00:03:42.820> high<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.450> you<00:03:44.140> cut

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
maneuver you come in high and you cut

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.990 
maneuver you come in high and you cut
the<00:03:44.680> throttle<00:03:45.070> you<00:03:45.100> start<00:03:45.400> pulling<00:03:45.549> elevator

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
the throttle you start pulling elevator

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.789 
the throttle you start pulling elevator
to<00:03:46.180> get<00:03:46.299> the<00:03:46.390> nose<00:03:46.540> up<00:03:46.600> once<00:03:47.230> she<00:03:47.410> comes<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:47.739> a

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
to get the nose up once she comes to a

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.140 
to get the nose up once she comes to a
stall<00:03:48.010> and<00:03:48.130> starts<00:03:48.400> fall<00:03:48.640> and<00:03:48.880> you<00:03:48.970> add<00:03:49.090> a

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
stall and starts fall and you add a

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.910 
stall and starts fall and you add a
little<00:03:49.209> bit<00:03:49.420> of<00:03:49.480> throttle<00:03:49.690> you<00:03:50.440> can<00:03:50.560> adjust

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
little bit of throttle you can adjust

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.289 
little bit of throttle you can adjust
the<00:03:51.010> amount<00:03:51.100> of<00:03:51.250> throttle<00:03:51.549> to<00:03:51.640> bring<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.209> nose

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
the amount of throttle to bring the nose

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.300 
the amount of throttle to bring the nose
higher<00:03:52.600> or<00:03:52.840> lower<00:03:52.890> let's<00:03:53.890> let<00:03:54.070> it<00:03:54.160> come

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
higher or lower let's let it come

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.500 
higher or lower let's let it come
straight<00:03:54.610> down<00:03:54.640> like<00:03:54.970> so<00:03:55.150> there's<00:03:55.330> going<00:03:55.420> to

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
straight down like so there's going to

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.090 
straight down like so there's going to
be<00:03:55.540> some<00:03:55.750> wing<00:03:55.900> rock<00:03:56.110> on<00:03:56.320> most<00:03:56.560> planes<00:03:56.860> some

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
be some wing rock on most planes some

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.800 
be some wing rock on most planes some
planes<00:03:57.310> won't<00:03:57.519> do<00:03:57.700> it<00:03:57.850> this<00:03:58.000> one<00:03:58.209> did<00:03:58.480> quite<00:03:58.750> a

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
planes won't do it this one did quite a

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.470 
planes won't do it this one did quite a
bit<00:03:59.220> but<00:04:00.220> if<00:04:00.459> you're<00:04:00.580> trying<00:04:00.790> to<00:04:00.910> fight<00:04:01.180> it<00:04:01.209> too

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
bit but if you're trying to fight it too

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.300 
bit but if you're trying to fight it too
much<00:04:01.660> with<00:04:01.870> rudder<00:04:02.079> and<00:04:02.410> aileron<00:04:03.010> it's<00:04:03.190> going

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
much with rudder and aileron it's going

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.310 
much with rudder and aileron it's going
to<00:04:03.370> just<00:04:03.489> make<00:04:03.670> it<00:04:03.700> worse<00:04:04.000> I<00:04:04.329> found<00:04:04.900> holding<00:04:05.200> a

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
to just make it worse I found holding a

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.750 
to just make it worse I found holding a
little<00:04:05.500> bit<00:04:05.590> of<00:04:05.680> right<00:04:05.829> rudder<00:04:05.860> as<00:04:06.370> it<00:04:06.670> was

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
little bit of right rudder as it was

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.759 
little bit of right rudder as it was
falling<00:04:07.000> really<00:04:07.299> helped<00:04:07.600> the<00:04:07.660> wing<00:04:07.840> rock<00:04:08.049> and

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
falling really helped the wing rock and

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.199 
falling really helped the wing rock and
then<00:04:08.890> use<00:04:09.010> bring<00:04:09.220> down<00:04:09.400> as<00:04:09.519> low<00:04:09.640> as<00:04:09.700> you<00:04:09.820> want<00:04:10.000> a

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
then use bring down as low as you want a

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:11.729 
then use bring down as low as you want a
really<00:04:10.420> fun<00:04:10.780> maneuvers<00:04:11.200> just<00:04:11.380> let<00:04:11.500> it<00:04:11.590> fall

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
really fun maneuvers just let it fall

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:12.840 
really fun maneuvers just let it fall
straight<00:04:11.920> down<00:04:12.040> until<00:04:12.430> you're<00:04:12.519> over<00:04:12.760> the

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
straight down until you're over the

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.490 
straight down until you're over the
runway<00:04:13.120> basically<00:04:13.630> add<00:04:13.840> throw

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
runway basically add throw

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.289 
runway basically add throw
we'll<00:04:14.680> pull<00:04:14.830> it<00:04:14.950> into<00:04:15.070> a<00:04:15.160> hover<00:04:15.400> torque<00:04:16.090> roll

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
we'll pull it into a hover torque roll

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.819 
we'll pull it into a hover torque roll
what<00:04:16.390> everyone<00:04:16.690> do<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:16.930> then<00:04:17.079> punch<00:04:17.410> out<00:04:17.620> and

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
what everyone do and then punch out and
