00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.629
 today we are going to teach you a little trick 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.629
 so that the glitter will look like this 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.590
 we are going to teach you how to throw 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.410
 correctly an enamel with glitter 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.119
 like this for example that is confetti that 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.220
 It has a lot of glitter with different 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:23.680
 sizes and different colors normally 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.770
 the enamels are cast from the cuticle 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.779
 upwards as you know with these I do not know 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.960
 It does not matter if you have tried some 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:34.090
 one time if you do it like that practically 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.470
 there are no glitter look for example 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:41.879
 I will make an example of how it is usually 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.879
 do and how is it 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:50.150
 in this nail normally what you usually 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.800
 going out to do is doing so below 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:56.840
 and as you see practically is that 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:59.089
 it stays beige milk glitter then you 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.390
 you despair a little because you say I've 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:04.150
 bought this enamel and it barely leaves me 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.730
 purpurin 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.560
 as you see and now we are going to count the 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.850
 right way to make them more 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.100
 glitter and look much more colorful 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.860
 so that for us to stay 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.750
 correctly and more colorful 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.520
 first thing we have to do is remove 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:27.370
 a little brush to take the 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.210
 the greater the amount of glitter 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.600
 possible 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.280
 what fishery is there and now what 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.340
 we have to do is do it with 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.370
 touches although it has a dropper not os 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.670
 worry later 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.840
 well with little touches and then if it leaves the 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.450
 do not worry 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.969
 because then we can remove it with a 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.969
 beige stick and so 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.770
 It is leaving much more glitter 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.810
 in our 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.200
 here you see the difference of how it is 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.950
 thrown in the two ways here is hardly 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.470
 go see glitter and here much more if 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.170
 you have come out a little with a toothpick 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.470
 of orange tree you can take off for the 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.470
 side 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.020
 and so that it is much more deep 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.890
 we wait for it to dry it's layer a 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.420
 little bit and you can repeat the 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.569
 process and so you will have much more 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.060
 colorful this is how it is leaving it 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.739
 the wrong way and this is throwing it 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.260
 You have seen how well it shows the 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.880
 difference do not hesitate to subscribe and if 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.380
 have any questions contact 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.430
 we'll see each other in the next 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.430
 goodbye tutorial
