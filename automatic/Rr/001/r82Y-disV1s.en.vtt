and the subsidy takes advantage of the
fingerprint<00:00:14.519> sensor<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.240> built<00:00:15.540> inside

of the home button now the way touch ID

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.189 
of the home button now the way touch ID
works<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.330> once<00:00:18.539> you<00:00:18.660> get<00:00:18.810> your<00:00:18.990> phone

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
works is that once you get your phone

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.720 
works is that once you get your phone
you<00:00:19.439> actually<00:00:19.800> go<00:00:19.920> through<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.279> during<00:00:20.640> this

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
you actually go through it during this

you actually go through it during this
setup<00:00:21.090> process<00:00:21.300> if<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.720> want<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:22.080> but<00:00:22.260> if<00:00:22.320> you

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
fingerprints and then it will give you

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.669 
fingerprints and then it will give you
an<00:00:29.789> option<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.179> add<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.779> new<00:00:30.810> print<00:00:31.380> now<00:00:31.619> the

an option to add a new print now the
whole<00:00:31.890> process<00:00:32.009> basically<00:00:32.669> involves<00:00:33.059> you

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
whole process basically involves you

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.819 
whole process basically involves you
tapping<00:00:33.450> your<00:00:33.660> finger<00:00:33.930> up<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.290> down<00:00:34.440> on<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
tapping your finger up and down on the

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.590 
tapping your finger up and down on the
home<00:00:35.010> button<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.520> once<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.000> tap<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.390> down<00:00:36.540> and

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
home button in once you tap it down and

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.150 
home button in once you tap it down and
then<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:36.960> feel<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> vibration<00:00:37.410> then<00:00:38.010> you're

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
then you feel a vibration then you're

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.040 
then you feel a vibration then you're
ready<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.579> lift<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.940> up<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.239> then<00:00:39.510> tap<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.930> down

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
ready to lift it up and then tap it down

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.450 
ready to lift it up and then tap it down
again<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.680> will<00:00:40.770> guide<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.129> through<00:00:41.160> this

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
again and it will guide you through this

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.220 
again and it will guide you through this
step<00:00:41.579> but<00:00:41.820> it's<00:00:41.969> pretty<00:00:42.239> painless<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.809> it'll

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
step but it's pretty painless and it'll

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.990 
step but it's pretty painless and it'll
more<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.530> likely<00:00:43.770> take<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.070> about<00:00:44.250> 30<00:00:44.550> seconds

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
more to likely take you about 30 seconds

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.940 
more to likely take you about 30 seconds
to<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.149> minute<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.539> complete<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.320> now<00:00:46.739> once

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
to a minute to complete this now once

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.250 
to a minute to complete this now once
you<00:00:47.070> do<00:00:47.250> finally<00:00:47.550> complete<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.899> simply

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
you do finally complete this you simply

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.170 
you do finally complete this you simply
now<00:00:49.440> we're<00:00:49.620> going<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.860> test<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.190> out<00:00:50.280> by<00:00:50.550> going

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
now we're going to test it out by going

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.850 
now we're going to test it out by going
to<00:00:51.480> your<00:00:51.660> lock<00:00:51.899> screen<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.530> then<00:00:52.680> just

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
to your lock screen and then just

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.319 
to your lock screen and then just
placing<00:00:53.190> your<00:00:53.280> finger<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.120> home<00:00:54.149> button

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
placing your finger on the home button

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.270 
placing your finger on the home button
and<00:00:54.750> then<00:00:55.170> boom<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.559> should<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:55.890> able<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.129> go

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
and then boom you should be able to go

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.979 
and then boom you should be able to go
right<00:00:56.520> into<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.059> phone<00:00:57.270> without<00:00:57.510> having<00:00:57.660> to

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
right into the phone without having to

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.020 
right into the phone without having to
type<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> passcode<00:00:59.070> now<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.550> still<00:00:59.789> need<00:00:59.820> to

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
type in a passcode now you still need to

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.869 
type in a passcode now you still need to
have<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.180> passcode<00:01:00.510> alongside<00:01:01.109> touch<00:01:01.710> ID<00:01:02.010> just

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
have a passcode alongside touch ID just

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.520 
have a passcode alongside touch ID just
for<00:01:03.120> safety<00:01:03.539> concern<00:01:03.780> just<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.049> case<00:01:04.229> your

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
for safety concern just in case your

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.170 
for safety concern just in case your
fingerprint<00:01:04.979> stops<00:01:05.339> working<00:01:05.670> for<00:01:05.850> whatever

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
fingerprint stops working for whatever

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.609 
fingerprint stops working for whatever
reason<00:01:06.510> or<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.630> lose<00:01:06.840> both<00:01:07.049> your<00:01:07.229> hands<00:01:07.409> and

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
reason or you lose both your hands and

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.080 
reason or you lose both your hands and
some<00:01:07.710> accidental<00:01:08.070> note<00:01:08.310> or<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.760> wouldn't<00:01:09.000> be

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
some accidental note or you wouldn't be

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.280 
some accidental note or you wouldn't be
able<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.330> type<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.540> passcode<00:01:09.960> well<00:01:10.140> maybe

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
able to type the passcode well maybe

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.390 
able to type the passcode well maybe
with<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.590> knows<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.010> type<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.310> but

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
with you knows you can type it but

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.399 
with you knows you can type it but
anyway<00:01:11.729> we<00:01:12.540> still<00:01:12.720> need<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.960> have<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.110> passcode

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
anyway we still need to have a passcode

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.679 
anyway we still need to have a passcode
to<00:01:13.860> go<00:01:13.979> alongside<00:01:14.340> touch<00:01:14.820> ID<00:01:15.030> they<00:01:15.420> can<00:01:15.570> also

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
to go alongside touch ID they can also

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.050 
to go alongside touch ID they can also
use<00:01:15.900> touch<00:01:16.080> ID<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.619> get<00:01:17.009> content<00:01:17.549> from<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.909> App

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
use touch ID to get content from the App

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.450 
use touch ID to get content from the App
Store<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.659> iTunes<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.799> know<00:01:20.009> every<00:01:20.340> time

Apple has ensured us that these

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.950 
Apple has ensured us that these
fingerprints<00:01:35.579> are<00:01:35.670> never<00:01:35.850> sent<00:01:36.299> up<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.750> them

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
fingerprints are never sent up to them

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.420

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
or to their servers or anything like

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.700 
or to their servers or anything like
that<00:01:38.490> they're<00:01:39.030> kept<00:01:39.479> locally<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:40.229> your<00:01:40.470> phone

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
that they're kept locally on your phone

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.080 
that they're kept locally on your phone
and<00:01:40.979> then<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.159> method<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.670> fingerprint

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
and then the method that the fingerprint

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.550 
and then the method that the fingerprint
sensor<00:01:42.240> uses<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.869> recognize<00:01:43.320> your

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
sensor uses to recognize your

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.649 
sensor uses to recognize your
fingerprint<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.610> makes<00:01:44.850> sure's<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.450> ensures

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
fingerprint it makes sure's and ensures

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.270 
fingerprint it makes sure's and ensures
that<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.990> are<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> living<00:01:46.409> person<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:47.130> you're

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
that you are a living person that you're

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.609 
that you are a living person that you're
alive<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.090> but<00:01:48.659> some<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:48.960> was<00:01:49.020> they<00:01:49.200> finally

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
alive so but some of it was they finally

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.170 
alive so but some of it was they finally
get<00:01:49.799> your<00:01:50.009> print<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.430> then<00:01:50.640> put<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.090> on

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
get your print and then put it on

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.480 
get your print and then put it on
something<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.899> was<00:01:52.049> fake<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:53.070> more<00:01:53.280> likely

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
something that was fake it more likely

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.460 
something that was fake it more likely
shouldn't<00:01:53.970> go<00:01:54.119> because<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.780> has<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.110> recognize

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
shouldn't go because it has to recognize

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.230 
shouldn't go because it has to recognize
that<00:01:55.619> you're<00:01:55.920> alive<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.460> that's<00:01:56.820> basically

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
that you're alive so that's basically

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.459 
that you're alive so that's basically
just<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.540> quick<00:01:57.750> little<00:01:58.020> look<00:01:58.140> into<00:01:58.380> the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
just a quick little look into the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.899 
just a quick little look into the
technology<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.430> do<00:01:59.549> be<00:01:59.700> warned

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909

think<00:02:04.170> it's<00:02:04.259> around<00:02:04.320> 16,000<00:02:05.310> dollars<00:02:05.399> at<00:02:05.670> the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
think it's around 16,000 dollars at the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.459 
think it's around 16,000 dollars at the
time<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.119> this<00:02:06.210> video<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:06.780> there<00:02:07.140> are<00:02:07.229> people

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
time of this video so there are people

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.930 
time of this video so there are people
who<00:02:07.590> are<00:02:07.680> proactively<00:02:08.160> trying<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.550> break<00:02:08.789> this

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
who are proactively trying to break this

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.850 
who are proactively trying to break this
but<00:02:09.179> Apple<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.479> pretty<00:02:09.690> confident<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.200> this

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
but Apple is pretty confident that this

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.309 
but Apple is pretty confident that this
is<00:02:10.979> going<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.160> be<00:02:11.250> pretty<00:02:11.459> secure<00:02:11.819> but

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
is going to be pretty secure but

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.690 
is going to be pretty secure but
I have<00:02:12.439> to<00:02:12.530> tell<00:02:12.680> you<00:02:12.739> guys<00:02:12.799> it<00:02:13.129> does<00:02:13.370> make

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
I have to tell you guys it does make

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.429 
I have to tell you guys it does make
getting<00:02:13.969> into<00:02:14.209> your<00:02:14.329> phone<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.569> lot<00:02:14.870> faster

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:15.439 
getting into your phone a lot faster

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.440 
getting into your phone a lot faster
again<00:02:16.219> less<00:02:16.430> than<00:02:16.459> a<00:02:16.639> second<00:02:16.999> you're<00:02:17.120> in<00:02:17.150> there

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
again less than a second you're in there

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.910 
again less than a second you're in there
and<00:02:17.480> it's<00:02:17.749> a<00:02:17.870> lot<00:02:17.989> faster<00:02:18.049> and<00:02:18.620> more<00:02:18.709> secure

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
and it's a lot faster and more secure

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.949 
and it's a lot faster and more secure
than<00:02:19.310> a<00:02:19.400> passcode<00:02:19.879> so<00:02:20.180> touch<00:02:20.569> ID<00:02:20.749> is

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
than a passcode so touch ID is

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.929 
than a passcode so touch ID is
definitely<00:02:21.379> a<00:02:21.409> win<00:02:21.650> on<00:02:21.799> the<00:02:21.889> iPhone<00:02:22.219> 5s<00:02:22.430> and

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:22.939 
definitely a win on the iPhone 5s and

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.039 
definitely a win on the iPhone 5s and
then<00:02:23.090> one<00:02:23.239> more<00:02:23.359> thing<00:02:23.480> before<00:02:23.569> I<00:02:23.719> get<00:02:23.870> out<00:02:23.959> of

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
that this fingerprint sensor can

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.300 
that this fingerprint sensor can
actually<00:02:33.319> read<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.709> fingerprints<00:02:34.219> of

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
actually read the fingerprints of

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.280 
actually read the fingerprints of
animals<00:02:34.849> so<00:02:35.329> somebody<00:02:35.599> put<00:02:35.719> a<00:02:35.750> video<00:02:36.079> and<00:02:36.260> I
