and see the setup is completed see you

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:14.990 
and see the setup is completed see you
it<00:04:13.409> is<00:04:13.620> necessary<00:04:14.040> to<00:04:14.099> be<00:04:14.310> installed<00:04:14.790> because

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
it is necessary to be installed because

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.620 
it is necessary to be installed because
otherwise<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:16.079> game<00:04:16.260> will<00:04:16.409> not<00:04:16.440> run<00:04:18.139> so<00:04:19.609> now

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
otherwise the game will not run so now

press finish and wait for this to

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.050 
press finish and wait for this to
complete<00:04:25.520> because<00:04:26.520> it's<00:04:27.449> a<00:04:27.690> very<00:04:27.960> important

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
complete because it's a very important

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.300 
complete because it's a very important
software<00:04:30.080> which<00:04:31.080> would<00:04:31.409> help<00:04:31.710> to<00:04:32.070> run<00:04:32.250> the

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
software which would help to run the

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
software which would help to run the
games

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
games

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.369 
games
and<00:04:34.699> without<00:04:35.699> this<00:04:36.030> software<00:04:36.780> many<00:04:37.020> games

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:37.379 
and without this software many games

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:43.760 
and without this software many games
does<00:04:37.860> not<00:04:38.099> run<00:04:38.960> so<00:04:40.220> it's<00:04:41.220> very<00:04:41.460> important<00:04:42.770> as

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
does not run so it's very important as

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.670 
does not run so it's very important as
my<00:04:44.129> net<00:04:44.340> speed<00:04:44.550> is<00:04:44.699> fast<00:04:45.000> so<00:04:45.419> I<00:04:45.719> think<00:04:46.199> the

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
my net speed is fast so I think the

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.339 
my net speed is fast so I think the
download<00:04:46.979> will<00:04:47.129> be<00:04:47.250> fast<00:04:47.750> and<00:04:48.750> if<00:04:49.020> you<00:04:49.169> have<00:04:49.259> a

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:49.349 
download will be fast and if you have a

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:53.959 
download will be fast and if you have a
slow<00:04:49.590> net<00:04:49.800> it<00:04:50.580> may<00:04:50.789> it<00:04:50.969> may<00:04:51.000> take<00:04:51.360> about<00:04:52.669> 10<00:04:53.669> to

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:53.969 
slow net it may it may take about 10 to

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:57.110 
slow net it may it may take about 10 to
15<00:04:54.810> minutes<00:04:55.379> of<00:04:56.069> install<00:04:56.580> foreigner

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
15 minutes of install foreigner

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:03.140 
15 minutes of install foreigner
downloading<00:04:57.629> this<00:04:57.840> or<00:04:58.830> more<00:05:01.460> so<00:05:02.460> the

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
downloading this or more so the

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.279 
downloading this or more so the
installation<00:05:03.479> will<00:05:03.930> take<00:05:04.139> nearly<00:05:04.409> 1<00:05:05.099> R<00:05:06.110> or<00:05:07.110> if

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
installation will take nearly 1 R or if

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.820 
installation will take nearly 1 R or if
you<00:05:07.409> have<00:05:07.500> a<00:05:07.590> fast<00:05:07.800> processor<00:05:08.539> higher<00:05:09.539> amp<00:05:09.990> so

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
you have a fast processor higher amp so

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.480 
you have a fast processor higher amp so
it'll<00:05:11.039> take<00:05:11.419> about<00:05:12.650> 30<00:05:13.650> minutes<00:05:13.800> to<00:05:14.159> 45

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
it'll take about 30 minutes to 45

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.080 
it'll take about 30 minutes to 45
minutes<00:05:15.330> and<00:05:15.810> then<00:05:16.289> the<00:05:16.550> installation<00:05:17.550> will

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
minutes and then the installation will

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.700 
minutes and then the installation will
complete<00:05:18.569> after<00:05:19.560> that<00:05:21.319> so<00:05:22.319> after<00:05:22.590> the

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
complete after that so after the

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.740 
complete after that so after the
installation<00:05:23.069> you<00:05:23.370> must<00:05:23.969> install<00:05:24.330> this

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
installation you must install this

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.869 
installation you must install this
software<00:05:25.529> so<00:05:27.110> wait<00:05:28.110> for<00:05:28.710> the<00:05:28.830> installation<00:05:29.219> of

00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:29.879 
software so wait for the installation of

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:37.430 
software so wait for the installation of
this<00:05:30.779> software<00:05:31.139> that<00:05:31.259> I<00:05:31.409> will<00:05:31.680> continue<00:05:36.440> so
