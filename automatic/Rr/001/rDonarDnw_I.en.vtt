00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.230
Hosting a baby shower for a mom- to- be?

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.260
Consider a whimsical nursery rhyme things
foray and impress all your guests with these

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.360
simple but spectacular cookies.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.860
Now, these may look complicated but I assure
you, they're not.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.050
You don't need to go out and buy especially
shaped cookie cutters.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:25.490
You just need round cookie cutters in 3 sizes-
mine is about 3 inches, 2 inches and 1 inch.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.910
All of the cookies use the same process of
royal icing with added things like sprinkles

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.500
or sugar ice or even chocolate chips.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.710
The key to decorating with royal icing is
a process known as flooding.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.809
You're gonna start with your royal icing in
a pastry bag or on a plastic bag with the

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:45.809
corners seamed off.

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:55.059
You're gonna create a border around the edge
of your cookie.

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.530
The next step is to use royal icing that you
[ unk ] a bit and thinned a bit with water.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.739
You can use the tip of the bottle to help
spread it to the edges.

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.630
The border you have from the beginning with
the royal icing is what keeps it from dripping

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.490
down the sides.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.619
At this point, you can either add sprinkles
into the wet icing so they'll set or you can

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:13.890
set them aside and let them dry.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.909
It will harden into a nice, smooth finish.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.810
For " Hey diddle diddle the cat in the fiddle;
the cow jumped over the moon ," you're actually

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.229
gonna make 2 different cookies.

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:22.520
The moon is really easy.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.570
It's a single sugar cookie that I decorated
with 2 different colors of royal icing or

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.710
stay piped, a yellow moon on and filled it
in and then I did a blue background.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.470
And then I used these little star shaped sprinkles.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.320
I added them right to the wet royal icing
before it dried and I used a little blue sprinkle

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.329
for the man and the moon eye.

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.820
Now, to make the cow, it's a little more involved
but still very easy.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.079
Start with one large cookie, one medium cookie
and 2 small cookies.

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.730
The medium cookie gets attached to the top
of the large cookie for the cow's head and

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.259
the two smaller cookies get attached at the
bottom for the cow's feet.

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.079
Everything gets coated in royal icing completely.

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:09.509
To make the cow spots, simply use a black
food marker and I just drew them on.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.450
I did the same with the nose and I added 2
little pink sprinkles for the cow's nostrils.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:23.870
I used sugar, [ unk ], again, you could just
use royal icing and little mini chocolate

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.700
chips, you don't have to buy these special.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.260
And for the cow's horns, I use chocolate chips.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.760
Now, grab a glass of milk and enjoy these
utterly delicious cookies.
