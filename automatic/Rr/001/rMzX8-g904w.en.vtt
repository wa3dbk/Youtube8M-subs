or<00:00:18.240> any<00:00:18.359> game<00:00:18.630> really<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.260> probably<00:00:19.560> first<00:00:19.920> to

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
or any game really is probably first to

understand the court that it's played on
in<00:00:22.500> some<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.859> basic<00:00:23.220> nomenclature<00:00:23.779> so<00:00:24.779> the

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
in some of the basic nomenclature so the

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.439 
in some of the basic nomenclature so the
first<00:00:25.170> thing<00:00:25.410> let's<00:00:26.279> look<00:00:26.760> at<00:00:26.880> how<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.060> hockey

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
first thing let's look at how a hockey

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.640 
first thing let's look at how a hockey
rink<00:00:27.750> set<00:00:28.740> up<00:00:29.539> ice<00:00:30.539> hockey<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.109> unique<00:00:31.439> because

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
rink set up ice hockey is unique because

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.760 
rink set up ice hockey is unique because
obviously<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.759> played<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.239> an<00:00:33.719> surface<00:00:34.590> of

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
obviously it is played on an surface of

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.069 
obviously it is played on an surface of
ice<00:00:34.950> there<00:00:35.850> are<00:00:36.030> many<00:00:36.239> variations<00:00:36.600> that

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
ice there are many variations that

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.840 
ice there are many variations that
you'll<00:00:37.260> see<00:00:37.530> like<00:00:37.710> roller<00:00:38.010> hockey<00:00:38.370> on

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
you'll see like roller hockey on

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.580 
you'll see like roller hockey on
rollerblades<00:00:39.210> or<00:00:39.629> deck<00:00:39.899> hockey<00:00:40.260> where<00:00:40.440> the

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
rollerblades or deck hockey where the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.229 
rollerblades or deck hockey where the
players<00:00:40.860> are<00:00:40.980> running<00:00:41.160> but<00:00:41.940> we'll<00:00:42.090> be<00:00:42.210> looking

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
players are running but we'll be looking

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.150 
players are running but we'll be looking
at<00:00:42.570> ice<00:00:42.809> hockey<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.320> these<00:00:43.469> videos<00:00:43.829> although

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
at ice hockey in these videos although

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.630 
at ice hockey in these videos although
many<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.879> rules<00:00:45.600> will<00:00:45.960> apply<00:00:46.640> regardless

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
many of the rules will apply regardless

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.920 
many of the rules will apply regardless
of<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.239> way<00:00:48.390> you're<00:00:48.570> playing<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:51.690> first

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
of the way you're playing the first

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.389 
of the way you're playing the first
thing<00:00:52.110> you'll<00:00:52.260> notice<00:00:52.440> about<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:53.039> rink<00:00:53.250> is

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
thing you'll notice about the rink is

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.369 
thing you'll notice about the rink is
that<00:00:53.610> it's<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.910> mirror<00:00:54.239> image<00:00:54.270> both<00:00:54.840> sides<00:00:55.110> are

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
that it's a mirror image both sides are

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.229 
that it's a mirror image both sides are
exactly<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.010> same<00:00:56.280> there<00:00:57.000> are<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.120> lot<00:00:57.210> of

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
exactly the same there are a lot of

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.299 
exactly the same there are a lot of
lines<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.899> dots<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.379> circles<00:00:58.590> going<00:00:59.010> on

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
lines and dots and circles going on

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.689 
lines and dots and circles going on
let's<00:00:59.730> break<00:01:00.149> them<00:01:00.300> down<00:01:01.070> first<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.430> red

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
let's break them down first is this red

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.700 
let's break them down first is this red
line<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.420> middle<00:01:03.539> which<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.080> shockingly

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
line in the middle which is shockingly

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.789 
line in the middle which is shockingly
called<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:06.000> red<00:01:06.210> line<00:01:06.510> I'll<00:01:07.260> admit<00:01:07.560> it's<00:01:07.710> not

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
called the red line I'll admit it's not

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.260 
called the red line I'll admit it's not
the<00:01:07.950> most<00:01:08.100> creative<00:01:08.400> name<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.909> world<00:01:09.090> that

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
the most creative name in the world that

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.200 
the most creative name in the world that
you<00:01:09.360> can<00:01:09.540> appreciate<00:01:09.810> its<00:01:10.250> simplicity<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
you can appreciate its simplicity the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.480 
you can appreciate its simplicity the
red<00:01:12.420> line<00:01:12.630> doesn't<00:01:13.049> come<00:01:13.170> into<00:01:13.320> play<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.560> ton<00:01:13.950> so

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
red line doesn't come into play a ton so

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.130 
red line doesn't come into play a ton so
for<00:01:14.700> now<00:01:14.850> all<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.150> really<00:01:15.509> have<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.720> know<00:01:15.780> is

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
for now all you really have to know is

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.780 
for now all you really have to know is
it's<00:01:16.409> called<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.740> red<00:01:16.890> line<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.400> it's<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
it's called the red line and it's in the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.960 
it's called the red line and it's in the
middle<00:01:18.320> to<00:01:19.320> get<00:01:19.470> slightly<00:01:19.770> more<00:01:20.189> complex<00:01:20.610> we

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
middle to get slightly more complex we

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.240 
middle to get slightly more complex we
have<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.360> blue<00:01:21.570> lines<00:01:21.840> there<00:01:22.530> are<00:01:22.560> two<00:01:23.070> of

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
have the blue lines there are two of

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.730 
have the blue lines there are two of
them<00:01:23.430> if<00:01:24.240> you're<00:01:24.420> colorblind<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.200> apologize

for<00:01:25.890> how<00:01:25.979> boring<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.430> must<00:01:26.670> be<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.000> far<00:01:27.180> but

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
for how boring this must be so far but

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.810 
for how boring this must be so far but
we'll<00:01:27.869> come<00:01:28.110> back<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.799> blue<00:01:29.100> lines<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.759> a

we'll come back to the blue lines in a

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.630 
we'll come back to the blue lines in a
second<00:01:30.299> if<00:01:30.930> you've<00:01:31.170> watched<00:01:31.439> even<00:01:31.860> 30<00:01:32.189> seconds

a<00:06:49.549> hockey<00:06:49.789> game<00:06:49.909> are<00:06:50.209> very<00:06:50.509> close<00:06:50.839> to<00:06:51.049> the<00:06:51.169> rink

00:06:51.429 --> 00:06:51.439 
a hockey game are very close to the rink

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:53.829 
a hockey game are very close to the rink
because<00:06:52.039> they're<00:06:52.399> separated<00:06:53.059> from<00:06:53.299> the

because they're separated from the

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:57.339 
because they're separated from the

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:00.019 
you don't know what Plexiglas is I think

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:02.049 
you don't know what Plexiglas is I think
Plexiglas<00:07:00.769> is<00:07:01.009> more<00:07:01.189> of<00:07:01.249> a<00:07:01.309> brand<00:07:01.549> name<00:07:01.849> but

00:07:02.049 --> 00:07:02.059 
Plexiglas is more of a brand name but

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:04.719
