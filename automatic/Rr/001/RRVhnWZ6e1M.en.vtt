 central multimedia newscientist 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.400
 in season 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.049
 in the flashlight ligament 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.049
 the unit will come in its original colors 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:16.739
 so for him 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.310
 logo account 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.310
 on startup 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.539
 I'm not going to put a radio 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.869
 10 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.419

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.250
 6 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.150
 it's just me 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.150
 I'm a sports fan. The newspapers. 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.150
 I'm going to pass a fake 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.370
 just the same different way 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.370
 questioned if made present 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.210
 these air the podium 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.980
 I'll go in now. 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.980
 digital 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.060
 the world to channel 3 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.530
 same thing if I want to change the channel 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.530
 if I change the steering wheel control 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.190
 depending on the location the weaker signal that we are 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.130
 the snag she these things over totally perfect operation 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.980
 even putting it back again 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.090
 to cut small legal sign 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.090

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.680
 closed 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.680
 gps browser 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.300
 It's a software goal 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.700
 when leaving boot only so it does not show that it already has a gps 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.570
 in the multimedia center 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.020
 there's no exit 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.980
 or sbt 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.450
 and also if and should have been placed 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.450
 here in the nasa glove compartment and digital postage 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.259

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.300
 automatically 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.559
 the rear camera 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:17.739
 to view the capital and image the accounts then timid 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.519
 I have dvds, neither is it possible nor will I demonstrate why 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.599
 everybody already knows the Tupi language 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.500
 this is from there presented among multimedia steals perfect finish 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:34.659
 all the buttons here has been the normal operation of the car 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.839
 which states that nothing 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:37.539
 the originality
