00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
but I'll say it one more time I'll take

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.450 
but I'll say it one more time I'll take
full<00:02:20.090> responsibility<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:21.170> think<00:02:22.070> you

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460

shouldn't<00:02:23.020> because<00:02:24.020> I<00:02:24.050> think<00:02:24.650> there<00:02:24.770> are

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
shouldn't because I think there are
