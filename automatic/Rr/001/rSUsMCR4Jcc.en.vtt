00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.589
 Here is again the technical of 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.940
 youtube who does not like himself 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.160
 to expand a bird 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.469
 I have a nice one for him today 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.849
 product and where is that to buy there 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:18.330
 I show you now only times the 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.090
 You can buy trend birds house for 14 euro 90 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.810
 +3 eur 49 shipping costs on Amazon 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.850
 to order 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.010
 the link to context and the video 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.240
 click on it comes directly to Amazon 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.029
 the link should not work 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.600
 can feel free to post in comments to 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:39.180
 and so the bird house is delivered and 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:42.320
 this I will unpack times now and 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.270
 That's how it looks from the birdhouse 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:55.680
 at the same time only from names times here one 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:59.100
 bit from the back side 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.739
 We're actually working on that 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.020
 okay not perfect but not either 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.549
 bad sometimes is a little something 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.950
 been stuck wrong so here this time 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.360
 hole where the club is supposed to see you 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:22.320
 little son is her wood how do you take 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:25.610
 the training does not do anything you can the door 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.610
 this too 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.850
 so solution small house should stop 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.440
 but a bit crooked can not 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.800
 correct, however, that if nobility is 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.130
 but just so stuck on it point because that 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.290
 glued here behind 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.610
 but otherwise is of optician 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.450
 actually top times we look at it 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.960
 roof on 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:56.820
 so so ok nothing to complain about here 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.650
 what does that look like ? 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:10.170
 plaintiff but bothers you happy 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:14.010
 here a bit of windows and 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:22.320
 completion back 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:25.470
 which then looks again when 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.300
 so flowers and here you can 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.390
 because the bird has built his nest and 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.390
 Once again you can pull this out 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.670
 so high and then you can do it here 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.870
 Vacuum a little in the bird house 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.870
 and clean up 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:48.590
 All these are just such an aspiration 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.480
 stabilization stability 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.540
 that would have the version in the middle 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.230
 but can look over it 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.870
 away the other side 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.450
 it's the same with him 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:08.340
 drawn 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:11.400
 on the whole nice birdhouse what 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.690
 We then hang on tree in data 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.230
 You could actually go somewhere 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:22.500
 put it down and we can search for something like that 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:24.870
 I then only miss the product in such a way 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.629
 just 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.239
 just as a comparison that's mine 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:43.310
 self-built bird house that one 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:43.310
 a little bit bigger at the singing 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.950
 Here it is once the little one look at you 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.799
 time to my sour cherry tree 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:00.750
 made and I think that's not right 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:02.579
 great, I hope that there 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.180
 now no idea perhaps 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:09.200
 winter or next spring 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:12.390
 one precedes and many little birds 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:16.500
 horrified that was again in between 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.340
 from youtube then say goodbye 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.530
 next time 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.970
 Who is interested in the product? 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.389
 link to find your text minutes 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.979
 Video 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.240
 because it just comes on the 13th 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:28.220
 and if he subscribes to me now 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.220
 do not miss another great video
