00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:08.610
 hello everybody here my surfing this and me 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.620
 I'll show you one now 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:16.760
 very cool feature you discovered 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:19.650
 Last night when I was watching 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.359
 useful youtube videos using 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.949
 bild application on windows 8 then 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.740
 you can see install the application 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:35.070
 official bild 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:38.430
 he shows here all seven of them 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.660
 people can take a seventh 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:47.899
 example here and have the possibility of 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.899
 watch the extreme of these find 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:59.760
 but I want to show here to not have 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:03.149
 problem is this functionality here 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:09.060
 people pull charles on devices or 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:12.360
 devices in English here called xbox 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.350
 because they have this option because my xbox 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.080
 is connected with the xbox connected in that 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.580
 moment he appeared here apply 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:28.159
 here what will happen he will pick up 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:31.700
 this video that is going on and going 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.700
 download as xbox 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.520
 takes a little while he's making the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.770
 connection 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.160
 I left the world is in the same taco 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:52.020
 but as you can see the video is 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:54.420
 running on the xbox and I started the whole 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.460
 process from windows 8 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.960
 I'm using a software but could 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.820
 be made from a laptop or 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.380
 desktop any device 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.390
 running windows 8 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.010
 You'll be able to do this kind of 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.480
 interaction 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:12.990
 then this is the kind of integration the 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.910
 windows 8 lets us make you 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.840
 you can create applications that have this type 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.900
 of interaction 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.940
 this is not something free you do not have 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.700
 then programming your application has 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.550
 have the programming required to 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.650
 dealing with devices for power charles 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.960
 download content 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.610
 but you can transfer the content 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.580
 Whatever you want and what they 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.260
 they managed to pass 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.410
 I believe he had not passed 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.630
 something like url of video and talk xbox 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.100
 run this video 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.770
 so I think it's a good feature 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.320
 cool if it was a little video showing 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.470
 a huge dust possibility xbox 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.430
 open to us with windows 8 with this 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:59.280
 new version of xbox all this integration 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.690
 and I hope to see a lot of apps now 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.060
 to do this, do not you 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.810
 imagining for example an application of the 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:10.940
 youtube to windows 8 an application 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:13.860
 from tnonline to podcast apps 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.000
 music applications to a 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.590
 xbox music 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.180
 then have a number of things that 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.980
 You can begin to imagine that take 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.550
 take advantage of this type of 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.390
 thing 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.800
 photo viewing applications and 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.880
 video players or anything else 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:36.120
 In this sense, he expects a well 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.610
 interesting and as you have discovered 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.020
 more cool stuff on windows 8 or all 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.310
 integration we have access to 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.310
 now I'm going to post here
