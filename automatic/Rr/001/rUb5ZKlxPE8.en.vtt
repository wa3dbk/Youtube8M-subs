00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:24.450
 So have a skins for site 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:29.220
 free and any one 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:32.609
 any skins so I think that's 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.100
 is going to be that will help you for you if 

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:38.570
 you want games and skins so 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.929
 you will type on google 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:46.949
 so you're going to type these have what 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:50.489
 is marked the let do you go 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:01:02.579
 on the site so I'm already going on 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:01:09.810
 my office founded so that's it 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:10.590
 makes points like this coconut so as soon as 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.180
 you are there 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:20.910
 it's going to show you complaining full of 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:23.550
 skins so skins marie-aude and 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.190
 pretty what is not everything 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.290
 which ones if you want a skin 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.000
 so there you can go in the lay a 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.490
 more but if you hamburg to 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.150
 Downstairs there's going to be like spins have 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.640
 of more than 7000 pages so if you 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.350
 want what are you reducing for example 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:48.590
 so you choose month by year that I 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:48.590
 I'll take it to the east 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:57.230
 yeah okay so we'll melt to 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.440
 saving that one a little bit 2002 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:04.790
 okay are you going towards 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.590
 your personal or slipping on your 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:18.620
 office 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:21.620
 So expect this you put it on 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.430
 your office of excesses suffered me but 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.950
 all here he is put there the same name and 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.690
 where rugby renamed it ever so 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.200
 secret is not yet if you 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.200
 know by heart 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.840
 we have to minecraft 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.010
 excuse me for this noise 1 so as soon as 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:48.230
 you are especially noticed your name a 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:50.209
 day you will mark that no 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.080
 pushes you to do what I already think 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.690
 that you already have an idea 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:59.239
 so you have to put the right ones right 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.820
 letters the right capitals and the 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:05.709
 tiny do not fool yourself 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:09.190
 when did you m sila the blue guy 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.190
 the blue man 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.460
 so you 're full 1 so far it's okay 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.110
 in fact you say that because he did 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:28.380
 it's super simple this tutorial I hope 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:31.500
 that he helped you point s kim and so he 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.270
 there are plenty of more than 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.850
 2000 and again since that's the double 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.220
 even at home how much in a homeland 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.650
 in this case there are more than 20 so he 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:46.280
 must be more than 1 million I 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.280
 think way of talking so you wait 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.590
 I still have my texture pack 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.220
 so I 'll put my texture pack 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:02.320
 in the description so and on 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:04.800
 minecraft point fr to 300 that I am surprised 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.800
 in the description 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:24.740
 so that's so you're going to go in 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:24.740
 solo in mime dance or no example here 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:33.210
 you wait wait 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:39.030
 here we go and wait for the map to load 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:42.450
 m little bit we 'll wait a little 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.790
 little do we go life so you are already 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.430
 realized that already you see my 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:53.040
 short to mama there is not the hand of 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:56.669
 steve so the usual characters the 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.290
 characters by default or does them so 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.260
 I do not know if it's that touch 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:10.380
 so inventory and look at my 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:11.360
 character 1 my skin earlier so your 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.620
 and that lag 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:18.960
 sabeg finally brief all all that 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.600
 I could have told you is that you 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.460
 just have to drag the skin that you 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.990
 do not want to click on two shot 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.160
 Swiss do not know where the master train of 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:36.030
 run at home what are you next 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:38.720
 can also put several in 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:42.479
 line on servers it works too 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:46.490
 if you play online so on a 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:46.490
 server you're going to have it anyway 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:53.419
 so I hope this video will have you 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.700
 I'll tell you very soon for 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.930
 new videos 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.750
 the next video I think that's 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.940
 would that be how to make a pretty 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.960
 building in less than two seconds at 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:10.130
 minus two times in less than two so 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.600
 easy enough fast so I had said 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.430
 in my old videos but I would have 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.770
 I would have liked to start with that first 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.419
 you can tell your friends 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:21.260
 that they further asserted that they 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:23.510
 are buses that are beginners iqu 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:27.320
 proof there it was my old skins and the 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.729
 launch the skin of my friend so I you 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.680
 say very soon for next 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:32.680
