00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.300
 I will recommend it to you an extreme 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.550
 to take vehicle from the street and it 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.500
 to park a new garage because when carrying 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.239
 will you lose a vehicle and am 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.430
 best it is but if these vehicles 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.530
 worthless you have the vehicle 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.730
 same your garage then turned off 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.800

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.870
 grab a fan directly around the level 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.969
 how you do that should be 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.440
 Chancery one shoots pasta or shipyard 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.480
 just a few grenades the air 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.760
 Do you have a search star then 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.070
 just commit suicide over that 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.780
 menu why the whole thing so easy 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.760
 the vehicle with which you just from the 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.230
 garage has been driven out by the police 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.239

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.799
 Now get involved in your garage 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.990
 Any vehicle that does not matter 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.580

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.320
 In it you push briefly two times 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.360
 asking if he really is out 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.119
