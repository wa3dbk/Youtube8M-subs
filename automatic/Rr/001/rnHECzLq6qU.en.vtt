00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.400
 Hello and welcome to 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.250
 another trick, however, around the 2 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.869
 Today she goes on happily and that 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.800
 there was still a to do list and me 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:29.050
 believe they have it was windschutz 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.490
 how so few have asked 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.020
 one in hamm after the dragon room 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.730
 asked one of them have water 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.510
 drank asked because the invisible and 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.130
 not more than that 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.680
 Excuse me 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:44.370
 The problem is that the quote is two clans 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.109
 is would not the Bank was not in it 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.879
 and the dragon is actually in there 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.710
 But that can be all that sounds 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.750
 complicated to send it all 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.219
 but it is very easy I have it 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.899
 that is how it is made as it is for me 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:01.870
 is and that is not really 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:05.110
 great effort now there on that 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.570
 archives from others here are on the one hand 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.750
 shows on the one hand like wap coordinates 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.920
 once what has to go in the partner 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.170
 and a matter of no sand 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.210
 storyteller that's actually right 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.460
 unpretentious what we are doing now 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.990
 take our client and around the peg 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.150
 folders go in the eco also go the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.590
 copy files and write about it 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.000
 yes you have her bag but I have 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.000
 she was beautiful baku in here 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.430
 Normally the birth took hold 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.200
 wrapped dragon in the shortwave 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.580
 Dragon room really unpacked and me 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.080
 That's what the Athenians wanted so much 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.780
 around with so they have simple 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.730
 then you go to the index file 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.910
 open it with notepad goes into that 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:49.060
 last place write patch 2 power 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:52.090
 a star makes a star with that 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.060
 then we can look like this 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.300
 Let's close this clancett back 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.830
 already finished 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.110
 so now you have dragon room 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.360
 and could become two of the dragon now 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.430
 and fox the skills, however, and the 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:13.080
 no damage was and that one 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:22.770
 jurisdictional siller connect connect 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:24.930
 to the server game local germany the mine 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.550
 settings aloha the thieves work here 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.230
 with net on we'll see each other even better 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.020
 tax is up to you 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.550
 I am now moving to desktop and here 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.490
 It is normally set to the 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.290
 commands for the gm and what music on 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.520
 which run apps is gold to very 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.870
 at the bottom to eg gm volume comes as 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.200
 We are also a quiet and here 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.760
 public rx texts also with nord with 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.930
 So we copy the whole content 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.840
 ctrl and then the gmc is either the 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:03:00.090
 settings el ua make behind this 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.450
 last two times and then add that 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.610
 on 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.830
 so it is down here, let me yet 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.690
 a few frees such a line you 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.959
 Ship is best left free 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.420
 and that's the same thing after this volume 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:16.489
 that its free time and then dragons 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.489
 Setting one to stop that was 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.069
 Let's save that tape for you 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.530
 Chile 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:27.930
 so that's it and honest 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.269
 say the worst though 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.980
 I have ever done but I wanted to 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.930
 relatively simple because I would 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.639
 now occupies parties messing about 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.209
 would let so many in some 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.349
 error is coming I just wanted that 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:45.299
 Who did I think I'll do? 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:47.040
 times so delete the files that need 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.329
 we no longer but soon the ev 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.489
 data so you know where I go 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:54.060
 you have to port you have to see 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:56.280
 just two could see just two 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.680
 hold and once group 2 the 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.510
 sections where the tree is the boss room 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.980
 and who could see two are the same 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:14.449
 did the people say that I noticed 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:14.449
 like so then we can log 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:37.620
 and then , of course , I demonstrated that 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:41.120
 also like as long as the summer needs 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.120
 so smart 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:05:01.760
 that 's twice once i was thank you and 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.760
 then we lay down 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.660
 then let's have a look 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.520
 it would have now a fox passing up 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.900
 at least for me I have it 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:22.070
 previously some dj compiled 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:25.070
 So let's try the first 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.070
 optional cards 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:52.250
 / 24 11 27 and duck 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:55.610
 in slam record 2 and thought ahead 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:59.240
 we can be two so with it 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.160
 does the grotte 2 ever and 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.030
 if that works then it works 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:07.190
 and the revenge room it was talks 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.900
 again putting millimeter and jaffÃ© 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.150
 There I am now fix 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.890
 Invisible because the monsters are coming soon 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.480
 The Dragon Tree let everyone attack 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.430
 music style up here, etc 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.420
 and we can do it like once again to 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.440
 kites call here 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.490
 although no I prefer to do that in 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:32.210
 the city because I hear what I show 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:33.470
 namely good but make it for the first 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.130
 it does not matter 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:40.550
 and although the dragon attacks faith only 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.370
 if you attack him so difficult he 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.870
 comes already ran to you 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.770
 By the way, the kite id is calling me 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.770
 again down in it 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.810
 the three that namely he is now 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.950
 here 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.720
 but as I said , I do not touch 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.139
 which not now attack the 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.860
 example 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:03.960
 yes, well I do the image from 1 to 4 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:07.849
 I'll set his life short and that 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:09.840
 now and he attacks 

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:10.669
 yes that was it already 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.479
 again 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:14.129
 and i hope i could give you one 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:17.819
 Little help with the dragon 

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:20.400
 and let thumb up there would be if 

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:23.939
 it could therefore be down 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:26.159
 there is a little bit of june for that 

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:28.199
 have done essential help sting 

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:31.279
 to dispose of the money and then until the 

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:31.279
 next time already look
