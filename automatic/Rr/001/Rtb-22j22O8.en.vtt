00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.700 
amount of damage so after all that fun
stuff<00:01:41.119> basically<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.360> can<00:01:42.810> go<00:01:43.200> for<00:01:43.470> rocks

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
stuff basically I can go for rocks

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.490 
stuff basically I can go for rocks
expecting<00:01:44.399> him<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.640> sort<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.060> out<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.960> guess<00:01:46.380> I

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
expecting him to sort you out I guess I

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.810 
expecting him to sort you out I guess I
could<00:01:46.649> do<00:01:46.740> some<00:01:46.920> other<00:01:47.040> stuff<00:01:47.159> maybe<00:01:47.579> like

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
could do some other stuff maybe like

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.460 
could do some other stuff maybe like
setup<00:01:48.119> screens<00:01:48.479> or<00:01:48.600> something<00:01:48.869> or<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.320> could

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
setup screens or something or I could

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.780 
setup screens or something or I could
just<00:01:49.500> predict<00:01:49.860> him<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.070> go<00:01:50.159> for<00:01:50.310> another<00:01:50.490> flare

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
just predict him to go for another flare

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.100 
just predict him to go for another flare
blitz<00:01:50.939> maybe<00:01:51.270> try<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.659> not<00:01:51.750> like<00:01:51.840> me<00:01:51.930> Yelp

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
blitz maybe try and not like me Yelp

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.480 
blitz maybe try and not like me Yelp
somehow<00:01:52.439> maybe<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> minimum<00:01:53.250> damage

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
somehow maybe that is a minimum damage

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.929 
somehow maybe that is a minimum damage
and<00:01:54.439> I<00:01:55.439> don't<00:01:55.740> know<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.130> go<00:01:56.250> from<00:01:56.399> there<00:01:56.579> so

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
the Vegas like it's actually rendering a

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.660 
the Vegas like it's actually rendering a
lot<00:02:27.720> faster<00:02:28.319> now<00:02:28.380> I<00:02:28.800> haven't<00:02:29.280> changed<00:02:29.430> with

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
lot faster now I haven't changed with

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.520 
lot faster now I haven't changed with
you<00:02:29.760> know<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.030> RAM<00:02:30.209> preview<00:02:30.450> or<00:02:30.690> anything<00:02:30.870> but

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
you know the RAM preview or anything but

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.500 
you know the RAM preview or anything but
Vegas<00:02:32.040> like<00:02:32.310> when<00:02:32.489> I'm<00:02:32.610> playing<00:02:32.640> back<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.180> video

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
and I'm recording it is very slow so I

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.009 
and I'm recording it is very slow so I
can<00:02:37.260> actually<00:02:37.730> like<00:02:38.730> it's<00:02:39.299> showing<00:02:39.690> me<00:02:39.810> the

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
can actually like it's showing me the

I'm being serious or maybe like a 1
frame<00:02:46.709> per<00:02:46.739> second<00:02:47.220> it's<00:02:47.549> terrible<00:02:48.120> but

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
frame per second it's terrible but

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.800 
frame per second it's terrible but

I<00:05:28.320> actually<00:05:28.830> ended<00:05:29.250> up<00:05:29.370> dying<00:05:29.700> which<00:05:30.660> is<00:05:30.780> you

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
I actually ended up dying which is you

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.390 
I actually ended up dying which is you
know<00:05:31.020> not<00:05:31.169> the<00:05:31.349> best<00:05:31.680> thing<00:05:32.160> in<00:05:32.280> the<00:05:32.370> world

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
know not the best thing in the world

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.700 
know not the best thing in the world
especially<00:05:32.880> since<00:05:33.570> I<00:05:33.780> wish<00:05:34.139> that<00:05:34.380> thing<00:05:34.560> got

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
especially since I wish that thing got

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.400 
especially since I wish that thing got
more<00:05:34.770> recoil<00:05:35.430> than<00:05:35.580> it<00:05:35.760> actually<00:05:35.910> did<00:05:36.410> which

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
more recoil than it actually did which

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.629 
more recoil than it actually did which
means<00:05:37.650> that<00:05:37.830> now<00:05:38.010> I'm<00:05:38.220> gonna<00:05:38.340> have<00:05:38.490> to<00:05:38.580> you

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:45.599 
although at this point I didn't really

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:47.420 
although at this point I didn't really
even<00:05:45.870> remember<00:05:46.020> what<00:05:46.500> his<00:05:46.590> last<00:05:46.740> Pokemon<00:05:47.280> was
