surface<00:02:34.090> like<00:02:34.300> a<00:02:34.450> plate<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.820> then<00:02:36.820> we'll

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
surface like a plate and then we'll

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.130 
surface like a plate and then we'll
cover<00:02:38.260> that<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.880> just<00:02:39.880> let<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.300> rise<00:02:40.480> the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
other way to do it is to take the dough

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.850 
other way to do it is to take the dough
on<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.710> non<00:02:45.670> floured<00:02:46.360> surface<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:47.620> want<00:02:47.740> a

the dough is grabbing on the counter and

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.759 
the dough is grabbing on the counter and
forming<00:04:00.019> a<00:04:00.139> ball<00:04:00.319> virtually<00:04:01.219> on<00:04:01.370> its<00:04:01.579> own<00:04:02.769> make
