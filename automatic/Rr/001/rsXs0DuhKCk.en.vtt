just<00:04:57.050> kidding<00:04:57.369> nature<00:04:58.369> power<00:04:58.580> turns<00:04:58.819> into

00:04:59.019 --> 00:04:59.029 
just kidding nature power turns into

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:01.299 
just kidding nature power turns into
earthquake<00:04:59.539> and<00:04:59.749> wifis<00:05:00.169> for<00:05:00.889> those<00:05:01.009> of<00:05:01.219> you

00:05:01.299 --> 00:05:01.309 
earthquake and wifis for those of you

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:02.709 
earthquake and wifis for those of you
that<00:05:01.430> don't<00:05:01.610> know<00:05:01.759> i<00:05:01.909> don't<00:05:02.119> think<00:05:02.419> there<00:05:02.629> is

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:02.719 
that don't know i don't think there is

anybody<00:05:02.990> that<00:05:03.319> doesn't<00:05:03.529> know<00:05:03.770> that<00:05:04.039> but<00:05:04.309> yeah

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
anybody that doesn't know that but yeah

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.309 
anybody that doesn't know that but yeah
so<00:05:04.849> you<00:05:04.909> can<00:05:05.089> put<00:05:05.240> earthquake<00:05:05.689> on<00:05:05.779> shift<00:05:06.110> creep

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:06.319 
so you can put earthquake on shift creep

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:08.200 
so you can put earthquake on shift creep
and<00:05:06.529> put<00:05:06.649> earthquake<00:05:06.979> on<00:05:07.099> this<00:05:07.399> so<00:05:08.029> it's

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
and put earthquake on this so it's

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.269 
and put earthquake on this so it's
pretty<00:05:08.419> funny<00:05:08.719> actually<00:05:08.930> since<00:05:09.649> it<00:05:09.800> is<00:05:09.919> i<00:05:10.129> was
