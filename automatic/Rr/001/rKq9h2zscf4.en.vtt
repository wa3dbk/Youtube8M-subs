00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:05.229
 good 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.840
 I'm not going to teach you some players 

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:09.860
 Chess 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:13.099
 first increase the pastor's 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.969
 this is for good white have 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.969
 to move the 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.580
 two or one almost fig tree 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.670
 well they have to obviously have in 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.910
 mind that nothing pawn move 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.600
 let him free the king 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.700
 that is , everything must be covered 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.920
 that obviously do not attack this point 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.620
 this pawn 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.090
 do not move it then suppose that 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:46.000
 They take out their horse they do not affect anything 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.000
 we draw our end 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:53.350
 suppose they climb their pawn 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:56.370
 what are they playing on this side 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:00.020
 and us what we have to do to 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.110
 take out our queen 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.000
 and take out our queen our bishop for 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.810
 here so that they can attack this 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.740
 point 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:15.010
 and checkmate the king and suppose 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.620
 that here they take this 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.890
 and good and either with our well with 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.160
 our queen we are going to do here 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.160
 okay 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:32.380
 [Music] 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.000
 and that is the pastor 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.050
 now 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.530
 the shepherd 2 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.530
 and it is exactly the same only that 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:52.210
 in the position of the queen is to change 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.759
 we take out if they want the bishop first 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.350
 [Music] 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.299
 pastor 2 the bishop is regularly removed 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.740
 because it reaches to take out the queen until 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.790
 here 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.950
 regularly all raise the pawn and not 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.530
 we want them to do we do not want to be 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.030
 scare of nothing 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.030
 So let 's say 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.030
 his kingdom is missing 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.280
 we'll see 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.280
 up here 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:31.690
 and let's say he comes back in the queen 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.820
 and I ask for an apology because a man of 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.620
 well you have removed the queen sir no longer 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.520
 I am the pastor's because then 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:43.110
 would have an exit in the king ok and good 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.830
 and here it is again the pastor's 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:50.209
 and already with the queen 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.209
 [Music] 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.590
 You can also make a pastor with a 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.590
 horse 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.099
 you would be staying like this we take our 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.809
 [Music] 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.320
 we take our queen 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:16.840
 suppose they take out their horse 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.840
 we lower our horse 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.010
 let's go every song 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.850
 we climb the horse 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.750
 and as you see the horse is attacking this 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:33.730
 point and up is attacking 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.730
 then suppose that 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.890
 [Music] 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.890
 here 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:54.510
 this there is also another 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.020
 that it's called 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.570
 I, the 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.410
 I have not seen this on the internet, I think 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.410
 that I discovered 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.630
 and I call her the temptress 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.760
 this 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.170
 [Music] 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.170
 they must lift this 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.850
 suppose they have the key piece is 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.280
 that to apply this play that the 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.840
 I'm seeing is that forces have to 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.840
 first take out this one 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:35.410
 and here they are 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.410
 so that the queen leaves 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:42.580
 they apply check and obviously the only thing that 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.580
 can do is this 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.640
 what can the worst do then 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.740
 here I recommend you to do fast 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.889
 this move so that you do not 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.469
 opponent not the a-15 much 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:58.889
 of henna and her queen and upload her bishop 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:05:02.400
 here 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:05.550
 the other the other opponent will think 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.220
 what did you lose? 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.400
 you lost your queen's attention because 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:15.449
 the bees that they eat it but to 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.590
 point that they eat it you eat 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:20.830
 and this material 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.830
 [Music] 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:29.340
 there is also another that this is not very very 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.790
 common 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.600
 but for those who can not play 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:38.490
 again your great you're fine 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.930
 go up this 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.930
 they take out their queen 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:47.020
 and obviously 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.389
 he does not know how to play what he's going to eat here 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.520
 very very few chances that 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:55.690
 do that and well 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.690
 and you can eat 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:02.150
 okay 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.850
 and that is called the so much because it's very 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.480
 silly win so do not notice the 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.480
 opponent 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:12.520
 there is also another 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.160
 which is similar to the one that had already 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:20.500
 taught like this we were 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.500
 the point is to take out is 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:27.940
 us that this let's say we take out 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:30.960
 our horse 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:36.110
 and this 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.110
 this pawn and they are going to upload this piece 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.210
 and so we do 

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:46.680
 the check of the madman 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.940
 you can know well those are all 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.210
 the plays until now 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.380
 I know others but they are longer and 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:57.270
 good 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.270
 but they like and comment
