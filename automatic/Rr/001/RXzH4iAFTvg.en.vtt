00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.540
 is an experiment that was made in Japan 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.880
 we are in the early evening ditek newspaper shows this extraordinary invention 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.599
 a house completely built in wood capable of withstanding the 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.480
 simulation is more powerful earthquake that occurred in Japan 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.480
 in the modern era 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:33.399
 how can you see the house not just your hands 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.980
 nobody amazes 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.370
 but how did a wooden house withstand such a powerful earthquake e 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.350
 what is the technology behind these panels that I can replace 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.320
 bricks that reinforced concrete and what it is that makes them 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.670
 so resistant and look at this and the realization the proven proof 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.370
 that this new philosophy this new conception of building in a manner 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.250
 completely ecological is a reality here has not only been built at home 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.920
 a hotel of various levels upright 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.700
 all made only of wood panels 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.610
 b the extraordinary strength of these panels has been demonstrated by another 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.610
 experiment 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.460
 this time the body 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.500
 a room full of furniture and furnishings is set a 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.700
 fire 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.110
 statistics tell us that 95% of birds develop inside 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.320
 of applications for usually trivial reasons 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.320
 the classic domestic accidents 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.900
 and we meet mario ceccotti of the cnr who served 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.470
 all reality action and even if but the design of these panels but 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.430
 meanwhile he had a question but that they were part of the Japanese abandonment, given that it is 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.439
 a small town in the Trentino mountains 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:09.489
 an earthquake-proof house had been built + a durable and compact GSM camera 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.299
 but I don't think it can replace the supporting wall of a ten-story house 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:18.630
 no in fact the shoulder specter we say revolutionary propo what 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.940
 in the whole the important item in adjacent rooms where in the room 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.590
 central there was 1000 degrees in centigrade station there are exceeded 20 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.450
 degrees the fire remained liquid isolated the tg of the fire in a real case 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.870
 they would have plenty of time to intervene 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.659
 the flames have come out of the window but I am no longer paid at the al 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.569
 the upper floor is a solarium the velino 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.749
 the heart sang for hours and hours
