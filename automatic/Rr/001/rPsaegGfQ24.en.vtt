actually<00:01:45.000> hurts<00:01:45.240> people<00:01:45.659> if<00:01:45.840> you're<00:01:45.990> near

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
them again you can also be falling down

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.270 
them again you can also be falling down
to<00:01:48.840> perform<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.530> think<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.799> need<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.040> be<00:01:50.159> at

to perform this I think I need to be at

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.149 
to perform this I think I need to be at
a<00:01:50.310> higher<00:01:50.960> place<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.140> do<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.950> could

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
a higher place to do that so I could

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.219 
a higher place to do that so I could
just<00:01:53.310> be<00:01:53.430> falling<00:01:53.820> down<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.299> XO<00:01:54.780> slammed<00:01:55.049> down

side to side like

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.350 
side to side like
that<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:15.020> way<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.430> XO<00:02:16.430> dodge<00:02:16.640> forward<00:02:17.180> is

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
that and the way to XO dodge forward is

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.000 
that and the way to XO dodge forward is
you<00:02:17.480> have<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.750> be<00:02:17.840> airborne<00:02:18.170> like<00:02:18.440> I<00:02:18.590> said<00:02:18.830> you

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
you have to be airborne like I said you

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.920 
you have to be airborne like I said you
can't<00:02:19.190> do<00:02:19.310> it<00:02:19.430> on<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:19.610> ground<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:20.240> you<00:02:20.780> can

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
can't do it on the ground so you can

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.960 
can't do it on the ground so you can
jump<00:02:21.200> up<00:02:21.320> once<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:21.890> do<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.160> or<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:22.520> can<00:02:22.670> boost

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
jump up once and do it or you can boost

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.780 
jump up once and do it or you can boost
jump<00:02:23.300> or<00:02:23.630> sorry<00:02:24.320> XO<00:02:24.680> jump<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.160> then<00:02:25.220> XO<00:02:25.610> dodge

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
jump or sorry XO jump and then XO dodge

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.760 
jump or sorry XO jump and then XO dodge
forward<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:26.600> there's<00:02:27.500> some<00:02:27.650> nice

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
forward and there's some nice

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.010 
forward and there's some nice
combinations<00:02:28.370> like<00:02:28.460> I<00:02:28.640> said<00:02:28.880> you<00:02:29.060> can<00:02:29.090> XO<00:02:29.690> jump

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
combinations like I said you can XO jump

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.370 
combinations like I said you can XO jump

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
to XO dodge to XO slam and that's an

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.290 
to XO dodge to XO slam and that's an
interesting<00:02:33.740> combo<00:02:34.130> but<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:34.820> can't<00:02:35.060> just

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
interesting combo but you can't just

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.970 
interesting combo but you can't just
spam<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.660> dodge<00:02:36.080> that's<00:02:36.560> something<00:02:36.950> that

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.980 
trying to spam it here you can't do it
if<00:02:40.880> you<00:02:41.000> haven't<00:02:41.300> done<00:02:41.360> anything<00:02:41.420> in<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.840> while

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
actually it didn't work that time let's

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.400 
actually it didn't work that time let's
see<00:02:46.460> let's<00:02:46.730> wait<00:02:46.910> a<00:02:46.940> second<00:02:47.360> left<00:02:47.990> and<00:02:48.320> then

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
see let's wait a second left and then

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.610 
see let's wait a second left and then
right<00:02:48.460> kind<00:02:49.460> of<00:02:49.610> but<00:02:50.020> some<00:02:51.020> for<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.320> most<00:02:51.500> part

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
right kind of but some for the most part

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.650 
right kind of but some for the most part
it<00:02:51.800> limits<00:02:52.130> you<00:02:52.310> on<00:02:52.490> just<00:02:52.700> going<00:02:52.970> crazy<00:02:53.180> all

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
it limits you on just going crazy all

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.930 
it limits you on just going crazy all
over<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:54.020> place<00:02:54.230> but<00:02:54.530> that's<00:02:55.160> a<00:02:55.280> nice<00:02:55.400> combo

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
over the place but that's a nice combo

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.290 
over the place but that's a nice combo
and<00:02:56.710> it's<00:02:57.710> it's<00:02:58.070> really<00:02:58.220> just<00:02:58.610> important<00:02:59.210> to

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
and it's it's really just important to

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.120 
and it's it's really just important to
chain<00:02:59.870> these<00:03:00.020> together<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:00.500> something<00:03:01.010> else

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
chain these together and something else

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.190 
chain these together and something else
to<00:03:01.640> note<00:03:01.880> that's<00:03:02.090> very<00:03:02.450> important<00:03:02.990> I<00:03:03.050> don't

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
to note that's very important I don't

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.110 
to note that's very important I don't
think<00:03:03.380> a<00:03:03.440> lot<00:03:03.560> of<00:03:03.590> people<00:03:03.680> know<00:03:04.010> this<00:03:04.040> is<00:03:04.460> that

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
you know detection and it's by using a

suppressor<00:03:50.780> on<00:03:51.170> so<00:03:51.680> every<00:03:52.370> time<00:03:52.400> I<00:03:52.580> do<00:03:52.730> an<00:03:53.030> EXO

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
suppressor on so every time I do an EXO

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.630
