00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.040
 the jac want to draw attention in the streets 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.849
 with stickers all over the 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.309
 bodywork 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.940
 the electric model is to see parades through 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.940
 St Paul's Streets 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.210
 This is a green version of the 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.279
 known sedan j3 turin 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.109
 the model was shown last October 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.390
 during the car show 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.920
 We spent a week with the car that has 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.250
 electric motor powered by batteries 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.530
 of lithium are 42 kilometers of power 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:44.309
 about fifty-seven horses and 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:46.140
 autonomy of up to 170 kilometers to 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.820
 routine with the electric vehicle is 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.950
 completely different 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.010
 are of loads to be able to 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.870
 run in slow mode on a standard wall outlet. 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.879
 are 12 hours so that the battery is 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.739
 completely full in fast mode 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.730
 aided by a kind of post 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.420
 portable 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.420
 It's six o'clock 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.630
 when starting the only information that 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.270
 if it is that the car is on is a 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.830
 green light with the word network something like 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.260
 ready in Portuguese 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.420
 from there, just put the lever of the 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.560
 change in the drive position and step on the pedal 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.300
 of the accelerator 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.479
 the advantages of an electric car are 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.700
 many the first of them is silence grandmother 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.220
 the only disputed noise is the wheels 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.150
 in contact with the floor of the air conditioning 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.130
 and radio 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.080
 Another positive point is that the torque 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.810
 electric motor is 100% available 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.640
 since when it accelerates although it is not 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.040
 so exciting in terms of 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.800
 the sins are the same 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.900
 from a jim turin gasoline to the steering 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.970
 extremely light even at high 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.800
 that the driver does the 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.690
 wheel does not always reflect on what 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.420
 front wheels are doing the same 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.610
 time the electrical system technology 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.190
 contrasts with the simplicity of the interior 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.899
 the intention of jac is to see in brazil is 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.210
 demonstrate technology in 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.850
 alternatives to propulsion as is 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.399
 strictly equal to j3 petrol turin 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.030
 In theory, if there is a demand, the 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.019
 propose to launch it at any time 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.450
 wants to know everything about the world of 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.850
 car optional car access
