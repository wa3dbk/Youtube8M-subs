00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
and it will open up take a bit of effort

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.149 
and it will open up take a bit of effort
which<00:01:05.549> I'd<00:01:05.729> like<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.080> might<00:01:07.260> think<00:01:07.290> why

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
which I'd like and you might think why

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.130 
which I'd like and you might think why
do<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.520> like<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> lot<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.360> effort<00:01:09.570> when<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.930> have

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
do I like a lot of effort when I have

gloves<00:01:10.439> on<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.180> the<00:01:12.180> main<00:01:12.360> reason<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:13.189> because

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
gloves on so the main reason is because

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.140 
gloves on so the main reason is because
that<00:01:14.400> means<00:01:14.580> it's<00:01:14.790> not<00:01:14.909> going<00:01:15.090> to

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
that means it's not going to

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.330 
that means it's not going to
accidentally<00:01:15.630> open<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.170> your<00:01:16.290> pocket<00:01:16.710> you

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
accidentally open in your pocket you

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.550 
accidentally open in your pocket you
know<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:18.030> button<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.689> bit<00:01:18.840> protruding<00:01:19.409> out

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
know the button is a bit protruding out

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.410 
know the button is a bit protruding out
but<00:01:19.920> it's<00:01:20.070> going<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.220> take<00:01:20.490> some<00:01:20.820> pressure<00:01:21.090> to

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
but it's going to take some pressure to

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.240 
but it's going to take some pressure to
actually<00:01:21.570> open<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:21.990> button<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:22.979> do<00:01:23.100> not

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
actually open that button so you do not

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.399 
actually open that button so you do not
have<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.610> worry<00:01:23.909> about<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:24.780> knife<00:01:24.990> opening

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
have to worry about this knife opening

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.670 
have to worry about this knife opening
in<00:01:25.500> your<00:01:25.619> pocket<00:01:26.040> unless<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.000> like<00:01:27.150> really

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
in your pocket unless you like really

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.530 
in your pocket unless you like really
loosen<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:28.799> knife<00:01:29.520> up<00:01:29.759> because<00:01:30.000> if<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.299> too

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
loosen this knife up because if it's too

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.910 
loosen this knife up because if it's too
stiff<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:31.110> always<00:01:31.229> take<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.500> screw<00:01:31.799> right

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
stiff you can always take a screw right

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.060 
stiff you can always take a screw right
there<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.939> loosen<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.570> up<00:01:33.659> but<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:34.770> it's<00:01:35.040> a

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
there and loosen it up but I like it's a

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.090 
there and loosen it up but I like it's a
bit<00:01:35.250> stiff<00:01:35.610> gives<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.720> pretty<00:01:37.110> nice<00:01:37.409> kick<00:01:37.829> if

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
bit stiff gives a pretty nice kick if

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.149 
bit stiff gives a pretty nice kick if
you<00:01:38.250> see<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:39.049> it<00:01:40.049> gives<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.439> pretty<00:01:40.680> nice<00:01:40.860> kick

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
you see that it gives a pretty nice kick

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.170 
you see that it gives a pretty nice kick
I<00:01:41.369> like<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:43.040> just<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.130> great<00:01:44.460> button<00:01:44.939> lock
