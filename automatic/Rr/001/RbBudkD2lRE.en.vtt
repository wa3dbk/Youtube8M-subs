tracker site first and then after that

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.799 
tracker site first and then after that
the<00:00:35.219> thermal<00:00:35.610> site<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.149> what<00:00:36.450> I'm<00:00:36.540> gonna<00:00:36.630> be

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
the thermal site and what I'm gonna be

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.450 
the thermal site and what I'm gonna be
talking<00:00:37.500> about<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:37.980> most<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.370> time

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
of the two so the tracker site you know

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.709 
of the two so the tracker site you know
it's<00:00:49.289> it's<00:00:49.829> really<00:00:49.950> nice<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.700> do<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.969> do<00:00:51.239> wish<00:00:51.570> it

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.380 
was a little bit wider it is very like
narrow<00:00:55.219> but<00:00:56.219> it's<00:00:56.370> good<00:00:56.579> it's<00:00:56.760> good<00:00:56.910> for<00:00:57.120> close

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
narrow but it's good it's good for close

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.619 
narrow but it's good it's good for close
range<00:00:57.719> definitely<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.620> has<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.579> the<00:01:00.449> yellow

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
range definitely it has the the yellow

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.479 
range definitely it has the the yellow
outline<00:01:00.899> around<00:01:01.230> enemies<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.160> are<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:02.399> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
outline around enemies that are in the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.660 
outline around enemies that are in the
site<00:01:02.730> like<00:01:02.910> an<00:01:03.180> Oracle<00:01:03.979> it's<00:01:04.979> it's<00:01:05.339> not<00:01:05.549> it

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
site like an Oracle it's it's not it

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.160 
site like an Oracle it's it's not it
doesn't<00:01:05.700> zoom<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.240> too<00:01:06.390> much<00:01:06.570> as<00:01:06.780> zooms<00:01:06.990> in

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
doesn't zoom in too much as zooms in

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.950 
doesn't zoom in too much as zooms in
about<00:01:07.380> like<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.710> same<00:01:07.890> level<00:01:08.340> as<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:09.299> red<00:01:09.780> dot

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
about like the same level as the red dot

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.690 
about like the same level as the red dot
sight<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.650> but<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:10.920> do<00:01:11.010> love<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.460> better

know<00:01:23.729> look<00:01:24.000> at<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.299> dot<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.110> everything<00:01:25.500> like

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
know look at the dot and everything like

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.230 
know look at the dot and everything like
that<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.950> try<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.159> aim<00:01:26.369> them<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.729> just<00:01:26.970> think

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.760 
that and try and aim them I just think
this<00:01:27.330> sites<00:01:27.570> really<00:01:27.750> easy<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.200> use<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.650> then

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
this sites really easy to use and then

that<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.070> wouldn't<00:01:50.399> normally<00:01:50.520> see<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.360> it

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
that you wouldn't normally see and it

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.510 
that you wouldn't normally see and it
doesn't<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.259> too<00:01:52.530> much<00:01:52.649> recoil<00:01:53.130> or<00:01:53.310> anything

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
doesn't have too much recoil or anything

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.030 
doesn't have too much recoil or anything
like<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:54.060> switches<00:01:54.390> pretty<00:01:55.320> fast<00:01:55.619> and

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
like that it switches pretty fast and

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.999 
like that it switches pretty fast and
yeah<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.240> tracker<00:01:57.509> site<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:58.049> definitely

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
yeah so the tracker site is definitely

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.499 
yeah so the tracker site is definitely
one<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.159> my<00:01:59.310> favorite<00:01:59.729> sites<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.149> love<00:02:00.390> this

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
one of my favorite sites I love this

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.510 
one of my favorite sites I love this
thing<00:02:00.810> but<00:02:01.619> we<00:02:02.009> are<00:02:02.159> now<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:04.520> thermal

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
thing but we are now on to the thermal

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.749 
thing but we are now on to the thermal
scope<00:02:06.030> thermal<00:02:06.630> hybrid<00:02:06.930> scope<00:02:07.229> something<00:02:07.759> now

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
scope thermal hybrid scope something now

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.190 
scope thermal hybrid scope something now
this<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.119> for<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.360> Isola<00:02:09.599> rifle<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:09.929> know<00:02:09.989> there

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
this is for the Isola rifle I know there

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.869 
this is for the Isola rifle I know there
is<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.319> thermal<00:02:10.770> scope<00:02:11.009> for<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.310> snipers<00:02:11.700> but

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
is a thermal scope for the snipers but

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.839 
is a thermal scope for the snipers but
that<00:02:12.030> doesn't<00:02:12.300> have<00:02:12.420> to

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
that doesn't have to

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.729 
that doesn't have to
now<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.450> thermal<00:02:13.810> scope<00:02:13.930> what<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.260> love<00:02:14.530> about

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
now the thermal scope what I love about

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.520 
now the thermal scope what I love about
it<00:02:14.920> is<00:02:15.069> right<00:02:15.700> here<00:02:15.879> you<00:02:15.939> see<00:02:16.299> it<00:02:16.510> zooms<00:02:16.870> in<00:02:17.109> so

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
it is right here you see it zooms in so

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.190 
it is right here you see it zooms in so
far<00:02:17.859> I<00:02:17.889> do<00:02:18.010> actually<00:02:18.519> get<00:02:18.790> this<00:02:18.999> kill<00:02:19.389> and<00:02:19.689> it

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
far I do actually get this kill and it

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.890 
far I do actually get this kill and it
does<00:02:20.439> have<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:20.680> lot<00:02:20.950> of<00:02:21.069> precision<00:02:21.519> that<00:02:22.329> the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
does have a lot of precision that the

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.500 
does have a lot of precision that the
tracker<00:02:23.200> sight<00:02:23.499> really<00:02:23.650> doesn't<00:02:24.129> have<00:02:24.510> but

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
tracker sight really doesn't have but

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.270 
tracker sight really doesn't have but
the<00:02:25.629> down<00:02:25.810> that's<00:02:26.079> also<00:02:26.349> its<00:02:26.499> downside<00:02:27.010> is<00:02:27.159> the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
the down that's also its downside is the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.770 
the down that's also its downside is the
fact<00:02:27.459> that<00:02:27.519> it<00:02:27.700> zooms<00:02:27.730> in<00:02:28.180> so<00:02:28.389> far<00:02:28.569> you<00:02:28.749> know

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
fact that it zooms in so far you know

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.979 
fact that it zooms in so far you know
when<00:02:28.989> you're<00:02:29.109> using<00:02:29.260> it<00:02:29.530> on<00:02:29.769> an<00:02:30.129> assault<00:02:30.430> rifle

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
when you're using it on an assault rifle

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.149 
when you're using it on an assault rifle
you're<00:02:31.989> gonna<00:02:32.109> be<00:02:32.319> moving<00:02:32.500> around<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:32.950> map<00:02:33.129> a

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
you're gonna be moving around the map a

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.959 
you're gonna be moving around the map a
lot<00:02:33.430> more<00:02:33.760> than<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.889> like<00:02:35.889> a<00:02:35.920> sniper<00:02:36.219> would<00:02:36.639> and

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:36.969 
lot more than a like a sniper would and

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:39.119 
lot more than a like a sniper would and
so<00:02:37.299> you<00:02:38.170> know<00:02:38.290> your<00:02:38.439> sight<00:02:38.620> is<00:02:38.680> gonna<00:02:38.829> be<00:02:38.980> kind

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
so you know your sight is gonna be kind

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.470 
so you know your sight is gonna be kind
of<00:02:39.219> bobbing<00:02:39.519> all<00:02:39.639> over<00:02:39.879> the<00:02:39.969> place<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.329> stuff

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
of bobbing all over the place and stuff

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.720 
of bobbing all over the place and stuff
but<00:02:41.469> one<00:02:41.709> thing<00:02:41.859> I<00:02:41.919> do<00:02:41.980> like<00:02:42.219> about<00:02:42.400> the

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
but one thing I do like about the

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.149 
but one thing I do like about the
thermal<00:02:43.209> scope<00:02:43.419> a<00:02:43.540> lot<00:02:43.689> better<00:02:43.900> is<00:02:44.109> well<00:02:44.799> this

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 
thermal scope a lot better is well this

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:46.679 
thermal scope a lot better is well this
can<00:02:45.370> be<00:02:45.489> this<00:02:45.669> can<00:02:45.730> be<00:02:45.909> good<00:02:46.120> for<00:02:46.269> some<00:02:46.419> people

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:46.689 
can be this can be good for some people

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:48.869 
can be this can be good for some people
and<00:02:46.780> bad<00:02:46.870> for<00:02:47.109> other<00:02:47.230> people<00:02:47.590> I<00:02:47.769> love<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.639> fact

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
and bad for other people I love the fact

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.059 
and bad for other people I love the fact
that<00:02:49.269> it<00:02:49.510> is<00:02:49.629> very<00:02:49.659> it's<00:02:50.200> black<00:02:50.469> and<00:02:50.650> white<00:02:50.859> and

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
that it is very it's black and white and

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.309 
that it is very it's black and white and
the<00:02:51.939> players<00:02:52.209> that<00:02:52.419> you<00:02:52.540> see<00:02:52.750> are<00:02:52.870> all<00:02:53.049> white

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
the players that you see are all white

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.140 
the players that you see are all white
so<00:02:53.620> basically<00:02:53.980> everything's<00:02:54.579> kind<00:02:54.819> of<00:02:54.879> a<00:02:54.969> dull

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
so basically everything's kind of a dull

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.629 
so basically everything's kind of a dull
gray<00:02:55.359> color<00:02:55.659> and<00:02:55.810> then<00:02:56.349> only<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.949> enemies<00:02:57.340> are

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
gray color and then only the enemies are

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.280 
gray color and then only the enemies are
white<00:02:57.939> and<00:02:58.209> so<00:02:58.419> you<00:02:58.480> know<00:02:58.750> when<00:02:59.169> you're

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
white and so you know when you're

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.470 
white and so you know when you're
scanning<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.769> map<00:02:59.949> you<00:03:00.189> know<00:03:00.430> if<00:03:00.909> it's<00:03:01.239> white

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
scanning the map you know if it's white

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.689 
scanning the map you know if it's white
it's<00:03:01.719> an<00:03:01.870> enemy<00:03:02.199> and<00:03:02.379> if<00:03:03.069> it's<00:03:03.250> not<00:03:03.400> then

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:03.699 
it's an enemy and if it's not then

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:05.369 
it's an enemy and if it's not then
you're<00:03:03.849> just<00:03:03.939> looking<00:03:04.269> at<00:03:04.449> you<00:03:04.930> know<00:03:05.019> a<00:03:05.079> door

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
you're just looking at you know a door

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:06.929 
you're just looking at you know a door
or<00:03:05.560> something<00:03:05.620> like<00:03:06.040> that<00:03:06.250> it<00:03:06.639> really<00:03:06.699> does

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:06.939 
or something like that it really does

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.000 
or something like that it really does
help<00:03:07.239> you<00:03:07.389> out<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.659> really<00:03:07.900> it's<00:03:08.139> a<00:03:08.260> lot<00:03:08.620> easier

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
help you out it really it's a lot easier

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.550 
help you out it really it's a lot easier
to<00:03:09.129> spot<00:03:09.280> people<00:03:09.639> than<00:03:10.449> the<00:03:10.959> tracker<00:03:11.230> sight

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
to spot people than the tracker sight

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.470 
to spot people than the tracker sight
the<00:03:12.099> tracker<00:03:12.310> sight<00:03:12.579> is<00:03:12.730> definitely<00:03:13.180> easy<00:03:13.299> to

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
the tracker sight is definitely easy to

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.099 
the tracker sight is definitely easy to
spot<00:03:13.689> people<00:03:13.870> but<00:03:14.290> I<00:03:14.549> definitely<00:03:15.549> say<00:03:15.790> like<00:03:16.109> if

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
spot people but I definitely say like if

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.360 
spot people but I definitely say like if
you're<00:03:17.259> going<00:03:17.560> if<00:03:17.799> you<00:03:17.919> want<00:03:18.009> the<00:03:18.159> sight

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
you're going if you want the sight

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.559 
you're going if you want the sight
that's<00:03:18.519> gonna<00:03:18.639> be<00:03:18.849> the<00:03:18.970> easiest<00:03:19.269> to<00:03:19.389> spot

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
that's gonna be the easiest to spot

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.869 
that's gonna be the easiest to spot
people<00:03:19.900> go<00:03:20.139> with<00:03:20.259> the<00:03:20.290> thermal<00:03:20.680> scope<00:03:20.979> just

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
people go with the thermal scope just

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.110 
people go with the thermal scope just
because<00:03:22.269> you<00:03:22.840> know<00:03:23.370> everything<00:03:24.370> is<00:03:24.519> just<00:03:24.549> one

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
because you know everything is just one

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.580 
because you know everything is just one
color<00:03:25.419> and<00:03:25.629> then<00:03:25.750> your<00:03:25.900> enemies<00:03:26.229> are<00:03:26.409> another

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
color and then your enemies are another

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.530 
color and then your enemies are another
color<00:03:26.919> where<00:03:27.220> as<00:03:27.549> on<00:03:27.879> the<00:03:27.970> tracker<00:03:28.209> site

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
color where as on the tracker site

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.059 
color where as on the tracker site
everything<00:03:28.870> is<00:03:29.139> its<00:03:29.290> normal<00:03:29.680> color<00:03:29.799> and

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
everything is its normal color and

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:31.860 
everything is its normal color and
there's<00:03:30.189> just<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.519> orange<00:03:30.759> outline<00:03:31.180> now<00:03:31.689> that

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
there's just the orange outline now that

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.860 
there's just the orange outline now that
may<00:03:31.989> be<00:03:32.049> what<00:03:32.319> you<00:03:32.439> like<00:03:32.470> but<00:03:32.919> personally<00:03:33.400> for

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
may be what you like but personally for

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.740 
may be what you like but personally for
you<00:03:34.870> know<00:03:34.989> if<00:03:35.109> you<00:03:35.400> on<00:03:36.400> ease<00:03:37.000> of<00:03:37.209> visibility

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
you know if you on ease of visibility

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.420 
you know if you on ease of visibility
like<00:03:37.900> trying<00:03:38.169> to<00:03:38.199> see<00:03:38.349> your<00:03:38.470> enemy's<00:03:38.769> thermal

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
like trying to see your enemy's thermal

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.490 
like trying to see your enemy's thermal
scope<00:03:39.609> definitely<00:03:40.180> wins<00:03:40.419> it<00:03:40.629> on<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:41.229> zoom

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
scope definitely wins it on the zoom

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.949 
scope definitely wins it on the zoom
level<00:03:41.829> you<00:03:42.159> know<00:03:42.280> you<00:03:42.340> could<00:03:42.790> be<00:03:42.939> going<00:03:43.180> for<00:03:43.569> a

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
level you know you could be going for a

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.059 
level you know you could be going for a
zoom<00:03:44.680> you<00:03:45.400> could<00:03:45.879> want<00:03:46.120> zoom<00:03:46.530> but<00:03:47.530> personally

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
zoom you could want zoom but personally

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.890 
zoom you could want zoom but personally
I<00:03:48.250> would<00:03:48.639> go<00:03:48.759> with<00:03:48.849> the<00:03:48.970> tracker<00:03:49.239> site<00:03:49.599> if<00:03:49.780> you

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
I would go with the tracker site if you

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.780 
I would go with the tracker site if you
don't<00:03:50.169> want<00:03:50.409> it<00:03:50.530> zoomed<00:03:50.769> in<00:03:51.009> a<00:03:51.280> bunch<00:03:51.489> because

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
don't want it zoomed in a bunch because

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.420 
don't want it zoomed in a bunch because
the<00:03:52.599> thermal<00:03:52.989> scope<00:03:53.139> you<00:03:53.470> know<00:03:53.590> it's<00:03:53.919> fun<00:03:54.220> to

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
the thermal scope you know it's fun to

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.369 
the thermal scope you know it's fun to
use<00:03:54.669> and<00:03:55.030> it's<00:03:55.180> definitely<00:03:55.569> zoomed<00:03:55.959> in<00:03:56.139> more

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
use and it's definitely zoomed in more

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.140 
use and it's definitely zoomed in more
and<00:03:56.530> you<00:03:56.919> can<00:03:57.069> get<00:03:57.219> some<00:03:57.370> with<00:03:57.489> accurate<00:03:57.909> shots

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
and you can get some with accurate shots

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.670 
and you can get some with accurate shots
but<00:03:58.389> like<00:03:58.540> if<00:03:58.689> you're<00:03:58.810> moving<00:03:59.259> and<00:03:59.409> if<00:03:59.500> you're

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
but like if you're moving and if you're

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.740 
but like if you're moving and if you're
running<00:03:59.889> gunplay<00:04:00.370> like<00:04:00.609> I<00:04:00.790> am<00:04:00.939> you<00:04:01.419> know<00:04:01.449> it's

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
running gunplay like I am you know it's

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.089 
running gunplay like I am you know it's
really<00:04:02.109> not<00:04:02.229> going<00:04:02.379> to<00:04:02.439> be<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.739> best<00:04:02.889> that

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
really not going to be the best that

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:04.259 
really not going to be the best that
tracker<00:04:03.340> sight<00:04:03.609> it's<00:04:03.699> definitely<00:04:04.090> going<00:04:04.209> to

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
tracker sight it's definitely going to

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:05.670 
tracker sight it's definitely going to
be<00:04:04.389> a<00:04:04.419> better<00:04:04.629> option<00:04:05.079> because<00:04:05.109> it's<00:04:05.530> not

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
be a better option because it's not

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.129 
be a better option because it's not
going<00:04:05.799> to<00:04:05.889> be<00:04:05.979> jiggling<00:04:06.250> around<00:04:06.729> and<00:04:07.479> moving

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
going to be jiggling around and moving

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.289 
going to be jiggling around and moving
around<00:04:08.259> and<00:04:08.709> there's<00:04:09.280> not<00:04:09.400> as<00:04:09.549> much<00:04:09.729> recall<00:04:10.150> or

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
around and there's not as much recall or

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:11.429 
around and there's not as much recall or
anything<00:04:10.539> like<00:04:10.750> that<00:04:10.810> I<00:04:10.989> mean<00:04:11.139> look<00:04:11.289> at<00:04:11.379> that

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 
anything like that I mean look at that

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.170 
anything like that I mean look at that
that's<00:04:11.739> yeah<00:04:12.430> I<00:04:12.459> still<00:04:12.729> killed<00:04:12.969> them<00:04:13.090> but

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
that's yeah I still killed them but

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.999 
that's yeah I still killed them but
there's<00:04:13.389> definitely<00:04:14.079> a<00:04:14.139> lot<00:04:14.259> of<00:04:14.409> recoil<00:04:14.650> not

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:15.009 
there's definitely a lot of recoil not

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:17.849 
there's definitely a lot of recoil not
guys<00:04:15.219> and<00:04:15.579> then<00:04:15.699> as<00:04:15.879> far<00:04:16.479> as<00:04:16.539> the<00:04:16.859> two-second

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
guys and then as far as the two-second

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.349 
guys and then as far as the two-second
like<00:04:18.099> the<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.549> things<00:04:18.729> that<00:04:18.880> you<00:04:18.940> can<00:04:19.090> switch

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
like the the things that you can switch

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.810 
like the the things that you can switch
to<00:04:19.389> by<00:04:19.690> pressing<00:04:20.079> right<00:04:20.620> stick<00:04:20.949> I<00:04:21.130> would

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
to by pressing right stick I would

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.810 
to by pressing right stick I would
definitely<00:04:22.029> yeah<00:04:22.960> I<00:04:23.469> don't<00:04:24.370> know<00:04:24.460> guys<00:04:24.610> I

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
definitely yeah I don't know guys I

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.890 
definitely yeah I don't know guys I
think<00:04:24.849> I<00:04:25.210> would<00:04:25.330> definitely<00:04:25.449> go<00:04:25.779> with<00:04:25.840> the

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
think I would definitely go with the

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.460 
think I would definitely go with the
trackers

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
trackers

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.380 
trackers
again<00:04:26.770> just<00:04:27.010> because<00:04:27.130> you<00:04:27.370> know<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:28.000> thermal

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
again just because you know the thermal

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.180 
again just because you know the thermal
scope<00:04:28.510> does<00:04:28.870> bring<00:04:29.080> up<00:04:29.230> a<00:04:29.320> holographic<00:04:29.950> sight

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
scope does bring up a holographic sight

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.160 
scope does bring up a holographic sight
but<00:04:30.370> once<00:04:30.610> again<00:04:30.790> it<00:04:31.150> is<00:04:31.330> zoomed<00:04:31.600> in<00:04:31.780> quite<00:04:32.050> a

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
but once again it is zoomed in quite a

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.530 
but once again it is zoomed in quite a
bit<00:04:32.410> for<00:04:32.650> me<00:04:32.800> but<00:04:33.790> like<00:04:33.910> right<00:04:34.060> there<00:04:34.300> you<00:04:34.330> know

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
bit for me but like right there you know

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.760 
bit for me but like right there you know
that<00:04:34.570> was<00:04:34.720> a<00:04:34.810> long-range<00:04:35.140> kill<00:04:35.500> and<00:04:35.650> so<00:04:35.740> I

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
that was a long-range kill and so I

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.010 
that was a long-range kill and so I
needed<00:04:36.010> a<00:04:36.160> long-range<00:04:36.550> sight<00:04:36.880> but<00:04:37.420> that<00:04:37.600> the

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
needed a long-range sight but that the

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.720 
needed a long-range sight but that the
tracker<00:04:38.260> sight<00:04:38.590> can<00:04:38.770> still<00:04:39.130> get<00:04:39.310> long<00:04:39.490> range

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
tracker sight can still get long range

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.560 
tracker sight can still get long range
kills<00:04:40.470> so<00:04:41.470> in<00:04:42.310> my<00:04:42.520> general<00:04:42.970> opinion<00:04:43.150> I<00:04:43.510> would

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
kills so in my general opinion I would

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.350 
kills so in my general opinion I would
go<00:04:44.020> with<00:04:44.290> the<00:04:44.590> tracker<00:04:45.520> sight<00:04:45.850> its<00:04:46.060> closer

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
go with the tracker sight its closer

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.250 
go with the tracker sight its closer
range<00:04:46.810> there's<00:04:47.440> less<00:04:47.740> recoil<00:04:48.720> it<00:04:49.720> doesn't<00:04:50.110> it

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
range there's less recoil it doesn't it

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.190 
range there's less recoil it doesn't it
just<00:04:50.440> doesn't<00:04:50.740> feel<00:04:50.800> as<00:04:50.980> bulky<00:04:51.490> and<00:04:51.750> as<00:04:52.750> sniper

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
just doesn't feel as bulky and as sniper

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.170 
just doesn't feel as bulky and as sniper
like<00:04:53.500> but<00:04:54.370> that<00:04:54.400> could<00:04:54.640> be<00:04:54.730> what<00:04:54.880> you're<00:04:55.030> going

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
like but that could be what you're going

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.760 
like but that could be what you're going
for<00:04:55.390> you<00:04:55.480> know<00:04:55.600> right<00:04:55.750> here<00:04:56.020> that<00:04:56.620> was

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
for you know right here that was

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.740 
for you know right here that was
definitely<00:04:57.280> a<00:04:57.310> good<00:04:57.340> kill<00:04:57.700> the<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.390> thermal

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
definitely a good kill the the thermal

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.290 
definitely a good kill the the thermal
scope<00:04:58.840> definitely<00:04:59.640> excels<00:05:00.640> at<00:05:00.850> long<00:05:01.030> range

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
scope definitely excels at long range

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.150 
scope definitely excels at long range
where's<00:05:01.690> the<00:05:01.840> tracker<00:05:02.170> sight<00:05:02.530> excels<00:05:02.950> at

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
where's the tracker sight excels at

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.190 
where's the tracker sight excels at
close<00:05:03.340> range<00:05:03.610> guys<00:05:03.970> but<00:05:04.210> that's<00:05:04.540> all<00:05:04.840> we<00:05:04.990> have

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
close range guys but that's all we have

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.220 
close range guys but that's all we have
today<00:05:05.730> my<00:05:06.730> final<00:05:07.120> opinion<00:05:07.270> my<00:05:07.630> final<00:05:07.960> verdict

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
today my final opinion my final verdict

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:09.510 
today my final opinion my final verdict
would<00:05:08.350> probably<00:05:08.650> be<00:05:08.740> to<00:05:08.860> go<00:05:08.980> for<00:05:09.220> the<00:05:09.280> tracker

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
would probably be to go for the tracker

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.130 
would probably be to go for the tracker
site<00:05:09.880> if<00:05:10.000> you're<00:05:10.090> going<00:05:10.330> for<00:05:10.480> close<00:05:10.660> range<00:05:10.930> and

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
site if you're going for close range and

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.710 
site if you're going for close range and
the<00:05:11.260> thermal<00:05:11.650> scope<00:05:11.920> if<00:05:12.130> you<00:05:12.610> don't<00:05:13.390> mind<00:05:13.570> the

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
the thermal scope if you don't mind the

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.000 
the thermal scope if you don't mind the
recoil<00:05:14.110> and<00:05:14.260> if<00:05:14.380> you're<00:05:14.500> going<00:05:14.680> for<00:05:14.830> longer

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
recoil and if you're going for longer

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.860 
recoil and if you're going for longer
range<00:05:15.190> these<00:05:15.490> sites<00:05:16.090> are<00:05:16.270> both<00:05:16.420> very<00:05:16.630> similar

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
range these sites are both very similar

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.590 
range these sites are both very similar

I love them both that's why I compare

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
I love them both that's why I compare
them<00:05:19.690> just<00:05:19.870> because<00:05:19.960> they're<00:05:20.169> very<00:05:20.350> similar
