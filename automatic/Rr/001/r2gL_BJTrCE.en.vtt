00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
the middle of the deck just like that

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.380 
the middle of the deck just like that
now<00:01:21.960> let's<00:01:22.799> see<00:01:23.009> how<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.820> real<00:01:23.850> speed

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
now let's see how it is in real speed

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.590 
now let's see how it is in real speed
this<00:01:25.380> time<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:26.159> guy<00:01:26.400> would<00:01:26.670> build<00:01:26.880> just<00:01:27.270> like

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
this time the guy would build just like

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.940 
this time the guy would build just like
this<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.920> would<00:01:29.070> look<00:01:29.280> perfectly<00:01:29.909> natural

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
this and it would look perfectly natural

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.249 
this and it would look perfectly natural
the<00:01:31.950> rhythm<00:01:32.250> never<00:01:32.460> broke<00:01:32.820> no<00:01:33.630> change<00:01:34.020> in

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
the rhythm never broke no change in

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.069 
the rhythm never broke no change in
sound<00:01:34.530> or<00:01:34.740> direction<00:01:35.400> every<00:01:36.299> card<00:01:36.600> coming

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
sound or direction every card coming

sound or direction every card coming
from<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.409> top<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> deck<00:01:38.070> or<00:01:38.280> at<00:01:38.400> least<00:01:38.640> so

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
from the top of the deck or at least so

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.870 
from the top of the deck or at least so
it<00:01:39.030> seems<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:40.110> yet<00:01:40.380> let's<00:01:41.100> see<00:01:41.280> what<00:01:41.490> happened
