Susan collective all right well this was

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:32.119 
Susan collective all right well this was
kind<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.720> taking<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.080> step<00:00:31.259> back<00:00:31.470> from<00:00:31.740> World

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129 
kind of taking a step back from World

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.299 
kind of taking a step back from World
War<00:00:32.250> Craft<00:00:32.460> he<00:00:32.610> wasn't<00:00:32.879> playing<00:00:32.970> as<00:00:33.180> much<00:00:33.360> and

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
War Craft he wasn't playing as much and

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.770 
War Craft he wasn't playing as much and
when<00:00:35.309> in<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.879> process<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.269> trying<00:00:36.510> out<00:00:36.660> all

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
when in the process of trying out all

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.689 
when in the process of trying out all
the<00:00:36.930> different<00:00:37.199> ropes<00:00:37.379> for<00:00:37.830> his<00:00:38.100> spot<00:00:38.460> I

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
the different ropes for his spot I

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:40.400 
the different ropes for his spot I
started<00:00:39.210> playing<00:00:39.360> with<00:00:39.540> tenderloin<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.290> I

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
started playing with tenderloin and I

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.660 
started playing with tenderloin and I
just<00:00:40.589> kind<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.739> felt<00:00:40.890> like<00:00:41.070> he<00:00:41.339> was<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> better

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
just kind of felt like he was a better

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.250 
just kind of felt like he was a better
fit<00:00:41.850> for<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.120> team<00:00:42.300> we<00:00:42.690> kind<00:00:43.019> of<00:00:43.050> meshed

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
fit for the team we kind of meshed

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.079 
fit for the team we kind of meshed
better<00:00:43.500> together<00:00:43.800> we<00:00:44.070> just<00:00:44.220> got<00:00:44.339> along<00:00:44.460> better

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:45.089 
better together we just got along better

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:47.689 
better together we just got along better
personally<00:00:45.659> and<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:47.280> just<00:00:47.339> worked

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
personally and it just it just worked

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:49.310 
personally and it just it just worked
out<00:00:47.820> well<00:00:48.030> translated<00:00:48.479> into<00:00:48.839> better<00:00:49.049> gameplay

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
out well translated into better gameplay

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.619 
out well translated into better gameplay
so<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.129> just<00:00:50.430> felt<00:00:50.640> like<00:00:50.729> it<00:00:51.360> was<00:00:51.479> the<00:00:51.510> right

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
so I just felt like it was the right

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.680 
so I just felt like it was the right
move<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.320> make<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.739> team<00:00:52.979> at<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.250> time<00:00:53.690> all

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
move to make the team at this time all

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.600 
move to make the team at this time all
right<00:00:54.839> so<00:00:55.080> do<00:00:55.290> you<00:00:55.440> actually<00:00:55.619> think<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.430> it

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
right so do you actually think that it

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.880 
right so do you actually think that it
was<00:00:56.729> more<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.119> a<00:00:57.180> chemistry<00:00:57.690> issue<00:00:57.960> or<00:00:58.409> did

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
was more of a chemistry issue or did

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.130 
was more of a chemistry issue or did
actually<00:00:59.220> your<00:00:59.729> performance<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.659> past<00:01:00.900> two

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
actually your performance the past two

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.009 
actually your performance the past two
years<00:01:01.409> with<00:01:02.280> struggling<00:01:02.939> and<00:01:03.239> MLG<00:01:03.689> columbus

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
years with struggling and MLG columbus

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.560 
years with struggling and MLG columbus
and<00:01:04.739> then<00:01:04.920> actually<00:01:05.430> not<00:01:05.820> even<00:01:06.060> being<00:01:06.210> invited

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
and then actually not even being invited

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.510 
and then actually not even being invited
to<00:01:06.750> MLG<00:01:07.110> dallas<00:01:07.439> did<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.100> have<00:01:08.280> any<00:01:08.430> effect

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
to MLG dallas did that have any effect

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.359 
to MLG dallas did that have any effect
on<00:01:09.060> your<00:01:09.689> roster<00:01:09.930> change<00:01:10.380> as<00:01:10.560> well<00:01:10.710> well<00:01:11.340> i

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
on your roster change as well well i

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.340 
on your roster change as well well i
think<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.850> has<00:01:12.000> some<00:01:12.450> affect<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.049> but<00:01:13.320> i

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
think it has some affect on it but i

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.530 
think it has some affect on it but i
mean<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.890> thing<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:15.000> knew<00:01:15.119> we<00:01:15.240> could<00:01:15.390> still

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
mean the thing is we knew we could still

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.940 
mean the thing is we knew we could still
do<00:01:15.720> well<00:01:15.869> with<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.140> team<00:01:16.350> i<00:01:16.530> think<00:01:16.680> was<00:01:16.770> more

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
do well with that team i think was more

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.200 
do well with that team i think was more
of<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.130> chemistry<00:01:17.520> thing<00:01:17.760> and<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.090> a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
of a chemistry thing and just a

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.660 
of a chemistry thing and just a
scheduled<00:01:18.600> thing<00:01:18.660> because<00:01:19.200> i<00:01:19.470> mean<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.190> we<00:01:20.520> did

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
scheduled thing because i mean we we did

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.100 
scheduled thing because i mean we we did
do<00:01:20.820> really<00:01:21.060> poorly<00:01:21.270> at<00:01:21.450> columbus<00:01:21.780> then<00:01:22.050> we

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
do really poorly at columbus then we

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.360 
do really poorly at columbus then we
came<00:01:22.230> back<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.530> we<00:01:22.590> placed<00:01:22.830> really<00:01:23.070> well<00:01:23.220> at

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
came back and we placed really well at

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.700 
came back and we placed really well at
the<00:01:23.490> regional<00:01:23.880> tournament<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.200> mean<00:01:25.620> we

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
the regional tournament so I mean we

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.500 
the regional tournament so I mean we
were<00:01:25.770> happy<00:01:26.070> with<00:01:26.160> that<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:27.090> know<00:01:27.300> that

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
were happy with that and I know that

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.210 
were happy with that and I know that
they're<00:01:27.930> both<00:01:28.260> great<00:01:28.410> players<00:01:28.620> and<00:01:28.980> I<00:01:29.040> wish

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
they're both great players and I wish

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.190 
they're both great players and I wish
them<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.400> best<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.750> not<00:01:30.900> like<00:01:31.080> it's

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
them the best so it's not like it's

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.270 
them the best so it's not like it's
anything<00:01:31.440> that<00:01:31.860> they<00:01:31.950> weren't<00:01:32.070> good<00:01:32.250> enough

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
anything that they weren't good enough

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.740 
anything that they weren't good enough
or<00:01:32.580> anything<00:01:32.790> like<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.940> it's<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.330> I<00:01:33.540> felt

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
or anything like that it's just I felt

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.720 
or anything like that it's just I felt
that<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:34.230> was<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.440> better<00:01:34.620> line<00:01:34.860> up<00:01:34.890> for<00:01:35.430> me

I'm LG's format I'm not sure how they

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.159 
I'm LG's format I'm not sure how they
used<00:03:37.120> to<00:03:37.590> actually<00:03:38.819> work<00:03:39.819> with<00:03:39.849> it<00:03:40.239> by<00:03:40.269> no<00:03:40.690> here

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
used to actually work with it by no here

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:42.750 
used to actually work with it by no here
they're<00:03:41.410> doing<00:03:41.709> a<00:03:41.829> round<00:03:41.980> robin<00:03:42.250> where<00:03:42.669> you

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
they're doing a round robin where you

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.520 
they're doing a round robin where you
actually<00:03:42.910> play<00:03:43.269> each<00:03:43.450> team<00:03:43.810> so<00:03:44.260> do<00:03:44.380> you<00:03:44.470> think

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
actually play each team so do you think

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.800 
actually play each team so do you think
they<00:03:44.889> should<00:03:44.919> that<00:03:45.730> that<00:03:46.060> will<00:03:46.359> be<00:03:46.510> better

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
they should that that will be better

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.900 
they should that that will be better
chances<00:03:47.470> for<00:03:47.530> you<00:03:47.859> in<00:03:48.099> terms<00:03:48.250> of<00:03:48.549> who<00:03:48.700> you'll

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
chances for you in terms of who you'll

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.729 
chances for you in terms of who you'll
be<00:03:48.940> facing<00:03:49.269> well<00:03:50.049> I<00:03:50.109> think<00:03:50.200> that<00:03:50.470> it's<00:03:50.620> the

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
be facing well I think that it's the

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.080 
be facing well I think that it's the
most<00:03:50.919> fair<00:03:51.160> format<00:03:51.579> because<00:03:51.730> you<00:03:52.000> know

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
most fair format because you know

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.180 
most fair format because you know
everyone<00:03:52.359> plays<00:03:52.569> everyone<00:03:52.930> they<00:03:53.769> used<00:03:53.919> to<00:03:54.010> run

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
everyone plays everyone they used to run

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.680 
everyone plays everyone they used to run
like<00:03:54.370> a<00:03:54.400> bracket<00:03:54.880> system<00:03:55.120> like<00:03:55.359> a<00:03:55.389> double

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
like a bracket system like a double

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.180 
like a bracket system like a double
elimination<00:03:55.750> where<00:03:56.380> it<00:03:56.530> was<00:03:56.620> kind<00:03:56.799> of<00:03:56.829> a<00:03:56.889> lot

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
elimination where it was kind of a lot

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.270 
elimination where it was kind of a lot
of<00:03:57.310> luck<00:03:57.459> of<00:03:57.579> draw<00:03:57.609> because

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
of luck of draw because

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.130 
of luck of draw because
you<00:03:58.370> know<00:03:58.490> with<00:03:59.060> a<00:03:59.090> while<00:03:59.270> there's<00:03:59.600> certain

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
you know with a while there's certain

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.940 
you know with a while there's certain
teen<00:04:00.260> so<00:04:00.410> you're<00:04:00.530> gonna<00:04:00.620> have<00:04:00.740> a<00:04:00.770> lot<00:04:00.890> of

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
teen so you're gonna have a lot of

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:01.900 
teen so you're gonna have a lot of
trouble<00:04:01.190> within<00:04:01.370> certain<00:04:01.550> teams<00:04:01.760> they'll

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
trouble within certain teams they'll

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.180 
trouble within certain teams they'll
have<00:04:02.270> an<00:04:02.360> easier<00:04:02.600> time<00:04:02.630> so<00:04:03.350> with<00:04:03.650> that<00:04:03.800> if<00:04:04.069> you

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
have an easier time so with that if you

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.010 
have an easier time so with that if you
got<00:04:04.310> a<00:04:04.370> really<00:04:04.670> good<00:04:04.790> draw<00:04:05.270> than<00:04:05.690> you<00:04:05.810> know<00:04:05.930> you

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
got a really good draw than you know you

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.570 
got a really good draw than you know you
could<00:04:06.170> get<00:04:06.290> really<00:04:06.500> far<00:04:06.680> pretty<00:04:06.950> easily<00:04:07.160> if

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
could get really far pretty easily if

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.980 
could get really far pretty easily if
you<00:04:07.910> had<00:04:08.000> a<00:04:08.030> bad<00:04:08.240> one<00:04:08.450> that<00:04:08.720> it<00:04:08.840> would<00:04:08.930> be

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
you had a bad one that it would be

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.570 
you had a bad one that it would be
extremely<00:04:09.140> hard<00:04:09.560> so<00:04:10.100> I<00:04:10.160> mean<00:04:10.310> this<00:04:10.430> is

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
extremely hard so I mean this is

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.520 
extremely hard so I mean this is
definitely<00:04:10.610> the<00:04:11.000> most<00:04:11.060> fair<00:04:11.480> but<00:04:12.170> it's<00:04:12.380> also

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
definitely the most fair but it's also

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.140 
definitely the most fair but it's also
we<00:04:12.800> really<00:04:13.040> tough<00:04:13.250> to<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:13.490> players<00:04:13.700> because

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
what we want to stay with because it

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.790 
what we want to stay with because it
does<00:04:53.030> work<00:04:53.300> well<00:04:53.330> but<00:04:54.080> there<00:04:54.470> was<00:04:54.560> some<00:04:54.680> other

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
does work well but there was some other

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.040 
does work well but there was some other
setups<00:04:55.190> that<00:04:55.250> we<00:04:55.400> were<00:04:55.460> considering<00:04:55.820> but<00:04:56.630> only

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
setups that we were considering but only

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
it really needs to be the very best

stuff like that so we felt like going

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.670 
stuff like that so we felt like going
with<00:05:11.540> this<00:05:11.720> was<00:05:11.960> definitely<00:05:12.169> the<00:05:12.350> best<00:05:12.500> thing

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
with this was definitely the best thing

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.590 
with this was definitely the best thing
to<00:05:12.710> do<00:05:12.860> for<00:05:12.890> now<00:05:13.130> so<00:05:13.970> do<00:05:14.150> you<00:05:14.240> think<00:05:14.300> you

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
to do for now so do you think you

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.380 
to do for now so do you think you
actually<00:05:14.780> put<00:05:15.320> have<00:05:15.590> any<00:05:15.800> like<00:05:16.789> serious

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
actually put have any like serious

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.570 
actually put have any like serious
competition<00:05:17.750> like<00:05:18.229> any<00:05:18.440> kind<00:05:18.950> of<00:05:19.100> setup<00:05:19.280> set

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
competition like any kind of setup set

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.860 
competition like any kind of setup set
are<00:05:19.729> going<00:05:19.850> to<00:05:19.910> give<00:05:20.060> you<00:05:20.180> a<00:05:20.210> lot<00:05:20.390> of<00:05:20.539> trouble

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
are going to give you a lot of trouble

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.430 
are going to give you a lot of trouble
well<00:05:21.740> I<00:05:21.770> think<00:05:21.950> that<00:05:22.930> it's<00:05:23.930> a<00:05:24.020> really<00:05:24.200> tough

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
well I think that it's a really tough

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.810 
well I think that it's a really tough
tournament<00:05:24.770> I<00:05:24.979> mean<00:05:25.100> pretty<00:05:25.250> every<00:05:25.490> pretty

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
tournament I mean pretty every pretty

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:26.920 
tournament I mean pretty every pretty
much<00:05:25.940> every<00:05:26.150> match<00:05:26.300> is<00:05:26.479> going<00:05:26.600> to<00:05:26.660> be<00:05:26.750> really

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
much every match is going to be really

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.690 
much every match is going to be really
hard<00:05:27.110> but<00:05:27.320> it's<00:05:27.890> the<00:05:28.010> same<00:05:28.160> for<00:05:28.310> most<00:05:28.460> teams

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
hard but it's the same for most teams

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.090 
hard but it's the same for most teams
here<00:05:28.970> I<00:05:29.180> think<00:05:29.479> that<00:05:29.830> specifically<00:05:30.830> I<00:05:30.890> think

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
here I think that specifically I think

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.440 
here I think that specifically I think
complexity<00:05:31.669> is<00:05:31.850> going<00:05:32.000> to<00:05:32.060> be<00:05:32.120> really<00:05:32.240> really

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
complexity is going to be really really

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.330 
complexity is going to be really really
tough<00:05:32.600> to<00:05:32.930> set<00:05:33.080> up<00:05:33.200> that<00:05:33.320> they<00:05:33.440> run<00:05:33.650> and<00:05:33.919> the

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
tough to set up that they run and the

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.860 
tough to set up that they run and the
way<00:05:34.460> that<00:05:34.640> they<00:05:34.729> run<00:05:34.940> it<00:05:35.060> is<00:05:35.180> extremely<00:05:35.570> hard

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
way that they run it is extremely hard

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.740 
way that they run it is extremely hard
