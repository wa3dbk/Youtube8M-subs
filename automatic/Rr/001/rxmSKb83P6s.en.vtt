00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
Well it doesn't seem possible that we're
in our eighth year and that the eight years

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.170
have gone by so fast. See the connection
of the run came after the NCAA

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.859
championship in 1977 at Marquette and we
wanted to do something for Milwaukee and

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.350
I wanted to do something for, kind of a
payback, put back into the kitty and all

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.619
those all those great years of 13 with
Marquette University and we came up with the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.780
concept of a run and I wanted to deal
with young people and it's been a nice

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.710
marriage. The Milwaukee Journal,
Children's Hospital, and Al Maguire's

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.230
truly what it's been, plus the
rank-and-file of the of the city and the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.399
state of Wisconsin. And through these
eight years we've never really changed

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.610
the M.O. of the run, it's been for the
so-called two-dollar better, it's been

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.559
for the cracked sidewalks. So the gift
each year of over one hundred thousand

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.769
dollars has been from the housewife in
the apron and the guy that rides the bus

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.610
and drinks a glass of beer at the local
watering hole. And now we're getting more of an

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.380
influence especially through my wife's
walk of the young children and I think

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.220
this is where the gold mine for the
intensive care of Children's Hospital is

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.780
located, through the walk. So many people
come down as a group for the runners

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.490
that it allows them something, you know,
to participate in instead of just going

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.820
down and waiting at the lakefront
there. And it's nice you know, it's good

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.090
exercise, it's fun. It has the stamp of
Milwaukee on it and the state of

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.970
Wisconsin, it has a wholesomeness and
it's almost a closing of the summer

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.110
season. Even so the kids are back in
school, it's an Oktoberfest type of

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:04.500
atmosphere, but it's when Wisconsin
is at its most beautiful. It's when the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.280
leaves are starting to turn up their
toes and the gold is starting to pop out

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.570
and normally the morning is
refreshing because it's usually a

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.150
little chilly. Very fortunate the last
two years we end up getting tremendous

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.250
weather and I hope that the big coat
shines on us again this year. I look

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.370
forward to it, I don't worry about the
weather anymore originally I did worry

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.870
about the weather but I've seen terrible
weather and still end up with 15,000

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.920
people out there. All of a sudden when it
gets the post time they seemed to come

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.520
out of a storefront and out of the
hallways and we go rain or shine. Kids

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.110
sicknesses don't depend on the weather,
so they're sick one way or the other. One

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.950
of the things I would like for the
runners to do this year they could

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.290
remember is that as they're warming up
to take a walk by the hospital and at

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.830
the hospital they're usually hundreds of
kids in the windows waving and so on

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.320
it's kind of a, it gives you more of a
feeling of accomplishing something. I

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.060
think our greatest growth area for the
money for the hospital and for

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.950
participants is in Pat's walk. What
happens so many times is that the

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.330
people cannot run because their knees or
because the children are too young, this

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.470
way they can push the children in
strollers, the grandparents can walk the

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:31.780
three four miles and what came about was
to service a need and last year we had

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.660
approximately 4,000 walkers and
surprisingly the walkers get over the

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.470
bridge as the tail end as the runners
are coming under the bridge and it's

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.930
just a magnificent sight and it allows
everyone to touch Children's Hospital a

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.640
little bit more and allows them to be
part of it with their children that are too

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.080
young or the grandparents that are too old or
the people that have physical handicaps,

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.850
whether it's bad knees or a bad ticker
or whatever they just can't take running.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.730
I'm sure if they do it one year they'll
thoroughly enjoy it and come back the

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.530
next year. An hour and a half before it
starts the true activity and the build up to

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.610
the starting gun and then the
couple hours after with the Blues

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.810
Brothers and all the shaking and bacon
and feelings, feeling that you have

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.220
touched the gold. You know the unique
thing about this run is that

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.540
we have raised approximately seven
hundred thousand dollars for the intensive

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.800
care unit Children's Hospital and we are
putting in, we, that means everyone out

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:40.490
there, has put in equipment into that
hospital with our little run name on it.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.910
This money is raised truly by the
rank-and-file. Just such a great cause

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.780
and I couldn't be more proud of it and I
think that's what has made it such a

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:59.050
pleasing happy day in the last saturday
of September.
