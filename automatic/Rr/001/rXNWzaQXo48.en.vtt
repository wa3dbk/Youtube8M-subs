00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.770 
wait till march like everyone else or 20
seconds<00:04:27.440> a<00:04:27.500> big<00:04:27.650> day<00:04:27.800> so<00:04:28.270> for<00:04:29.270> some<00:04:29.420> reason<00:04:29.450> i

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
seconds a big day so for some reason i

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.720 
seconds a big day so for some reason i
think<00:04:30.020> this<00:04:30.140> guy<00:04:30.320> is<00:04:30.350> like<00:04:31.220> uber

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
think this guy is like uber

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.240 
think this guy is like uber
defense<00:04:32.120> so<00:04:32.510> i<00:04:32.750> switch<00:04:33.140> out<00:04:33.380> I<00:04:33.650> don't<00:04:34.190> think

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
defense so i switch out I don't think

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.620 
defense so i switch out I don't think
far<00:04:34.550> guns<00:04:34.760> would<00:04:34.910> be<00:04:35.000> able<00:04:35.150> to<00:04:35.210> take<00:04:35.330> them<00:04:35.450> out

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
far guns would be able to take them out

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.660 
far guns would be able to take them out
and<00:04:37.110> I'm<00:04:37.230> predicting<00:04:37.650> like<00:04:37.800> a<00:04:37.830> match<00:04:38.100> punch<00:04:38.490> or

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
and I'm predicting like a match punch or

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.100 
and I'm predicting like a match punch or
something<00:04:39.000> I<00:04:39.180> don't<00:04:39.240> know<00:04:39.390> how<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.750> hell<00:04:39.990> this

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
something I don't know how the hell this

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.660 
something I don't know how the hell this
guy's<00:04:40.320> match<00:04:40.590> buns<00:04:40.890> because<00:04:41.040> his<00:04:41.280> feet<00:04:41.520> are

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
guy's match buns because his feet are

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.690 
guy's match buns because his feet are
big<00:04:41.880> as<00:04:42.000> hell<00:04:42.150> but<00:04:42.740> he<00:04:43.740> put<00:04:44.010> it's<00:04:44.130> a<00:04:44.220> switch<00:04:44.520> and

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
big as hell but he put it's a switch and

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.730 
big as hell but he put it's a switch and
it's<00:04:44.790> a<00:04:44.910> good<00:04:45.180> move<00:04:45.390> in<00:04:45.750> stone<00:04:46.140> Age's<00:04:46.440> minus

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
it's a good move in stone Age's minus

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.650 
it's a good move in stone Age's minus
maggots<00:04:47.160> and<00:04:47.430> I<00:04:47.550> barely<00:04:47.880> hang<00:04:48.210> in<00:04:48.330> there<00:04:48.480> which

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
maggots and I barely hang in there which

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.160 
maggots and I barely hang in there which
is<00:04:48.690> nice<00:04:48.990> I<00:04:49.290> go<00:04:50.070> for<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:50.340> shadow<00:04:50.610> ball<00:04:50.850> and<00:04:51.170> he

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
is nice I go for the shadow ball and he

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.690 
is nice I go for the shadow ball and he
switches<00:04:52.410> out<00:04:52.650> which<00:04:52.890> is<00:04:53.040> kind<00:04:53.280> of<00:04:53.310> odd<00:04:53.430> I

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
switches out which is kind of odd I

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.920 
switches out which is kind of odd I
don't<00:04:53.880> know<00:04:54.000> why<00:04:54.120> I<00:04:54.150> did<00:04:54.420> that<00:04:54.500> and<00:04:56.750> he'd<00:04:57.750> be

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
don't know why I did that and he'd be

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.990 
don't know why I did that and he'd be
lives<00:04:58.290> and<00:04:58.680> it's<00:04:58.770> a<00:04:58.830> potential<00:04:59.340> speed<00:04:59.610> tie<00:04:59.820> I

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
lives and it's a potential speed tie I

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.330 
lives and it's a potential speed tie I
don't<00:05:00.180> know<00:05:00.300> I<00:05:00.540> packed<00:05:01.140> a<00:05:01.260> couple<00:05:01.710> extra<00:05:01.830> speed

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
don't know I packed a couple extra speed

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.260 
don't know I packed a couple extra speed
v's<00:05:02.970> in<00:05:03.180> mine<00:05:04.010> the<00:05:05.010> situations<00:05:05.610> like<00:05:05.700> this<00:05:05.910> so
