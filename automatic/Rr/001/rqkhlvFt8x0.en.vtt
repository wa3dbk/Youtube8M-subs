he says trials are on the way with the
new<00:00:12.420> set<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.960> subjects<00:00:13.500> here's<00:00:13.799> number<00:00:13.980> two

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
new set of subjects here's number two

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.490 
new set of subjects here's number two
similar<00:00:14.880> physiology<00:00:17.960> alrighty<00:00:18.960> then<00:00:19.199> he<00:00:19.289> says

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
similar physiology alrighty then he says

similar<00:00:20.010> physiology<00:00:20.820> different

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
similar physiology different

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.170 
similar physiology different
environmental<00:00:22.410> conditions<00:00:22.850> now<00:00:23.850> let's<00:00:24.029> check

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
environmental conditions now let's check

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.730 
environmental conditions now let's check
out<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.480> third<00:00:24.689> one<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.320> long<00:00:25.500> one

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
out the third one this the long one

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.980 
out the third one this the long one
following<00:00:26.310> -<00:00:26.609> seizures<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.390> subjects<00:00:27.810> the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
following - seizures the subjects the

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.960 
following - seizures the subjects the
two<00:00:28.230> reported<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.949> brief<00:00:29.160> periods<00:00:29.760> of

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
two reported the brief periods of

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.279 
two reported the brief periods of
impaired<00:00:30.480> hearing

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
impaired hearing

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.100 
impaired hearing
similarly<00:00:32.250> d5<00:00:32.850> complained<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.690> decreased

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
similarly d5 complained of a decreased

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.160 
similarly d5 complained of a decreased
sense<00:00:35.270> alrighty<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.480> this<00:00:36.630> final<00:00:37.050> one

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
sense alrighty so this final one

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.750 
sense alrighty so this final one
definitely<00:00:37.649> gives<00:00:37.860> us<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.219> most<00:00:38.460> information

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
definitely gives us the most information

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.639 
definitely gives us the most information
so<00:00:39.390> basically<00:00:39.809> out<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.930> all<00:00:40.170> three<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.469> these

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
so basically out of all three of these

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.549 
so basically out of all three of these
dr.<00:00:41.460> Salim<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:42.210> setting<00:00:42.570> up<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.870> new<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.440> know

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
dr. Salim is setting up a new you know

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.260 
dr. Salim is setting up a new you know
kind<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.770> group<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.309> subjects<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.180> he's

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
kind of group of subjects that he's

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.760 
kind of group of subjects that he's
testing<00:00:45.750> he's<00:00:45.870> saying<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.200> they're<00:00:46.320> all<00:00:46.500> you

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
testing he's saying that they're all you

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.690 
testing he's saying that they're all you
know<00:00:46.800> pretty<00:00:47.190> much<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.520> same

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
know pretty much the same

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.250 
know pretty much the same
physiologically<00:00:48.690> like<00:00:48.870> they're<00:00:49.050> they're<00:00:49.230> you

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
physiologically like they're they're you

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.799 
physiologically like they're they're you
know<00:00:49.410> living<00:00:49.739> breathing<00:00:50.489> human<00:00:50.730> beings<00:00:51.390> but

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
know living breathing human beings but

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.510 
know living breathing human beings but
they<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:52.110> different<00:00:52.500> backgrounds<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.399> he's

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
they have different backgrounds and he's

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.069 
they have different backgrounds and he's
doing<00:00:53.789> something<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.360> them<00:00:54.570> whatever<00:00:54.809> this

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
doing something to them whatever this

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.959 
doing something to them whatever this
experiment<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.770> it's<00:00:56.010> something<00:00:56.370> big<00:00:56.610> we<00:00:56.820> know

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
experiment is it's something big we know

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.459 
experiment is it's something big we know
from<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> previous<00:00:57.449> snaps<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.289> it's

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
from the previous snaps that it's

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.240 
from the previous snaps that it's
something<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.890> know<00:00:58.980> kind<00:00:59.129> of

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
something you know kind of

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.560 
something you know kind of
groundbreaking<00:00:59.730> never<00:01:00.090> been<00:01:00.359> done<00:01:00.539> before

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
groundbreaking never been done before

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.869 
groundbreaking never been done before
and<00:01:01.170> he's<00:01:01.620> got<00:01:01.829> confidence<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.640> but<00:01:02.820> he

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
and he's got confidence in it but he

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.789 
and he's got confidence in it but he
doesn't<00:01:03.030> really<00:01:03.270> know<00:01:03.539> what<00:01:04.439> could<00:01:04.619> happen

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
doesn't really know what could happen

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.469 
doesn't really know what could happen
not<00:01:05.129> basically<00:01:05.489> something<00:01:05.700> bad<00:01:05.970> can<00:01:06.180> go<00:01:06.299> wrong

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
not basically something bad can go wrong

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.390 
not basically something bad can go wrong
which<00:01:06.659> was<00:01:06.810> kind<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.020> alluded<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.220> last

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
snap as well now as you can see and this

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.640 
snap as well now as you can see and this
one<00:01:11.040> right<00:01:11.250> here<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.689> way<00:01:13.080> back<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.530> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
one right here this is way back in the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.140 
one right here this is way back in the
past<00:01:13.860> like<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.369> looks<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:14.790> it's<00:01:14.909> like<00:01:15.060> you

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
past like this looks like it's like you

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.880 
past like this looks like it's like you
know<00:01:15.240> World<00:01:15.509> War<00:01:15.659> 2<00:01:15.900> era<00:01:15.930> maybe<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.500> little<00:01:16.799> bit

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
know World War 2 era maybe a little bit

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.289 
know World War 2 era maybe a little bit
after<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> little<00:01:17.700> bit<00:01:17.820> before<00:01:18.119> but

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
after that a little bit before but

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.200 
after that a little bit before but
somewhere<00:01:19.110> around<00:01:19.340> that<00:01:20.340> time<00:01:20.729> period<00:01:21.060> this

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
somewhere around that time period this

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.810 
somewhere around that time period this
doesn't<00:01:21.689> look<00:01:21.960> like<00:01:22.439> it's<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.310> modern

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
doesn't look like it's in the modern

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.520 
doesn't look like it's in the modern
times<00:01:24.119> or<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.840> near<00:01:25.020> future<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.439> know

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
times or the the near future you know

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.050 
times or the the near future you know
kind<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.770> like<00:01:25.890> black<00:01:26.040> ops<00:01:26.340> 2<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.790> set<00:01:26.970> in

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
kind of like black ops 2 is set in

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.090 
kind of like black ops 2 is set in
because<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.570> can<00:01:27.689> tell<00:01:27.900> by<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.320> outfit

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
because you can tell by the the outfit

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.740 
because you can tell by the the outfit
that<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> nurse<00:01:29.579> has<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.540> kind<00:01:30.720> of

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
that the nurse has on so it kind of

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.929 
that the nurse has on so it kind of
confuses<00:01:31.560> me<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> little<00:01:31.950> bit<00:01:32.100> because<00:01:32.250> it

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
confuses me a little bit because it

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.210 
confuses me a little bit because it
seems<00:01:33.329> like<00:01:33.509> he's<00:01:33.720> doing<00:01:33.750> something<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:34.979> terms

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
seems like he's doing something in terms

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.569 
seems like he's doing something in terms
of<00:01:35.460> like<00:01:35.640> Robo<00:01:36.680> bionic<00:01:37.680> like<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.159> know<00:01:38.280> kind

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
of like Robo bionic like you know kind

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.550 
of like Robo bionic like you know kind
of<00:01:38.610> like<00:01:38.790> mind<00:01:39.060> control<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:40.079> know<00:01:40.290> mind

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
of like mind control you know mind

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.830 
of like mind control you know mind
stimulation<00:01:41.490> type<00:01:41.729> stuff<00:01:42.090> because<00:01:42.360> why<00:01:42.509> would

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
stimulation type stuff because why would

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.569 
stimulation type stuff because why would
these<00:01:42.960> people<00:01:43.020> be<00:01:43.350> losing<00:01:43.829> their<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.460> know

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
these people be losing their you know

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.889 
these people be losing their you know
taste<00:01:44.880> or<00:01:45.180> their<00:01:45.329> hearing<00:01:45.600> or<00:01:45.689> stuff<00:01:45.869> like

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
taste or their hearing or stuff like

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.420 
taste or their hearing or stuff like
that<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.350> he's<00:01:46.500> going<00:01:46.770> into<00:01:46.950> their<00:01:47.159> brains

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
that like he's going into their brains

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.999 
that like he's going into their brains
and<00:01:47.640> doing<00:01:47.850> something<00:01:48.119> with<00:01:48.329> them<00:01:48.689> but<00:01:49.229> that

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
and doing something with them but that

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.139 
and doing something with them but that
wasn't<00:01:50.340> really<00:01:50.430> something<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:50.939> they<00:01:51.090> were

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
wasn't really something that they were

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.819 
wasn't really something that they were
doing<00:01:51.570> back<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:51.869> those<00:01:52.200> days<00:01:52.439> at<00:01:52.590> least<00:01:52.680> I

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
doing back in those days at least I

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.260 
doing back in those days at least I
don't<00:01:52.979> think<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.640> something<00:01:53.820> were<00:01:53.939> just

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
don't think so that something were just

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.420 
don't think so that something were just
now<00:01:54.509> starting<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:55.049> experiment<00:01:55.259> with<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.860> mess

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
now starting to experiment with and mess

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.499 
now starting to experiment with and mess
around<00:01:56.579> with<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:56.969> we<00:01:57.060> aren't<00:01:57.149> even<00:01:57.270> really

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
around with and we aren't even really

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.300 
around with and we aren't even really
all<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.719> advanced<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.259> technology<00:01:58.979> as

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
all that advanced in that technology as

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.880 
all that advanced in that technology as
of<00:01:59.520> right<00:01:59.670> now<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.509> it's<00:02:01.049> like<00:02:01.110> what<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.590> earth

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
of right now so it's like what on earth

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.609 
of right now so it's like what on earth
could<00:02:02.520> he<00:02:02.700> be<00:02:02.880> doing<00:02:03.149> back<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:04.140> like<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.409> World

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
could he be doing back in like the World

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.590 
could he be doing back in like the World
War<00:02:04.799> 2<00:02:05.070> era<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.700> it's<00:02:05.850> kind<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.090> cool<00:02:06.329> like<00:02:06.509> I

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
War 2 era and it's kind of cool like I

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.029 
War 2 era and it's kind of cool like I
don't<00:02:06.810> know<00:02:06.960> maybe<00:02:07.170> we're<00:02:07.350> kind<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.560> mixing

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
don't know maybe we're kind of mixing

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.040 
don't know maybe we're kind of mixing
the<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.670> know<00:02:08.759> future<00:02:09.179> with<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.810> past

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
the the you know future with the past

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.780 
the the you know future with the past
and<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:11.009> don't<00:02:11.250> know<00:02:11.400> how<00:02:11.520> it's<00:02:11.640> gonna<00:02:11.700> work

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
and and I don't know how it's gonna work

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.199 
and and I don't know how it's gonna work
out<00:02:12.060> but<00:02:12.300> yes

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
out but yes

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.339 
out but yes
kind<00:02:13.359> of<00:02:13.390> interesting<00:02:13.629> you<00:02:13.840> know<00:02:13.900> he's<00:02:14.200> doing

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
kind of interesting you know he's doing

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.550 
kind of interesting you know he's doing
this<00:02:14.530> big<00:02:14.769> experiment<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.549> so<00:02:16.480> far<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:17.079> seems

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
this big experiment and so far it seems

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.289 
this big experiment and so far it seems
like<00:02:17.769> it's<00:02:18.310> going<00:02:18.430> pretty<00:02:18.519> well<00:02:18.730> you<00:02:19.000> know<00:02:19.120> we

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
like it's going pretty well you know we

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.240 
like it's going pretty well you know we
just<00:02:19.329> had<00:02:19.659> some<00:02:19.959> minor<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.859> know<00:02:20.980> kind<00:02:21.219> of

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
just had some minor you know kind of

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.369 
just had some minor you know kind of
side<00:02:21.730> effects<00:02:22.090> where<00:02:22.329> somebody<00:02:22.719> lost<00:02:22.930> his

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
side effects where somebody lost his

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:24.959 
side effects where somebody lost his
sense<00:02:23.650> of<00:02:23.799> taste<00:02:24.010> somebody<00:02:24.489> had<00:02:24.640> impaired

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:24.969 
sense of taste somebody had impaired

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:26.640 
sense of taste somebody had impaired
hearing<00:02:25.150> for<00:02:25.390> a<00:02:25.420> little<00:02:25.629> bit<00:02:25.719> but<00:02:25.930> as<00:02:26.290> of<00:02:26.500> right

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
hearing for a little bit but as of right

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.530 
hearing for a little bit but as of right
now<00:02:26.709> things<00:02:27.459> are<00:02:27.579> going<00:02:27.700> well<00:02:27.969> but<00:02:28.269> I've<00:02:28.390> got<00:02:28.510> a

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
now things are going well but I've got a

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.970 
now things are going well but I've got a
feeling<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:28.870> soon<00:02:29.200> they're<00:02:29.590> gonna<00:02:29.650> start

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
feeling that soon they're gonna start

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.140 
feeling that soon they're gonna start
taking<00:02:30.189> a<00:02:30.310> turn<00:02:30.489> for<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.760> worse

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
taking a turn for the worse

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.449 
taking a turn for the worse
based<00:02:31.510> off<00:02:31.719> of<00:02:31.930> that<00:02:32.049> one<00:02:32.290> red<00:02:32.590> snap<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.250> red

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
based off of that one red snap the red

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:34.979 
based off of that one red snap the red
eye<00:02:33.489> that<00:02:33.790> you<00:02:33.879> guys<00:02:34.030> I<00:02:34.269> may<00:02:34.689> have<00:02:34.810> seen<00:02:34.959> a

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
eye that you guys I may have seen a

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.750 
eye that you guys I may have seen a
couple<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.290> days<00:02:35.439> ago<00:02:35.560> so<00:02:35.889> oh<00:02:36.069> yeah<00:02:36.430> I<00:02:36.579> don't

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
couple of days ago so oh yeah I don't

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.280 
couple of days ago so oh yeah I don't
know<00:02:36.819> if<00:02:36.939> guys<00:02:37.060> have<00:02:37.269> any<00:02:37.389> ideas<00:02:37.629> as<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:37.780> what

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
know if guys have any ideas as to what

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.809 
know if guys have any ideas as to what
this<00:02:38.469> experiment<00:02:39.159> could<00:02:39.250> be<00:02:39.489> what<00:02:39.700> do<00:02:39.760> you

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
this experiment could be what do you

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.280 
this experiment could be what do you
guys<00:02:39.909> think<00:02:39.969> dr.<00:02:40.480> Salim<00:02:40.689> is<00:02:40.780> doing<00:02:40.989> leave<00:02:41.170> it

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
guys think dr. Salim is doing leave it

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.449 
guys think dr. Salim is doing leave it
