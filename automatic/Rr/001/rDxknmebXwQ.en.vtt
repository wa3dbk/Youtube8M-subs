you<00:00:45.640> know<00:00:45.940> in<00:00:46.270> the<00:00:46.420> air<00:00:46.600> in<00:00:46.840> the<00:00:46.930> car<00:00:47.110> and<00:00:47.920> I

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
you know in the air in the car and I

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.040 
you know in the air in the car and I
believe<00:00:49.060> I<00:00:49.300> can<00:00:49.420> get<00:00:49.510> these<00:00:49.600> in<00:00:49.720> the<00:00:49.780> back<00:00:49.900> of

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
believe I can get these in the back of

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.040 
believe I can get these in the back of
the<00:00:50.110> BMW<00:00:51.420> they<00:00:52.420> should<00:00:52.630> be<00:00:52.720> able<00:00:52.780> to<00:00:52.900> sit

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
the BMW they should be able to sit

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:01.080 
the BMW they should be able to sit
side-by-side<00:00:53.290> so<00:00:53.800> my<00:00:53.890> problem<00:00:54.250> is<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.820> cargo

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
side-by-side so my problem is the cargo

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.180 
side-by-side so my problem is the cargo
carrier<00:01:01.600> takes<00:01:02.410> that<00:01:02.590> below<00:01:02.739> that<00:01:02.920> our<00:01:03.010> room

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
carrier takes that below that our room

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.340 
carrier takes that below that our room
so<00:01:03.460> the<00:01:03.550> catch<00:01:03.850> will<00:01:04.089> not<00:01:04.179> close<00:01:04.420> so<00:01:05.319> let's

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
so the catch will not close so let's

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.349 
so the catch will not close so let's
take<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:05.710> cargo<00:01:06.009> carrier<00:01:06.310> out<00:01:06.520> see<00:01:07.179> what<00:01:07.329> we

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:07.359 
take the cargo carrier out see what we

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:11.849 
take the cargo carrier out see what we
can<00:01:07.569> do<00:01:07.689> with<00:01:07.810> that<00:01:08.079> I<00:01:10.469> think<00:01:11.469> these<00:01:11.590> great

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:11.859 
can do with that I think these great

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:14.160 
can do with that I think these great
rice<00:01:12.100> crates<00:01:12.399> are<00:01:12.549> a<00:01:12.609> little<00:01:12.999> larger<00:01:13.509> than<00:01:13.719> the

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
rice crates are a little larger than the

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.010 
rice crates are a little larger than the
old<00:01:14.319> berry<00:01:14.890> kennels<00:01:15.280> I<00:01:15.719> think<00:01:16.719> they<00:01:16.780> said<00:01:16.990> a

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020

so thought the cargo cover the verdict
is<00:02:00.119> they<00:02:01.119> can<00:02:01.300> fit<00:02:01.540> but<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.590> money's<00:02:02.800> our
