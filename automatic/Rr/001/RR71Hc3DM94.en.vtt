mainstream and what people actually know

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.080 
mainstream and what people actually know
because<00:02:56.340> two<00:02:57.340> out<00:02:57.520> of<00:02:57.550> three<00:02:57.820> of<00:02:57.880> those

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
because two out of three of those

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.200 
because two out of three of those
companies<00:02:58.390> are<00:02:58.870> crap<00:02:59.290> so<00:02:59.800> I<00:03:00.340> thought<00:03:01.030> was

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
companies are crap so I thought was

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.330 
companies are crap so I thought was
funny<00:03:01.360> um<00:03:01.690> but<00:03:02.620> I<00:03:02.680> told<00:03:02.950> her<00:03:03.040> about<00:03:03.130> it

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
funny um but I told her about it

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.540 
funny um but I told her about it
hopefully<00:03:03.520> she'll<00:03:03.910> go<00:03:04.000> check<00:03:04.210> out<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.390> site

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
hopefully she'll go check out the site

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.220 
hopefully she'll go check out the site
but<00:03:06.550> I<00:03:06.610> do<00:03:06.730> think<00:03:07.090> this<00:03:07.300> still<00:03:07.570> defines<00:03:08.050> my

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
but I do think this still defines my

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.740 
but I do think this still defines my
curls<00:03:08.530> like<00:03:08.770> not<00:03:09.280> like<00:03:09.520> defined<00:03:09.970> as<00:03:10.330> and<00:03:10.660> they

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
curls like not like defined as and they

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.360 
curls like not like defined as and they
weren't<00:03:10.930> there<00:03:11.110> before<00:03:11.290> but<00:03:11.709> it<00:03:11.860> just<00:03:11.890> like<00:03:12.250> i

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
weren't there before but it just like i

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.010 
weren't there before but it just like i
said<00:03:12.400> in<00:03:12.760> my<00:03:12.790> first<00:03:12.850> view<00:03:13.239> it<00:03:13.480> makes<00:03:13.720> my<00:03:13.870> hair

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
said in my first view it makes my hair

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.680 
said in my first view it makes my hair
like<00:03:14.110> kind<00:03:14.380> of<00:03:14.410> like<00:03:14.500> hyper<00:03:15.160> curly<00:03:15.880> like<00:03:16.420> if

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
like kind of like hyper curly like if

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.630 
like kind of like hyper curly like if
you<00:03:16.989> see<00:03:17.230> like<00:03:17.440> my<00:03:17.650> hair<00:03:17.830> is<00:03:17.920> like<00:03:18.070> super<00:03:18.430> curly

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
you see like my hair is like super curly

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.240 
you see like my hair is like super curly
and<00:03:18.940> then<00:03:19.120> it<00:03:19.239> makes<00:03:19.390> it<00:03:19.660> really<00:03:20.050> soft<00:03:20.560> as<00:03:20.950> well

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
and then it makes it really soft as well

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.660 
and then it makes it really soft as well
um<00:03:22.239> I<00:03:22.300> think<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:23.140> would<00:03:23.380> help<00:03:23.590> get<00:03:24.459> rid<00:03:24.610> of

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
um I think it would help get rid of

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.870 
um I think it would help get rid of
crunch<00:03:25.060> like<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.600> helps<00:03:25.840> like<00:03:25.959> alleviate<00:03:26.410> that

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
crunch like it helps like alleviate that

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.490 
crunch like it helps like alleviate that
