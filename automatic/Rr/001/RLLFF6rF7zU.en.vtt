00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
definitely a different Call of Duty and

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.050 
definitely a different Call of Duty and
modern<00:01:25.110> warfare<00:01:25.320> 2<00:01:25.560> they<00:01:26.100> all<00:01:26.310> play<00:01:26.670> so

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.010 
modern warfare 2 they all play so
differently<00:01:27.479> though<00:01:27.659> they<00:01:27.780> would<00:01:27.930> have

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
differently though they would have

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.410

different styles to them it's funny

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.440

adjusting<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.049> them<00:01:31.220> hopefully<00:01:32.220> we<00:01:32.700> can<00:01:32.850> be

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
adjusting to them hopefully we can be

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.230 
adjusting to them hopefully we can be
quite<00:01:33.720> sneaky<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.290> far<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:34.650> haven't<00:01:34.799> really

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240

this guy first for the weight room
man<00:02:10.210> my<00:02:10.450> aim<00:02:10.660> just<00:02:10.690> doesn't<00:02:11.170> feel<00:02:11.290> quite<00:02:11.350> on

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
man my aim just doesn't feel quite on

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.090 
man my aim just doesn't feel quite on
point

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
point

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.320 
point
I<00:02:12.130> think<00:02:12.610> one<00:02:12.730> of<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.850> other<00:02:12.880> things<00:02:13.150> is

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
I think one of the other things is

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.940 
I think one of the other things is
switching<00:02:13.630> between<00:02:13.750> cooler<00:02:14.110> duties<00:02:14.560> is<00:02:14.770> that

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
switching between cooler duties is that

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.220 
switching between cooler duties is that
their<00:02:15.220> sensitivities<00:02:15.970> is<00:02:16.300> pretty<00:02:17.110> much

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
their sensitivities is pretty much

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.230 
their sensitivities is pretty much
different<00:02:17.620> between<00:02:17.680> every<00:02:18.310> Call<00:02:18.520> of<00:02:18.550> Duty<00:02:19.030> it

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
different between every Call of Duty it

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.070 
different between every Call of Duty it
especially<00:02:19.870> screws<00:02:20.320> me<00:02:20.440> over<00:02:20.500> Oh<00:02:21.450> No<00:02:22.480> there's

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
especially screws me over Oh No there's

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.720 
especially screws me over Oh No there's
a<00:02:23.170> dog<00:02:23.380> I<00:02:25.080> I'm<00:02:26.080> running<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.710> killed<00:02:27.400> both<00:02:27.550> of
