it<00:02:12.560> can't<00:02:12.830> be<00:02:13.010> easy<00:02:13.220> but<00:02:13.970> he<00:02:14.120> pulled<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.510> off

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
it can't be easy but he pulled it off

Zelda<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:20.180> had<00:02:20.330> this<00:02:20.510> incredibly<00:02:21.230> complex

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
Zelda you had this incredibly complex

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.360 
Zelda you had this incredibly complex
multi<00:02:22.640> character<00:02:23.500> password<00:02:24.500> there<00:02:25.220> was<00:02:25.340> a

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
multi character password there was a

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.400 
multi character password there was a
code<00:02:25.640> in<00:02:25.819> Metroid<00:02:26.209> called<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.660> Justin<00:02:27.110> Bailey

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
code in Metroid called the Justin Bailey

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.170 
code in Metroid called the Justin Bailey
code<00:02:27.799> and<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.069> was<00:02:28.160> really<00:02:28.340> clever<00:02:28.640> because<00:02:29.060> in

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
code and it was really clever because in

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.020 
code and it was really clever because in
the<00:02:29.269> UK<00:02:29.630> they<00:02:29.660> call<00:02:30.080> a<00:02:30.319> Bailey<00:02:30.799> a<00:02:30.980> swimsuit

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
the UK they call a Bailey a swimsuit

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.350 
the UK they call a Bailey a swimsuit
so<00:02:32.569> just<00:02:33.080> in<00:02:33.319> Bailey<00:02:34.250> means<00:02:34.790> just<00:02:35.209> in

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
so just in Bailey means just in

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.210 
so just in Bailey means just in
swimsuits<00:02:35.900> so<00:02:36.080> you<00:02:36.140> would<00:02:36.380> see<00:02:36.560> Samus<00:02:36.950> running

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
swimsuits so you would see Samus running

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.470 
swimsuits so you would see Samus running
