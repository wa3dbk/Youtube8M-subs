simple<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:07.390> first<00:01:07.600> step<00:01:07.810> is<00:01:08.049> to<00:01:08.290> have<00:01:08.799> both<00:01:09.580> of

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
simple the first step is to have both of

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
members and by themselves and stay out

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.830

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
until the spore explodes which lays out

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.080 
until the spore explodes which lays out
the<00:01:19.900> opening<00:01:20.320> there<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:21.610> ensures<00:01:21.939> that
