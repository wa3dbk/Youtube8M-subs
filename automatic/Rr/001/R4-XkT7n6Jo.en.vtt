knees promising him the cure and then

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.890 
knees promising him the cure and then
throwing<00:03:58.639> it<00:03:58.849> was<00:03:59.180> definitely<00:03:59.480> one<00:03:59.750> of<00:03:59.810> the

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
throwing it was definitely one of the

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.300 
throwing it was definitely one of the
most<00:03:59.989> tense<00:04:00.319> scenes<00:04:00.650> that<00:04:00.799> I've<00:04:00.949> seen<00:04:01.160> from

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
most tense scenes that I've seen from

most tense scenes that I've seen from
the<00:04:01.430> entire<00:04:01.849> series<00:04:02.329> I<00:04:02.660> almost<00:04:03.109> wanted<00:04:03.500> to

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
the entire series I almost wanted to

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.839 
the entire series I almost wanted to
hope<00:04:03.739> that<00:04:03.829> karma<00:04:04.340> was<00:04:04.489> going<00:04:04.639> to<00:04:04.699> get

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
hope that karma was going to get

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.789 
hope that karma was going to get
involved<00:04:05.090> as<00:04:05.329> well<00:04:05.359> because<00:04:05.840> next<00:04:06.379> in<00:04:06.590> naugy

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
involved as well because next in naugy

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.259 
involved as well because next in naugy
said<00:04:07.040> karma<00:04:07.430> is<00:04:07.489> definitely<00:04:07.849> the<00:04:07.910> one<00:04:08.030> who<00:04:08.180> has

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
said karma is definitely the one who has

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:09.729 
said karma is definitely the one who has
a<00:04:08.299> little<00:04:08.510> bit<00:04:08.660> more<00:04:08.810> muscle<00:04:09.079> a<00:04:09.379> little<00:04:09.650> more

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
a little bit more muscle a little more

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.379 
a little bit more muscle a little more
skill<00:04:10.069> behind<00:04:10.430> him<00:04:10.579> and<00:04:10.699> I<00:04:11.090> thought<00:04:11.299> that

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:11.389 
skill behind him and I thought that

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:12.580 
skill behind him and I thought that
would've<00:04:11.540> been<00:04:11.660> really<00:04:11.840> cool<00:04:12.139> there's<00:04:12.470> also

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
would've been really cool there's also

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.770 
would've been really cool there's also

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
argue that this is all in the vein of

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.100 
argue that this is all in the vein of
trying<00:05:22.030> to<00:05:22.150> save<00:05:22.330> the<00:05:22.480> world<00:05:22.630> from<00:05:22.780> koro
