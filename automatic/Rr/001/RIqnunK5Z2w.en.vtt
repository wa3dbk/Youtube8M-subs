00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
all right back again today we got out

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.690 
all right back again today we got out
the<00:00:03.419> Sega<00:00:04.049> Master<00:00:04.290> System<00:00:04.560> and<00:00:05.160> I<00:00:05.430> figured

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
the Sega Master System and I figured

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.419 
the Sega Master System and I figured
we'd<00:00:05.879> put<00:00:06.089> in<00:00:06.210> this<00:00:06.420> game<00:00:06.660> here<00:00:07.140> this<00:00:08.130> one's

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
we'd put in this game here this one's

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.549 
we'd put in this game here this one's
Sinbad<00:00:09.210> mystery<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:09.990> this<00:00:10.139> one<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.410> actually

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
Sinbad mystery and this one is actually

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.519 
Sinbad mystery and this one is actually
for<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.309> sega<00:00:12.200> sg-1000<00:00:13.200> 2<00:00:13.500> or<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.389> sg-1<00:00:15.529> 3000

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
for the sega sg-1000 2 or the sg-1 3000

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.740 
for the sega sg-1000 2 or the sg-1 3000
but<00:00:17.190> instead<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.910> digging<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.300> thing<00:00:18.570> out

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
but instead of digging that thing out

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.380 
but instead of digging that thing out
and<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:20.100> figured<00:00:20.430> we'd<00:00:20.609> just<00:00:20.640> play<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.119> on<00:00:21.210> the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
and I figured we'd just play it on the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:37.549 
and I figured we'd just play it on the
master<00:00:22.230> system<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:22.800> that's<00:00:23.340> what<00:00:23.519> we'll<00:00:23.640> do

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.590 

so<00:00:38.039> this<00:00:38.280> one<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.550> kind<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.789> reminds<00:00:39.120> me<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.420> a

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
so this one it kind of reminds me of a

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.139 
so this one it kind of reminds me of a
pacman<00:00:40.590> with<00:00:40.829> kind<00:00:41.039> of<00:00:41.100> like<00:00:41.160> an<00:00:41.370> Arabian<00:00:41.640> kind

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
pacman with kind of like an Arabian kind

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.840 
pacman with kind of like an Arabian kind
of<00:00:42.239> theme<00:00:42.449> to<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:43.129> get<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> chance<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.579> see<00:00:44.760> it
