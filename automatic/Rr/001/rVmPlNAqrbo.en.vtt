00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:45.840 

the<00:02:34.610> cheese<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.150> bread<00:02:35.360> crumbs

otherwise<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.370> cheese<00:02:48.610> will<00:02:49.090> leak<00:02:49.480> out

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.240 

I<00:02:55.349> think<00:02:56.930> that's<00:02:57.930> about<00:02:58.170> done<00:02:58.590> you<00:02:58.769> can<00:02:59.040> do

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
I think that's about done you can do

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.770 
I think that's about done you can do
this<00:02:59.310> with<00:02:59.400> your<00:02:59.609> hands<00:02:59.879> but<00:03:00.239> I<00:03:00.420> don't<00:03:00.629> like

getting my hands dirty leave that to the

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:12.250 
getting my hands dirty leave that to the
side<00:03:04.650> while<00:03:05.400> we<00:03:05.549> do<00:03:05.700> our<00:03:05.730> other<00:03:06.090> seven<00:03:06.510> pieces

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260

okay we have done all eight triangle now
we<00:03:18.230> need<00:03:18.409> to<00:03:18.560> test<00:03:18.769> about<00:03:19.099> oil<00:03:19.370> is<00:03:19.670> hot<00:03:19.939> enough

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
we need to test about oil is hot enough

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.490 
we need to test about oil is hot enough
and<00:03:20.920> with<00:03:21.920> me<00:03:22.129> to<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.400> slow

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.190 

a<00:03:26.530> little<00:03:27.370> bit<00:03:27.460> of<00:03:27.490> bread<00:03:27.790> I<00:03:28.120> use<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:28.960> cross

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
a little bit of bread I use the cross

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.330 
a little bit of bread I use the cross
because<00:03:29.320> no<00:03:29.590> one<00:03:29.710> eats<00:03:29.860> it

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
because no one eats it

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.030 
because no one eats it
just<00:03:31.610> drop<00:03:31.970> it<00:03:32.000> in<00:03:32.260> what<00:03:33.260> I<00:03:33.470> was<00:03:33.620> like<00:03:33.800> that

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
just drop it in what I was like that

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:46.830 
just drop it in what I was like that
means<00:03:34.340> that<00:03:34.519> the<00:03:34.610> oil<00:03:34.640> is<00:03:35.000> for<00:03:35.269> now

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.619 

okay<00:03:47.349> I<00:03:47.379> found<00:03:47.830> that<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.370> extra<00:03:48.970> crust<00:03:49.300> is<00:03:49.599> a

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
okay I found that the extra crust is a

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.479 
okay I found that the extra crust is a
great<00:03:49.959> place<00:03:50.610> to<00:03:51.610> leave<00:03:51.959> your<00:03:52.959> spoon<00:03:53.410> so<00:03:54.340> that

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
great place to leave your spoon so that

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.400 
great place to leave your spoon so that
you<00:03:54.550> don't<00:03:54.730> get<00:03:54.879> oil<00:03:55.239> marks<00:03:55.599> on<00:03:55.810> your<00:03:56.019> topic

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
you don't get oil marks on your topic

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.030 
you don't get oil marks on your topic
board<00:03:56.790> all<00:03:57.790> right<00:03:58.019> now<00:03:59.019> because<00:03:59.560> we<00:03:59.739> are<00:03:59.769> deep

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
board all right now because we are deep

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.539 
board all right now because we are deep
probably<00:04:00.280> need<00:04:00.610> you<00:04:00.790> have<00:04:00.970> paper<00:04:01.420> towel

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:09.020 
probably need you have paper towel
otherwise<00:04:03.549> they'll<00:04:03.940> be<00:04:04.030> fat<00:04:04.269> everywhere

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.160 

maybe<00:04:09.540> two<00:04:09.930> pieces<00:04:10.470> of<00:04:10.590> pipe<00:04:10.800> down<00:04:11.040> oh<00:04:11.490> my<00:04:12.450> gosh

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.140 

walking<00:04:15.560> on<00:04:15.680> our<00:04:15.890> plate

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.490 

now<00:04:20.329> we<00:04:20.389> take<00:04:20.720> them<00:04:22.509> crouches<00:04:23.509> you<00:04:23.660> can<00:04:23.960> double

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
now we take them crouches you can double

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.090 
now we take them crouches you can double
from<00:04:24.770> it<00:04:24.949> but<00:04:25.190> I<00:04:25.540> think<00:04:26.540> most<00:04:27.020> waste<00:04:27.560> of<00:04:27.800> time

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
from it but I think most waste of time

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.200 
from it but I think most waste of time
but<00:04:29.640> just<00:04:30.000> to<00:04:30.150> follow<00:04:30.420> with<00:04:30.630> one<00:04:30.840> from<00:04:32.210> all

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
but just to follow with one from all

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.990 
but just to follow with one from all
right<00:04:33.360> soon<00:04:34.040> instead<00:04:35.040> of<00:04:35.100> dumping

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
right soon instead of dumping

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:51.370 

and<00:04:44.400> then<00:04:44.730> lower<00:04:45.920> into<00:04:46.920> our<00:04:47.100> oil

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:59.320

latitude<00:05:00.289> going<00:05:00.650> brown<00:05:00.919> in<00:05:01.250> there

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.340 

check<00:05:04.680> it<00:05:04.860> all<00:05:05.159> aspects

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:16.200 

shake<00:05:08.980> some<00:05:09.280> the<00:05:09.430> excess<00:05:09.820> oil<00:05:10.210> off

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:33.190 

and<00:05:22.060> we<00:05:22.180> get<00:05:22.240> our<00:05:22.420> next<00:05:22.750> fall

they're<00:05:50.809> pretty<00:05:51.080> quick

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
they're pretty quick

00:05:52.650 --> 00:06:14.200 
they're pretty quick
we<00:05:52.770> can<00:05:52.949> see<00:05:53.160> the<00:05:53.280> brown<00:05:53.460> sticking<00:05:54.150> out
