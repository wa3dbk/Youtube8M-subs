they were on day one so let me fill you
in<00:00:29.730> first<00:00:30.510> off<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.779> my<00:00:30.900> boot<00:00:31.140> up<00:00:31.260> time<00:00:31.289> has

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
in first off to my boot up time has

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.910 
in first off to my boot up time has
slowed<00:00:32.790> drastically<00:00:33.300> i<00:00:33.930> went<00:00:34.410> from<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.710> maybe

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
slowed drastically i went from the maybe

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.370 
slowed drastically i went from the maybe
10<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.399> 15<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.180> had<00:00:36.390> when<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.690> first<00:00:36.719> got<00:00:37.170> it

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
10 to 15 that I had when I first got it

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.860 
10 to 15 that I had when I first got it
now<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.129> takes<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.430> good<00:00:38.460> probably<00:00:38.940> 45<00:00:39.360> seconds

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
now it takes it good probably 45 seconds

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.720 
now it takes it good probably 45 seconds
almost<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.290> minute<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.680> fully<00:00:40.860> boot<00:00:41.160> up<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.579> be

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
almost a minute to fully boot up and be

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.209 
almost a minute to fully boot up and be
ready<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.059> use<00:00:42.170> it's<00:00:43.170> not<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.800> big<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.129> deal

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
ready to use it's not that big a deal

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.100 
ready to use it's not that big a deal
but<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.700> something<00:00:44.940> that's<00:00:45.120> very<00:00:45.239> noticeable

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
but is something that's very noticeable

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.170 
but is something that's very noticeable
and<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.950> think<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:47.280> probably<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.670> fault<00:00:47.969> with

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
and I think it's probably a fault with

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.510 
and I think it's probably a fault with
OS<00:00:48.780> 10<00:00:49.140> leopard<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.829> it's<00:00:49.920> file<00:00:50.100> management

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
OS 10 leopard and it's file management

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.549 
OS 10 leopard and it's file management
system<00:00:50.940> then<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.020> computer<00:00:52.440> itself

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
system then it is the computer itself

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.779 
system then it is the computer itself
don't<00:00:53.010> like<00:00:53.100> something<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.460> keep<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.730> mind

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
don't like something to keep in mind

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.580 
don't like something to keep in mind
hopefully<00:00:54.480> they<00:00:54.600> upgrade<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.020> snow<00:00:55.079> leopard

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
hopefully they upgrade to snow leopard

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.770 
hopefully they upgrade to snow leopard
and<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.520> next<00:00:56.640> few<00:00:56.940> months<00:00:57.090> we'll<00:00:57.420> fix

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
and in the next few months we'll fix

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.080 
and in the next few months we'll fix
those<00:00:58.109> issues<00:00:58.410> when<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.370> boots<00:00:59.579> up<00:00:59.760> at<00:00:59.940> this

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
those issues when it boots up at this

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.779 
those issues when it boots up at this
day<00:01:00.270> on<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> blue<00:01:00.719> screen<00:01:00.989> for<00:01:01.199> quite<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> while

that I was going to use a lot knows the
reason<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.189> got<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.700> 2.4<00:01:12.330> gigahertz<00:01:12.740> but

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
reason that I got the 2.4 gigahertz but

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.170 
reason that I got the 2.4 gigahertz but
as<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.979> turns<00:01:14.189> out<00:01:14.310> i'm<00:01:14.430> really<00:01:14.610> not<00:01:14.729> using<00:01:15.090> the

as it turns out i'm really not using the

class<00:01:17.150> but<00:01:18.350> you<00:01:19.350> know<00:01:19.470> usually<00:01:19.680> it's<00:01:19.950> it's

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
class but you know usually it's it's

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.850 
class but you know usually it's it's
light<00:01:20.610> enough<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.240> i'm<00:01:21.930> not<00:01:22.049> even<00:01:22.110> utilized

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
light enough and i'm not even utilized

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.530 
light enough and i'm not even utilized
the<00:01:22.950> back<00:01:23.130> way<00:01:23.310> back<00:01:23.580> most<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.939> time<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.180> turned

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
the back way back most the time I turned

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.719 
the back way back most the time I turned
off<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.869> save<00:01:24.900> battery<00:01:25.159> so<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.250> new<00:01:26.369> trackpad

trackpad<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:29.369> thought<00:01:29.610> there<00:01:29.820> was<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> lot<00:01:30.150> of

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
trackpad I thought there was a lot of

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.240 
trackpad I thought there was a lot of
room<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.780> was<00:01:31.110> really<00:01:31.350> looking<00:01:31.799> forward<00:01:32.220> to

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
room I was really looking forward to

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.520 
room I was really looking forward to
using<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.610> gestures<00:01:33.119> as<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.930> turns<00:01:34.140> out<00:01:34.290> most

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
using the gestures as it turns out most

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.109 
using the gestures as it turns out most
of<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.710> time<00:01:34.950> now<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.189> use<00:01:35.400> an<00:01:35.520> external<00:01:35.850> mouse

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
of the time now I use an external mouse

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.929 
of the time now I use an external mouse
I<00:01:36.479> found<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.350> clicking<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.670> trackpad

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
I found the clicking on the trackpad

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.399 
I found the clicking on the trackpad
about<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.479> button<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> little<00:01:40.290> bit

and<00:03:21.170> this<00:03:21.739> day<00:03:21.920> as<00:03:22.069> i<00:03:22.160> showed<00:03:22.370> my<00:03:22.549> benchmark

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
and this day as i showed my benchmark

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.819 
and this day as i showed my benchmark
actually<00:03:23.540> runs<00:03:23.750> very<00:03:24.019> smoothly<00:03:24.380> and<00:03:24.560> really

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
actually runs very smoothly and really

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.280 
actually runs very smoothly and really
quickly<00:03:25.220> actually<00:03:25.819> runs<00:03:26.180> much<00:03:26.450> faster<00:03:26.480> than

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
quickly actually runs much faster than

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.080 
quickly actually runs much faster than
some<00:03:27.560> of<00:03:27.620> my<00:03:27.650> classmates<00:03:27.980> fully<00:03:28.760> loaded

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
some of my classmates fully loaded

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.599 
some of my classmates fully loaded
Dell's<00:03:30.049> that's<00:03:30.410> with<00:03:30.590> 4<00:03:30.829> gigabytes<00:03:31.250> of<00:03:31.400> ram

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
Dell's that's with 4 gigabytes of ram

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.190 
Dell's that's with 4 gigabytes of ram
and<00:03:31.639> even<00:03:32.090> some<00:03:32.269> with<00:03:32.420> solid<00:03:32.690> state<00:03:32.900> drives

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
and even some with solid state drives

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.050 
and even some with solid state drives
it's<00:03:33.769> really<00:03:33.920> gotta<00:03:34.160> give<00:03:34.340> credit<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:34.700> Apple

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
it's really gotta give credit to Apple

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.940 
it's really gotta give credit to Apple
for<00:03:35.180> building<00:03:35.420> a<00:03:35.450> great<00:03:35.630> machine<00:03:35.840> for<00:03:36.200> OS<00:03:36.380> 10<00:03:36.680> I

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
for building a great machine for OS 10 I

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.160 
for building a great machine for OS 10 I
also<00:03:37.340> a<00:03:37.459> great<00:03:37.700> machine<00:03:37.880> for<00:03:38.359> running<00:03:38.720> Windows

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
also a great machine for running Windows

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.460 
also a great machine for running Windows
if<00:03:39.500> that's<00:03:40.280> what<00:03:40.549> you<00:03:40.700> needed<00:03:40.970> to<00:03:41.120> do<00:03:41.359> so<00:03:42.230> I'm

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
if that's what you needed to do so I'm

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.229 
if that's what you needed to do so I'm
again<00:03:42.859> I've<00:03:42.980> been<00:03:43.010> really<00:03:43.639> happy<00:03:43.730> with<00:03:44.120> its

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
again I've been really happy with its

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.670 
again I've been really happy with its
performance<00:03:44.720> overall<00:03:45.019> I<00:03:45.079> couldn't<00:03:45.590> have

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
performance overall I couldn't have

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.410 
performance overall I couldn't have
asked<00:03:45.889> for<00:03:45.920> more<00:03:46.040> but<00:03:46.340> I<00:03:46.430> need<00:03:46.579> my<00:03:46.700> windows<00:03:47.120> I

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
asked for more but I need my windows I

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.509 
asked for more but I need my windows I
have<00:03:47.930> it<00:03:48.139> when<00:03:48.410> I<00:03:48.440> need<00:03:48.500> my<00:03:48.739> Mac<00:03:48.980> cookies<00:03:49.310> most

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
have it when I need my Mac cookies most

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.970 
have it when I need my Mac cookies most
of<00:03:49.609> the<00:03:49.670> time<00:03:49.880> I<00:03:50.150> have<00:03:50.630> that<00:03:50.810> too<00:03:50.870> I<00:03:51.350> have<00:03:51.859> not

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
of the time I have that too I have not

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.099 
of the time I have that too I have not
installed<00:03:52.220> parallels<00:03:52.819> or<00:03:53.060> vmware<00:03:53.090> fusion<00:03:53.630> on

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
installed parallels or vmware fusion on

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:55.900 
installed parallels or vmware fusion on
it<00:03:54.260> or<00:03:54.350> any<00:03:54.500> other<00:03:54.709> virtualization<00:03:55.430> software

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
it or any other virtualization software

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.250 
it or any other virtualization software
so<00:03:56.389> i<00:03:56.420> can't<00:03:56.720> speak<00:03:56.780> for<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:58.280> speed<00:03:58.579> of

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
so i can't speak for the speed of

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.539 
so i can't speak for the speed of
virtualization<00:04:00.260> on<00:04:00.350> the<00:04:00.440> machine<00:04:00.739> but<00:04:01.250> having

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
virtualization on the machine but having

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.190 
virtualization on the machine but having
only<00:04:01.639> two<00:04:01.730> gigabytes<00:04:02.269> of<00:04:02.420> ram<00:04:02.599> i<00:04:02.630> assume<00:04:03.049> that

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
only two gigabytes of ram i assume that

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.610 
only two gigabytes of ram i assume that
the<00:04:03.319> will<00:04:03.560> be<00:04:03.829> as<00:04:04.730> fast<00:04:05.239> as<00:04:05.569> native<00:04:06.290> booting

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
the will be as fast as native booting

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.039 
the will be as fast as native booting
and<00:04:07.030> probably<00:04:08.030> have<00:04:08.150> a<00:04:08.180> little<00:04:08.389> bit<00:04:08.540> of<00:04:08.569> slow

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
and probably have a little bit of slow

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.400 
and probably have a little bit of slow
down<00:04:09.079> due<00:04:09.470> to<00:04:09.500> ram

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
down due to ram

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.280 
down due to ram
