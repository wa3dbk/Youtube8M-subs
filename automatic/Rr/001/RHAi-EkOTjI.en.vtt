if it shows up except look yep you can

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.139 
if it shows up except look yep you can
see<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:48.960> there<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> series<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.550> those<00:00:50.760> around

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
see it there so a series of those around

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.779 
all the cylinders is holding the cowling
on<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:53.850> very<00:00:54.780> strong<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.500> soft<00:00:56.340> coupled

on and it's very strong and soft coupled
so<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.690> should<00:00:57.870> work<00:00:57.989> okay<00:01:02.059> and<00:01:03.059> as<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.359> can

you<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.250> see<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.759> little<00:01:18.630> bit<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:18.990> steel

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
you can see a little bit of that steel

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.859 
you can see a little bit of that steel
and<00:01:19.799> carriage<00:01:20.189> there<00:01:20.509> it's<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.570> little<00:01:21.689> bit

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
and carriage there it's a little bit

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.240 
and carriage there it's a little bit
heavier<00:01:22.170> than<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.409> grove<00:01:22.590> undercarriage<00:01:23.070> but

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
heavier than the grove undercarriage but

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.399 
heavier than the grove undercarriage but
it's<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.850> was<00:01:23.939> quite<00:01:24.210> inexpensive<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.259> make

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
it's it was quite inexpensive to make

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.649 
it's it was quite inexpensive to make
which<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.189> always<00:01:26.340> nice<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:28.040> very<00:01:29.040> strong<00:01:29.659> and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
which is always nice and very strong and

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.300 
which is always nice and very strong and
of<00:01:31.470> course<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.710> could<00:01:31.860> make<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.040> little<00:01:32.220> bit

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
of course I could make a little bit

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.740 
of course I could make a little bit
longer<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.700> clear<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.000> big<00:01:33.180> seventy<00:01:33.540> six

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750

just<00:01:35.369> loved<00:01:35.549> swinging<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.200> should<00:01:37.200> be<00:01:37.259> able<00:01:37.320> to

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
just loved swinging I should be able to

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.600 
just loved swinging I should be able to
get<00:01:37.530> some<00:01:37.680> serious<00:01:38.009> climb<00:01:38.250> out<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.490> this

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
get some serious climb out of this

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.020 
get some serious climb out of this
aircraft<00:01:38.820> with<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.360> engine<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.810> prop<00:01:41.030> so

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
aircraft with that engine and prop so

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.910 
aircraft with that engine and prop so
yeah<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.360> front<00:01:42.600> looks<00:01:42.750> I'm<00:01:43.409> very<00:01:43.710> pleased

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.139 
yeah the front looks I'm very pleased
with<00:01:44.100> how<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.220> Front's<00:01:44.490> come<00:01:44.670> up<00:01:44.790> there's<00:01:45.090> a

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
with how the Front's come up there's a

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.230 
with how the Front's come up there's a
big<00:01:45.299> prop<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:47.070> some<00:01:47.490> other<00:01:47.610> features<00:01:48.000> on<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
big prop and some other features on the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.289 
big prop and some other features on the
aircraft<00:01:48.659> as<00:01:48.960> we<00:01:49.079> go<00:01:49.259> around<00:01:49.970> all<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.000> these

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
aircraft as we go around all of these

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.289 
aircraft as we go around all of these
skins<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.899> fiberglass<00:01:52.520> I've<00:01:53.520> made<00:01:54.119> them

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
skins of fiberglass I've made them

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.899 
skins of fiberglass I've made them
myself<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:55.020> only<00:01:55.170> had<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.409> welders<00:01:56.310> usual<00:01:56.729> large

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
myself I only had a welders usual large

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.090 
myself I only had a welders usual large
frame<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.600> start<00:01:57.869> with<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.619> as<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.890> can<00:01:58.979> see

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
frame to start with and as you can see

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.770 
frame to start with and as you can see
the<00:01:59.189> side<00:01:59.399> profile<00:01:59.880> of<00:01:59.909> apply<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.299> quite<00:02:00.570> nice

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
the side profile of apply is quite nice

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.780 
the side profile of apply is quite nice
that<00:02:00.810> windscreens<00:02:01.530> weight<00:02:01.860> raked<00:02:02.310> forward

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
that windscreens weight raked forward

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.209 
that windscreens weight raked forward
significantly<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:04.409> gives<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.799> bit<00:02:04.950> more<00:02:05.130> of

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
significantly it gives it a bit more of

give<00:04:32.020> them<00:04:32.140> a<00:04:32.200> nice<00:04:32.350> rounded<00:04:32.830> shape<00:04:32.890> they're

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
give them a nice rounded shape they're

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.270 
give them a nice rounded shape they're
my<00:04:33.670> own<00:04:33.850> molds<00:04:34.300> and<00:04:34.420> patterns<00:04:34.750> for<00:04:34.930> those<00:04:35.280> and

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
my own molds and patterns for those and

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.760 
my own molds and patterns for those and
the<00:04:37.000> next<00:04:37.300> thing<00:04:37.720> I'm<00:04:37.870> working<00:04:38.200> on<00:04:38.350> is<00:04:38.560> these

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
the next thing I'm working on is these

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.190 
the next thing I'm working on is these
dummy<00:04:39.070> fairings<00:04:39.670> which<00:04:40.420> I've<00:04:40.600> made<00:04:40.780> patterns

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
dummy fairings which I've made patterns

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.160 
dummy fairings which I've made patterns
and<00:04:41.350> molds<00:04:41.620> for<00:04:41.770> again<00:04:42.100> I<00:04:42.840> really<00:04:43.840> should<00:04:43.990> call

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
and molds for again I really should call

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.660 
and molds for again I really should call
this<00:04:44.290> aircraft<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.800> glass<00:04:45.070> Fox<00:04:45.400> because

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
this aircraft the glass Fox because

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.820 
this aircraft the glass Fox because
there's<00:04:45.850> not<00:04:45.970> one<00:04:46.120> bit<00:04:46.270> of<00:04:46.360> metal<00:04:46.540> on<00:04:46.630> it<00:04:46.830> and

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
there's not one bit of metal on it and

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.820 
there's not one bit of metal on it and
these<00:04:48.040> fairings<00:04:48.520> will<00:04:48.670> get<00:04:49.410> glued<00:04:50.410> on<00:04:50.620> these

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
these fairings will get glued on these

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.670 
these fairings will get glued on these
on<00:04:51.070> the<00:04:51.280> original<00:04:51.310> struts<00:04:52.200> and<00:04:53.200> I'm<00:04:53.350> gonna<00:04:53.530> put

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
on the original struts and I'm gonna put

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.990 
on the original struts and I'm gonna put
fairings<00:04:54.040> over<00:04:54.310> this<00:04:54.460> I<00:04:54.610> think<00:04:54.670> all<00:04:54.880> these

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
fairings over this I think all these

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.610 
fairings over this I think all these
electra<00:04:55.390> details<00:04:55.750> really<00:04:55.930> make<00:04:56.170> it<00:04:56.320> plus<00:04:56.470> it's

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
electra details really make it plus it's

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.030 
electra details really make it plus it's
quite<00:04:56.770> enjoyable<00:04:57.070> I'm<00:04:57.340> in<00:04:57.460> no<00:04:57.580> hurry<00:04:58.860> so<00:04:59.860> yeah

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
quite enjoyable I'm in no hurry so yeah

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.890 
quite enjoyable I'm in no hurry so yeah
I've<00:05:00.160> got<00:05:00.340> basically<00:05:00.940> each<00:05:01.330> one<00:05:01.360> of<00:05:01.630> these<00:05:01.750> has

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
I've got basically each one of these has

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.230 
I've got basically each one of these has
been<00:05:01.930> relieved<00:05:02.800> so<00:05:03.160> it<00:05:03.490> fits<00:05:03.730> into<00:05:03.910> the<00:05:04.000> next

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
been relieved so it fits into the next

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.090 
been relieved so it fits into the next
one<00:05:04.420> and<00:05:04.810> I<00:05:04.930> can<00:05:05.110> epoxy<00:05:05.350> them<00:05:05.590> together<00:05:05.740> and

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
one and I can epoxy them together and

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.090 
one and I can epoxy them together and
glue<00:05:06.280> them<00:05:06.430> all<00:05:06.550> up<00:05:07.470> and<00:05:08.470> that<00:05:08.740> should<00:05:08.980> look

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
glue them all up and that should look

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.650
