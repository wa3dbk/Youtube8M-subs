00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
hi so Luca here for peak survival we are

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.940 
hi so Luca here for peak survival we are
continuing<00:00:03.060> our<00:00:03.240> segment<00:00:03.870> on<00:00:03.990> how<00:00:04.080> to<00:00:04.650> find

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
continuing our segment on how to find

North<00:00:05.279> without<00:00:05.940> using<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:06.540> compass<00:00:07.170> now<00:00:07.740> this

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
North without using a compass now this

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.680 
North without using a compass now this
is<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.370> ax<00:00:08.400> stick<00:00:08.849> method<00:00:09.059> there's<00:00:09.450> another

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
is the ax stick method there's another

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.749 
is the ax stick method there's another
version<00:00:10.080> where<00:00:10.440> you<00:00:10.500> can<00:00:10.830> use<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.070> string<00:00:11.580> as

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
version where you can use a string as

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.600 
version where you can use a string as
well<00:00:12.049> however<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.380> takes<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.799> whole<00:00:13.980> day<00:00:14.040> for

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
well however it takes a whole day for

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.550 
well however it takes a whole day for
that<00:00:14.700> method<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.389> it's<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.109> little<00:00:16.289> bit<00:00:16.379> more

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
that method and it's a little bit more

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.830 
that method and it's a little bit more
accurate<00:00:17.010> than<00:00:17.160> this<00:00:17.279> version<00:00:17.490> but<00:00:18.210> like<00:00:18.720> I

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
accurate than this version but like I

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.750 
accurate than this version but like I
said<00:00:19.080> it's<00:00:19.350> much<00:00:19.650> much<00:00:19.830> longer<00:00:20.070> but<00:00:20.430> this<00:00:20.580> is

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
said it's much much longer but this is

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.340 
said it's much much longer but this is
really<00:00:21.029> good<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:21.660> what<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.840> want<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.080> do<00:00:22.230> is

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
really good so what you want to do is

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.890 
really good so what you want to do is
find<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.680> stick<00:00:22.890> about<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.160> meter<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.939> length<00:00:24.000> not

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
find a stick about a meter in length not

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.130 
find a stick about a meter in length not
the<00:00:25.439> width<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.130> thumb<00:00:26.369> even<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.990> want

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
the width of a thumb even and you want

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.900 
the width of a thumb even and you want
to<00:00:28.230> strip<00:00:28.500> down<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:30.529> branches<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:31.850> now<00:00:32.850> you

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
to strip down the branches so now you

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.990 
to strip down the branches so now you
have<00:00:33.120> your<00:00:33.300> perfect<00:00:33.480> stick<00:00:34.430> I've<00:00:35.430> done<00:00:35.790> mine

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
have your perfect stick I've done mine

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.280 
have your perfect stick I've done mine
at<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.239> end<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.480> day<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:36.690> my<00:00:36.960> line<00:00:37.140> is

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
at the end of the day so my line is

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.110 
at the end of the day so my line is
gonna<00:00:37.380> be<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> lot<00:00:37.800> longer<00:00:38.219> but<00:00:38.610> if<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.820> do<00:00:38.940> this

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
gonna be a lot longer but if you do this

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.840 
gonna be a lot longer but if you do this
during<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.510> day<00:00:39.690> early<00:00:40.290> your<00:00:41.160> line<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.670> gonna

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
during the day early your line is gonna

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.630 
during the day early your line is gonna
be<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> lot<00:00:42.149> more<00:00:42.390> manageable<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.350> shorter<00:00:44.100> so

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
be a lot more manageable and shorter so

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.080 
be a lot more manageable and shorter so
you<00:00:44.910> stick<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.309> you<00:00:47.309> put<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> rock<00:00:47.820> at

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
you stick it in and you put a rock at

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.330 
you stick it in and you put a rock at
the<00:00:48.539> end<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.440> line<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.950> end<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
the end of the line the end of the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.630 
the end of the line the end of the
shadow<00:00:50.629> you<00:00:51.629> wait<00:00:51.809> 15<00:00:52.410> minutes<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.460> you're

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
shadow you wait 15 minutes and you're

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.299 
shadow you wait 15 minutes and you're
gonna<00:00:53.730> put<00:00:54.030> another<00:00:54.149> rock<00:00:54.719> at<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.920> end<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.190> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
gonna put another rock at the end of the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.920 
gonna put another rock at the end of the
shadow<00:00:56.550> now<00:00:57.180> time<00:00:57.539> has<00:00:58.910> passed<00:00:59.910> by<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.629> you're

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
shadow now time has passed by and you're

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.870 
shadow now time has passed by and you're
gonna<00:01:01.020> be<00:01:01.199> able<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.440> see<00:01:01.800> what<00:01:02.039> happens<00:01:02.489> here

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.420 

15<00:01:08.880> minutes<00:01:08.909> ago<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:10.320> shadow<00:01:10.650> line<00:01:10.950> was

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
15 minutes ago the shadow line was

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.109 
15 minutes ago the shadow line was
position<00:01:12.119> here<00:01:12.650> time<00:01:13.650> passed<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.460> now<00:01:14.790> it's

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
position here time passed and now it's

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.160 
position here time passed and now it's
located<00:01:15.960> here<00:01:16.520> how<00:01:17.520> do<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.850> find<00:01:18.210> direction

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
located here how do you find direction

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.749 
located here how do you find direction
well<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.979> place<00:01:20.280> your<00:01:20.580> left<00:01:20.850> foot<00:01:22.250> where<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
well you place your left foot where the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.120 
well you place your left foot where the
first<00:01:24.060> rock<00:01:24.420> was<00:01:24.630> position<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:28.130> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
first rock was position like so the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.499 
first rock was position like so the
second<00:01:29.579> indicator<00:01:30.420> here<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.829> are<00:01:32.009> facing

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
second indicator here you are facing

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.660 
second indicator here you are facing
north<00:01:33.530> now<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.920> for<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.280> northern

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
north now this is for the northern

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.410 
north now this is for the northern
hemisphere<00:01:35.790> South<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:37.470> reverse<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.150> so<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
hemisphere South you reverse it so the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.859 
hemisphere South you reverse it so the
first<00:01:39.720> foot<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.710> first<00:01:40.979> indicator<00:01:41.869> maybe

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
first foot on the first indicator maybe

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:43.660 
first foot on the first indicator maybe
you're<00:01:43.020> right

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
you're right

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.060 
you're right
and<00:01:44.670> then<00:01:45.000> second<00:01:45.570> here<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.680> southern

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
and then second here and in southern

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.490 
and then second here and in southern
hemisphere<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:48.030> would<00:01:48.299> be<00:01:48.450> north<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.350> it's

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
hemisphere this would be north so it's

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.350 
hemisphere this would be north so it's
really<00:01:49.740> easy<00:01:49.890> straightforward<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.939> wait<00:01:51.119> 15

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
really easy straightforward you wait 15

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.569 
really easy straightforward you wait 15
minutes<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.170> one<00:01:52.320> with<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.560> string<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.250> full

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
minutes the one with a string is a full

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.160 
minutes the one with a string is a full
day<00:01:53.610> but<00:01:54.240> it's<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.479> little<00:01:54.689> bit<00:01:54.840> more<00:01:54.990> accurate

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
day but it's a little bit more accurate

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.310 
day but it's a little bit more accurate
so<00:01:55.829> stay<00:01:56.340> tuned<00:01:56.610> for<00:01:56.640> one<00:01:57.030> more<00:01:57.240> video<00:01:57.450> on<00:01:57.780> how

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
so stay tuned for one more video on how

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.000 
so stay tuned for one more video on how
to<00:01:58.380> find<00:01:58.710> north<00:01:59.040> without<00:01:59.369> your<00:01:59.549> compass
