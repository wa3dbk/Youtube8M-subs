00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.210
 Ask us what number is represented with the blocks displayed? 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.620
 We could sit and count all these, but let's think a bit more constructive. 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.644
 How many blocks do we have in one cubicle? 

00:00:12.644 --> 00:00:13.490
 Well, let's see. 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.090
 It is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.560
 with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.250
 That's 10 times 10 squares. 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.890
 There are 100 blocks. 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.070
 So, that's 100. 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.640
 This is another 100, so we have two hundred. 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.540
 So, 200 blocks of these two. 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.650
 And then we'll count these here. 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:45.500
 We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 in each of these lines. 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.750
 And we have four rows. 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.310
 So 4 times per 10, that's 40. 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.820
 So, we have 200 and then 40 - 240 blocks. 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.250
 Let's check our answer. 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.370
 You may wonder what the purpose of this exercise is? 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.800
 Is not it just a block count exercise? 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.620
 But you may find something interesting here. 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.060
 When I write this two here, you will notice that it is not just number 2. 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.690
 She's a hundred, so this two actually represents number 200. 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.020
 Represents both blocks of blocks. 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.790
 This quadrant is not just a number 4. It stands at tenth place, and represents 40. 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.450
 Represents these four groups of dozens. 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.080
 These are two groups of stubs. 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.250
 These are four groups of dozens. 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.860
 Let's solve another one. 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.250
 Oh, this is interesting. 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.600
 Let's take the first hundred. 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.180
 So, we have one group of 100 out there, that's 100. 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.890
 And then, let's see, we have five groups per 10, so 150. 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.900
 And then we have only 4 blocks, so there are only 4. 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.740
 Let's make sure we're sure it's okay. 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.460
 We see this quadruple in place of the unit. 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.190
 So literally it represents 4 blocks. 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.260
 This pet is ten. It represents five groups per 10. 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.390
 - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.870
 And this unit is in place of a hundred. 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.410
 It represents a group of hundreds, this big cube here.
