00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
so I wanted to go over my fog light mod

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.680 
so I wanted to go over my fog light mod
for<00:00:04.170> the<00:00:04.589> FRS<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.730> car<00:00:05.970> did<00:00:06.180> not<00:00:06.210> come<00:00:06.540> with

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
for the FRS the car did not come with

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.570 
for the FRS the car did not come with
fog<00:00:06.899> lights<00:00:07.170> and<00:00:07.560> I<00:00:08.010> went<00:00:08.189> through<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.400> hassle

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
fog lights and I went through the hassle

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.390 
fog lights and I went through the hassle
of<00:00:09.150> installing<00:00:09.599> fog<00:00:10.590> lights<00:00:10.860> because<00:00:11.160> that's

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
of installing fog lights because that's

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.320 
of installing fog lights because that's
how<00:00:11.550> they<00:00:11.730> come<00:00:11.910> on<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.809> JDM<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.530> euro-spec

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
how they come on the JDM and euro-spec

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.370 
how they come on the JDM and euro-spec
cars<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:16.260> can<00:00:16.410> see<00:00:16.560> over<00:00:16.859> here<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:18.080> have<00:00:19.080> a

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
cars you can see over here I have a

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.279 
cars you can see over here I have a
custom<00:00:20.070> switch<00:00:20.539> that<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.570> installed<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.109> didn't

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
custom switch that I installed I didn't

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.420 
custom switch that I installed I didn't
do<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.380> very<00:00:22.529> good<00:00:22.619> job<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:23.039> drilling<00:00:23.310> out<00:00:23.400> the

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
do a very good job of drilling out the

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.060 
do a very good job of drilling out the
hole<00:00:23.670> but<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.029> worked<00:00:24.300> with<00:00:24.390> what<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.600> had<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.070> if

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
hole but I worked with what I had and if

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.970 
hole but I worked with what I had and if
you<00:00:26.369> do<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.390> illuminates<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.800> fog

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
you do that it illuminates and the fog

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:29.900 
you do that it illuminates and the fog
lights<00:00:29.220> are<00:00:29.369> on

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
lights are on

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.780 
lights are on
and<00:00:30.000> with<00:00:30.660> them<00:00:30.810> off<00:00:31.019> they<00:00:31.769> are<00:00:31.800> off<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.460> have<00:00:32.669> it

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
and with them off they are off I have it

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.900 
and with them off they are off I have it
wired<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:35.040> fog<00:00:35.430> lights<00:00:35.670> can<00:00:35.880> be

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
wired so that the fog lights can be

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.030 
wired so that the fog lights can be
enabled<00:00:36.180> with<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.570> car<00:00:36.780> off<00:00:37.020> if<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.890> ever

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
enabled with the car off if I ever

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.840 
enabled with the car off if I ever
needed<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:38.640> that

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
needed to do that

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.840 
needed to do that
so<00:00:39.559> here's<00:00:40.559> with<00:00:40.770> them<00:00:40.920> on<00:00:43.399> and<00:00:44.399> we'll<00:00:44.730> go

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
so here's with them on and we'll go

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.100 
so here's with them on and we'll go
around<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.270> front<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.629> car<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.020> you

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
around to the front of the car so you

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.529 
around to the front of the car so you
can<00:00:46.260> see<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.620> fog<00:00:46.860> lights<00:00:49.820> and<00:00:50.820> there<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.360> can

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
can see the fog lights and there you can

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.400 
can see the fog lights and there you can
see<00:00:52.850> see<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> fog<00:00:54.210> lights<00:00:54.480> set<00:00:54.660> up<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.350> I

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
see see the fog lights set up that I

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.529 
see see the fog lights set up that I
have<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:56.460> went<00:00:57.120> with<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.930> Forester<00:01:00.680> fog<00:01:01.680> lights

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
have I went with the Forester fog lights

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.950 
have I went with the Forester fog lights
instead<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.840> JDM<00:01:04.500> ones<00:01:04.769> or<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.909> well<00:01:06.810> yeah

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
instead of the JDM ones or the well yeah

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.580 
instead of the JDM ones or the well yeah
the<00:01:07.140> JDM<00:01:07.530> ones<00:01:07.799> or<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.250> BRZ<00:01:09.260> fog<00:01:10.260> lights

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
the JDM ones or the BRZ fog lights

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.390 
the JDM ones or the BRZ fog lights
because<00:01:11.040> they<00:01:11.250> were<00:01:11.310> more<00:01:11.580> expensive<00:01:13.400> and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
because they were more expensive and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.940 
because they were more expensive and
there<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.760> can<00:01:14.909> see<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.240> fitment<00:01:15.950> it's

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
there you can see the fitment it's

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.399 
there you can see the fitment it's
pretty<00:01:17.220> good<00:01:17.689> there<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> little<00:01:19.140> bit<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.350> a

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
pretty good there is a little bit of a

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.740 
pretty good there is a little bit of a
gap<00:01:19.619> but<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.490> believe<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.060> gap<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.570> there

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
gap but I believe the gap is in there

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:30.620 
gap but I believe the gap is in there
for<00:01:23.390> cooling<00:01:24.390> for<00:01:24.960> having<00:01:25.560> air<00:01:25.890> flow

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.840 

but<00:01:31.630> there<00:01:31.960> you<00:01:31.990> can<00:01:32.140> get<00:01:32.290> an<00:01:32.500> idea<00:01:32.650> of<00:01:33.070> what

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
but there you can get an idea of what

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.690 
but there you can get an idea of what
they<00:01:34.000> look<00:01:34.120> like<00:01:34.180> with<00:01:34.480> the<00:01:34.570> fog<00:01:34.780> lights<00:01:34.810> and

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
they look like with the fog lights and

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.150 
they look like with the fog lights and
how<00:01:36.700> I<00:01:36.730> have<00:01:36.970> everything<00:01:37.210> wired<00:01:37.510> up<00:01:37.780> I<00:01:38.080> have<00:01:39.040> it

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
how I have everything wired up I have it

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.470 
how I have everything wired up I have it
using<00:01:39.460> a<00:01:39.550> relay<00:01:39.940> and<00:01:41.520> yeah<00:01:42.520> that's<00:01:42.760> it<00:01:42.940> I<00:01:43.150> mean

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
using a relay and yeah that's it I mean

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.970 
using a relay and yeah that's it I mean
it's<00:01:43.690> uh<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:46.450> wasn't<00:01:46.660> very<00:01:46.870> easy<00:01:47.350> to<00:01:47.560> install

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
it's uh it wasn't very easy to install

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.400 
it's uh it wasn't very easy to install
them<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:49.450> switch<00:01:49.690> was<00:01:49.870> kind<00:01:50.050> of<00:01:50.080> a<00:01:50.200> pain<00:01:50.380> to

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
them the switch was kind of a pain to

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.970 
them the switch was kind of a pain to
wire<00:01:50.710> up<00:01:50.940> but<00:01:51.940> other<00:01:52.210> than<00:01:52.360> that<00:01:52.570> I<00:01:53.170> love

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
wire up but other than that I love

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.410 
wire up but other than that I love
having<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:54.340> extra<00:01:55.170> extra<00:01:56.170> lighting<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:57.420> so
