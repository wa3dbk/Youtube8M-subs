00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 and still locked mode you can 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.920
 rub this face and 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.480
 and the smartphone will fly a genie to pin down or 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.970
 Internet and mobile networks is droid 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.400
 er.ru how do right before the exhibition 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.049
 mvc 2015 where we went 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.790
 record fresh reviews 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.619
 to our office got here such here 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.300
 strange cube then many of you 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.070
 make your assumptions about what 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.960
 inside who sent it, we also had 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.380
 our versions and finally we decided 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.300
 write down 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.990
 special videos about it all 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.160
 drove the box opened strongly on March 1 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.230
 there seems to be there 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.620
 magnetic lock and how many 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.860
 supposed inside turned out to be flagship 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.559
 smartphone from samsung galaxy s6 and 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.270
 two variations at once galaxy s6 edge and 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.059
 galaxy s6 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.039
 just not f and since we have such 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.780
 combo we decided to make a comparison of two 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.579
 devices because city ​​has a lot of questions 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.399
 about how they differ except 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.930
 own design let's try but 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.579
 However , design and start from this 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.109
 nowhere to go both smartphone 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.059
 developed inside the corporation 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.879
 samsung from scratch called it all 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.199
 mysterious words project zero both 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.330
 gadget have not afraid of that word 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.610
 very premium metal bow 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.040
 circle frame and gorilla glass 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.990
 front panel and back panel too but 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.270
 as we see galaxy s6 edge has 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.759
 angled display and how 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.229
 a consequence of a frame of a slightly different shape she 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.110
 thinner and the smartphone itself externally 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.970
 looks thinner than his fellow at the same time 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.070
 in fact, it is thick in two 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.930
 tenths of a millimeter more days 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.180
 droplets are not noticeable at the same time due to 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.130
 these bends on the edge frame looks 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.259
 much more interesting and somehow more 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.810
 stylish mainly characteristics 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.689
 devices are the same and what are they 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.390
 probably the brightest spot on the list 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.790
 specifications of this pair of smartphones it 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.140
 screen for 5 1 inch made by technology 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.750
 super amoled 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.520
 qhd resolution viewing angles and 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.500
 contrast and brightness are all here in 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.290
 okay more I would say that in 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.110
 difference from past flagships from samsung 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.030
 here they didn’t make such vigorous colors 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.159
 much closer to reality for life and this 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.890
 happy inside your own processors 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.299
 exynos eight-core lineup with 6 four 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.190
 bit architecture and made by 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.690
 14 nanometer technology also 3 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.680
 gigabyte ddr4 RAM is more 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.190
 with ladders then there are three options 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.170
 internal memory 32 64 or 128 gigabytes 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.940
 Micro SD card can not be inserted 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.770
 the case is not collapsible also 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.930
 replace the battery but present 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.470
 fast charge function and there is 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.050
 wireless charging put puma puma 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.390
 charging in addition with support for Acad 6 and 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.270
 dial sensor is heart rate monitor infrared 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.220
 port and fingerprint sensor it 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.170
 fixed now no need for a button 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.750
 top down is easy enough 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.630
 click let's check how it works 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.670
 click here and the smartphone is unlocked 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.650
 no matter what angle you put your finger 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.170
 more convenient and correct this works 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.340
 sensor than in galaxy s5 now than 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.680
 different characteristics well firstly 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.930
 again the display it has the same 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.580
 diagonal and resolution but at the edges 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.500
 it is bent a little and it does not reach 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.770
 the very edge of the device that you are comfortable 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.200
 your tips of your body and fingers are n't 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.820
 you touch the screen and do not provoke the whales 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.030
 extra presses and second difference before 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.930
 battery capacity in galaxy s6 edge 2600 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.030
 milliampere hours in galaxy s6 2550 50 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.280
 the bag is not such a big difference apparently 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.110
 an opportunity appeared in this corps for 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.840
 court battery a little bit more 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.840
 now the camera first both of them have 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.250
 aperture 1 and 9 and that means that the sensor 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.050
 gets more light and snapshots 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.900
 get better quality frontalka 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.340
 a 5 megapixel main camera 16 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.800
 megapixels made a cool chip 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.500
 To start you need to double click on 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.510
 the main button and the bob starts 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.610
 the camera these things were before but me 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.920
 still like what you can do 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.780
 hao and the camera sees your palm 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.550
 idiot automatically snapshot photos by 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.110
 The first sensations are good and 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.570
 this screen looks very cool 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.090
 feel high definition see 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.670
 which watch is actually a super plan 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.630
 details of what kinds of friends can read 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:04.060
 this tag is 59fifty its size is 7 and 1 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.739
 quarter is the size per head diameter 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.600
 frontalka 5 megapixels too well done 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.580
 see a huge black metal this one in 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.790
 light source we did not succeed all 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.220
 the details are preserved another important thing 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.970
 This is a new touch visa or she shell 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.920
 made on android 5.0 lollipop looks 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.720
 cleanly got rid of doubtful 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.120
 creative design and application 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.100
 implemented in material design so 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.410
 orange dialer green android 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.230
 it works smoothly 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.360
 synergy of new software and new hardware 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.860
 multitasking starts quickly and 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.230
 The following important difference unit 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.020
 It is connected with the software in the first place 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.840
 feature favorite contacts or friends on 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.790
 s6 edge it is called like this 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.640
 wipe right side of the top 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.810
 screen and we see here a list of five 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.970
 selected friends 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.980
 you fill this list yourself 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.320
 You can click on anyone of them do 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.080
 call send a message or just 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.180
 remember the name of this person except 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.160
 this is tied to each contact 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.530
 one of these colors 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.120
 let's check this call from 1 of 6 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.010
 on the other to what is the first similar 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.200
 Up in Russia was 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.390
 we hear the lips and see these 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.210
 clubs and play it means that 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.860
 Smartphone tells who exactly of 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.540
 your friends are calling and more 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.680
 locked mode can be rubbed 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.570
 here is this line and 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.270
 And a genie will fly out of the smartphone 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.170
 even with the notification panel 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.060
 scroll by the way missed call 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.340
 preserved saw such a small dates 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.140
 The stripes on the side can be pulled up and 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.770
 get all the information about it 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.360
 missed call 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.100
 another curious feature of curved 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.500
 screens by the way here the settings are straight 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.810
 a special section for this is called 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.580
 night hours and I liked this trick 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.980
 the idea is that you set an approximate 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.770
 the range in which you sleep for example with 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.060
 eight in the evening to 6 in the morning while you sleep 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.950
 here will be neatly with weak 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.750
 backlit time woke up 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.670
 because of the crash on the street which looked 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.260
 an hour and went on here are the chips 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.520
 came up with for this curved screen 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.500
 I must say that everyone else 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.900
 applications naturally do not know about it 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.380
 and therefore stretch the entire diagonal 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.230
 screen 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.210
 it looks very unusual for example 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.640
 when viewing the text also when 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.530
 viewing photos or video clips 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.480
 it is a little torn template one more 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.680
 the difference is the price of galaxy s6 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.620
 it is known that most likely she will 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.390
 start from about 50,000 rubles a 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.980
 about galaxy s6 edge representatives 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.320
 samsung say the price will be 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.450
 differ by 5-7 thousand rubles that is 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.569
 not as critical as I thought 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.399
 initially 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:30.979
 almost all points of contention that 

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:33.379
 were at the galaxy s line fixed 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:35.719
 great design now good materials 

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:37.610
 great stuff right direction 

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:40.129
 worked on the firmware for the first time ruler 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.110
 consists of two different devices 

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:44.179
 quite significant design and 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.949
 Partly functional, you can see that samsung 

00:06:44.179 --> 00:06:48.199
 wants to convince users that 

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:50.179
 here is this idea with a concave screen she 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:52.099
 what exactly is the flagship should 

00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:53.449
 have such a feature look 

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:55.639
 will it succeed but let me remind you again 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:57.319
 The main differences 1 is more interesting 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:59.479
 second design is a little bigger 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:01.189
 battery the third is chips implemented 

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:02.629
 with the help of these bends on it all with 

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:03.020
 you were Boris Veda and Valerie 

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:05.449
 shesha 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:09.169
 as well as our friends today galaxy 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:10.849
 s6 and galaxy s6 edge from samsung write 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:13.759
 comments which device you liked 

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:15.110
 more what chips and features you 

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:16.610
 seem more interesting
