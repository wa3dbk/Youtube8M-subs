00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.329
 in the general assembly 

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:12.919
 mmmmm 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.210
 efe 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.340
 apple after the delays 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.740
 and after 15 days lighten from the apple version 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.180
 here we can see the new presentation 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.580
 that replaces the previous recall that had been 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.330
 accused of plagiarism 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.460
 we can see this new presentation inside 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.970
 and once the athletics is turned on let's say that the menu changes 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.010
 a more minimalist menu 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.010
 but much easier to handle 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.430
 if we look at the movements are fluid we move through the options 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.430
 main 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.200
 the truth is that it works very fast rather better than the previous one 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.050
 and once days within the options it is displayed that are displayed 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.730
 we can 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.510
 continue moving through the menus and wind the functions that unfolds 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.350
 one of the things that strikes me the most is the new music option 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
 inside we find the best of music 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.869
 and the best of music is nothing more and nothing less than the itunes this 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.630
 with a very comfortable interface 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.630
 let's go into it 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.990
 let's go into music 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.990
 the best music 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:15.679
 we open 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:17.289
 the interface 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:20.779
 new titles for apple tibi 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:23.779
 peris rooms from album covers 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.659
 organization 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.379
 not in the way we are used to in landmarks 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.089
 a simple click to preview the holidays 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.619
 and we can access the purchase 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:44.379
 or just to listen to a fragment from the track as they would do the 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.119
 program of our computer 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:50.769
 right now we are studying that 30-second fragment 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.039
 we can go back keep watching 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:58.039
 the outstanding students 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:02.059
 inside the music action 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:05.059
 we can also move podcasts ovation 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.099
 and in the same way we can subscribe compotes 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:14.680
 oo one thing that I find much more interesting than adding a potash 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:17.019
 favorites 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.990
 and from favorite without making the download can preview 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.120
 well, kuchar 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.789
