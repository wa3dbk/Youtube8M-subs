00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.940 
really impressed me about this game was
the<00:01:21.509> fact<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:21.960> there's<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.530> much<00:01:22.679> detail

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the fact that there's so much detail

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.370 
the fact that there's so much detail
crammed<00:01:23.640> into<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.060> character<00:01:24.420> models<00:01:24.810> you

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
crammed into the character models you

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.319 
crammed into the character models you
can<00:01:25.409> also<00:01:25.649> update<00:01:26.009> your<00:01:26.249> technologies<00:01:27.030> and

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
can also update your technologies and

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.120 
can also update your technologies and
really<00:01:27.659> improve<00:01:28.020> your<00:01:28.229> chances<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:28.829> battle

really improve your chances in battle

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.590 
really improve your chances in battle
but<00:01:29.310> overall<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.759> just<00:01:30.090> thought<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.420> was<00:01:30.569> a

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
but overall I just thought this was a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.660 
but overall I just thought this was a
really<00:01:30.990> fun<00:01:31.380> application<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.159> pick<00:01:32.340> up<00:01:32.490> and

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
really fun application to pick up and

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.580 
really fun application to pick up and
play<00:01:32.850> around<00:01:33.119> with<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:33.960> one<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.350> best

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
play around with it's one of the best
