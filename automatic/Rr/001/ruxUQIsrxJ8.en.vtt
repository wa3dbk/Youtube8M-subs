00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
hi everyone today I'm going to show you

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.090 
hi everyone today I'm going to show you
how<00:00:10.370> to<00:00:10.430> do<00:00:10.820> um<00:00:11.240> some<00:00:11.990> of<00:00:12.110> the<00:00:12.260> woven<00:00:12.500> patterns

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:13.100 
how to do um some of the woven patterns

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.299 
how to do um some of the woven patterns
that<00:00:13.309> are<00:00:13.430> out<00:00:13.580> there<00:00:14.799> the<00:00:15.799> two<00:00:16.039> that<00:00:16.250> I

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
that are out there the two that I

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.349 
that are out there the two that I
generally<00:00:16.850> do<00:00:17.330> are<00:00:17.830> hugging's<00:00:18.830> and<00:00:19.160> w2<00:00:19.730> they

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359 
generally do are hugging's and w2 they

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:22.510 
generally do are hugging's and w2 they
are<00:00:20.630> from<00:00:20.930> zentangle<00:00:21.859> com

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
are from zentangle com

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.759 
are from zentangle com
I<00:00:22.570> believe<00:00:23.570> there<00:00:23.779> are<00:00:23.869> some<00:00:24.439> of<00:00:24.589> the<00:00:24.679> original

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
I believe there are some of the original

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.759 
I believe there are some of the original
patterns<00:00:25.490> that<00:00:26.029> are<00:00:26.150> out<00:00:26.269> there<00:00:26.589> and<00:00:27.589> I<00:00:27.710> know

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
patterns that are out there and I know

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.939 
patterns that are out there and I know
I've<00:00:28.070> seen<00:00:28.339> a<00:00:28.369> lot<00:00:28.519> of<00:00:28.580> people<00:00:29.029> ask<00:00:29.890> how<00:00:30.890> you

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
I've seen a lot of people ask how you

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.100 
I've seen a lot of people ask how you
keep<00:00:31.220> track<00:00:31.490> how<00:00:31.759> are<00:00:31.880> they<00:00:31.999> done<00:00:32.270> are<00:00:32.810> they

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
keep track how are they done are they

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.780 
keep track how are they done are they
hard<00:00:33.380> um<00:00:34.780> there's<00:00:35.780> just<00:00:35.900> a<00:00:36.590> lot<00:00:37.220> to<00:00:37.520> remember

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
hard um there's just a lot to remember

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.070 
hard um there's just a lot to remember
when<00:00:38.120> you're<00:00:38.270> doing<00:00:38.300> them<00:00:38.750> they're<00:00:38.930> not

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
when you're doing them they're not

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.870 
when you're doing them they're not
really<00:00:39.290> hard<00:00:39.680> but<00:00:40.010> you<00:00:40.100> kind<00:00:40.370> of<00:00:40.460> have<00:00:40.640> to<00:00:40.670> come

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 
really hard but you kind of have to come

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.390 
really hard but you kind of have to come
up<00:00:40.910> with<00:00:41.090> a<00:00:41.150> system<00:00:41.630> so<00:00:42.560> I've<00:00:42.890> come<00:00:43.160> up<00:00:43.190> with<00:00:43.370> a

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
up with a system so I've come up with a

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.490 
up with a system so I've come up with a
little<00:00:43.700> system<00:00:44.090> we're<00:00:44.480> going<00:00:44.570> to<00:00:44.630> do<00:00:44.840> W<00:00:45.320> 2

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
little system we're going to do W 2

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.060 
little system we're going to do W 2
which<00:00:45.800> is<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:47.180> straighter<00:00:47.800> version<00:00:48.800> of<00:00:48.950> it

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
which is the straighter version of it

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.230 
which is the straighter version of it
Huggins<00:00:49.580> is<00:00:49.850> very<00:00:50.120> similar<00:00:50.420> it's<00:00:50.780> just<00:00:50.840> curved

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.240 
Huggins is very similar it's just curved

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.360 
Huggins is very similar it's just curved
and<00:00:53.240> I<00:00:53.420> usually<00:00:53.870> start<00:00:54.170> out<00:00:54.400> with<00:00:57.370> drawing

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
and I usually start out with drawing

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:06.340 
and I usually start out with drawing
some<00:00:58.610> squares

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.350 

you<00:01:07.350> want<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.979> try<00:01:08.310> when<00:01:09.090> you're<00:01:09.210> practicing

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
you want to try when you're practicing

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.940 
you want to try when you're practicing
this<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.440> try<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.740> keep<00:01:10.979> them<00:01:12.350> even<00:01:13.350> an

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
this to just try to keep them even an

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.210 
this to just try to keep them even an
equal<00:01:14.310> distance<00:01:14.700> apart<00:01:15.650> and<00:01:16.650> later<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:17.070> you

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
equal distance apart and later on you

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.210 
equal distance apart and later on you
can<00:01:17.340> fool<00:01:17.549> around<00:01:17.700> with<00:01:18.920> putting<00:01:19.920> them<00:01:20.070> in

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
can fool around with putting them in

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.719 
can fool around with putting them in
different<00:01:21.290> distances<00:01:22.290> from<00:01:22.350> each<00:01:22.649> other<00:01:22.890> for

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
different distances from each other for

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:35.890 
different distances from each other for
different<00:01:24.060> configurations

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.620 

it<00:01:36.900> doesn't<00:01:37.409> really<00:01:37.590> matter<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.310> me<00:01:38.600> how<00:01:39.600> I

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
it doesn't really matter to me how I

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.500 
it doesn't really matter to me how I
start<00:01:40.170> if<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.500> start<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.220> outside<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.180> set

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
start if I start on the outside of a set

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.570 
start if I start on the outside of a set
of<00:01:42.630> squares<00:01:42.960> or<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.350> inside<00:01:43.890> but<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.159> just<00:01:44.430> try

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
of squares or the inside but I just try

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.320 
of squares or the inside but I just try
to<00:01:44.610> be<00:01:44.850> consistent<00:01:46.310> so<00:01:47.310> if<00:01:47.580> you<00:01:47.759> start<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
to be consistent so if you start on the

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.480 
to be consistent so if you start on the
outside<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.930> make<00:01:49.020> your<00:01:49.200> first<00:01:49.409> line<00:01:49.770> on<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
outside and make your first line on the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.490 
outside and make your first line on the
outside<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.060> squares<00:01:51.420> you're<00:01:52.320> going<00:01:52.440> to

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
outside of the squares you're going to

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.580 
outside of the squares you're going to
alternate<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.280> next<00:01:53.670> line<00:01:54.300> will<00:01:54.540> be<00:01:54.720> on<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
alternate the next line will be on the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.350 
alternate the next line will be on the
inside<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.250> then<00:01:56.970> you're<00:01:57.210> going<00:01:57.300> to

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
inside and then you're going to

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.200 
inside and then you're going to
alternate<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:57.960> outside<00:01:58.380> again<00:01:59.090> when<00:02:00.090> it

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
alternate to the outside again when it

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.090 
alternate to the outside again when it
comes<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.720> next<00:02:00.869> row<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.440> usually<00:02:01.890> work

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
comes to the next row and I usually work

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.010 
comes to the next row and I usually work
in<00:02:02.280> rows<00:02:04.159> you<00:02:05.159> look<00:02:05.460> at<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.820> row<00:02:06.330> before<00:02:06.600> that

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
in rows you look at the row before that

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.340 
in rows you look at the row before that
you<00:02:07.110> just<00:02:07.320> did<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.830> if<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.489> on<00:02:09.350> the

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
you just did and if this is on the

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.920 
you just did and if this is on the
outside<00:02:10.910> you're<00:02:11.910> going<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.150> mirror<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:12.480> over

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
outside you're going to mirror that over

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.050 
outside you're going to mirror that over
on<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.470> next<00:02:13.620> rail<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.130> make<00:02:14.220> this<00:02:14.580> one<00:02:14.910> on

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
on the next rail and make this one on

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.900 
on the next rail and make this one on
the<00:02:15.150> outside<00:02:15.440> then<00:02:16.440> alternate<00:02:17.070> inside<00:02:17.580> and

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
the outside then alternate inside and

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.900 
the outside then alternate inside and
then<00:02:18.390> outside<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.890> coming<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.430> next<00:02:20.730> row

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
then outside and coming to the next row

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.000 
then outside and coming to the next row
you're<00:02:21.120> going<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.300> look<00:02:21.480> over<00:02:21.630> here<00:02:22.110> this<00:02:22.739> one

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
you're going to look over here this one

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.979 
you're going to look over here this one
is<00:02:23.130> on<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.310> inside<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:24.690> you're<00:02:24.840> going<00:02:24.959> to

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
is on the inside so you're going to

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.190 
is on the inside so you're going to
mirror<00:02:25.260> this<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.769> make<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:25.890> on<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.190> inside

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
mirror this and make it on the inside

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.340 
mirror this and make it on the inside
outside<00:02:28.250> inside<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:30.300> last<00:02:30.569> one<00:02:30.810> is<00:02:31.019> going

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
to be on the outside and you alternate

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.280 
to be on the outside and you alternate
you<00:02:36.120> could<00:02:36.300> turn<00:02:36.420> your<00:02:36.660> paper<00:02:36.870> when<00:02:37.170> you're

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
you could turn your paper when you're

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.370 
you could turn your paper when you're
ready<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.590> do<00:02:40.370> connecting<00:02:41.370> them<00:02:41.549> and<00:02:42.320> this<00:02:43.320> is

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
ready to do connecting them and this is

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.610 
ready to do connecting them and this is
the<00:02:43.590> part<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.100> I<00:02:44.130> had<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.549> hardest<00:02:44.880> with<00:02:45.620> how

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
the part that I had the hardest with how

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.340 
the part that I had the hardest with how
do<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.860> know<00:02:47.420> where<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.570> make<00:02:48.750> your<00:02:48.989> first

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
do you know where to make your first

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.380 
do you know where to make your first
line<00:02:49.709> well<00:02:50.519> I<00:02:50.820> try<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.840> remember<00:02:52.440> if<00:02:53.030> these<00:02:54.030> are

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
line well I try to remember if these are

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.949 
line well I try to remember if these are
on<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.840> outside<00:02:55.410> of<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.650> squares<00:02:56.420> my<00:02:57.420> first

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
on the outside of the squares my first

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.410 
on the outside of the squares my first
line<00:02:58.320> is<00:02:58.739> going<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.430> be<00:02:59.549> opposite<00:02:59.940> of<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.209> on

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
line is going to be opposite of that on

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.830 
line is going to be opposite of that on
the<00:03:00.600> inside<00:03:00.989> of<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.140> squares<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:03.480> then<00:03:03.780> I'm

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
the inside of the squares and then I'm

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.680 
the inside of the squares and then I'm
going<00:03:04.019> to<00:03:04.049> alternate<00:03:04.530> again<00:03:04.799> outside<00:03:05.690> inside

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
going to alternate again outside inside

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.380 
going to alternate again outside inside
you<00:03:07.290> can<00:03:07.470> start<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.769> see<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.070> pattern

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
you can start to see the pattern

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.230 
you can start to see the pattern
emerging

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.260 

I<00:03:17.470> still<00:03:18.470> make<00:03:19.130> mistakes<00:03:19.160> all<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.880> time<00:03:20.060> doing

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
I still make mistakes all the time doing

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.050 
I still make mistakes all the time doing
this<00:03:20.540> because<00:03:20.780> I<00:03:21.230> start<00:03:21.560> to<00:03:22.040> my<00:03:22.430> mind<00:03:22.670> starts

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
this because I start to my mind starts

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.800 
this because I start to my mind starts
to<00:03:23.120> wander<00:03:23.390> not<00:03:24.320> paying<00:03:24.590> attention<00:03:25.750> so<00:03:26.750> you

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
to wander not paying attention so you

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.570 
to wander not paying attention so you
could<00:03:27.020> see<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.320> pattern<00:03:27.530> there

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
could see the pattern there

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.870 
could see the pattern there
woven<00:03:29.090> looks<00:03:29.780> like<00:03:29.960> basket<00:03:30.470> weave<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:30.950> it

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
woven looks like basket weave and it

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.640 
woven looks like basket weave and it
looks<00:03:32.090> like<00:03:32.180> this<00:03:32.660> is<00:03:32.990> going<00:03:33.320> underneath

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
looks like this is going underneath

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.460 
looks like this is going underneath
these<00:03:33.950> two<00:03:34.190> that<00:03:34.340> are<00:03:34.460> coming<00:03:34.760> straight<00:03:35.000> down

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
these two that are coming straight down

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.910 
these two that are coming straight down
so<00:03:36.470> to<00:03:37.460> give<00:03:37.610> it<00:03:37.730> a<00:03:37.790> little<00:03:37.970> bit<00:03:38.150> more<00:03:38.360> gap<00:03:38.920> you

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
so to give it a little bit more gap you

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.170 
so to give it a little bit more gap you
can<00:03:39.950> shade<00:03:40.400> with<00:03:40.730> your<00:03:40.850> pencil<00:03:43.030> along<00:03:44.030> the

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
can shade with your pencil along the

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.960 
can shade with your pencil along the
edges<00:03:44.570> that<00:03:45.070> that<00:03:46.070> looks<00:03:46.310> like<00:03:46.490> that<00:03:46.700> woven

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
edges that that looks like that woven

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:54.370 
edges that that looks like that woven
piece<00:03:47.330> is<00:03:47.570> coming<00:03:47.780> out<00:03:47.990> from<00:03:48.110> underneath<00:03:53.380> you

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
piece is coming out from underneath you

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.990 
piece is coming out from underneath you
can<00:03:54.530> also<00:03:54.680> fill<00:03:55.040> in<00:03:55.070> your<00:03:55.250> squares<00:03:55.610> a<00:03:55.730> little

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
can also fill in your squares a little

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:13.580 
can also fill in your squares a little
bit<00:03:56.090> better<00:03:56.240> than<00:03:56.510> I<00:03:56.600> have

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.860 

you

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.950 

and<00:04:19.870> when<00:04:20.560> you<00:04:20.620> come<00:04:20.829> in<00:04:20.949> to<00:04:20.979> blend<00:04:21.459> I<00:04:21.840> kind<00:04:22.840> of

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
and when you come in to blend I kind of

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.920 
and when you come in to blend I kind of
go<00:04:23.770> with<00:04:24.310> what<00:04:24.909> I<00:04:24.939> think<00:04:25.090> is<00:04:25.449> going<00:04:25.599> to<00:04:25.689> be<00:04:25.810> the

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
go with what I think is going to be the

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.240 
go with what I think is going to be the
direction<00:04:26.439> of<00:04:28.169> that<00:04:29.169> this<00:04:29.349> is<00:04:29.379> a<00:04:29.560> basket<00:04:30.750> and

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
direction of that this is a basket and

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.730 
direction of that this is a basket and
the<00:04:33.250> read<00:04:33.990> because<00:04:34.990> that's<00:04:35.110> what<00:04:35.319> it<00:04:35.409> reminds

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
the read because that's what it reminds

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:56.470 
the read because that's what it reminds
me<00:04:35.949> of

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.960 

and<00:04:57.480> that's<00:04:57.690> all<00:04:57.870> there<00:04:57.960> really<00:04:58.110> is<00:04:58.260> to<00:04:58.380> it<00:04:58.970> it

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
and that's all there really is to it it

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.879 
and that's all there really is to it it
just<00:05:00.360> takes<00:05:00.570> a<00:05:00.690> little<00:05:00.840> it<00:05:01.169> took<00:05:01.410> a<00:05:01.500> lot<00:05:01.680> of

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
just takes a little it took a lot of

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.469 
just takes a little it took a lot of
concentration<00:05:02.070> for<00:05:02.610> me<00:05:02.880> when<00:05:03.030> I<00:05:03.060> was<00:05:03.300> first

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
concentration for me when I was first

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.500 
concentration for me when I was first
started<00:05:04.199> to<00:05:04.320> do<00:05:04.470> these<00:05:04.650> patterns<00:05:04.919> and<00:05:05.510> Huggins

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
started to do these patterns and Huggins

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.650 
started to do these patterns and Huggins
throws<00:05:06.810> me<00:05:07.050> because<00:05:07.440> it's<00:05:07.680> curved<00:05:08.040> I<00:05:08.660> don't

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
throws me because it's curved I don't

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.000 
throws me because it's curved I don't
know<00:05:09.750> why<00:05:09.900> the<00:05:09.960> curve<00:05:10.260> would<00:05:10.410> throw<00:05:10.650> you<00:05:10.710> but

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
know why the curve would throw you but

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.600 
know why the curve would throw you but
it<00:05:11.130> does

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
it does

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.580 
it does
and<00:05:12.620> with<00:05:13.620> Huggins<00:05:14.010> I<00:05:14.220> usually<00:05:14.669> start<00:05:14.970> with

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
and with Huggins I usually start with

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:31.210 
and with Huggins I usually start with
circles

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.680 

and<00:05:31.340> it's<00:05:32.000> the<00:05:32.120> same<00:05:32.560> concept<00:05:33.560> if<00:05:34.210> you<00:05:35.210> start

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
and it's the same concept if you start

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.540 
and it's the same concept if you start
your<00:05:36.380> first<00:05:36.650> curve<00:05:37.840> towards<00:05:38.840> the<00:05:38.990> outside

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
your first curve towards the outside

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.870 
your first curve towards the outside
you're<00:05:40.550> going<00:05:40.670> to<00:05:40.730> alternate<00:05:42.160> curving<00:05:43.160> in<00:05:43.370> and

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
you're going to alternate curving in and

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.300 
you're going to alternate curving in and
then<00:05:44.300> curving<00:05:44.720> out<00:05:44.840> again<00:05:45.140> and<00:05:45.380> you're<00:05:46.130> going

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
then curving out again and you're going

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.150 
then curving out again and you're going
to<00:05:46.430> look<00:05:46.730> to<00:05:47.000> this<00:05:47.300> one<00:05:47.600> when<00:05:48.380> you<00:05:48.500> do<00:05:48.650> this<00:05:48.830> row

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
to look to this one when you do this row

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:57.130 
to look to this one when you do this row
so<00:05:49.460> let's<00:05:50.450> out<00:05:50.720> in<00:05:51.880> out<00:05:53.110> this<00:05:54.110> one<00:05:54.350> is<00:05:54.500> in<00:05:56.140> out

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
so let's out in out this one is in out

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.030 
so let's out in out this one is in out
in<00:05:57.620> and<00:05:58.960> that<00:05:59.960> one<00:06:00.140> is<00:06:00.260> out<00:06:00.440> and<00:06:00.650> this<00:06:00.800> is<00:06:00.860> the

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:01.040 
in and that one is out and this is the

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:08.380 
in and that one is out and this is the
one<00:06:01.280> I<00:06:01.310> always<00:06:01.640> mess<00:06:01.850> up<00:06:06.490> when<00:06:07.490> you<00:06:07.730> go<00:06:07.940> to<00:06:08.000> your

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.390 
one I always mess up when you go to your

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.150 
one I always mess up when you go to your
row<00:06:08.570> across<00:06:09.020> and<00:06:09.970> you<00:06:10.970> might<00:06:11.240> do<00:06:11.450> it<00:06:12.160> another

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 
row across and you might do it another

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.590 
row across and you might do it another
way<00:06:13.400> you<00:06:13.460> might<00:06:13.760> come<00:06:13.940> up<00:06:13.970> with<00:06:14.060> another<00:06:14.390> way

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
way you might come up with another way

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.030 
way you might come up with another way
that's<00:06:14.750> easier<00:06:15.110> but<00:06:15.260> I've<00:06:15.380> always<00:06:15.680> done<00:06:15.860> it<00:06:15.950> in

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
that's easier but I've always done it in

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.700 
that's easier but I've always done it in
rows<00:06:16.280> so<00:06:16.580> that<00:06:16.610> can<00:06:16.850> keep<00:06:16.970> track<00:06:17.410> these<00:06:18.410> are

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
rows so that can keep track these are

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:19.630 
rows so that can keep track these are
going<00:06:18.830> to<00:06:18.920> bow<00:06:19.100> out

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:19.640 
going to bow out

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.700 
going to bow out
so<00:06:19.790> this<00:06:20.180> first<00:06:20.900> set<00:06:21.710> is<00:06:21.980> going<00:06:22.250> to<00:06:22.400> bow<00:06:22.640> in<00:06:22.940> and

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
so this first set is going to bow in and

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:30.070 
so this first set is going to bow in and
then<00:06:24.710> out<00:06:25.480> and<00:06:26.480> then<00:06:27.110> in<00:06:28.900> you're<00:06:29.900> going<00:06:29.990> to

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 
then out and then in you're going to

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.570 
then out and then in you're going to
look<00:06:30.260> to<00:06:30.440> this<00:06:30.620> when<00:06:30.890> you<00:06:30.980> do<00:06:31.100> the<00:06:31.220> next<00:06:31.370> row

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
look to this when you do the next row

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:37.600 
look to this when you do the next row
that<00:06:31.790> bow<00:06:31.970> is<00:06:32.120> out<00:06:32.560> so<00:06:33.560> in<00:06:34.810> out<00:06:35.810> and<00:06:36.490> then<00:06:37.490> the

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
that bow is out so in out and then the

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:43.660 
that bow is out so in out and then the
final<00:06:38.000> one<00:06:38.030> it<00:06:38.330> bows<00:06:38.570> in<00:06:39.760> out<00:06:40.760> and<00:06:42.640> come<00:06:43.640> back

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:43.670 
final one it bows in out and come back

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:50.950 
final one it bows in out and come back
in<00:06:43.820> and<00:06:44.150> make<00:06:44.300> your<00:06:45.220> little<00:06:46.220> dots<00:06:47.350> bigger<00:06:49.960> just

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 
in and make your little dots bigger just

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:56.470 
in and make your little dots bigger just
to<00:06:51.050> show<00:06:51.260> some<00:06:51.290> space<00:06:51.860> in<00:06:52.100> between<00:06:52.250> them<00:06:55.480> and

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:56.480 
to show some space in between them and

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:12.920 
to show some space in between them and
you<00:06:56.720> could<00:06:56.870> shade<00:06:57.080> that<00:06:57.260> too<00:06:57.910> same<00:06:58.910> concept

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:12.930 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:30.990 

it<00:07:13.740> makes<00:07:13.919> it<00:07:14.100> pop<00:07:14.310> a<00:07:14.340> little<00:07:14.490> bit

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:31.000 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.530 

and<00:07:32.000> that's<00:07:32.150> it

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:32.540 
and that's it

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.170 
and that's it
I<00:07:32.740> hope<00:07:33.740> that<00:07:33.950> helps<00:07:34.280> if<00:07:34.790> you<00:07:34.910> have<00:07:35.000> any
