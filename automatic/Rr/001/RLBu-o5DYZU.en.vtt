hi<00:00:01.199> my<00:00:01.860> name<00:00:02.070> is<00:00:02.100> Steven<00:00:02.639> McGee<00:00:02.939> and<00:00:03.270> I'm<00:00:03.480> the

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
hi my name is Steven McGee and I'm the

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.530 
hi my name is Steven McGee and I'm the
author<00:00:03.750> of<00:00:03.899> toxic<00:00:04.410> electricity<00:00:05.310> and<00:00:05.609> we're

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
author of toxic electricity and we're

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.589 
author of toxic electricity and we're
here<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:07.230> talk<00:00:07.770> about<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:08.130> discovery<00:00:09.000> that<00:00:09.420> I

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
here to talk about a discovery that I

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.499 
here to talk about a discovery that I
made<00:00:09.960> regarding<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.030> dieffenbachia<00:00:12.030> plant

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
made regarding the dieffenbachia plant

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.279 
made regarding the dieffenbachia plant
and<00:00:13.040> as<00:00:14.040> you<00:00:14.160> can<00:00:14.280> see<00:00:14.340> this<00:00:15.000> plant<00:00:15.299> has<00:00:15.839> very

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
and as you can see this plant has very

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.240 
and as you can see this plant has very
large<00:00:16.890> leaves<00:00:17.810> typically<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.140> size<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.770> your

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
large leaves typically the size of your

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.720 
large leaves typically the size of your
hand<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> very<00:00:22.140> healthy<00:00:22.730> specimen

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
hand and this is a very healthy specimen

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.290 
hand and this is a very healthy specimen
but<00:00:24.600> what<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.170> found<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:26.279> this<00:00:26.430> plant<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:27.269> that

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
but what I found that this plant is that

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.640 
but what I found that this plant is that
it<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.779> electrically<00:00:28.529> sensitive<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:30.650> you

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
it is electrically sensitive and you

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.170 
it is electrically sensitive and you
grow<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:32.009> plant<00:00:32.270> in<00:00:33.270> radio<00:00:33.829> fields<00:00:35.180> you'll

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
grow this plant in radio fields you'll

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.090 
grow this plant in radio fields you'll
find<00:00:36.510> you'll<00:00:36.780> get<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.050> very<00:00:37.290> very<00:00:37.739> small

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
find you'll get this very very small

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.330 
find you'll get this very very small
growth<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.870> same<00:00:40.110> species<00:00:40.920> of

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
growth so this is the same species of

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.760 
growth so this is the same species of
plant<00:00:41.820> as<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.809> can<00:00:42.960> see<00:00:43.050> it's<00:00:43.200> very<00:00:43.260> very

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
plant as you can see it's very very

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.479 
plant as you can see it's very very
different<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:45.020> the<00:00:46.160> adaptation<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.190> this

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
different and the adaptation that this

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.910 
different and the adaptation that this
plant<00:00:47.760> made<00:00:47.969> was<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.200> little<00:00:49.500> device

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
plant made was to this little device

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
plant made was to this little device
this<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.579> little<00:00:50.960> outdoor<00:00:52.489> thermometer<00:00:53.489> and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
this is a little outdoor thermometer and

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.709 
this is a little outdoor thermometer and
humidity<00:00:54.660> sensor<00:00:55.520> for<00:00:56.520> an<00:00:57.059> indoor<00:00:57.510> and

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
humidity sensor for an indoor and

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.990 
humidity sensor for an indoor and
outdoor<00:00:57.930> weather<00:00:58.829> station<00:00:59.370> since<00:00:59.760> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
outdoor weather station since the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.020 
outdoor weather station since the
outdoor<00:01:00.300> polished<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:02.460> transmissions

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
outdoor polished so the transmissions

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.140 
outdoor polished so the transmissions
are<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:03.600> device<00:01:04.369> deformed<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.760> plant

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
are of this device deformed this plant

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.520 
are of this device deformed this plant
into<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> radio<00:01:08.790> frequency

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
into this so this is a radio frequency

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.109 
into this so this is a radio frequency
deformed<00:01:10.530> plant<00:01:11.600> sir<00:01:13.070> actually<00:01:14.070> got<00:01:14.400> wise<00:01:14.640> to

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
deformed plant sir actually got wise to

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.420 
deformed plant sir actually got wise to
radio<00:01:15.960> frequencies<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.180> I<00:01:18.180> realized<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:19.530> lot

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
radio frequencies and I realized a lot

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.429 
radio frequencies and I realized a lot
of<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.610> deformities<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.659> was<00:01:21.780> seeing<00:01:22.049> in

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
of the deformities that I was seeing in

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.700 
of the deformities that I was seeing in
my<00:01:22.560> plants<00:01:23.009> were<00:01:23.369> radio<00:01:23.700> frequency

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
my plants were radio frequency

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.700 
my plants were radio frequency
deformities<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:27.180> was<00:01:27.570> quite<00:01:28.080> typical

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
deformities and this was quite typical

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.569 
deformities and this was quite typical
of<00:01:29.040> how<00:01:29.250> my<00:01:29.759> control<00:01:30.299> plants<00:01:30.750> would<00:01:30.900> grow<00:01:30.930> so

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
of how my control plants would grow so

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.550 
of how my control plants would grow so
they<00:01:32.579> were<00:01:32.670> kept<00:01:32.820> use<00:01:33.030> very<00:01:33.299> very<00:01:33.810> small

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
they were kept use very very small

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.640 
they were kept use very very small
leaves<00:01:34.829> on<00:01:35.100> them<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.720> with<00:01:36.720> minimal<00:01:37.170> padding

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
leaves on them and with minimal padding

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.719 
leaves on them and with minimal padding
so<00:01:38.780> this<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.200> same<00:01:40.409> plant<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.610> what

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
so this is the same plant this is what

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.670 
so this is the same plant this is what
we<00:01:41.820> started<00:01:42.150> out<00:01:42.299> with<00:01:42.360> had<00:01:42.840> he<00:01:43.200> started<00:01:43.619> the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
we started out with had he started the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.700 
we started out with had he started the
video<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:44.610> very<00:01:44.640> very<00:01:45.000> different<00:01:45.439> so<00:01:46.439> this

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
video it's very very different so this

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.149 
video it's very very different so this
is<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.640> typical<00:01:48.140> control<00:01:49.140> plant<00:01:49.560> when<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:49.890> had

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
is a typical control plant when I had

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.300 
is a typical control plant when I had
all<00:01:50.310> my<00:01:50.340> wireless<00:01:51.090> devices<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:52.049> service<00:01:52.710> and

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
all my wireless devices in service and

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.039 
all my wireless devices in service and
every<00:01:53.579> plant<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.149> home<00:01:54.270> would<00:01:54.600> show<00:01:54.840> this

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
every plant in the home would show this

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.330 
every plant in the home would show this
growth<00:01:55.680> pattern<00:01:56.299> so<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.750> actually<00:01:58.229> took<00:01:59.070> my

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
growth pattern so I actually took my

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.630 
growth pattern so I actually took my
wireless<00:01:59.820> devices<00:02:00.590> out<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.710> service<00:02:02.189> last

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
wireless devices out of service last

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.600 
wireless devices out of service last
year<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.110> how<00:02:04.290> my<00:02:04.469> plants<00:02:04.740> now<00:02:05.219> grow

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
year and this is how my plants now grow

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.089 
year and this is how my plants now grow
now<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.420> my<00:02:06.570> wireless<00:02:06.930> devices<00:02:07.530> are<00:02:07.950> not

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
now that my wireless devices are not

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.850 
now that my wireless devices are not
serviced<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.569> can<00:02:09.690> see<00:02:09.869> it's<00:02:10.229> much<00:02:10.410> better

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
serviced so you can see it's much better

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.059 
serviced so you can see it's much better
the<00:02:11.160> leaves<00:02:11.400> are<00:02:11.670> much

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
the leaves are much

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.780 
the leaves are much
larger<00:02:12.790> but<00:02:13.150> not<00:02:13.180> quite<00:02:13.780> right<00:02:14.079> and<00:02:14.700> there<00:02:15.700> is

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
larger but not quite right and there is

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
larger but not quite right and there is
some<00:02:16.120> deformity<00:02:16.900> in<00:02:17.079> these<00:02:17.469> leaves<00:02:18.209> so<00:02:19.209> I

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
some deformity in these leaves so I

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.199 
some deformity in these leaves so I
actually<00:02:20.680> started<00:02:20.889> running<00:02:21.730> some

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
actually started running some

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.129 
actually started running some
experiments<00:02:22.840> around<00:02:23.409> her<00:02:23.829> and<00:02:24.569> I<00:02:25.569> started

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:26.139 
experiments around her and I started

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.830 
experiments around her and I started
checking<00:02:26.379> out<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:27.430> entire<00:02:27.790> area<00:02:28.060> around<00:02:28.450> the

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
checking out the entire area around the

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.399 
checking out the entire area around the
heart<00:02:29.019> and<00:02:30.010> this<00:02:30.639> deformity<00:02:31.599> is<00:02:31.750> quite

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409 
heart and this deformity is quite

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.369 
heart and this deformity is quite
consistent<00:02:32.889> this<00:02:33.670> year<00:02:33.730> in<00:02:34.269> the<00:02:34.870> plants<00:02:35.230> that

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
consistent this year in the plants that

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.800 
consistent this year in the plants that
I've<00:02:35.530> grown<00:02:35.769> in<00:02:36.280> many<00:02:36.760> rooms<00:02:37.030> throughout<00:02:37.659> my

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
I've grown in many rooms throughout my

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.990 
I've grown in many rooms throughout my
home<00:02:38.019> that<00:02:38.829> they<00:02:39.069> they<00:02:39.370> change<00:02:39.639> from<00:02:39.819> this

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
home that they they change from this

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.679 
home that they they change from this
very<00:02:40.870> large<00:02:41.109> growth<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:42.430> this<00:02:42.579> much<00:02:43.239> smaller

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:43.689 
very large growth to this much smaller

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:45.569 
very large growth to this much smaller
growth<00:02:44.049> but<00:02:44.469> I've<00:02:44.709> managed<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.069> get<00:02:45.280> all<00:02:45.489> the

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
growth but I've managed to get all the

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.280 
growth but I've managed to get all the
padding<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.150> come<00:02:46.299> back<00:02:46.480> so<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.989> leaves<00:02:47.169> are

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
padding to come back so the leaves are

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.250 
padding to come back so the leaves are
just<00:02:47.319> a<00:02:47.530> miniature<00:02:47.829> version<00:02:48.840> now<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:50.079> my

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
just a miniature version now that my

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.890 
just a miniature version now that my
wireless<00:02:50.530> devices<00:02:51.219> are<00:02:51.730> our<00:02:51.819> service<00:02:52.329> in<00:02:52.540> the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
wireless devices are our service in the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.720 
wireless devices are our service in the
home<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:54.250> there's<00:02:54.639> a<00:02:54.699> very<00:02:54.909> big<00:02:55.239> difference<00:02:55.409> to

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
home so there's a very big difference to

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.399 
home so there's a very big difference to
exposure<00:02:57.730> when<00:02:58.359> the<00:02:58.449> wireless<00:02:58.780> devices<00:02:59.109> were

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
exposure when the wireless devices were

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.939 
exposure when the wireless devices were
in<00:02:59.560> service<00:03:00.010> as<00:03:00.639> opposed<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.329> exposure<00:03:02.319> after

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:02.949 
in service as opposed to exposure after

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:05.429 
in service as opposed to exposure after
they<00:03:03.459> were<00:03:03.519> taken<00:03:03.730> out<00:03:04.000> of<00:03:04.060> service<00:03:04.329> and<00:03:05.199> I<00:03:05.290> get

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:05.439 
they were taken out of service and I get

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.470 
they were taken out of service and I get
much<00:03:05.560> better<00:03:05.799> growth<00:03:06.340> patterns<00:03:06.760> now<00:03:07.299> that

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
much better growth patterns now that

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.500 
much better growth patterns now that
they're<00:03:07.599> out<00:03:07.689> of<00:03:07.750> service<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:09.370> I<00:03:09.969> started

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
they're out of service so I started

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.449 
they're out of service so I started
running<00:03:10.659> some<00:03:11.049> more<00:03:11.260> experiments<00:03:11.949> with

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
running some more experiments with

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.420 
running some more experiments with
batteries<00:03:13.329> and<00:03:13.659> this<00:03:14.590> is<00:03:14.709> one<00:03:14.889> of<00:03:15.010> them<00:03:15.159> and

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
batteries and this is one of them and

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.399 
batteries and this is one of them and
you<00:03:15.519> can<00:03:15.639> see<00:03:15.849> that<00:03:16.000> that<00:03:16.209> plant<00:03:16.540> has<00:03:16.810> almost

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
you can see that that plant has almost

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.580 
you can see that that plant has almost
died<00:03:17.979> you<00:03:18.939> can<00:03:19.030> see<00:03:19.150> that<00:03:19.299> we've<00:03:19.419> got<00:03:19.599> a<00:03:19.900> 9-volt

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
died you can see that we've got a 9-volt

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.270 
died you can see that we've got a 9-volt
battery<00:03:20.979> but<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.030> one<00:03:22.829> side<00:03:23.829> of<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.099> terminal

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
battery but the one side of the terminal

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.879 
battery but the one side of the terminal
goes<00:03:24.729> to<00:03:24.909> the<00:03:25.000> pot<00:03:25.239> and<00:03:26.079> the<00:03:26.139> other<00:03:26.259> terminal

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
goes to the pot and the other terminal

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.849 
goes to the pot and the other terminal
goes<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.639> the<00:03:27.879> stem<00:03:28.299> of<00:03:28.599> the<00:03:28.659> plant<00:03:28.870> you'll

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
goes to the stem of the plant you'll

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.979 
goes to the stem of the plant you'll
notice<00:03:30.159> on<00:03:30.310> this<00:03:30.459> one<00:03:30.669> either<00:03:30.819> the<00:03:31.479> clip<00:03:31.810> is

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
notice on this one either the clip is

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.309 
notice on this one either the clip is
very<00:03:32.019> corroded<00:03:32.970> so<00:03:33.970> I<00:03:34.000> noticed<00:03:34.509> that<00:03:34.780> nine

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
very corroded so I noticed that nine

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.330 
very corroded so I noticed that nine
bulbs<00:03:35.769> with<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:37.290> negative<00:03:38.290> going<00:03:38.799> to<00:03:39.040> the

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
bulbs with the negative going to the

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.099 
bulbs with the negative going to the
stem<00:03:39.579> of<00:03:39.819> the<00:03:40.000> plant<00:03:40.120> you<00:03:40.659> get<00:03:40.780> a<00:03:40.810> lot<00:03:40.989> of

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
stem of the plant you get a lot of

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.439 
stem of the plant you get a lot of
corrosion<00:03:41.229> it<00:03:41.650> also<00:03:41.799> appears<00:03:42.729> to<00:03:43.000> kill<00:03:43.329> the

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:43.449 
corrosion it also appears to kill the

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:51.719 
corrosion it also appears to kill the
plant<00:03:43.769> so<00:03:44.769> doesn't<00:03:45.430> like<00:03:45.729> nine<00:03:46.239> bolts<00:03:50.729> it's

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:51.729 
plant so doesn't like nine bolts it's

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:53.999 
plant so doesn't like nine bolts it's
the<00:03:51.879> opposite<00:03:52.209> polarity<00:03:52.479> so<00:03:52.989> we<00:03:53.139> have<00:03:53.319> the

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:54.009 
the opposite polarity so we have the

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:57.149 
the opposite polarity so we have the
positive<00:03:54.449> going<00:03:55.449> to<00:03:55.719> the<00:03:55.810> plant<00:03:56.079> we<00:03:56.889> have<00:03:57.040> the

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:57.159 
positive going to the plant we have the

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.390 
positive going to the plant we have the
negative<00:03:57.310> going<00:03:58.000> to<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.329> pot<00:03:58.569> and<00:03:59.189> you<00:04:00.189> see

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
negative going to the pot and you see

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.240 
negative going to the pot and you see
that<00:04:00.549> it's<00:04:00.729> showing<00:04:00.969> stress<00:04:01.870> and<00:04:02.560> this<00:04:03.009> one

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
that it's showing stress and this one

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.069 
that it's showing stress and this one
was<00:04:03.400> showing<00:04:03.639> deformity<00:04:04.239> as<00:04:04.359> thing<00:04:04.599> so<00:04:04.840> the

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
was showing deformity as thing so the

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.330 
was showing deformity as thing so the
leaf<00:04:05.229> is<00:04:05.409> very<00:04:05.650> deformed<00:04:06.810> so<00:04:07.810> either<00:04:08.560> polarity

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
leaf is very deformed so either polarity

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.939 
leaf is very deformed so either polarity
of<00:04:09.430> nine<00:04:09.609> bolts<00:04:09.969> they<00:04:10.689> do<00:04:11.229> not<00:04:11.379> like<00:04:11.590> that

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:11.949 
of nine bolts they do not like that

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:15.929 
of nine bolts they do not like that
voltage<00:04:13.799> but<00:04:14.799> it's<00:04:14.919> a<00:04:14.949> different<00:04:15.219> story<00:04:15.250> at

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:15.939 
voltage but it's a different story at

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:20.490 
voltage but it's a different story at
one<00:04:16.120> half<00:04:16.389> volts<00:04:17.759> so<00:04:18.759> at<00:04:19.299> one<00:04:19.479> half<00:04:19.719> volts<00:04:20.260> you

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
one half volts so at one half volts you

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.600 
one half volts so at one half volts you
get<00:04:21.130> the<00:04:21.250> full<00:04:21.489> size<00:04:21.810> leaf<00:04:22.810> probe

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
get the full size leaf probe

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.610 
get the full size leaf probe
and<00:04:25.069> these<00:04:26.069> are<00:04:26.430> grown<00:04:26.669> in<00:04:27.509> my<00:04:27.689> home<00:04:27.900> were<00:04:28.229> no

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
and these are grown in my home were no

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.369 
and these are grown in my home were no
plant<00:04:28.949> of<00:04:29.300> this<00:04:30.300> type<00:04:30.599> will<00:04:30.840> actually<00:04:31.169> grow

00:04:31.369 --> 00:04:31.379 
plant of this type will actually grow

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:33.950 
plant of this type will actually grow
normally<00:04:31.680> but<00:04:32.189> the<00:04:32.400> these<00:04:33.060> two<00:04:33.240> actually<00:04:33.389> grow

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
normally but the these two actually grow

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.010 
normally but the these two actually grow
normally<00:04:34.229> so<00:04:35.159> it's<00:04:36.030> very<00:04:36.210> very<00:04:36.419> interesting

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
normally so it's very very interesting

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.830 
normally so it's very very interesting
this<00:04:37.110> is<00:04:37.169> all<00:04:37.500> new<00:04:38.129> growth<00:04:38.280> and<00:04:38.759> the<00:04:39.539> way<00:04:39.569> that

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
this is all new growth and the way that

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.290 
this is all new growth and the way that
I've<00:04:39.900> got<00:04:40.080> it<00:04:40.169> to<00:04:40.259> grow<00:04:40.500> normally<00:04:40.800> is<00:04:41.300> to

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
I've got it to grow normally is to

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.459 
I've got it to grow normally is to
attach<00:04:42.659> on<00:04:43.050> a<00:04:43.110> half<00:04:43.620> volt<00:04:44.360> battery<00:04:45.360> to<00:04:45.689> the<00:04:46.229> pot

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:46.469 
attach on a half volt battery to the pot

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:49.100 
attach on a half volt battery to the pot
you<00:04:47.219> see<00:04:47.400> this<00:04:47.520> pot<00:04:47.819> is<00:04:47.969> negative<00:04:48.689> and<00:04:49.020> the

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
you see this pot is negative and the

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.629 
you see this pot is negative and the
plant<00:04:49.379> is<00:04:49.759> positive<00:04:50.759> and<00:04:52.069> the<00:04:53.069> plant<00:04:53.340> is

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
plant is positive and the plant is

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.200 
plant is positive and the plant is
growing<00:04:53.849> normally<00:04:54.509> so<00:04:55.849> actually<00:04:56.849> run<00:04:57.090> the

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
growing normally so actually run the

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.640 
growing normally so actually run the
experiment<00:04:57.779> of<00:04:57.930> both<00:04:58.259> polarities<00:04:59.960> and<00:05:00.960> again

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
experiment of both polarities and again

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.179 
experiment of both polarities and again
we<00:05:02.400> got<00:05:02.550> a<00:05:02.580> very<00:05:02.789> normal<00:05:03.569> growing

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:04.189 
we got a very normal growing

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:07.700 
we got a very normal growing
dieffenbachia<00:05:05.189> and<00:05:06.080> this<00:05:07.080> is<00:05:07.289> the<00:05:07.409> way<00:05:07.529> it's

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
dieffenbachia and this is the way it's

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.589 
dieffenbachia and this is the way it's
supposed<00:05:07.979> to<00:05:08.129> grow<00:05:08.449> so<00:05:09.449> some<00:05:10.229> reason<00:05:11.599> there's

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599 
supposed to grow so some reason there's

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:16.939 
supposed to grow so some reason there's
a<00:05:12.840> voltage<00:05:13.310> missing<00:05:14.310> on<00:05:15.029> my<00:05:15.840> plants<00:05:16.379> in<00:05:16.590> the

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 
a voltage missing on my plants in the

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.570 
a voltage missing on my plants in the
home<00:05:17.129> I<00:05:17.490> believe<00:05:17.909> that<00:05:18.599> it's<00:05:18.750> an<00:05:18.960> effect<00:05:19.289> of

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
home I believe that it's an effect of

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.689 
home I believe that it's an effect of
Wireless<00:05:20.580> radiation<00:05:21.319> overloading<00:05:22.699> because

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
Wireless radiation overloading because

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:26.869 
Wireless radiation overloading because
in<00:05:24.150> the<00:05:24.360> area<00:05:24.659> of<00:05:24.900> my<00:05:25.169> home<00:05:25.520> there<00:05:26.520> are<00:05:26.550> three

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:26.879 
in the area of my home there are three

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:29.149 
in the area of my home there are three
cell<00:05:27.330> phone<00:05:27.539> towers<00:05:27.900> between<00:05:28.139> six<00:05:28.740> and<00:05:28.949> seven

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:29.159 
cell phone towers between six and seven

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:32.360 
cell phone towers between six and seven
hundred<00:05:29.490> meters<00:05:29.969> away<00:05:30.210> from<00:05:30.389> my<00:05:30.629> home<00:05:30.810> and<00:05:31.370> I

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
hundred meters away from my home and I

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.420 
hundred meters away from my home and I
live<00:05:32.729> in<00:05:32.819> an<00:05:32.909> area<00:05:33.240> that<00:05:33.300> has<00:05:33.750> radio<00:05:34.529> frequency

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
live in an area that has radio frequency

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.480 
live in an area that has radio frequency
transmitting<00:05:36.419> utility<00:05:37.199> meters<00:05:37.500> and<00:05:37.860> they're

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
transmitting utility meters and they're

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.939 
transmitting utility meters and they're
installed<00:05:38.909> on<00:05:39.150> both<00:05:39.180> the<00:05:39.539> electrical<00:05:40.080> and<00:05:40.379> the

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:40.949 
installed on both the electrical and the

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:44.149 
installed on both the electrical and the
gas<00:05:41.129> meters<00:05:41.729> so<00:05:42.419> my<00:05:42.599> area<00:05:42.839> where<00:05:43.500> I<00:05:43.529> live<00:05:43.860> has

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:44.159 
gas meters so my area where I live has

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:47.390 
gas meters so my area where I live has
extensive<00:05:45.029> Wireless<00:05:45.690> radiation<00:05:46.400> overloading

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
extensive Wireless radiation overloading

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.110 
extensive Wireless radiation overloading
and<00:05:47.719> the<00:05:48.719> only<00:05:48.930> way<00:05:49.139> I<00:05:49.500> can<00:05:49.830> get<00:05:50.099> these<00:05:50.279> plants

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
and the only way I can get these plants

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.040 
and the only way I can get these plants
to<00:05:51.300> grow<00:05:51.449> in<00:05:51.810> that<00:05:52.020> environment<00:05:52.710> is<00:05:53.900> to<00:05:54.900> hook

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
to grow in that environment is to hook

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.459 
to grow in that environment is to hook
them<00:05:55.229> up<00:05:55.349> to<00:05:55.879> a<00:05:56.879> 1/2<00:05:57.419> volt<00:05:57.689> battery<00:05:57.990> and<00:05:58.259> the

00:05:58.459 --> 00:05:58.469 
them up to a 1/2 volt battery and the

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:00.469 
them up to a 1/2 volt battery and the
parity<00:05:58.889> doesn't<00:05:59.430> matter<00:05:59.580> on<00:05:59.909> the<00:06:00.120> one<00:06:00.240> on<00:06:00.360> our

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
parity doesn't matter on the one on our

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.450 
parity doesn't matter on the one on our
volts<00:06:00.900> and<00:06:01.710> you<00:06:01.770> see<00:06:01.979> we've<00:06:02.129> got<00:06:02.279> a<00:06:02.339> bit

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
volts and you see we've got a bit

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.700 
volts and you see we've got a bit
positive<00:06:02.879> to<00:06:03.000> the<00:06:03.089> pot<00:06:03.349> and<00:06:04.349> we've<00:06:04.500> got<00:06:04.589> the

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
positive to the pot and we've got the

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.260 
positive to the pot and we've got the
negative<00:06:04.889> to<00:06:05.580> the<00:06:05.610> plant<00:06:06.050> but<00:06:07.050> if<00:06:07.529> you<00:06:07.770> do<00:06:07.949> that

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
negative to the plant but if you do that

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.390 
negative to the plant but if you do that
the<00:06:09.270> plants<00:06:09.629> grow<00:06:09.689> normally<00:06:10.080> so<00:06:10.710> it's<00:06:11.129> a<00:06:11.219> very

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
the plants grow normally so it's a very

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.140 
the plants grow normally so it's a very
very<00:06:11.759> interesting<00:06:11.819> effect<00:06:12.889> so<00:06:14.150> the

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
very interesting effect so the

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.749 
very interesting effect so the
interesting<00:06:15.419> thing<00:06:15.839> is<00:06:16.080> and<00:06:17.069> this<00:06:17.189> is<00:06:17.250> a<00:06:17.400> page

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 
interesting thing is and this is a page

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:20.899 
interesting thing is and this is a page

electricity page 289 you'll find this

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:27.079 
electricity page 289 you'll find this
diagram<00:06:25.319> that<00:06:25.349> I<00:06:25.620> drew<00:06:25.710> and<00:06:26.610> this<00:06:26.759> is<00:06:26.909> what's

00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:27.089 
diagram that I drew and this is what's

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:29.950 
diagram that I drew and this is what's
going<00:06:27.270> on<00:06:27.569> and<00:06:28.219> you<00:06:29.219> look<00:06:29.400> right<00:06:29.580> there

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
going on and you look right there

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.080 
going on and you look right there
atmospheric<00:06:30.960> DC<00:06:31.889> voltage

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
atmospheric DC voltage

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.590 
atmospheric DC voltage
so<00:06:33.330> the<00:06:33.630> atmosphere<00:06:33.780> has<00:06:34.470> a<00:06:34.889> DC<00:06:35.550> voltage<00:06:35.970> in<00:06:36.450> it

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 
so the atmosphere has a DC voltage in it

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.200 
so the atmosphere has a DC voltage in it
and<00:06:36.960> that<00:06:37.800> appears<00:06:38.130> to<00:06:38.280> be<00:06:38.370> missing<00:06:38.550> at<00:06:39.030> my

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
and that appears to be missing at my

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.890 
and that appears to be missing at my
home<00:06:39.450> and<00:06:39.780> without<00:06:40.650> that<00:06:40.889> voltage<00:06:41.570> it<00:06:42.570> appears

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 
home and without that voltage it appears

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.370 
home and without that voltage it appears
that<00:06:42.990> you<00:06:43.290> actually<00:06:43.440> start<00:06:44.070> to<00:06:44.190> get<00:06:44.340> sick<00:06:44.700> and

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.380 
that you actually start to get sick and

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.500 
that you actually start to get sick and
I've<00:06:46.380> always<00:06:46.560> exhibited<00:06:47.160> fatigue<00:06:47.760> in<00:06:48.300> this

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:48.510 
I've always exhibited fatigue in this

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.220 
I've always exhibited fatigue in this
home<00:06:48.720> and<00:06:49.070> I<00:06:50.070> found<00:06:50.340> that<00:06:50.639> by<00:06:51.230> connecting

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:52.230 
home and I found that by connecting

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.040 
home and I found that by connecting
myself<00:06:52.560> to<00:06:52.800> a<00:06:52.830> battery<00:06:53.300> actually<00:06:54.300> appears<00:06:54.900> to

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.050 
myself to a battery actually appears to

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.860 
myself to a battery actually appears to
alleviate<00:06:55.500> that<00:06:55.830> fatigue<00:06:56.400> so<00:06:57.360> the<00:06:57.660> same

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
alleviate that fatigue so the same

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:03.230 
alleviate that fatigue so the same
effect<00:06:58.260> is<00:06:58.560> what<00:06:59.220> we<00:06:59.340> see<00:06:59.610> in<00:07:00.510> these<00:07:00.990> ones<00:07:02.240> also

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 
effect is what we see in these ones also

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.510 
effect is what we see in these ones also
appears<00:07:03.570> to<00:07:03.630> be<00:07:03.780> transferable<00:07:04.590> to<00:07:04.710> the<00:07:05.100> human

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 
appears to be transferable to the human

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.730 
appears to be transferable to the human
and<00:07:05.790> I<00:07:06.419> don't<00:07:06.630> advise<00:07:06.900> people<00:07:07.290> to<00:07:07.650> hook

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:07.740 
and I don't advise people to hook

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.740 
and I don't advise people to hook
themselves<00:07:07.979> up<00:07:08.400> to<00:07:08.610> batteries<00:07:09.210> because<00:07:09.570> the

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:09.750 
themselves up to batteries because the

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.350 
themselves up to batteries because the
side<00:07:09.930> effects<00:07:10.260> are<00:07:10.530> unknown<00:07:10.889> currently<00:07:11.850> and

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 
side effects are unknown currently and

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.350 
side effects are unknown currently and
I'm<00:07:13.110> a<00:07:13.169> researcher<00:07:13.770> so<00:07:13.919> I'm<00:07:14.280> prepared<00:07:15.120> to<00:07:15.180> take

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 
I'm a researcher so I'm prepared to take

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.530 
I'm a researcher so I'm prepared to take
the<00:07:15.419> risk<00:07:15.540> of<00:07:16.370> researching<00:07:17.370> human<00:07:18.360> body

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:18.540 
the risk of researching human body

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.659 
the risk of researching human body
exposure<00:07:18.990> to<00:07:19.380> one<00:07:19.560> and<00:07:19.680> a<00:07:19.710> half<00:07:19.740> volt<00:07:20.100> DC

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:20.669 
exposure to one and a half volt DC

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:23.420 
exposure to one and a half volt DC
battery<00:07:21.389> and<00:07:22.139> I<00:07:22.200> can<00:07:22.350> tell<00:07:22.530> you<00:07:22.710> it<00:07:22.950> does<00:07:23.160> some

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:23.430 
battery and I can tell you it does some

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.890 
battery and I can tell you it does some
very<00:07:23.460> strange<00:07:23.880> things<00:07:24.030> to<00:07:24.389> the<00:07:24.479> human<00:07:24.600> body

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900 
very strange things to the human body

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.330 
very strange things to the human body
but<00:07:25.680> what<00:07:25.800> are<00:07:25.889> the<00:07:25.950> things<00:07:26.130> that<00:07:26.190> I

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.340 
but what are the things that I

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.330 
but what are the things that I
definitely<00:07:26.669> does<00:07:27.090> is<00:07:27.389> it<00:07:28.380> eliminates<00:07:28.590> fatigue

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:29.340 
definitely does is it eliminates fatigue

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.820 
definitely does is it eliminates fatigue
and<00:07:29.639> fatigue<00:07:30.150> is<00:07:30.389> the<00:07:30.450> number<00:07:31.050> one<00:07:31.229> reported

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:31.830 
and fatigue is the number one reported

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:35.800 
and fatigue is the number one reported
symptom<00:07:32.490> of<00:07:32.700> radio<00:07:33.389> frequency<00:07:34.169> sickness<00:07:34.790> so

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:35.810 
symptom of radio frequency sickness so

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.659 
symptom of radio frequency sickness so
that's<00:07:36.810> where<00:07:37.050> I'm<00:07:37.140> up<00:07:37.289> to<00:07:37.530> with<00:07:38.010> these<00:07:38.190> plant

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:38.669 
that's where I'm up to with these plant

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:42.080 
that's where I'm up to with these plant
experiments<00:07:39.390> and<00:07:40.220> the<00:07:41.220> human<00:07:41.520> experiments

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:42.090 
experiments and the human experiments

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.840 
experiments and the human experiments
are<00:07:42.330> revealing<00:07:42.710> some<00:07:43.710> very<00:07:44.220> very<00:07:44.580> interesting

are revealing some very very interesting
stuff<00:07:45.600> and<00:07:45.840> I'm<00:07:45.930> very<00:07:46.080> very<00:07:46.470> early<00:07:46.950> into<00:07:47.430> the

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:47.460 
stuff and I'm very very early into the

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.300 
stuff and I'm very very early into the
human<00:07:47.880> experiments<00:07:48.720> but<00:07:48.900> I<00:07:49.200> can<00:07:49.979> tell<00:07:50.160> you

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:50.310

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:09.350 
there's a chapter in those called DC
voltage<00:08:06.410> and<00:08:07.410> direct<00:08:07.860> current<00:08:08.100> and<00:08:08.430> you'll

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 
voltage and direct current and you'll
