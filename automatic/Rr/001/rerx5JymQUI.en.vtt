00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 hello gangsters with you pandan this 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.390
 next issue 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.650
 dota 2 and 1 ramps in today's video 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.719
 we have warlock warlock who ultuet 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.059
 summons two golems and starts 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.369
 quietly slowly so cut all 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.770
 the enemy team is very cool hero to me 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.150
 He always liked him especially since 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.230
 Aganim he gets enough 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.180
 serious advantage 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.400
 but don't forget that this is warlock 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.019
 plays the role of support judging because 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.660
 him 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:33.000
 assembled label or tips therefore such 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.280
 rampagu you can even evaluate a few 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.530
 higher than if he played no support 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.670
 anakin pusher for example that is not 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.879
 collected such auxiliary artifacts 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:50.100
 I think it's a pretty nice start. 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:52.230
 release the next rampag on our water 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.449
 I can't stand this hero to be honest 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.670
 because all the time I eat or very bad 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.730
 play and foxes are so good on farms that 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.620
 kills the whole team solo and considering that 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.080
 in pubs don't like to collect something to 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.950
 void it 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.860
 you catch for example a halberd then in 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.290
 situations he just frantically cuts all 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.180
 enemy team 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.310
 and judging by his form and judging by his 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.970
 impudence he does n’t even need a dome 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.850
 so that all kill but of course well then 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.520
 that he has aegis this will help him 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.540
 rise again and continue 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.380
 senseless duty and merciless 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.020
 battle against 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.350
 dudes who are even barely 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.810
 resist and are given as always by 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.100
 queues 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.530
 such a tempish on I rampag in Russian 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.680
 the pub is like a story and run run 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.149
 quietly die the funniest thing is that 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.070
 even the dome didn't need it at all 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.840
 somehow very strange very strange 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.250
 the next rampagu we have on the invoker i 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.189
 I love rampagi on locker because 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.540
 always interesting to someone else there for casting 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.430
 he cast for 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.540
 the truth is here at the dude a little bit strange 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.890
 assembly invoker goes through midas it would be 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.570
 more fun to look at rampagoo with 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.509
 Aganim but I will show such a temple while we 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.720
 don't send four kills in a row and 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.660
 the last client is already running away 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.820
 especially nice that this purge is longtime 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.650
 enemy invoker on mid by the way brawler lockers 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:24.390
 against j in don mode can you 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.910
 look at the link next rampag 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.370
 us on only rockets lately with them 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.680
 Well, I’m a little bit different. 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.330
 which allows you to disassemble everyone 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.850
 just standing by 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.010
 of course if you have mana but in this 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:43.370
 case it is and therefore 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.370
 gentlemen substitute your dirty ass 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:52.540
 nothing special but nonetheless 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.460
 rampag there is a rampag next on 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.870
 Mipo queues 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.490
 ramp on by comes just every 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.500
 a week there are a lot of them 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.290
 the boys beg to take us rampagu 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.580
 release sometimes we do want it 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.880
 something strongly original you are here 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.230
 probably you will not see either 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.470
 except that mipo die black 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.470
 holly 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.810
 otherwise everything is standard 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.640
 and this is a great hero miran who is still 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:33.430
 did not have time to farm in this game gives ult 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:35.860
 and begins a fun night run puja 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.540
 hiding in the bushes shaker gives a fissure 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:44.349
 I hope to punish the brazen woman 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.569
 nothing his son gets 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:50.950
 in the face and now two killings in a row 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:53.620
 shaker queue up sand king 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.130
 runs and skims the ground very skillfully 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.540
 bathroom game 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:04.630
 Amirana quietly continues to cut 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:08.079
 this pooj is not the last poor runaway 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:11.549
 little i don't even know what about 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.549
 he can still be said of this situation 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.030
 rampaga from peace 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.949
 since the ramp and in this release it 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.810
 weak I think rested eyes 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:31.110
 could perceive them a little more 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:34.770
 positive more positive more 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.110
 positively the next rampag we have on 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.729
 phantom assassin nothing surprising 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.960
 quite standard for this hero purchase 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.389
 there is no counting vladmir's 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.250
 but the most important thing about this rampagi is that 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:48.360
 she has a beautiful hero 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:52.050
 lamp is the best hero dota 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:55.139
 I would certainly say but the first skill 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.430
 it's not a cake at all now so not 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:00.030
 I can say such nonsense 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:03.060
 I can't bear the boring carry 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.159
 although the potential is certainly strong if 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.150
 fuck it can be hard to cut but 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:12.840
 it is boring for me to play 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:15.180
 if not to say rude such rampag 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.150
 and the lamp at the end becomes attached to 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.669
 phantoms 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.169
 balls love winners i think silencer 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.810
 first time rampag on fat 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.880
 but the fat way wonderful hero 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.219
 so I will praise him in this issue 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.469
 although the farm he is not the top 20 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:33.569
 mascot for stafffchik 3 null talisman and 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:36.060
 gosh 3 but at the talisman I don’t immediately 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:37.669
 saw not really a bad thing with 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.469
 point of view of what intelligence gives 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:43.380
 if the children are very much a lot 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:45.960
 for fat is suitable because fat is like 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.270
 we know the more brains the stronger 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.029
 gives doom bringer am on the head 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.830
 which suddenly run out of the forest four 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:53.310
 kills in a row and 5 client already on 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.610
 approach 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:59.719
 as always as if he himself seemed 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.719
 specially goes to surrender 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.680
 for some reason almost always 5 murder in 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:08.510
 rampage this is a situation that 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.510
 given almost himself 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.560
 our next trax hero you say 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.200
 Lov skill with one button plays and after all 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.510
 really, really, really 1 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.360
 fucking button kills the whole team 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:26.130
 adversary and renders foolish enough and 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.480
 two rapiers on dachshund is strange but 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.750
 no less rapier lends the game 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:32.640
 special color that is, it seems to me to 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.600
 so real interesting rampagi wish 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:40.350
 the funniest release though 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:42.210
 really just right forward button i 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.670
 not very sure what it is worth repeating 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.230
 in the pub because chances are if 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:50.040
 trucks have today killed and I, in general, and 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:52.950
 killed if not Aegis two rapiers 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.810
 some shade it would be very 

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:57.240
 hard not to mention the fact that they and 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:00.060
 the troll there it would be it would be 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.400
