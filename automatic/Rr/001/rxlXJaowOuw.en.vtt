check the pH of the water I have a
liquid<00:00:22.740> pH<00:00:23.310> tester<00:00:23.970> but<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.769> looking<00:00:25.769> at<00:00:25.859> the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
liquid pH tester but I looking at the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.370 
liquid pH tester but I looking at the
color<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.699> water<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.269> can<00:00:27.570> tell<00:00:27.810> what<00:00:28.050> pH

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
color of this water I can tell what pH

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:43.520 
color of this water I can tell what pH
of<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.800> water<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:39.770> it's<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.890> light<00:00:41.100> green<00:00:42.530> pH

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
of the water is it's a light green pH

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.130 
of the water is it's a light green pH
somewhere<00:00:44.040> around<00:00:45.079> 6<00:00:46.079> yellow<00:00:46.620> green<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:48.140> I'm

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
somewhere around 6 yellow green and I'm

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.240 
somewhere around 6 yellow green and I'm
going<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.530> add<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:50.460> colorless<00:00:51.000> odorless

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
going to add this colorless odorless

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.569 
going to add this colorless odorless
alkaline

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
alkaline

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.660 
alkaline
usually<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.539> need<00:00:54.870> four<00:00:55.440> drops<00:00:55.800> for<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> big<00:00:56.340> cup

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
usually I need four drops for a big cup

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.970 
usually I need four drops for a big cup
but<00:00:57.210> since<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.050> half<00:00:58.289> cup<00:00:58.320> I'm<00:00:58.739> going

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
but since this is a half cup I'm going

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:07.130 
but since this is a half cup I'm going
to<00:00:59.129> only<00:00:59.250> put<00:00:59.809> two<00:01:00.809> drops<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:05.720> you<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:06.930> see

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
to only put two drops and you can see

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.969 
to only put two drops and you can see
the<00:01:07.290> color<00:01:07.530> changes<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.880> purple<00:01:09.770> which<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.799> a

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
the color changes the purple which is a

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.050 
the color changes the purple which is a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
you think this is the magic let me blow

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.460 
you think this is the magic let me blow
my<00:01:28.439> carbon<00:01:29.100> dioxide<00:01:29.700> from<00:01:30.030> my<00:01:30.240> lungs<00:01:30.509> into

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
can see the color chart and see how this

00:01:40.110 --> 00:02:17.760 
can see the color chart and see how this
color<00:01:40.380> changes

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.160 

now<00:03:16.530> I'm<00:03:16.980> going<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.430> add<00:03:17.610> alkali<00:03:18.450> into<00:03:18.959> this

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
now I'm going to add alkali into this

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.800 
now I'm going to add alkali into this
and<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.680> see<00:03:19.890> what<00:03:20.580> what<00:03:20.909> kind<00:03:21.180> of<00:03:21.299> change<00:03:21.599> I

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
and to see what what kind of change I

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:37.930 
and to see what what kind of change I
can<00:03:22.019> get<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:32.420> back<00:03:33.420> to<00:03:33.690> acid<00:03:35.330> now<00:03:36.330> if<00:03:36.480> I<00:03:36.599> put

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
can get it back to acid now if I put

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.630 
can get it back to acid now if I put
Alka<00:03:38.940> life<00:03:39.120> into<00:03:39.540> this<00:03:39.810> water<00:03:40.349> the<00:03:40.680> one<00:03:40.830> I<00:03:40.860> blew

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
this one comes back to alkaline now if I

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.520 
this one comes back to alkaline now if I
add<00:03:52.260> all<00:03:52.590> this<00:03:52.920> alkaline<00:03:53.790> water<00:03:54.030> into<00:03:54.690> this

it<00:03:59.849> comes<00:04:00.120> back<00:04:00.359> to<00:04:00.420> acid<00:04:00.930> that's<00:04:01.500> how<00:04:01.769> strong

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
it comes back to acid that's how strong

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.690 
it comes back to acid that's how strong
