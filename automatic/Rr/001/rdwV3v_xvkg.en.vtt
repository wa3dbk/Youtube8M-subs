00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.750 

it's<00:03:12.879> helped<00:03:13.120> me<00:03:13.209> a<00:03:13.239> lot<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:15.310> it's<00:03:15.519> really

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
it's helped me a lot and it's really

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.349 
it's helped me a lot and it's really
good<00:03:16.139> the<00:03:17.139> colors<00:03:17.500> kind<00:03:17.680> of<00:03:17.799> fading<00:03:18.129> away<00:03:18.359> not

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
good the colors kind of fading away not

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.229 
good the colors kind of fading away not
too<00:03:19.540> much<00:03:20.459> but<00:03:21.459> one<00:03:21.670> thing<00:03:21.849> if<00:03:22.000> you<00:03:22.090> get<00:03:22.209> a

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
too much but one thing if you get a

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.979 
too much but one thing if you get a
tornado<00:03:22.590> make<00:03:23.590> sure<00:03:23.739> that<00:03:23.829> you<00:03:23.980> don't<00:03:24.220> do<00:03:24.370> this

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
tornado make sure that you don't do this

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.780 
tornado make sure that you don't do this
untwist<00:03:25.989> them<00:03:26.200> because<00:03:27.099> it<00:03:27.190> just<00:03:27.220> messes<00:03:27.670> up

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
untwist them because it just messes up

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.539 
untwist them because it just messes up
the<00:03:27.970> twisting<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:28.950> you<00:03:29.950> don't<00:03:30.159> want<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.370> take

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
the twisting and you don't want to take

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.009 
the twisting and you don't want to take
them<00:03:30.670> apart<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:31.150> then<00:03:31.239> twist<00:03:31.569> them<00:03:31.720> like<00:03:31.750> this

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
them apart and then twist them like this

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.440 
them apart and then twist them like this
to<00:03:32.230> make<00:03:32.349> them<00:03:32.500> twice<00:03:32.709> tighter<00:03:33.310> because<00:03:34.239> then

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
to make them twice tighter because then

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.830 
to make them twice tighter because then
this<00:03:34.659> gets<00:03:35.260> all<00:03:35.470> shaped<00:03:35.980> like<00:03:36.189> this<00:03:36.629> like<00:03:37.629> this

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
this gets all shaped like this like this

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.930 
this gets all shaped like this like this
and<00:03:38.200> it<00:03:38.590> gets<00:03:38.709> kind<00:03:38.980> of<00:03:39.099> lopsided<00:03:39.280> like<00:03:39.760> this

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.850 

but<00:03:44.540> yeah<00:03:44.720> these<00:03:44.930> are<00:03:45.110> all<00:03:45.290> really<00:03:45.830> really
