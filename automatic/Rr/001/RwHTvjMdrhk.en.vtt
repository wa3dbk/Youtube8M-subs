00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.160
Welcome to TV Repair Made Easy, brought to
you by ShopJimmy.com. Visit www.shopjimmy.com

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.540
to search the hundreds of thousands of TV
parts in our inventory.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:26.540
The Main Board typically manages your accessory
inputs and outputs, and houses the TV tuner.

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.619
Finding replacement Main Boards for LG &amp; Zenith
TVs requires matching the TV Service Code

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.940
to item listings on ShopJimmy.com. This code
can be found on a label on the back or side

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.940
of your TV, next to the words "Service Code"
or "SVC Code." Search your Service Code on

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.449
ShopJimmy.com to find a compatible replacement
Main Board. As long as your Service Code is

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.920
found in the Known Models or Description Field,
the Main Boards listed on the search results

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.769
page will work as compatible replacements.

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.659
If you do not know the Service Code for your
TV, you can begin your search by using the

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:08.600
Part Numbers found on the labels on the board.
The following are the most common Part Number

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.230
patterns found on LG &amp; Zenith Main Boards:

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:19.230
Part numbers beginning with EBT, EBR, EBU,
or AGF are followed by 8 digits.

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:28.610
These numbers are typically found on barcode
labels, and can be missing the 3 letter prefix.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.189
Please note that part numbers printed on the
board, beginning with the letters EAX are

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:39.670
generic part numbers and will not guarantee
a compatible replacement when searching online.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.990
Part numbers beginning with 6871 are followed
by 7 characters, and can be found on a barcode

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.750
label.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.750
Part numbers beginning with 3911 are followed
by 7 characters. These part numbers are found

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.670
embedded within a string of characters printed
on a barcode label.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.609
Part numbers beginning with 33139 are followed
by 6 characters, and can be found printed

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:09.700
on a barcode label.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.840
Please note that part numbers beginning with
6870 are generic board numbers, and will not

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.680
guarantee compatibility when searching online.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.440
Again, it is very important to understand
that searching for replacement LG &amp; Zenith

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.110
Main Boards solely by part number will not
guarantee a perfect match. Some parts can

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.440
have the same part numbers, but totally different
composition. Searching by TV Service Code

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.440
instead of Part Number is the best way to
guarantee compatibility.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.600
Search your part number on ShopJimmy.com to
find a compatible replacement. Typically,

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.480
your part number will match the ShopJimmy
Item Number.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.010
If searching your part number directs you
to items that have differing ShopJimmy Item

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.400
Numbers, take a look at the product details
to confirm that your part number is listed

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.670
in the Part Number, Manufacturer Part Number,
Board Number, or Substitute Parts fields.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.200
If your part number is listed in the Part
Number, Manufacturer Part Number, or Board

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.400
Number fields on a product page, but is different
than the ShopJimmy Item number, that just

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.120
means that we have found Manufacturer Part
Numbers that relate to this product. As long

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.560
as your part number is found in the Part Number,
Manufacturer Part Number, or Board Number

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:31.560
field, this item will be the correct replacement
TV part for you.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.490
If searching your part number directs you
to items that have slightly different part

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.820
numbers, take a look at the product details
to confirm that your part number is in the

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.620
Substitute Parts field. As long as your part
number is found in the Substitute Parts field,

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.340
this item will be a compatible substitute
and will work in your TV.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.220
If your part number is out of stock, be sure
to check the Substitute Parts field on the

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.750
product page for compatible replacements.
These substitutes are guaranteed to replace

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.790
your original board, even if the part numbers
on the board do not match.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.870
