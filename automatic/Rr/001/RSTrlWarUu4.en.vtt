00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
compromising the iPad size and weight so

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.550 
compromising the iPad size and weight so
rather<00:01:40.610> than<00:01:40.820> developing<00:01:41.240> a<00:01:41.810> separate<00:01:42.320> case

rather than developing a separate case

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.639 
rather than developing a separate case
we<00:01:43.310> created<00:01:43.819> a<00:01:43.910> cover<00:01:44.270> at<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.840> same<00:01:45.110> time<00:01:45.380> that

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
we created a cover at the same time that

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.830 
we created a cover at the same time that
we<00:01:45.740> were<00:01:45.860> actually<00:01:45.950> designing<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.880> iPad<00:01:47.270> the

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
we were actually designing the iPad the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.930 
we were actually designing the iPad the
two<00:01:47.990> are<00:01:48.140> made<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.619> work<00:01:48.770> together<00:01:48.979> it

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
two are made to work together it

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.630 
two are made to work together it
attaches<00:01:50.270> magnetically<00:01:50.770> Airlines<00:01:51.770> perfectly

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
attaches magnetically Airlines perfectly

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.820 
attaches magnetically Airlines perfectly
and<00:01:52.819> it's<00:01:53.149> just<00:01:53.420> as<00:01:53.539> easy<00:01:53.660> to<00:01:53.840> remove<00:01:54.170> when<00:01:54.740> the

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
and it's just as easy to remove when the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.130 
and it's just as easy to remove when the
iPad<00:01:55.160> detects<00:01:55.789> you've<00:01:56.000> open<00:01:56.330> the<00:01:56.420> cover<00:01:56.660> it

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
iPad detects you've open the cover it

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.139 
iPad detects you've open the cover it
immediately<00:01:57.649> wakes<00:01:58.100> from<00:01:58.220> sleep<00:01:58.340> and<00:01:58.850> when

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
immediately wakes from sleep and when

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:00.730 
immediately wakes from sleep and when
you<00:01:59.270> close<00:01:59.509> the<00:01:59.690> cover<00:01:59.869> it<00:02:00.229> could<00:02:00.410> give<00:02:00.590> that

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
you close the cover it could give that

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.950 
you close the cover it could give that
to<00:02:00.920> you<00:02:01.100> you<00:02:01.610> can<00:02:01.789> also<00:02:01.910> fold<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:02.509> cover<00:02:02.660> to

things<00:04:23.169> with<00:04:23.470> his<00:04:23.620> ipad<00:04:23.800> that<00:04:24.550> we<00:04:24.669> never<00:04:25.120> could

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
things with his ipad that we never could

things with his ipad that we never could
have<00:04:25.480> done<00:04:25.660> before<00:04:25.870> and<00:04:26.470> it's<00:04:27.040> because

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
have done before and it's because

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.879 
have done before and it's because
there's<00:04:27.940> a<00:04:28.030> lot<00:04:28.240> of<00:04:28.270> new<00:04:28.630> innovation<00:04:29.320> driving

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
there's a lot of new innovation driving

there's a lot of new innovation driving
it<00:04:30.510> it<00:04:31.510> starts<00:04:31.930> with<00:04:32.140> the<00:04:32.290> new<00:04:32.440> dual-core<00:04:33.010> a5

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
it it starts with the new dual-core a5

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.640 
it it starts with the new dual-core a5
chip<00:04:33.880> that's<00:04:34.210> added<00:04:34.630> a<00:04:34.690> lot<00:04:34.900> more<00:04:34.960> speed<00:04:35.440> to

web sending email and multitasking in

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.409 
web sending email and multitasking in
fact<00:04:41.020> it's<00:04:41.380> up<00:04:41.620> to<00:04:41.770> twice<00:04:41.950> as<00:04:42.190> fast<00:04:42.400> but<00:04:42.760> the

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
fact it's up to twice as fast but the

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.450 
fact it's up to twice as fast but the
place<00:04:43.720> with<00:04:43.960> me<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:44.260> biggest<00:04:44.530> chunk<00:04:44.950> is<00:04:45.160> with

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
place with me the biggest chunk is with

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.610 
place with me the biggest chunk is with
graphics<00:04:46.000> with<00:04:46.480> performance<00:04:47.110> that's<00:04:47.350> up<00:04:47.470> to

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
nine times faster you'll really notice

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.710 
nine times faster you'll really notice
this<00:04:50.800> in<00:04:51.010> games<00:04:51.280> and<00:04:51.729> apps<00:04:52.030> that<00:04:52.270> use<00:04:52.390> a<00:04:52.419> lot<00:04:52.540> of

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
this in games and apps that use a lot of

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.650 
this in games and apps that use a lot of
data<00:04:52.960> and<00:04:53.260> for<00:04:54.250> the<00:04:54.370> first<00:04:54.550> time<00:04:54.850> we<00:04:55.300> built<00:04:55.540> a

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
data and for the first time we built a

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.620 
data and for the first time we built a
gyro<00:04:56.110> into<00:04:56.410> this<00:04:56.560> iPad<00:04:57.040> that<00:04:57.910> gives<00:04:58.150> you<00:04:58.300> very

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
gyro into this iPad that gives you very

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.690 
gyro into this iPad that gives you very
precise<00:04:59.080> control<00:04:59.680> in<00:04:59.919> multiple<00:05:00.550> dimensions

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
precise control in multiple dimensions

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.600 
precise control in multiple dimensions
and<00:05:01.330> it<00:05:01.600> allows<00:05:01.870> us<00:05:02.200> to<00:05:02.530> really<00:05:02.560> measure<00:05:03.250> the

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
and it allows us to really measure the

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.810 
and it allows us to really measure the
orientation<00:05:04.390> of<00:05:04.479> the<00:05:04.540> iPad<00:05:05.050> in<00:05:05.200> space<00:05:05.820> these

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
orientation of the iPad in space these

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.880 
orientation of the iPad in space these
new<00:05:07.060> components<00:05:07.660> and<00:05:07.810> features<00:05:07.990> add<00:05:08.470> all

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
new components and features add all

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.159 
new components and features add all
kinds<00:05:08.950> of<00:05:09.460> possibilities<00:05:09.660> when<00:05:10.660> it<00:05:10.750> comes<00:05:10.960> to

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
kinds of possibilities when it comes to

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.320 
kinds of possibilities when it comes to
apps<00:05:11.320> and<00:05:11.800> even<00:05:12.520> though<00:05:12.640> we<00:05:12.820> boosted<00:05:13.210> the

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
apps and even though we boosted the

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.390 
apps and even though we boosted the
performance<00:05:13.900> we<00:05:14.169> haven't<00:05:14.590> compromised<00:05:15.160> on

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400

battery life the new ipad still gets a
full<00:05:18.400> 10<00:05:18.640> hours<00:05:19.030> and<00:05:19.240> that's<00:05:19.780> a<00:05:19.960> major

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:20.229 
full 10 hours and that's a major

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:22.650 
full 10 hours and that's a major
achievement<00:05:20.500> of<00:05:21.130> design<00:05:21.520> this<00:05:21.760> thing<00:05:22.090> with

achievement of design this thing with
all<00:05:22.840> that<00:05:22.990> we've<00:05:23.110> added<00:05:23.260> to<00:05:23.470> iPad<00:05:23.860> to<00:05:24.130> a

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
all that we've added to iPad to a

forward

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.670 

the<00:05:36.560> original<00:05:37.070> iPad<00:05:37.570> defined<00:05:38.570> a<00:05:38.780> category<00:05:39.380> and

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
the original iPad defined a category and

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.219 
the original iPad defined a category and
I<00:05:40.460> think<00:05:40.729> that<00:05:40.880> I<00:05:41.060> peg<00:05:41.360> tube<00:05:41.690> will<00:05:41.960> really

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
I think that I peg tube will really

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:47.890 
I think that I peg tube will really
define<00:05:42.650> that<00:05:42.830> category<00:05:43.400> for<00:05:43.699> years<00:05:43.940> to<00:05:44.030> come
