that<00:02:39.569> you<00:02:39.720> shot<00:02:39.959> was<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.260> continuous<00:02:40.920> stream<00:02:41.340> in

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
that you shot was a continuous stream in

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.360 
that you shot was a continuous stream in
the<00:02:42.569> Famicom<00:02:43.050> version<00:02:43.080> they<00:02:43.769> are<00:02:43.800> more<00:02:44.160> like

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
the Famicom version they are more like

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.400 
the Famicom version they are more like
bullets<00:02:44.910> but<00:02:45.660> they<00:02:45.780> still<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.230> same

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
bullets but they still the same

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.160 
bullets but they still the same
properties<00:02:47.069> as<00:02:47.250> your<00:02:47.400> laser<00:02:47.760> stream<00:02:48.269> and<00:02:48.630> that

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
properties as your laser stream and that

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.710 
properties as your laser stream and that
is<00:02:49.410> that<00:02:49.590> they're<00:02:49.769> somewhat<00:02:50.310> heat-seeking<00:02:50.819> so

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
is that they're somewhat heat-seeking so

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.360 
is that they're somewhat heat-seeking so
if<00:02:51.810> there's<00:02:52.019> more<00:02:52.440> than<00:02:52.500> one<00:02:52.680> enemy<00:02:53.160> on<00:02:53.250> the
