but<00:00:36.110> let's<00:00:37.110> get<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.320> shot<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.149> group's

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
but let's get a shot of the group's

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.560 
but let's get a shot of the group's
rooty<00:00:40.230> rooty<00:00:40.579> from<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.700> angle<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.210> can<00:00:42.360> see

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
rooty rooty from this angle you can see

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.569 
rooty rooty from this angle you can see
that<00:00:42.809> there's<00:00:43.260> not<00:00:43.410> enough<00:00:43.680> space<00:00:43.890> for<00:00:44.399> the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
that there's not enough space for the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.720 
that there's not enough space for the
roots<00:00:44.820> he<00:00:45.450> needs<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.780> grow<00:00:46.280> not<00:00:47.280> only<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.670> we

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
roots he needs to grow not only that we

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.090 
roots he needs to grow not only that we
also<00:00:47.910> have<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.420> little<00:00:48.899> puppy<00:00:49.320> they're<00:00:49.620> just

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
also have a little puppy they're just

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.670 
also have a little puppy they're just
growing<00:00:50.460> out<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.730> bottom<00:00:51.289> so<00:00:52.289> I'm<00:00:52.440> going<00:00:52.469> to

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
growing out the bottom so I'm going to

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.770 
growing out the bottom so I'm going to
separate<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.789> put<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.030> into<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.239> new<00:00:54.480> pot

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
separate that and put it into a new pot

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.920 
separate that and put it into a new pot
hopefully<00:00:55.100> that<00:00:56.100> will<00:00:56.219> grow<00:00:56.430> as<00:00:56.610> well<00:00:56.930> let's

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
hopefully that will grow as well let's

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.380 
hopefully that will grow as well let's
go<00:00:58.079> for<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.440> alright<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.550> here<00:00:59.789> we<00:00:59.969> have<00:01:00.000> a

big<00:02:31.950> rice<00:02:32.950> big<00:02:33.280> pop<00:02:33.519> throw<00:02:33.910> in<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.660> more<00:02:34.810> space

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
big rice big pop throw in the more space

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:39.150 
big rice big pop throw in the more space
that<00:02:35.380> has<00:02:35.700> better<00:02:36.700> I<00:02:36.880> reckon<00:02:37.680> but<00:02:38.680> you

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
that has better I reckon but you

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.840 
that has better I reckon but you
shouldn't<00:02:39.430> have<00:02:39.609> it<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:40.030> bigger<00:02:40.269> one<00:02:40.510> really<00:02:40.930> I

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
shouldn't have it to bigger one really I

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.550 
shouldn't have it to bigger one really I
mean<00:02:42.850> you<00:02:43.000> wouldn't<00:02:43.239> want<00:02:43.420> that<00:02:43.510> big<00:02:43.989> this

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
mean you wouldn't want that big this

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.349 
mean you wouldn't want that big this
mess<00:02:44.859> in<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.190> thing<00:02:45.400> but<00:02:45.609> that's<00:02:46.150> all<00:02:46.329> right

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
mess in the thing but that's all right

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.870 
mess in the thing but that's all right
from<00:02:47.290> a<00:02:47.380> bit<00:02:47.620> too<00:02:47.829> much<00:02:47.859> space<00:02:48.340> but<00:02:48.640> it<00:02:48.760> means

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
from a bit too much space but it means

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.140 
from a bit too much space but it means

obviously going very that angles because

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.220 
obviously going very that angles because
it<00:05:00.010> hasn't<00:05:00.220> enough<00:05:00.550> space<00:05:00.910> to<00:05:00.940> grow<00:05:02.280> so

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:15.190 

bugger<00:06:06.230> give<00:06:07.230> it<00:06:07.410> a<00:06:07.620> little<00:06:07.830> water<00:06:11.690> like<00:06:12.690> that

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.200 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.440 

then<00:06:16.200> it<00:06:16.350> would<00:06:16.470> all<00:06:16.620> set<00:06:16.980> together<00:06:17.390> okay<00:06:18.390> so

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.450 
then it would all set together okay so

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.090 
then it would all set together okay so
it's<00:06:18.720> a<00:06:18.780> bit<00:06:18.960> fragile<00:06:19.200> at<00:06:19.500> the<00:06:19.530> moment<00:06:19.620> but

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
it's a bit fragile at the moment but

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.070 
it's a bit fragile at the moment but
this<00:06:20.310> is<00:06:20.520> this<00:06:20.970> is<00:06:21.180> it<00:06:21.360> all<00:06:21.540> standing<00:06:21.960> up

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
this is this is it all standing up

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.000 
this is this is it all standing up
nicely<00:06:22.320> and<00:06:22.620> correctly<00:06:23.100> and<00:06:23.430> we'll<00:06:24.270> be<00:06:24.390> done

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.010 
nicely and correctly and we'll be done

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.720 
nicely and correctly and we'll be done
very<00:06:26.010> very<00:06:26.730> happy<00:06:27.030> with<00:06:27.330> that<00:06:27.480> result

very very happy with that result

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.940 
very very happy with that result
hopefully<00:06:29.730> after<00:06:30.420> a<00:06:30.870> little<00:06:31.020> while<00:06:31.170> it<00:06:31.650> should

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950 
hopefully after a little while it should

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.380 
hopefully after a little while it should
go<00:06:32.100> up<00:06:32.130> straight<00:06:32.640> because<00:06:32.820> it<00:06:32.970> have<00:06:33.120> more

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:33.390 
go up straight because it have more

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.559 
go up straight because it have more
space<00:06:33.630> to<00:06:33.690> grow<00:06:34.080> more<00:06:34.620> boots<00:06:35.010> to<00:06:35.340> Rome

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:37.569
