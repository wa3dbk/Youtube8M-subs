little<00:01:08.630> tunnel<00:01:09.630> here<00:01:09.840> it's<00:01:10.320> actually<00:01:10.409> kind<00:01:10.830> of

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
little tunnel here it's actually kind of

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.010

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.740 
long so can be kind of annoying
especially<00:01:16.350> because<00:01:17.310> Diglett<00:01:17.880> has<00:01:18.060> some

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
especially because Diglett has some

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.080 
especially because Diglett has some
diglettz<00:01:19.140> have<00:01:19.350> an<00:01:19.920> ability<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.880> not

allow<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.630> run<00:01:21.810> away<00:01:21.900> from<00:01:22.049> battle<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:22.979> you

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
allow you to run away from battle so you

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.190 
allow you to run away from battle so you
are<00:01:23.280> forced<00:01:23.520> basin<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.479> here's<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.840> new<00:01:24.990> tunnel

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
are forced basin so here's a new tunnel

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.469 
are forced basin so here's a new tunnel
go<00:01:25.530> through<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.799> ladder<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.369> here<00:01:27.330> we<00:01:27.450> are

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
go through that ladder and here we are

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.370 
go through that ladder and here we are
at<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.810> other<00:01:27.990> end<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.619> escape<00:01:30.380> alright

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
at the other end of the escape alright

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.590 
at the other end of the escape alright
so<00:01:31.590> once<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.890> exit<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.490> tunnel<00:01:33.000> head

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
so once you exit that tunnel head

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.210 
so once you exit that tunnel head
directly<00:01:33.990> south<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.590> skip<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.040> house
