with this valve in the open position I'm

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.899 
with this valve in the open position I'm
going<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.409> pump<00:01:04.589> this<00:01:04.769> up<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.159> about<00:01:05.309> 10<00:01:05.549> pounds

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909

going to pump this up to about 10 pounds
of<00:01:05.970> pressure<00:01:06.240> make<00:01:06.960> sure<00:01:07.170> we<00:01:07.290> don't<00:01:07.409> have<00:01:07.590> any

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
of pressure make sure we don't have any

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.990 
of pressure make sure we don't have any
leaks<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:13.100> don't<00:01:14.100> see<00:01:14.280> any<00:01:14.400> leaks<00:01:14.640> around<00:01:14.790> the

master cylinder or hoses our gauge is
holding<00:01:17.880> pressure<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.960> I'm<00:01:19.020> going<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.229> go

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
holding pressure so I'm going to go

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.899 
holding pressure so I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.650> tilt<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.040> valve<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.490> relieve<00:01:20.759> the

ahead and tilt this valve to relieve the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:28.330 
ahead and tilt this valve to relieve the
pressure<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.299> we're<00:01:21.509> ready<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.780> add<00:01:21.900> fluid

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.790 

this<00:01:29.340> particular<00:01:29.910> vehicle<00:01:30.120> calls<00:01:30.870> 4.4<00:01:31.530> brake

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
this particular vehicle calls 4.4 brake

this particular vehicle calls 4.4 brake
fluid<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.310> poured<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.060> whole<00:01:33.090> quart<00:01:33.570> into<00:01:33.870> the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
fluid I poured a whole quart into the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.480 
fluid I poured a whole quart into the
pump<00:01:34.229> which<00:01:34.470> should<00:01:34.680> be<00:01:34.830> enough<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.220> do<00:01:35.370> this

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
pump which should be enough to do this

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.240 
pump which should be enough to do this
job<00:01:35.930> it's<00:01:36.930> always<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.260> good<00:01:37.440> idea<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.800> consult

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
job it's always a good idea to consult

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.650 
job it's always a good idea to consult
the<00:01:38.460> service<00:01:38.790> manual<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.270> see<00:01:39.420> what<00:01:39.540> the

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
the service manual to see what the

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.870 
the service manual to see what the
proper<00:01:40.020> pump<00:01:40.290> pressure<00:01:40.560> should<00:01:40.890> be<00:01:41.070> if<00:01:41.310> you're

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
proper pump pressure should be if you're

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.210 
proper pump pressure should be if you're
unsure<00:01:42.000> 10<00:01:42.720> psi<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.260> a<00:01:43.410> good<00:01:43.560> place<00:01:43.800> to<00:01:43.830> start

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
unsure 10 psi is a good place to start

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.910 
unsure 10 psi is a good place to start
so<00:01:45.060> I'm<00:01:45.150> going<00:01:45.300> to<00:01:45.360> pump<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.720> up<00:01:45.780> until<00:01:46.650> I<00:01:46.740> get

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
so I'm going to pump this up until I get

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.859 
so I'm going to pump this up until I get
to<00:01:47.040> 10<00:01:47.250> psi<00:01:49.040> and<00:01:50.090> then<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.240> Machine<00:01:51.540> also

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
to 10 psi and then the Machine also

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.590 
to 10 psi and then the Machine also
comes<00:01:52.110> with<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.410> hook<00:01:52.940> which<00:01:53.940> makes<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.420> nice

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
comes with this hook which makes it nice

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.660 
comes with this hook which makes it nice
to<00:01:55.350> hold<00:01:55.560> everything<00:01:55.860> level<00:01:56.250> while<00:01:56.550> you're

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
to hold everything level while you're

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.490 
to hold everything level while you're
bleeding<00:01:56.970> the<00:01:57.030> brakes<00:01:57.150> now<00:01:58.080> we're<00:01:58.259> ready<00:01:58.440> to

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
bleeding the brakes now we're ready to

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.340 
bleeding the brakes now we're ready to
lift<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.890> vehicle

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.100 

I've<00:02:04.160> securely<00:02:04.580> lifted<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.150> vehicle<00:02:05.570> in<00:02:05.750> this

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.020 
I've securely lifted the vehicle in this
situation<00:02:06.770> I'm<00:02:06.860> only<00:02:07.010> bleeding<00:02:07.190> one<00:02:07.550> brake<00:02:07.820> if

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
situation I'm only bleeding one brake if

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.820 
situation I'm only bleeding one brake if
you're<00:02:08.630> bleeding<00:02:08.960> more<00:02:09.080> than<00:02:09.229> one<00:02:09.350> brake<00:02:09.590> it's

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
you're bleeding more than one brake it's

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.380 
you're bleeding more than one brake it's
a<00:02:09.920> good<00:02:10.070> idea<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.520> check<00:02:10.670> your<00:02:10.880> service<00:02:11.210> manual

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
a good idea to check your service manual

you can put that on the end of the hose

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.440 
you can put that on the end of the hose
pump<00:03:38.920> it<00:03:39.130> back<00:03:39.160> up<00:03:39.550> and<00:03:39.730> fill<00:03:39.910> it<00:03:40.030> from<00:03:40.150> there
