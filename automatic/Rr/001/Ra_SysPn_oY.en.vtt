hi I'm making a video about the new
vortec<00:00:03.770> mp10<00:00:04.770> which<00:00:05.130> I<00:00:05.279> have<00:00:05.370> running<00:00:05.759> in<00:00:05.940> my

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
vortec mp10 which I have running in my

vortec mp10 which I have running in my
15<00:00:06.990> gallon<00:00:07.589> tank<00:00:08.179> I've<00:00:09.179> got<00:00:09.450> it<00:00:09.599> running<00:00:09.900> at

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
15 gallon tank I've got it running at

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.970 
15 gallon tank I've got it running at
about<00:00:10.160> maybe<00:00:11.160> one<00:00:11.519> third<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:12.030> full<00:00:12.300> power<00:00:12.570> on

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
about maybe one third of full power on

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.490 
about maybe one third of full power on
Lagoon<00:00:13.980> mode<00:00:14.750> it<00:00:15.750> doesn't<00:00:15.960> really<00:00:16.049> take<00:00:16.320> any

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
Lagoon mode it doesn't really take any

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.670 
Lagoon mode it doesn't really take any
more<00:00:16.740> than<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:18.080> to<00:00:19.080> really<00:00:19.260> get<00:00:19.439> things

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
more than that to really get things

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.820 
more than that to really get things
stirred<00:00:19.920> up<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.189> my<00:00:20.310> tank<00:00:21.320> as<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.439> can<00:00:22.560> see<00:00:22.740> it

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
stirred up in my tank as you can see it

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.490 
stirred up in my tank as you can see it
makes<00:00:23.010> nice<00:00:23.250> motion<00:00:23.880> on<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.119> surface<00:00:24.539> I've

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
makes nice motion on the surface I've

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.759 
makes nice motion on the surface I've
got<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.070> couple<00:00:26.460> inches<00:00:26.580> below<00:00:30.529> corals<00:00:31.529> get

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
got it a couple inches below corals get

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:39.950 
got it a couple inches below corals get
some<00:00:31.920> nice<00:00:32.809> periodic<00:00:33.809> movement<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.320> them<00:00:38.960> you

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
some nice periodic movement to them you

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.779 
some nice periodic movement to them you
can<00:00:40.110> see<00:00:41.809> I'm<00:00:42.809> Galaxia<00:00:43.410> polyps<00:00:44.480> waving<00:00:45.480> around

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
can see I'm Galaxia polyps waving around

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:52.270 
can see I'm Galaxia polyps waving around
some<00:00:47.789> xenian<00:00:48.390> cloves

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:59.229 

Alvia<00:00:53.180> pora<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.960> unit's<00:00:57.260> really<00:00:57.530> small<00:00:58.239> you

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
Alvia pora the unit's really small you

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.520 
Alvia pora the unit's really small you
can<00:00:59.360> see<00:00:59.510> it's<00:00:59.629> hard<00:00:59.780> takes<00:00:59.989> up<00:01:00.079> any<00:01:00.230> room<00:01:00.440> on

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
can see it's hard takes up any room on

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.140 
can see it's hard takes up any room on
the<00:01:00.620> side<00:01:00.829> of<00:01:00.860> the<00:01:01.010> tank<00:01:03.670> it's<00:01:04.670> a<00:01:04.759> controller

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
the side of the tank it's a controller

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.390 
the side of the tank it's a controller

box blue purple light means it's in the
Guru<00:01:07.670> mode<00:01:07.880> you<00:01:08.690> see<00:01:08.899> it's<00:01:09.020> relatively<00:01:09.440> small

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
Guru mode you see it's relatively small

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.680 
Guru mode you see it's relatively small
size<00:01:09.860> about<00:01:10.550> the<00:01:10.640> same<00:01:10.790> size<00:01:11.000> like<00:01:11.240> a<00:01:11.270> ton<00:01:11.570> Z

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.260 

see<00:01:18.409> the<00:01:18.500> surf<00:01:18.710> is<00:01:18.890> moving<00:01:19.190> a<00:01:19.250> little<00:01:19.430> better

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.270 

that's<00:01:23.869> on<00:01:24.020> one<00:01:24.229> end<00:01:24.439> there's<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.189> other<00:01:25.280> end

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
that's on one end there's the other end

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.590 
that's on one end there's the other end
if<00:01:28.280> I<00:01:28.369> crank<00:01:28.670> it<00:01:28.789> too<00:01:28.880> high<00:01:29.000> you<00:01:29.060> can<00:01:29.390> really

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
if I crank it too high you can really

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.919 
if I crank it too high you can really
see<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:29.869> difference<00:01:31.509> that's<00:01:32.509> two<00:01:32.659> for<00:01:32.869> a

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
see the difference that's two for a

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:43.660 
see the difference that's two for a

happens to not be all the way up right

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.980 
happens to not be all the way up right
now<00:01:52.100> it<00:01:52.250> must<00:01:52.400> just<00:01:52.520> be<00:01:52.730> a<00:01:52.880> little<00:01:53.660> bit<00:01:53.840> of<00:01:53.930> a

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
now it must just be a little bit of a

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.630 
now it must just be a little bit of a
lower<00:01:54.200> pulse<00:01:54.590> that's<00:01:54.800> in<00:01:55.010> a<00:01:55.100> lagoon<00:01:55.400> mode

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
lower pulse that's in a lagoon mode

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.880 
lower pulse that's in a lagoon mode
right<00:01:55.790> now<00:01:56.110> now<00:01:57.110> it's<00:01:57.350> really<00:01:57.500> starting<00:01:57.590> to

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
right now now it's really starting to

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.710 
right now now it's really starting to
kick

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.780 

being<00:02:05.620> that<00:02:05.740> close<00:02:05.920> to<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.220> surface<00:02:06.340> when<00:02:06.700> it

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
being that close to the surface when it

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.570 
being that close to the surface when it
kicks<00:02:07.090> all<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.300> way<00:02:07.360> to<00:02:07.420> full<00:02:07.630> power<00:02:07.870> it<00:02:08.580> tends

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
kicks all the way to full power it tends

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.010 
kicks all the way to full power it tends
to<00:02:09.729> stir<00:02:10.030> up<00:02:10.060> a<00:02:10.270> little<00:02:10.479> bubbles<00:02:10.750> from<00:02:10.869> the

to stir up a little bubbles from the

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.570 
to stir up a little bubbles from the
surface<00:02:13.740> you<00:02:14.740> can<00:02:14.800> see<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.010> mushrooms<00:02:15.400> don't

really<00:02:15.730> care<00:02:15.910> for<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.150> be<00:02:16.270> that<00:02:16.390> hot<00:02:16.540> I

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
really care for it to be that hot I

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.330 

so<00:02:37.930> antics<00:02:38.380> bellowing<00:02:38.680> around<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.070> little<00:02:39.190> bit

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.770 
so antics bellowing around a little bit
now<00:02:41.250> you're<00:02:42.250> really<00:02:42.400> at<00:02:42.970> birds<00:02:43.330> nests<00:02:43.630> is

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
now you're really at birds nests is

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.610 
now you're really at birds nests is
usually<00:02:44.080> going<00:02:44.230> crazy<00:02:44.620> look<00:02:44.890> at<00:02:45.040> it

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
usually going crazy look at it

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.500 
usually going crazy look at it
steering's<00:02:47.620> up<00:02:47.710> a<00:02:47.800> lot<00:02:47.950> of<00:02:48.070> detris

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.289
