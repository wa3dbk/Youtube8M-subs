00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
old co out my crankcase out so I got to

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.260 
old co out my crankcase out so I got to
replace<00:01:35.890> that<00:01:36.220> before<00:01:36.640> I<00:01:36.670> even<00:01:36.729> put<00:01:36.940> all<00:01:37.180> this

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
replace that before I even put all this

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.790 
replace that before I even put all this
back<00:01:37.450> together<00:01:37.630> but<00:01:38.080> I'd<00:01:38.200> take<00:01:38.410> the<00:01:38.530> bearing

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
back together but I'd take the bearing

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.000 
back together but I'd take the bearing
out<00:01:38.920> of<00:01:38.979> this<00:01:39.160> and<00:01:39.490> put<00:01:39.970> it<00:01:40.090> in<00:01:40.150> this<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:41.350> then

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
out of this and put it in this and then

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.980 
out of this and put it in this and then
how<00:01:42.460> this<00:01:42.670> works<00:01:43.000> is<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:46.060> here<00:01:46.330> this<00:01:46.840> is<00:01:46.960> a

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
how this works is this here this is a

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.530 
how this works is this here this is a
one-way<00:01:47.260> clutch<00:01:47.920> here<00:01:48.250> you<00:01:48.970> see<00:01:49.180> it's<00:01:49.330> already

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
one-way clutch here you see it's already

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.109 
one-way clutch here you see it's already
that's<00:01:49.869> brand-new<00:01:50.610> see<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.670> little<00:01:51.940> balls

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
that's brand-new see the little balls

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:59.490 
that's brand-new see the little balls
and<00:01:52.390> then<00:01:53.670> put<00:01:54.670> it<00:01:54.790> right<00:01:54.910> over<00:01:54.970> this<00:01:58.500> let's

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
and then put it right over this let's

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.760 
and then put it right over this let's
see<00:02:00.810> one<00:02:01.810> way<00:02:02.310> that's<00:02:03.310> that<00:02:03.369> cranks<00:02:03.850> it<00:02:03.940> up

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
see one way that's that cranks it up

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.740 
see one way that's that cranks it up
that's<00:02:05.770> like<00:02:06.009> that<00:02:06.270> see<00:02:07.270> it<00:02:07.360> won't<00:02:07.509> spin

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
that's like that see it won't spin

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.850 
that's like that see it won't spin
