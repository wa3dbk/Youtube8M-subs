thin layer so for the first 10 to 15

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.320 
thin layer so for the first 10 to 15
minutes<00:02:49.530> I'll<00:02:49.709> be<00:02:49.830> able<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:50.099> rub<00:02:50.879> my<00:02:51.090> lips

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
together in order to kind of smooth it

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.930 
together in order to kind of smooth it
out<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.510> make<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.720> nice<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:55.349> even<00:02:55.800> across<00:02:56.670> the

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
kind of see the line that it makes and I

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.619 
kind of see the line that it makes and I
don't<00:03:22.170> know<00:03:22.379> if<00:03:22.470> that's<00:03:22.650> normal<00:03:23.269> but<00:03:24.269> it's

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
don't know if that's normal but it's

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.750 
don't know if that's normal but it's
it's<00:03:25.019> something<00:03:25.200> that<00:03:25.409> happens<00:03:25.769> with<00:03:26.040> these

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:42.280 

the<00:03:29.760> next<00:03:30.120> one<00:03:30.299> is<00:03:30.540> Tokyo

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.350 

this<00:03:43.290> next<00:03:43.620> color<00:03:43.830> is<00:03:44.099> Antwerp<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.060> it's<00:03:45.180> one

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
this next color is Antwerp and it's one

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.149 
this next color is Antwerp and it's one
of<00:03:45.450> my<00:03:45.510> favorite<00:03:46.140> ones<00:03:46.319> from<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.680> collection

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
of my favorite ones from the collection

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.250 
of my favorite ones from the collection
and<00:03:47.400> one<00:03:47.940> thing<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.269> forgot<00:03:48.450> to<00:03:48.629> mention<00:03:48.870> was

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
and one thing I forgot to mention was

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.119 
and one thing I forgot to mention was
the<00:03:49.440> smell<00:03:49.739> they<00:03:50.430> do<00:03:50.489> have<00:03:50.940> a<00:03:51.239> buttery

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
the smell they do have a buttery

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:56.000 
the smell they do have a buttery
marshmallowy<00:03:53.129> smell<00:03:54.049> it's<00:03:55.049> very<00:03:55.349> unique<00:03:55.590> but

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
marshmallowy smell it's very unique but

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.520 
marshmallowy smell it's very unique but
it<00:03:56.190> is<00:03:56.549> similar<00:03:56.940> to<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.569> butter<00:03:57.870> glosses<00:03:58.200> I

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
it is similar to the butter glosses I

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.160 
it is similar to the butter glosses I
believe<00:03:59.120> they're<00:04:00.120> just<00:04:00.599> a<00:04:00.690> teeny<00:04:00.930> bit<00:04:01.019> more

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
believe they're just a teeny bit more

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.920 
believe they're just a teeny bit more
vanilla<00:04:01.830> II<00:04:02.040> I<00:04:02.580> don't<00:04:03.390> think<00:04:03.540> that's<00:04:03.690> a<00:04:03.780> word

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
vanilla II I don't think that's a word

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.280 
vanilla II I don't think that's a word
but<00:04:03.959> I<00:04:04.470> said<00:04:04.799> it<00:04:04.920> so<00:04:05.629> but<00:04:06.629> these<00:04:06.780> are<00:04:06.989> more

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
but I said it so but these are more

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.190 
but I said it so but these are more
buttery<00:04:07.829> marshmallowy<00:04:08.819> ish<00:04:09.450> but<00:04:09.870> they<00:04:09.989> have

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
buttery marshmallowy ish but they have

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:26.080 
buttery marshmallowy ish but they have
that<00:04:10.379> similar<00:04:11.250> sent<00:04:11.610> to<00:04:11.760> him

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.280 

this<00:04:27.090> is<00:04:27.389> Abu<00:04:27.960> Dhabi<00:04:28.430> and<00:04:29.480> it's<00:04:30.480> a<00:04:30.600> brown<00:04:30.870> color

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
this is Abu Dhabi and it's a brown color

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
this is Abu Dhabi and it's a brown color
that<00:04:31.410> I<00:04:31.620> don't<00:04:31.860> wear<00:04:32.070> too<00:04:32.460> often<00:04:42.980> this<00:04:43.980> is

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
that I don't wear too often this is

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:54.790 
that I don't wear too often this is
London

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:03.149 

and<00:04:55.340> it's<00:04:55.639> a<00:04:55.759> very<00:04:55.910> subtle<00:04:56.360> brown<00:04:56.780> I<00:04:56.990> believe

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:03.159 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:05.980 

the<00:05:04.159> last<00:05:04.400> color<00:05:04.729> with<00:05:04.970> hints<00:05:05.210> of<00:05:05.419> brown<00:05:05.539> is

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
the last color with hints of brown is

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.550 
the last color with hints of brown is
Stockholm<00:05:06.620> and<00:05:07.449> it's<00:05:08.449> the<00:05:08.690> one<00:05:08.870> I<00:05:08.900> wear<00:05:09.199> most

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
Stockholm and it's the one I wear most

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:22.210 
Stockholm and it's the one I wear most
often<00:05:09.860> out<00:05:10.340> of<00:05:10.550> these<00:05:10.729> three<00:05:20.889> this<00:05:21.889> is<00:05:22.069> the

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
often out of these three this is the

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.680 
often out of these three this is the
brightest<00:05:22.639> color<00:05:22.879> of<00:05:23.030> the<00:05:23.090> bunch<00:05:23.300> and<00:05:23.539> it's

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
brightest color of the bunch and it's

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.779 
brightest color of the bunch and it's
called<00:05:23.930> San<00:05:24.319> Paolo<00:05:24.819> and<00:05:25.819> it's<00:05:26.270> just<00:05:26.449> a<00:05:26.569> bright

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
called San Paolo and it's just a bright

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:34.930 
called San Paolo and it's just a bright
ready<00:05:28.789> pink<00:05:29.210> I<00:05:32.860> really<00:05:33.860> should<00:05:34.069> say<00:05:34.310> bold<00:05:34.639> that

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
ready pink I really should say bold that

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.370 
ready pink I really should say bold that
it's<00:05:35.090> the<00:05:35.240> boldest<00:05:35.659> of<00:05:35.840> the<00:05:35.960> bunch<00:05:36.169> because

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
it's the boldest of the bunch because

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.800 
it's the boldest of the bunch because
it's<00:05:36.590> not<00:05:36.770> exactly<00:05:37.190> bright<00:05:37.550> it's<00:05:38.300> a<00:05:38.449> deeper

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
it's not exactly bright it's a deeper

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.510 
it's not exactly bright it's a deeper
reddish<00:05:39.139> pink<00:05:39.409> color<00:05:39.620> but<00:05:39.889> it's<00:05:40.009> very<00:05:40.190> bold

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
reddish pink color but it's very bold

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:50.050 
reddish pink color but it's very bold
and<00:05:40.930> noticeable<00:05:47.979> so<00:05:48.979> the<00:05:49.099> last<00:05:49.340> color<00:05:49.729> in<00:05:49.940> this

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
and noticeable so the last color in this

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.959 
and noticeable so the last color in this
collection<00:05:50.419> is<00:05:50.750> Amsterdam<00:05:54.340> that's<00:05:55.340> a<00:05:55.550> very

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:55.969

pretty<00:05:56.360> red<00:06:00.009> and<00:06:01.009> I<00:06:01.069> think<00:06:01.340> I<00:06:01.490> smeared<00:06:01.880> all<00:06:02.030> of

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
pretty red and I think I smeared all of

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.570 
pretty red and I think I smeared all of
that<00:06:02.419> on<00:06:02.630> my<00:06:02.780> pants<00:06:03.080> oh<00:06:04.599> crap
