00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
 7 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.940
 hello everyone welcome on the 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.350
 honey heated nonsense 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.110
 today I propose a recipe 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.040
 of chocolate bread but revisited you 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.590
 will understand right now it's 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.000
 left then rather than leave on a 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.259
 puff pastry that is really very 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.660
 very long business I wanted to make a 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.070
 chocolate bread recipe much more 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.809
 fast so obviously I cheated a 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.059
 little bit I prepared rather a paw 

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:33.250
 a little brioche you'll see on 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:34.630
 already begins with dilute and yeast 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.000
 baker in warm milk 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.950
 then you go and that in 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.300
 your bread machine you will add 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.790
 sugar 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.910
 Then we continue by adding the 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.700
 small dice of butter we continue in there 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.200
 adding the flour then add the 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.700
 salt then the salt should not be in 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.400
 contact with the yeast so it's for 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.380
 that I put it on top then we 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.860
 will end with vanilla extract 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.450
 liquid 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.040
 so that's optional you 're not 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.390
 not have to put some or you 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.530
 put real vanilla bean 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.950
 here you can do a little 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.259
 variant 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.140
 that's after you put your machine to 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.399
 bread on just paste program so finally 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.490
 in any case for mine had for 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:12.969
 1h30 of kneading and then 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.819
 mounted 

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:17.020
 it had to double in volume 

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:18.729
 after an hour and a half she was 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.219
 so ready there so you're just going 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.509
 the gas die and you make a ball and 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:23.530
 you cut it in half so 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.789
 I explain now for those who 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.130
 do not have a bread machine it's very 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:28.810
 simple you can take your robot 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.520
 or else a big salad bowl in your hand and 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.249
 you do exactly the same thing 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.810
 except that you're going to knead it a 

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:36.219
 quarter of an hour by hand and consult you 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.020
 let you double your volume 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.819
 share in a corner where he makes a small 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.529
 little hotter so we'll take care of 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:44.020
 ja of the first stick so you spread it 

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:45.969
 in rectangle so as much as possible 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.209
 high possible and not too narrow 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:51.340
 close 20 20 cm madian and you have to 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:53.560
 able to do at least four or five 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.209
 chocolate buns so depending on the size 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.279
 that you're going to give them to me he was 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:58.899
 a little big but good here after 

00:01:57.279 --> 00:02:00.340
 the fact how do you measure with 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.359
 a chocolate bar 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.189
 as I show you then was picking 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:04.840
 dark chocolate either take you from the 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.889
 pralinoise so it's more or less the 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.470
 same size a little matter 

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:10.149
 and once you've cut your 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.830
 bands so there are about 4 or 5 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.020
 you put chocolate at the end 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.340
 is wanted to simply roll on 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.220
 himself here is I show you the 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.329
 result so once it's rolling 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.069
 then you go up and all your 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.540
 chocolate buns on a plate 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.129
 pastry and you put a movie 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.930
 prevent the dough from actually crusting 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.760
 the top and let you double 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.290
 volume so here it is now at 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.510
 it took about an hour 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.620
 so it doubled in volume 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.390
 so now we will go to the gilding 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.819
 so either you use an egg yolk 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.129
 either you use milk mixed with 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.480
 sugar and that's you lethal is everything 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.329
 simply on the top then we 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.650
 stuffs halfway up to 180 degrees to 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.500
 it takes about 15 minutes 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.030
 little chocolate steps are well browned and 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.409
 here it is cooked so I was a 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.469
 little bit hot again I wanted to cut 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.489
 in two to show you inside 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:55.959
 so these good chocolate buns 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.700
 sure are better when they have when 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.739
 even lukewarm because when it's hot 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.840
 the chocolate is really too hot 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.359
 women we see the crowd eating lukewarm or 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.430
 cold so it was absolutely delicious 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.169
 here I find that trompe l'oeil and 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.590
 not bad anyway it's not a dough 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:10.780
 puff 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.489
 it's a little brioche dough but 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.859
 here it is much faster to do 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.560
 and the children the children have well 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:18.489
 appreciated here do not hesitate to tell me 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.480
