 five gold and be afraid of the word 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.020
 rules for natural athlete 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.750
 these are 5 basic principles you 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.379
 should rely in their workouts 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.410
 unless of course you want to get 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:39.090
 training positive 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.910
 it doesn't matter if you train for development 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.059
 power qualities you want to increase 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.690
 muscle mass or just take care of 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.989
 your health and muscle is 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.379
 one of the components of our health 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.890
 one of the important parts and what's the most 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.050
 the main thing that has already been proven physicians muscles 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.680
 the only thing that does not age in our 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.729
 in the body 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.000
 so when you correctly correctly 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:11.850

 my partners think what you would 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.409
 suggested 5 principles 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.409
 this natural training 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.220
 first place in our rating of 5 base 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.880
 basic principles for natural 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.040
 athlete 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:58.480
 it will be difficult to overestimate the regime of the day 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:03.940
 the need to respect the 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:08.369
 second place is food nutrition is 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:12.340
 our we all adjust our workouts 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:16.209
 just under the power of our food but 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.400
 not the other way round because still great 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.470
 and the terrible dorian yats said that you 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.410
 you can train so much 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:28.600
 how intensely your quality 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:30.700
 food in third place is water yes how much 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.420
 no matter how much we say 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.690
 considered 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:38.620
 how much would we learn useful and 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:42.989
 necessary water qualities for our 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:47.290
 the body we care and I including 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:50.769
 Often do not get in the necessary 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.290
 the amount of water per day it can 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.480
 affect not only quality 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.260
 workouts but also on our quality 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.610
 vital activity and only on the fourth 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.260
 place many this will surprise is training 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.630
 training depends on all three 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.820
 of the above 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.250
 basic principles because training 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.459
 directly depends on those three 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.370
 the above points and if these 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:22.930
 the points will limp then and the workouts are not 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.120
 will give you the effect that 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.880
 you strive 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:31.720
 in fifth place of our ranking diary 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.810
 because everything we are above 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:39.760
 with you listed it is impossible to withhold 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:42.480
 in my head and the diary is what helps 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.730
 you go through thorns 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:49.970
 stars diary will show you your mistakes 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.590
 deficiencies your shortcomings and vice versa 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.140
 positive aspects of your training 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.099
 thanks to the diary you can 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.890
 track 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:01.799
 where did you do wrong where 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.950
 where what needs to be changed and where what is needed 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.910
 improve or keep either leave on 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.920
 former level 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:14.150
 and in all these go the basic principles 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.410
 for a natural athlete as well as this 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.079
 suitable for those who use 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.889
 pharmacology we will talk in the following 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:25.789
 issues about each of the five basic 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:28.949
 principles separately separately 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:29.729
 day mode separate meals separately 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.919
 on water 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:35.430
 the biggest issue will be dedicated 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:37.800
 training sessions and a diary separately 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.900
 because when we say diary 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.510
 many people think that this is a training diary 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:47.970
 in fact the training diary is 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:50.250
 just one part of the diary diary 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:54.210
 you will record not only yours 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:57.270
 but exercise and nutrition as well as the mode 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.760
 days will be recorded tracked 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.520
 just due to the introduction 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.010
 diary 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.789
 see you next time rethink and 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:11.690
 improve your knowledge constantly 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:14.430
 not only physically but spiritually 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:17.840
 develop mentally and then you will 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.470
 fully develop do not forget that 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.229
 physical education 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:25.110
 this is just part of it 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:27.479
 culture of society and need to be engaged and 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.330
 to develop naturally all third-party 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:32.460

 your life but also on those

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.690
 questions in the comments but most importantly 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.700
 those who ask questions in the comments 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:48.790
