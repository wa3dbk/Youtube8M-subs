00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.230
 hello good in this video I 'm going to 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.260
 teach these lentils these rich 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.540
 We are going to need 4 cloves of garlic 2 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.750
 bay leaves carrot onion 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:23.730
 chorizo â€‹â€‹ribs lentils herbs 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:27.619
 Provenzales rice tomato and oil 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.619
 we will put the oil in the pan 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.280
 when it's hot we 're going to put the 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.280
 sausage 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.570
 and the garlic 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.290
 it has to be at medium heat 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.290
 bad 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.050
 because so now when we are the 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.200
 lentils 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.040
 - at medium heat and we are not going to 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.040
 to burn 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.120
 we remove that we suffered a little 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.910
 we will throw the lentils 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.740
 as we have said to agreed medium fire 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.900
 be because if you are not going to burn this 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.190
 is done so that the lentils then do not 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.520
 it melts 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.740
 that they do not stay like a plasta 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.220
 do not look 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.220
 and 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.329
 that do not fall apart we throw the onion 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.410
 and we remove 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.729
 we put on medium heat 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:55.770
 so that he goes suffering 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.770
 quietly so we burn nothing 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.200
 we are at the bay 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.409
 and now the Provencal herbs 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.950
 the remove 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.750
 so that all the 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.750
 flavors 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.130
 now we make a hole because there 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.130
 let's take the tomato 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.260
 we are the tomato card 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.770
 and we remove it 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.870
 now we will pour water we have to fill 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:46.700
 all the saucepan 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:50.430
 until what is almost being a little finger 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.760
 or two so that it will not leave 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.760
 above 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.239
 we take them all 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:03.079
 then there he left me like two little fingers more or 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:05.139
 less fingers half two fingers from where 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:08.290
 the broth ends where the sole ends 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:11.290
 we take like two tablespoons of 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.290
 Salt 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.320
 but good this of the salts to the pleasure 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:23.160
 we throw the ribs 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.160
 in the carrot 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.810
 we see a little 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.860
 and that's it now we're setting fire to medium 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.040
 and when it starts 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.699
 to boil, let's leave it 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.699
 half-covered 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.790
 so that it does not come out or that's what 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.800
 we will cover now 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:03.410
 and when we see that she is going to see 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.410
 Well we opened it a little bit 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.320
 we cover it 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.250
 and now as you see the best half open 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.250
 so that it does not come out 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.800
 it is already boiling 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:41.649
 but let's see if the lentils are 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.649
 made 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.969
 and they have to be around an hour 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.729
 hour 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:56.759
 and fourth for lentils to be made 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:59.330
 at medium heat more depends on the fire 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:02.210
 will take more or less 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.650
 well let's uncover and now we're going 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.830
 to throw 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.990
 when the lentils are already done 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:13.330
 dye well as now we are going to 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.330
 put rice to make it more beautiful 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.250
 a little bit so let's try the 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.820
 lentils and so we already make sure that 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.820
 be done 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:38.610
 and we're going to take the rice 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:40.919
 if you see that the rice sticks out of the water 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.020
 worth of the broth you would have to throw a 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:46.600
 a little more broth as half a cup 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:52.200
 so that we do not stay dry 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:54.570
 then they are approximately so I know 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:57.320
 15 minutes to make the rice and already 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.320
 they would be done 

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.840
 and when they are made by the time of 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.710
 throw it out 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.710
 to the deal 

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:13.710
 and so our lentils would be fine 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.870
 rich try it done because the truth 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:18.770
 is that they are very good 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.770
 a little kiss until later
