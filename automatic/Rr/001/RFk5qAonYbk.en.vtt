00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.379
 hi everyone guys and welcome to 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.480
 this new video as you all know 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.969
 in the last hours the internet is exploding 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.330
 in fact, a Chinese team has issued a 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.000
 surprise an untethered jailbreak of ios 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.650
 7.1 and 7.1.1 before showing you how 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.539
 run this jailbreak and I want to do 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.490
 a series of premises the jailbreak is 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.710
 was released just by surprise and by 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.869
 a society we do not know 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.150
 it seems that if it is related to society 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.650
 which developed pp 25 a famous one 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.860
 software for downloading applications 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.700
 pirate on ios so this thing 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.829
 it means 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.020
 means that we have no idea if this 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.309
 jailbreak can be safe or can 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.320
 install malware 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.539
 we have no idea if once executed 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.520
 jailbreak our private data i 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.800
 our sensitive data our passwords 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.420
 saved on the device could 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.030
 so my advice will be stolen 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.800
 currently it is not to do this 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.840
 jailbreak because we still have too many 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.370
 little information or you do 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.620
 exactly how I did it ie 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.629
 run it on a device that does not have 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.090
 your apple id which has none 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.369
 password saved and not used for 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.229
 work or for personal purposes because like 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.479
 I already said we have no idea if this 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.950
 jailbreak is safe or includes a 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.740
 virus but I can guarantee you that 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.140
 however it works from a few minutes however hayez 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.450
 not famous reliable hacker has 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.220
 statement that analyzed the 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.110
 jailbreak hunter and of the fact from this 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.119
 tool and it all seems to be fine 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.000
 nevertheless I invite you as I have already told you 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.430
 to wait because when there will be 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.040
 final confirmation that this jailbreak 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.720
 will be absolutely sure I will write it in 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.700
 description therefore if you now in 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.920
 Descriptions of this video find the 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.820
 written the jailbreak is one hundred secure 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.500
 percent 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.759
 then you can go quiet if not 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.170
 you find it cautious and execute it on 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.689
 devices you no longer care about 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.159
 so be hacked in quotes 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.680
 I said this, let's not waste any more time 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.750
 and we begin immediately with the tutorial on 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.939
 tool is called peng wu and is available 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.920
 only for downloadable windows 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.500
 for free from the link that I put you in 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.540
 description is obviously compatible with 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.410
 all existing devices therefore 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:13.470
 iphone 5 iphone 5 c iphone 5 iphone 4s 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.880
 iphone 4 ipad and ipad 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.460
 in retina ipad 3 ipad 4 ipad mini 1 ipad 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.740
 2 and fifth generation ipod touch 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.780
 I've already done this jailbreak 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.180
 untethered on my fifth ipod touch 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.370
 generation was london run on mine 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.380
 iphone 5 s together with you then how 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.090
 see here is my iphone 5 connected 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.800
 at my windows computer is the first thing 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.730
 what you have to do is go up 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.490
 settings 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.150
 then go to the general section 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:44.430
 and finally go to the block section 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.370
 automatic once block is reached 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.520
 automatic you'll have to set it to never one 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.260
 Once set on we should never go back 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.630
 in the settings to disable the 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.910
 block with breast code in fact we will have a 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.470
 block with code a password at 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.570
 active lock screen 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.550
 we will have to disable it to do it 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.020
 back to settings let's go into the 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.570
 block section with code 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.700
 then we scroll down and deactivate 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.930
 our code obviously once 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.240
 the jailbreak procedure is over 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.160
 we could reactivate it once 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.930
 disabled the code lock now 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.420
 I go to the device information 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.630
 to show you that I'm actually up 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.760
 ios 7.1.1 you can also understand it from 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.650
 new choirs to switch off which has changed 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.390
 precisely duyos 7.1 onwards 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.560
 and then this is an iphone 5 s then 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.050
 we're going to jailbreak it 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.209
 untethered together then once 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.430
 downloaded the peng wu app for 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.739
 windows right click and select 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.300
 run as an administrator is a lot 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.720
 important to open in this way 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.239
 then press on the yes and 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.700
 after a few seconds it will materialize 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.620
 this screen therefore as you see 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.810
 since the characters are Chinese i 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.670
 other computers will recognize them as 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.620
 however, the question marks are not 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.540
 very difficult the first thing 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.090
 you absolutely have to do that one more 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.549
 important of all is to remove the tick 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.200
 to this little black square mi 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.850
 I recommend removing the check mark as 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.980
 you see meanwhile mine is recognized 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.230
 connected device however important and 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.030
 uncheck the one written before 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.250
 to perform the jailbreak 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.709
 then press the black button 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.030
 placed on the right side of the program e 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.160
 the jailbreak will start 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.440
 as you can see the device asks us to 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.000
 perform actions in this case the 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.500
 language in Chinese so it's not much 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.960
 simple to understand but I tell you 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.509
 you will simply have to 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.669
 go to the settings 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:32.960
 then go to the section 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:36.190
 general and finally go to the section 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:39.410
 date and time then remove the check mark 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.840
 automatic and you will have to set the date 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.750
 back you have to set it back 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.789
 until the jailbreak will start if the 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.759
 jailbreak and do not start set the 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:51.620
 specifically February 6, 2014 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:54.199
 however it should be enough to go a little 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.639
 back and the jailbreak will start if 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:58.130
 just don't start and set the 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.509
 precisely February 6, 2014 how 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.039
 you see in this case the jailbreak is 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.870
 party it was enough for me to go a little 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:05.570
 back with the months and will have installed us 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.330
 this application then when the bar 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.460
 will be exactly half will hang the 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.539
 jailbreak will not continue and to do so 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.070
 continue we will have to open them 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.270
 the application that will have installed us 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.849
 on the device 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.590
 so now the pro first continues on 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:20.659
 this life of security and as you see 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.580
 the jailbreak will continue instantly from 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:24.710
 now we will no longer have to do anything 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.039
 and simply enjoy the procedure 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.039
 jailbreak 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.410
 as you see ours at some point 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.720
 device will reboot is all normal 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.870
 we keep looking without touching 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.870
 anything 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.979
 if itunes opens in the background we can 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.780
 also close it so much that it will not serve 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:22.240
 meanwhile I take this opportunity to tell you that the 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.569
 my iphone is almost on you are going to 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.729
 switch on 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:28.949
 and as you see it once turned on 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:30.629
 unlock but it will restart instantly 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:32.909
 normal will reboot immediately afterwards 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:34.830
 what's just been you there 

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:37.639
 worry and keep looking at the 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.639
 jailbreak procedure 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.750
 as you see during this startup 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.490
 the logos of the house will appear 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.930
 producer who created this 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.610
 jailbreak don't worry too 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.950
 this is normal means that it is 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:55.230
 finishing the last stages of the jailbreak 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.230
 same and keep waiting 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.460
 perfect as you see it turned on let's go 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.820
 immediately to unlock it even if the first one 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:09.440
 start the unlock could be a bit 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.060
 bad you don't care normal one 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.860
 once unlocked as you see we find 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.930
 cydia installed we go immediately to 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.240
 open and wait for it to execute 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.220
 file system preparation 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.110
 this process will also last about three 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.880
 minutes or in this case instead it has it 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.890
 speeded up so you don't get bored 

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.900
 too once the process is over 

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:29.240
 breast will last about three minutes 

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.580
 your iphone will restart for the last one 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.530
 time this will be the last reboot e 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.770
 so we wait for the 

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.770
 lockscreen 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.530
 as you see it has come 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.770
 the lockscreen we go to unlock e 

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.909
 we find cydia up and running 

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:46.789
 so guys we managed to 

00:07:44.909 --> 00:07:50.580
 untethered ios jailbreak 

00:07:46.789 --> 00:07:51.539
 7.1 and 7.1.1 successfully on ours 

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.280
 iphone 5 

00:07:51.539 --> 00:07:55.500
 I repeat that it is compatible with all 

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.229
 devices but I remind you to stay 

00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.000
 be careful and don't run it on yours 

00:07:58.229 --> 00:08:02.159
 primary devices until we have 

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.080
 more information on developers 

00:08:02.159 --> 00:08:05.580
 however guys I remind you of
