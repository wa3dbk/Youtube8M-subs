00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
lot of pressure I don't know that

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.540 
lot of pressure I don't know that
they're<00:02:10.790> endangered<00:02:11.790> yet

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550

point where we know for sure because

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.540 
point where we know for sure because
that<00:02:16.750> might<00:02:17.170> be<00:02:17.320> too<00:02:17.500> late<00:02:17.740> but<00:02:18.250> they're<00:02:18.370> under

that might be too late but they're under
so<00:02:18.730> much<00:02:18.850> pressure<00:02:18.910> around<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.660> world<00:02:19.810> this

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
so much pressure around the world this

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.600 
so much pressure around the world this
whole<00:02:20.140> print<00:02:20.380> this<00:02:20.470> practice<00:02:20.860> of<00:02:21.010> thinning<00:02:21.460> is

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
whole print this practice of thinning is

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.060 
whole print this practice of thinning is
just<00:02:22.300> absolutely<00:02:22.690> barbaric<00:02:23.140> that<00:02:23.800> they<00:02:23.920> would

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
just absolutely barbaric that they would

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.190 
just absolutely barbaric that they would
catch<00:02:24.460> a<00:02:24.550> shark<00:02:24.760> cut<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.150> fin<00:02:25.330> off<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.780> throw

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
catch a shark cut the fin off and throw

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.450 
catch a shark cut the fin off and throw
the<00:02:26.290> rest<00:02:26.350> of<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.620> shark<00:02:26.860> back<00:02:27.040> in<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.310> ocean

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
the rest of the shark back in the ocean

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.430 
the rest of the shark back in the ocean
just<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.880> get<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.150> thin<00:02:28.420> are<00:02:28.630> we<00:02:29.140> making

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
just to get the thin are we making

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.170 
just to get the thin are we making
progress<00:02:29.470> and<00:02:29.980> shutting<00:02:30.430> that<00:02:30.520> practice<00:02:30.970> down

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
progress and shutting that practice down

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.120 
progress and shutting that practice down
I<00:02:31.480> think<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.080> first<00:02:32.290> part<00:02:32.500> of<00:02:32.560> progress<00:02:32.980> is

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
I think the first part of progress is

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.100 
I think the first part of progress is
making<00:02:33.460> sure<00:02:33.610> everybody<00:02:33.940> knows<00:02:34.150> that<00:02:34.540> this<00:02:34.930> is

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
making sure everybody knows that this is

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.830 
making sure everybody knows that this is
happening<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:35.710> then<00:02:36.520> making<00:02:37.210> sure<00:02:37.360> that<00:02:37.660> we

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
happening and then making sure that we

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.140 
happening and then making sure that we
don't<00:02:38.470> buy<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:38.830> products<00:02:39.430> that<00:02:39.760> are

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
don't buy the products that are

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.390 
don't buy the products that are
resulting<00:02:40.600> from<00:02:40.810> this<00:02:41.020> it's<00:02:41.860> certainly<00:02:42.130> still

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
resulting from this it's certainly still

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.790 
resulting from this it's certainly still
a<00:02:42.460> problem<00:02:42.870> it's<00:02:43.870> becoming<00:02:44.290> more<00:02:44.530> and<00:02:44.650> more

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
a problem it's becoming more and more

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.340 
a problem it's becoming more and more
known<00:02:45.120> we<00:02:46.120> have<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.480> continue<00:02:46.990> with<00:02:47.200> the

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
known we have to continue with the

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.380 
known we have to continue with the
pressure<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:48.130> stop<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.520> shark<00:02:48.700> hunting<00:02:49.060> okay

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
pressure to stop the shark hunting okay

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
pressure to stop the shark hunting okay
