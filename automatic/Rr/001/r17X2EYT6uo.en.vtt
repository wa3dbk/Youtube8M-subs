out<00:02:01.350> much<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.829> suppose<00:02:02.729> as<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.210> center<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:03.780> quite

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
out much I suppose as a center on quite

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.840 
out much I suppose as a center on quite
a<00:02:04.020> bit<00:02:04.229> pace<00:02:04.500> that's<00:02:05.159> why<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.399> probably<00:02:05.759> goes

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
a bit pace that's why it probably goes

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.249 
a bit pace that's why it probably goes
up<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.149> night<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.659> heading<00:02:07.079> as<00:02:07.229> well<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.590> it

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
up a night to heading as well is it

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.039

gets the link with franck ribéry and
angle<00:06:06.930> demaria<00:06:07.470> so<00:06:08.160> that's<00:06:08.400> why<00:06:08.580> he<00:06:08.880> has<00:06:09.090> them

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
angle demaria so that's why he has them

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.430 
angle demaria so that's why he has them
playing<00:06:09.510> there<00:06:09.900> I'm<00:06:11.060> 48,000<00:06:12.060> this<00:06:12.440> that's

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
playing there I'm 48,000 this that's

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.719 
playing there I'm 48,000 this that's
probably<00:06:13.710> expensive<00:06:14.070> cuz<00:06:14.340> that's<00:06:14.550> the

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:14.729 
probably expensive cuz that's the

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:16.850 
probably expensive cuz that's the
operation<00:06:15.570> so<00:06:15.720> his<00:06:16.080> price<00:06:16.320> is<00:06:16.470> probably<00:06:16.710> gone

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
operation so his price is probably gone

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.480 
operation so his price is probably gone
down<00:06:17.130> maybe<00:06:17.430> from<00:06:17.880> and<00:06:18.650> what<00:06:19.650> was<00:06:20.070> I<00:06:20.400> don't

wrong in the comments but his price has

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.830

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
probably come down quite a bit like Omri

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.510 
probably come down quite a bit like Omri
was<00:06:26.080> gonna<00:06:26.290> go<00:06:26.530> hundred<00:06:26.770> twenty<00:06:27.070> canings

would then kind of cards very first

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
would then kind of cards very first
thing<00:06:31.720> I<00:06:31.780> think<00:06:31.990> you<00:06:32.050> should<00:06:32.230> wait<00:06:32.350> like

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
thing I think you should wait like

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:33.720 
thing I think you should wait like
coupla<00:06:32.890> weeks<00:06:32.950> before<00:06:33.280> you<00:06:33.340> getting<00:06:33.580> a<00:06:33.610> no

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:33.730 
coupla weeks before you getting a no

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.220 
coupla weeks before you getting a no
card<00:06:34.000> unless<00:06:34.120> you<00:06:34.330> really<00:06:34.660> really<00:06:34.780> want

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.230 
card unless you really really want

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.990 
card unless you really really want
because<00:06:36.100> the<00:06:36.220> price<00:06:36.430> is<00:06:36.460> when<00:06:36.730> they<00:06:36.820> first

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.000 
because the price is when they first

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.730 
because the price is when they first
come<00:06:37.090> are<00:06:37.180> going<00:06:37.450> to<00:06:37.510> be<00:06:37.570> ridiculous<00:06:38.110> please
