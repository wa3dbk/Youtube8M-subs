00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.300 
hello dear there was a deer in the in
the<00:03:00.600> over<00:03:01.600> there<00:03:01.840> trying<00:03:02.709> to<00:03:02.770> scare<00:03:03.130> me<00:03:03.160> I

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
the over there trying to scare me I

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.460 
the over there trying to scare me I
guess<00:03:04.320> yeah<00:03:05.320> looks<00:03:05.920> like<00:03:06.070> somebody<00:03:07.350> tried<00:03:08.350> to

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
guess yeah looks like somebody tried to

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.860 
guess yeah looks like somebody tried to
move<00:03:08.680> some<00:03:09.040> big<00:03:09.670> berms<00:03:10.060> here<00:03:10.360> I'll<00:03:10.510> guess<00:03:10.690> that

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
move some big berms here I'll guess that

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.060 
move some big berms here I'll guess that
maybe<00:03:11.050> that<00:03:11.200> was<00:03:11.320> from<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.560> plowing<00:03:11.920> the

maybe that was from the plowing the

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.370 
maybe that was from the plowing the
other<00:03:12.190> day<00:03:13.110> all<00:03:14.110> right<00:03:15.810> anyway<00:03:16.810> you<00:03:16.870> can<00:03:17.170> kind
