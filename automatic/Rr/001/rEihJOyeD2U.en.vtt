00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
9,000 feet or 3,000 to 6,000 here we're

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.140 
9,000 feet or 3,000 to 6,000 here we're
basically<00:01:19.200> riding<00:01:19.500> sea<00:01:20.130> level<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.580> 3,000<00:01:21.090> so

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
basically riding sea level to 3,000 so

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.330 
basically riding sea level to 3,000 so
it's<00:01:21.270> kinda<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.570> same<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:22.560> we<00:01:22.770> have<00:01:23.009> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
it's kinda the same but we have the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.980 
it's kinda the same but we have the
trees<00:01:23.550> so<00:01:23.850> we<00:01:23.880> need<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.330> go<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.540> clearcuts

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
trees so we need to go to clearcuts

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.590 
trees so we need to go to clearcuts
where<00:01:25.229> they<00:01:25.320> do<00:01:25.440> the<00:01:25.530> logging<00:01:25.880> or<00:01:26.880> bare<00:01:27.240> areas

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
where they do the logging or bare areas

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.600 
where they do the logging or bare areas
that<00:01:27.750> we<00:01:27.869> can<00:01:28.020> find<00:01:28.259> or<00:01:28.470> maybe<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.979> fire<00:01:29.280> swept

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
that we can find or maybe a fire swept

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.130 
that we can find or maybe a fire swept
through<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:30.030> that's<00:01:30.450> kind<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.780> stuff<00:01:30.960> we<00:01:31.080> need

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
through so that's kind of stuff we need

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.490 
through so that's kind of stuff we need
to<00:01:31.320> find<00:01:32.090> what<00:01:33.090> happened<00:01:33.450> was<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:34.110> same<00:01:34.320> rain

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500
