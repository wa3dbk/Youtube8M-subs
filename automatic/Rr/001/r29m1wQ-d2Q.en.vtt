I'm<00:04:32.950> just<00:04:33.160> going<00:04:33.340> to<00:04:33.370> do<00:04:33.490> it<00:04:33.610> two<00:04:33.760> times

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
I'm just going to do it two times

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.750 
I'm just going to do it two times
because<00:04:34.330> I<00:04:34.390> think<00:04:34.600> that's<00:04:34.750> all<00:04:34.930> it<00:04:35.080> needs

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
because I think that's all it needs

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.100 
because I think that's all it needs
just<00:04:36.760> the<00:04:36.880> same<00:04:37.120> hitch<00:04:37.480> not<00:04:37.690> that<00:04:37.870> we've<00:04:37.990> been

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
just the same hitch not that we've been

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.390 
just the same hitch not that we've been
doing<00:04:38.320> this<00:04:38.440> whole<00:04:38.650> time<00:04:40.890> then<00:04:41.890> I<00:04:42.190> do<00:04:42.250> another

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
doing this whole time then I do another

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.580 
doing this whole time then I do another
hitch<00:04:43.030> knot<00:04:43.270> but<00:04:43.510> I<00:04:43.570> take<00:04:43.900> it<00:04:43.930> through<00:04:44.470> the

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
hitch knot but I take it through the

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.530 
hitch knot but I take it through the
front<00:04:44.950> of<00:04:45.160> the<00:04:45.250> extension<00:04:48.240> just<00:04:49.240> right

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
front of the extension just right

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.860 
front of the extension just right
through<00:04:49.810> it<00:04:49.900> like<00:04:50.050> that<00:04:52.890> and<00:04:54.510> pull<00:04:55.510> it<00:04:55.630> tight

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
through it like that and pull it tight

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.750 
through it like that and pull it tight
and<00:04:56.140> if<00:04:56.800> you're<00:04:56.950> worried<00:04:57.310> that<00:04:57.340> it's<00:04:57.610> going<00:04:57.700> to

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
and if you're worried that it's going to

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.700 
and if you're worried that it's going to
come<00:04:58.000> undone<00:04:58.360> you<00:04:58.630> can<00:04:58.900> put<00:04:59.170> a<00:04:59.200> little<00:04:59.380> bit<00:04:59.590> of

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
come undone you can put a little bit of

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.850 
come undone you can put a little bit of
glue<00:04:59.950> on<00:05:00.220> to<00:05:00.760> your<00:05:00.940> knot<00:05:01.360> and<00:05:01.750> then<00:05:02.350> cut<00:05:02.650> it<00:05:02.680> off

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
glue on to your knot and then cut it off

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.490 
glue on to your knot and then cut it off
just<00:05:03.130> to<00:05:03.280> make<00:05:03.430> sure<00:05:03.460> it's<00:05:03.730> secure<00:05:04.150> so<00:05:04.870> just<00:05:05.410> a

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
just to make sure it's secure so just a

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.920 
just to make sure it's secure so just a
little<00:05:05.770> bit<00:05:05.890> of<00:05:05.980> placement<00:05:06.550> so<00:05:07.540> you're<00:05:07.750> going

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
little bit of placement so you're going

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.200 
little bit of placement so you're going
to<00:05:07.990> start<00:05:08.230> your<00:05:08.320> first<00:05:08.620> section<00:05:09.070> I<00:05:09.340> like<00:05:10.060> to

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
to start your first section I like to

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.840 
to start your first section I like to
start<00:05:10.420> about<00:05:10.690> the<00:05:10.870> low<00:05:11.110> occipital<00:05:11.850> because

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
start about the low occipital because

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.970 
start about the low occipital because
that<00:05:13.090> way<00:05:13.270> it's<00:05:13.720> not<00:05:13.930> going<00:05:14.140> to<00:05:14.200> slip<00:05:14.440> it<00:05:14.710> has<00:05:14.950> a

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
that way it's not going to slip it has a

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.130 
that way it's not going to slip it has a
little<00:05:15.280> something<00:05:15.460> more<00:05:15.880> to<00:05:15.970> grip<00:05:16.180> to<00:05:16.390> so<00:05:17.050> I'm

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
little something more to grip to so I'm

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.330 
little something more to grip to so I'm
going<00:05:17.230> to<00:05:17.290> do<00:05:17.380> it<00:05:17.440> about<00:05:17.500> the<00:05:17.740> low<00:05:17.920> occipital

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
going to do it about the low occipital

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.110 
going to do it about the low occipital
then<00:05:19.210> I<00:05:19.330> do<00:05:19.390> the<00:05:19.600> next<00:05:19.630> row<00:05:20.550> right<00:05:21.550> above<00:05:21.940> it

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
then I do the next row right above it

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.610 
then I do the next row right above it
and<00:05:22.390> then<00:05:23.260> I<00:05:23.320> do

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
and then I do

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.620 
and then I do
maybe<00:05:24.100> another<00:05:24.430> row<00:05:24.640> depending<00:05:25.180> on<00:05:25.300> how<00:05:25.450> much

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
maybe another row depending on how much

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.780 
maybe another row depending on how much
the<00:05:25.840> client<00:05:26.170> needs<00:05:26.290> you<00:05:26.980> might<00:05:27.190> need<00:05:27.340> three<00:05:27.670> to

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
the client needs you might need three to

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.920 
the client needs you might need three to
four<00:05:27.970> rows<00:05:28.270> for<00:05:28.900> this<00:05:29.050> method<00:05:29.470> and<00:05:30.120> then<00:05:31.120> when

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
four rows for this method and then when

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.660 
four rows for this method and then when
you<00:05:32.020> get<00:05:32.200> up<00:05:32.320> by<00:05:32.500> the<00:05:32.560> ear<00:05:32.860> then<00:05:33.370> you're<00:05:33.550> going

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670 
you get up by the ear then you're going

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.690 
you get up by the ear then you're going
to<00:05:33.730> start<00:05:34.000> taking<00:05:34.360> your<00:05:34.480> braids<00:05:35.340> from<00:05:36.340> the

to start taking your braids from the
temporal<00:05:37.150> all<00:05:37.360> the<00:05:37.540> way<00:05:37.660> around<00:05:38.050> but<00:05:38.590> just

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
temporal all the way around but just

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.190 
temporal all the way around but just
remember<00:05:39.310> to<00:05:40.000> leave<00:05:40.180> out<00:05:40.360> a<00:05:40.570> little<00:05:40.870> bit<00:05:41.080> of

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
remember to leave out a little bit of

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.000 
remember to leave out a little bit of
section<00:05:41.590> so<00:05:41.770> you<00:05:41.830> hide<00:05:42.100> the<00:05:42.310> extension<00:05:43.030> or<00:05:44.010> you

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
section so you hide the extension or you

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.800 
section so you hide the extension or you
can<00:05:45.220> do<00:05:45.340> you<00:05:45.700> can<00:05:45.910> do<00:05:46.030> cornrows<00:05:46.450> over<00:05:46.720> the

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
can do you can do cornrows over the

entire head and so the West to each

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:55.920 
entire head and so the West to each
cornrow<00:05:50.140> to<00:05:50.380> create<00:05:50.710> a<00:05:50.950> more<00:05:52.410> more<00:05:53.410> even<00:05:53.740> look
