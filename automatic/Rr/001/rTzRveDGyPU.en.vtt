cheap<00:00:42.200> looks<00:00:43.010> cheap<00:00:43.340> but<00:00:43.940> I<00:00:43.970> find<00:00:44.329> that<00:00:44.420> to<00:00:44.570> be

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
cheap looks cheap but I find that to be

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.410 
cheap looks cheap but I find that to be
quite<00:00:45.020> the<00:00:45.290> contrary<00:00:45.880> it's<00:00:46.880> worth<00:00:47.120> every

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
quite the contrary it's worth every

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.790 
quite the contrary it's worth every
single<00:00:47.570> penny<00:00:47.720> it<00:00:47.960> doesn't<00:00:48.200> feel<00:00:48.350> cheap<00:00:48.380> and

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
single penny it doesn't feel cheap and

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.010 
single penny it doesn't feel cheap and
it<00:00:48.890> sure<00:00:49.100> as<00:00:49.220> hell<00:00:49.370> does<00:00:49.579> not<00:00:49.730> look<00:00:50.090> cheap<00:00:50.120> once

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
it sure as hell does not look cheap once

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.450 
it sure as hell does not look cheap once
you<00:00:51.170> know<00:00:51.290> exactly<00:00:51.380> what<00:00:51.829> it's<00:00:51.980> made<00:00:52.160> out<00:00:52.220> of

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
you know exactly what it's made out of

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.790 
you know exactly what it's made out of
it<00:00:52.640> you<00:00:53.000> know<00:00:53.120> I<00:00:53.360> guess<00:00:53.960> people<00:00:54.260> who<00:00:54.469> say<00:00:54.620> those

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
it you know I guess people who say those

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.709 
it you know I guess people who say those
things<00:00:55.010> are<00:00:55.219> people<00:00:55.550> who<00:00:55.670> don't<00:00:55.790> really<00:00:56.059> they

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
things are people who don't really they

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.389 
things are people who don't really they
just<00:00:56.750> base<00:00:57.110> observations<00:00:57.770> on<00:00:57.920> what<00:00:57.950> they<00:00:58.340> see

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
just base observations on what they see

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.360 
just base observations on what they see
not<00:00:58.730> exactly<00:00:59.120> what<00:00:59.360> they<00:00:59.510> know<00:00:59.780> so<00:01:00.469> it's<00:01:00.800> even

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
not exactly what they know so it's even

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.069

too<00:01:14.659> big<00:01:14.780> of<00:01:14.899> a<00:01:14.929> deal<00:01:15.079> I<00:01:15.109> really<00:01:15.439> wanted<00:01:15.679> it<00:01:15.829> but

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
too big of a deal I really wanted it but

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.889 
too big of a deal I really wanted it but
when<00:01:16.429> I<00:01:16.459> went<00:01:16.670> home<00:01:16.819> and<00:01:17.030> I<00:01:17.090> watched<00:01:17.359> it<00:01:17.569> the

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
when I went home and I watched it the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.319 
when I went home and I watched it the
shape<00:01:18.139> that<00:01:18.170> was<00:01:18.740> right<00:01:18.979> back<00:01:19.189> and<00:01:19.490> this<00:01:20.060> goat

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:20.329 
shape that was right back and this goat

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:22.059 
shape that was right back and this goat
here<00:01:20.569> felt<00:01:20.869> extremely<00:01:21.499> soft<00:01:21.740> to<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:21.950> touch

00:01:22.059 --> 00:01:22.069 
here felt extremely soft to the touch

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:25.300 
here felt extremely soft to the touch
and<00:01:22.490> also<00:01:22.729> to<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.359> face<00:01:23.539> as<00:01:23.689> well<00:01:23.719> too<00:01:24.279> so<00:01:25.279> I

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
and also to the face as well too so I

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.489 
and also to the face as well too so I
wasn't<00:01:25.670> really<00:01:25.909> tripping<00:01:26.479> about<00:01:26.689> that<00:01:26.899> aspect

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:27.499 
wasn't really tripping about that aspect

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:29.410 
wasn't really tripping about that aspect
at<00:01:27.619> all<00:01:27.740> because<00:01:27.889> it's<00:01:28.700> definitely<00:01:29.119> paid<00:01:29.270> off

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
at all because it's definitely paid off

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.609 
at all because it's definitely paid off
consider<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:29.929> I<00:01:29.959> use<00:01:30.139> it<00:01:30.259> probably<00:01:30.529> about

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
consider and I use it probably about

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.859 
consider and I use it probably about
five<00:01:31.310> times<00:01:31.639> a<00:01:31.909> week<00:01:32.029> it's<00:01:32.389> definitely<00:01:32.749> paid

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
five times a week it's definitely paid

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.719 
five times a week it's definitely paid

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
diffused look to the color and it's not

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.699 
diffused look to the color and it's not
just<00:03:38.910> it's<00:03:39.060> not<00:03:39.120> just<00:03:39.209> like<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.510> harsh<00:03:39.930> streak

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
just it's not just like a harsh streak

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.580 
just it's not just like a harsh streak
of<00:03:40.920> orange<00:03:41.610> on<00:03:41.790> your<00:03:42.000> cheek<00:03:42.270> or<00:03:42.420> red<00:03:42.720> it<00:03:43.410> just

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
of orange on your cheek or red it just

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
of orange on your cheek or red it just
gives<00:03:43.770> like<00:03:43.830> this<00:03:44.040> really<00:03:44.370> beautiful

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
gives like this really beautiful

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.850 
gives like this really beautiful
diffused<00:03:45.570> look<00:03:45.780> that<00:03:46.020> doesn't<00:03:46.410> that<00:03:46.620> just

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
diffused look that doesn't that just

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.920 
diffused look that doesn't that just
it's<00:03:47.610> I<00:03:48.030> don't<00:03:48.300> want<00:03:48.540> to<00:03:48.600> say<00:03:48.660> it's<00:03:48.780> natural

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
it's I don't want to say it's natural

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.540 
it's I don't want to say it's natural
because<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.440> blush<00:03:49.590> color<00:03:49.680> itself<00:03:50.220> isn't

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
because the blush color itself isn't

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.680 
because the blush color itself isn't
natural<00:03:50.820> but<00:03:51.270> it<00:03:51.330> just<00:03:51.420> gives<00:03:51.600> a<00:03:51.660> really

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
natural but it just gives a really

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:58.059 
natural but it just gives a really
natural<00:03:52.410> soft<00:03:52.709> look

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.979 

so<00:03:59.069> that<00:03:59.220> right<00:03:59.340> there<00:03:59.400> is<00:03:59.819> Taj<00:04:00.630> Mahal

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
so that right there is Taj Mahal

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.900 
so that right there is Taj Mahal
beautiful<00:04:01.440> shimmering<00:04:01.920> orange<00:04:02.340> color<00:04:02.640> and

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
beautiful shimmering orange color and

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.270 
beautiful shimmering orange color and
now<00:04:03.750> I'm<00:04:03.959> going<00:04:04.140> to<00:04:04.290> use<00:04:04.440> if<00:04:04.680> this<00:04:04.830> is<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.010> matte

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
now I'm going to use if this is a matte

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.770 
now I'm going to use if this is a matte
color<00:04:05.459> Exhibit<00:04:05.940> A<00:04:06.000> is<00:04:06.150> kind<00:04:06.330> of<00:04:06.360> like<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:06.540> really

one I'm still not gonna lie I don't use
it<00:04:11.040> that<00:04:11.160> often<00:04:11.400> because<00:04:11.580> it<00:04:11.790> scares<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.209> hell

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
it that often because it scares the hell

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.860
