00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.919 

computer-assisted<00:00:13.620> surgery<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.900> what<00:00:15.900> I

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
computer-assisted surgery is what I

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.590 
computer-assisted surgery is what I
describe<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.560> patient<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.270> taking<00:00:18.270> your

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
describe to a patient is taking your

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.929 
describe to a patient is taking your
whole<00:00:18.840> limb<00:00:19.170> taking<00:00:20.010> your<00:00:20.220> whole<00:00:20.400> leg<00:00:20.670> and

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
whole limb taking your whole leg and

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.900 
whole limb taking your whole leg and
mapping<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.539> out<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.050> once<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.160> map<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.580> out

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
mapping it out and once you map it out

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.439 
mapping it out and once you map it out
now<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.750> can<00:00:25.470> register<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.670> can<00:00:26.699> create<00:00:27.330> if

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
now you can register you can create if

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.870 
now you can register you can create if
you<00:00:27.599> will<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> 3d<00:00:28.199> model<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:29.130> patient<00:00:29.670> on<00:00:29.820> a

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
you will a 3d model of that patient on a

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.569 
you will a 3d model of that patient on a
computer<00:00:30.750> screen<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.800> knee<00:00:31.980> or<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.460> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
computer screen of the knee or of the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.360 
computer screen of the knee or of the
hip<00:00:32.820> once<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:33.960> 3d<00:00:34.260> model<00:00:34.380> then<00:00:35.340> you

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
hip once you have this 3d model then you

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.299 
hip once you have this 3d model then you
can<00:00:35.730> sit<00:00:35.969> there<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.239> actually<00:00:36.899> visually<00:00:37.829> put

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
can sit there and actually visually put

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.100 
can sit there and actually visually put
those<00:00:38.460> components<00:00:39.120> where<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.600> want<00:00:39.780> them<00:00:39.960> to

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
those components where you want them to

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.920 
those components where you want them to
go<00:00:40.290> before<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.969> ever<00:00:42.149> do<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.480> surgery<00:00:42.870> and

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
go before you ever do the surgery and

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.690 
go before you ever do the surgery and
that's<00:00:43.079> how<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.230> describe<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.739> them<00:00:43.950> once

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
that's how I describe it to them once

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.130 
that's how I describe it to them once
you<00:00:44.910> know<00:00:45.329> where<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.660> want<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.870> put<00:00:46.020> these

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
you know where you want to put these

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.529 
you know where you want to put these
components<00:00:46.920> then<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.239> computer

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
components then you the computer

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.660 
components then you the computer
actually<00:00:48.780> guides<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.469> not<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.160> robotic<00:00:50.550> way

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
actually guides you not in a robotic way

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.979 
actually guides you not in a robotic way
but<00:00:50.820> actually<00:00:51.090> guides<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.600> through<00:00:51.629> those

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
but actually guides you through those

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.290 
but actually guides you through those
motions<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.789> can<00:00:54.000> do<00:00:54.120> that

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
motions and and so you can do that

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.549 
motions and and so you can do that
exactly<00:00:54.780> as<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.050> planned

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
exactly as you planned

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.970 
exactly as you planned
you<00:00:55.860> can<00:00:56.039> also<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:57.410> you<00:00:58.410> also<00:00:58.590> have<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
you can also have you also have the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.069 
you can also have you also have the
ability<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.340> check<00:00:59.789> those<00:01:00.210> cuts<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.750> for<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
ability to check those cuts and for the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.349 
ability to check those cuts and for the
patient<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.469> means<00:01:02.000> precision<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.120> tell

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
patient that means precision you tell

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.149 
patient that means precision you tell
them<00:01:03.480> how<00:01:03.600> accurate<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.350> precise<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:04.979> and

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
them how accurate and precise it is and

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.039 
them how accurate and precise it is and
how<00:01:05.220> reproducible<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.840> think

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
how reproducible it is and I think

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.630 
how reproducible it is and I think
that's<00:01:07.560> what<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.830> patient<00:01:08.159> wants<00:01:08.369> for<00:01:08.520> that

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
that's what the patient wants for that

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.030 
that's what the patient wants for that
longevity<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.619> that

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
longevity in that and that and that

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.460 
longevity in that and that and that
outcome<00:01:11.520> for<00:01:12.060> me<00:01:12.270> computer<00:01:12.780> sister<00:01:13.080> surgery

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
outcome for me computer sister surgery

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.050 
outcome for me computer sister surgery
is<00:01:13.560> really<00:01:13.830> beneficial<00:01:14.220> for<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.580> patient

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
is really beneficial for the patient

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.030 
is really beneficial for the patient
I<00:01:15.119> think<00:01:15.360> it's<00:01:15.509> revolutionized<00:01:16.470> total<00:01:16.920> joy

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
I think it's revolutionized total joy

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.330 
I think it's revolutionized total joy
North<00:01:17.220> plasti<00:01:17.640> really<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:19.049> liked<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.189> before

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
North plasti really I liked it before

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.160 
North plasti really I liked it before
because<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.060> precision<00:01:21.390> everything<00:01:21.930> all

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
because of the precision everything all

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.109 
because of the precision everything all
the<00:01:22.380> information<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.159> get<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.520> surgery<00:01:23.939> so

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
the information that I get in surgery so

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.730 
the information that I get in surgery so
in<00:01:24.540> other<00:01:24.630> words<00:01:24.869> I'm<00:01:25.080> doing<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.409> for<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> total

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
in other words I'm doing it for a total

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.260 
in other words I'm doing it for a total
mean<00:01:26.009> for<00:01:26.159> example<00:01:26.250> if<00:01:26.580> you're<00:01:26.700> doing<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.970> total

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
mean for example if you're doing a total

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.350 
mean for example if you're doing a total
knee<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.799> can<00:01:28.979> basically<00:01:29.220> go<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.119> there

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
knee you you can basically go in there

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.050 
knee you you can basically go in there
in<00:01:30.659> with<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.409> 4.0<00:01:31.920> navigation<00:01:32.579> system<00:01:32.939> you

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
in with the 4.0 navigation system you

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.730 
in with the 4.0 navigation system you
can<00:01:33.180> create<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.450> blueprint<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.110> what<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.590> want

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
can create a blueprint of what you want

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.880 
can create a blueprint of what you want
to<00:01:34.829> do<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.579> go<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.780> can<00:01:37.049> register<00:01:37.500> all

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
to do you go in and you can register all

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.679 
to do you go in and you can register all
the<00:01:37.920> points<00:01:38.220> in<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.340> patient<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:39.180> can<00:01:39.329> create

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
the points in the patient you can create

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.450 
the points in the patient you can create
a<00:01:39.750> plan<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.380> want<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.799> do<00:01:41.100> for<00:01:41.369> this

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
a plan that you want to do for this

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.550 
a plan that you want to do for this
patient<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.119> then<00:01:42.630> execute<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.140> plan<00:01:43.380> to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
patient and then execute that plan to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.620 
patient and then execute that plan to
perfection<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.250> can<00:01:44.490> get<00:01:44.670> an<00:01:44.759> ostrich<00:01:45.119> XO<00:01:45.540> you

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
perfection you can get an ostrich XO you

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.690 
perfection you can get an ostrich XO you
know<00:01:45.840> there's<00:01:46.079> not<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.259> domino<00:01:46.710> effect<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.280> if

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
know there's not a domino effect and if

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.920 
know there's not a domino effect and if
you're<00:01:47.850> off<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> degree<00:01:48.450> or<00:01:48.600> two<00:01:48.750> or<00:01:48.899> three

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
you're off a degree or two or three

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.870 
you're off a degree or two or three
degrees<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.979> affects<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.430> next<00:01:50.700> step

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
degrees that it affects the next step

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.999 
degrees that it affects the next step
you<00:01:51.329> eliminate<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.899> completely<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:52.920> if

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
you eliminate that completely and so if

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.889 
you eliminate that completely and so if
you<00:01:53.100> do<00:01:53.250> those<00:01:53.430> things<00:01:53.700> then<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.509> know<00:01:54.750> what

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
you do those things then you know what

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.090 
you do those things then you know what
you're<00:01:55.020> gonna<00:01:55.140> end<00:01:55.229> up<00:01:55.470> with<00:01:55.590> before<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.950> even

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
you're gonna end up with before you even

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.190 
you're gonna end up with before you even
start<00:01:56.460> cutting<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.000> femur<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.540> end

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
start cutting the femur and the end

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.310 
start cutting the femur and the end
result<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.860> what<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.250> plan<00:01:59.520> and

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
result is what you plan and

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.750 
result is what you plan and
that's<00:02:00.560> been<00:02:00.710> great<00:02:00.950> for<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.250> patient<00:02:01.670> I

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
that's been great for the patient I

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.700 
that's been great for the patient I
think<00:02:02.060> computer<00:02:02.390> sister<00:02:02.630> surgery<00:02:03.020> is<00:02:03.230> great

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
think computer sister surgery is great

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.110 
think computer sister surgery is great
because<00:02:04.010> it<00:02:04.130> still<00:02:04.310> gives<00:02:04.490> a<00:02:04.640> surgeon

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
because it still gives a surgeon

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.670 
because it still gives a surgeon
complete<00:02:05.540> control<00:02:05.840> of<00:02:05.960> what<00:02:06.200> he's<00:02:06.290> doing<00:02:06.530> it's

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
complete control of what he's doing it's

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.950 
complete control of what he's doing it's
a<00:02:06.770> tool<00:02:07.010> it's<00:02:07.040> a<00:02:07.490> new<00:02:07.700> advanced<00:02:08.090> technological

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
a tool it's a new advanced technological

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.200 
a tool it's a new advanced technological
tool<00:02:09.200> that<00:02:09.440> we<00:02:09.560> use<00:02:09.740> in<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:09.979> O<00:02:10.010> R<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.520> so<00:02:11.060> we

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
tool that we use in the O R and so we

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.240 
tool that we use in the O R and so we
still<00:02:11.390> have<00:02:11.570> complete<00:02:11.780> control<00:02:12.080> we<00:02:12.890> know<00:02:13.070> what

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
still have complete control we know what

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.710 
still have complete control we know what
we<00:02:13.340> want<00:02:13.520> to<00:02:13.610> do<00:02:13.730> we<00:02:13.880> have<00:02:13.970> real-time<00:02:14.450> access

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
we want to do we have real-time access

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.750 
we want to do we have real-time access
to<00:02:14.990> information<00:02:15.380> at<00:02:15.830> that<00:02:16.010> time<00:02:16.220> if<00:02:16.400> we<00:02:16.550> want

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
to information at that time if we want

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.100 
to information at that time if we want
to<00:02:16.820> change<00:02:17.090> our<00:02:17.240> plane<00:02:17.510> in<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.750> middle<00:02:18.020> of

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
to change our plane in the middle of

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.320 
to change our plane in the middle of
surgery<00:02:18.350> we<00:02:19.100> have<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.340> absolute<00:02:19.850> ability<00:02:20.030> to

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
surgery we have the absolute ability to

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.240 
surgery we have the absolute ability to
do<00:02:20.450> that<00:02:20.570> kinematically<00:02:21.350> we<00:02:21.500> can<00:02:21.650> see<00:02:21.920> that<00:02:22.100> on

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
do that kinematically we can see that on

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.280 
do that kinematically we can see that on
a<00:02:22.280> computer<00:02:22.760> screen<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.210> we<00:02:23.750> can<00:02:23.780> make<00:02:24.110> those

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
a computer screen and we can make those

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:40.070 
a computer screen and we can make those
adjustments<00:02:24.440> as<00:02:24.950> we<00:02:25.070> need<00:02:25.250> to

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.140
