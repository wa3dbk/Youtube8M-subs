00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:06.009 
here we are at the two quantum and Falls

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.660 
here we are at the two quantum and Falls
Lower<00:00:06.759> Falls<00:00:06.880> State<00:00:07.390> Park<00:00:08.040> at<00:00:09.040> the<00:00:09.190> campground

and they speak sight problem is I don't

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.060 
and they speak sight problem is I don't
think<00:00:13.809> a<00:00:13.870> park<00:00:14.110> we're<00:00:14.290> gonna<00:00:14.530> reach<00:00:14.740> because

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070 
think a park we're gonna reach because

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.540 
think a park we're gonna reach because
here's<00:00:16.380> the<00:00:17.380> power<00:00:17.590> pedestal<00:00:18.099> right<00:00:18.250> there

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
here's the power pedestal right there

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.929 
here's the power pedestal right there
that's<00:00:19.119> quite<00:00:19.330> long<00:00:19.980> that's<00:00:20.980> at<00:00:21.130> least<00:00:21.160> 50

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939 
that's quite long that's at least 50

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.929 
that's quite long that's at least 50
feet<00:00:22.330> from<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:24.490> site<00:00:24.730> so<00:00:25.180> I<00:00:25.210> kind<00:00:25.600> of<00:00:25.660> sucks

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
feet from the site so I kind of sucks

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.009 
feet from the site so I kind of sucks
it's<00:00:27.939> too<00:00:28.060> bad<00:00:28.269> they<00:00:28.420> didn't<00:00:28.660> put<00:00:28.779> it<00:00:28.900> between

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:29.019 
it's too bad they didn't put it between

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.960 
it's too bad they didn't put it between
the<00:00:29.349> sites<00:00:30.300> where<00:00:31.300> this<00:00:31.510> one<00:00:32.080> ain't<00:00:32.260> shows

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
the sites where this one ain't shows

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.189 
the sites where this one ain't shows
because<00:00:33.970> I<00:00:34.120> don't<00:00:34.269> wanted<00:00:34.480> never<00:00:34.989> would<00:00:35.140> have

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:35.199 
because I don't wanted never would have

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.570 
because I don't wanted never would have
had<00:00:35.320> enough<00:00:35.559> to<00:00:36.100> reach<00:00:36.659> so<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:39.010> guess<00:00:39.400> we're

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
had enough to reach so I guess we're

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.869 
had enough to reach so I guess we're
gonna<00:00:39.699> have<00:00:39.879> to<00:00:39.970> get<00:00:40.089> a<00:00:40.150> take<00:00:40.809> an<00:00:40.960> extra<00:00:41.879> 25

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
gonna have to get a take an extra 25

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.640 
gonna have to get a take an extra 25
foot<00:00:43.089> cord<00:00:43.120> with<00:00:43.570> us<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:46.180> for<00:00:46.629> now<00:00:46.750> we're<00:00:47.620> just

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
foot cord with us so for now we're just

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.460 
foot cord with us so for now we're just
have<00:00:48.070> to<00:00:48.190> suffer<00:00:48.400> with<00:00:49.229> not<00:00:50.229> having

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
have to suffer with not having

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.740 
have to suffer with not having
electricity<00:00:50.890> for<00:00:51.489> the<00:00:51.549> night<00:00:51.760> which<00:00:52.210> we<00:00:52.600> can

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
electricity for the night which we can

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.350 
electricity for the night which we can
do<00:00:52.900> because<00:00:53.170> we<00:00:53.320> have<00:00:53.850> propane<00:00:54.850> that<00:00:54.879> we<00:00:55.180> can

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
do because we have propane that we can

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.560 
do because we have propane that we can
run<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:55.720> fridge<00:00:56.170> on<00:00:57.000> lights<00:00:58.000> of<00:00:58.150> course<00:00:58.360> we

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
run the fridge on lights of course we

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.490 
run the fridge on lights of course we
can<00:00:58.750> run<00:00:58.960> on<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.190> batteries<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:02.260> we've

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
can run on the batteries and we've

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.920 
can run on the batteries and we've
certainly<00:01:02.739> done<00:01:02.979> that<00:01:03.040> before<00:01:03.689> and<00:01:04.689> I<00:01:04.750> can

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
certainly done that before and I can

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.170 
certainly done that before and I can
fight<00:01:05.080> generator<00:01:05.530> if<00:01:05.650> I<00:01:05.710> need<00:01:05.860> to<00:01:06.180> recharge

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
fight generator if I need to recharge

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.020 
fight generator if I need to recharge
everything<00:01:07.660> so<00:01:07.990> we<00:01:08.980> for<00:01:09.400> one<00:01:09.610> night<00:01:09.760> at<00:01:09.880> least

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
everything so we for one night at least

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.860 
everything so we for one night at least
we<00:01:10.240> could<00:01:10.390> be<00:01:10.450> certainly<00:01:11.320> self-contained<00:01:12.870> too

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
we could be certainly self-contained too

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.100 
we could be certainly self-contained too
bad<00:01:14.050> the<00:01:14.290> DNR<00:01:14.980> doesn't<00:01:16.380> state<00:01:17.380> things<00:01:17.710> like

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
bad the DNR doesn't state things like

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.870 
bad the DNR doesn't state things like
campsite<00:01:20.110> such-and-such<00:01:20.440> requires

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
campsite such-and-such requires

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.230 
campsite such-and-such requires
75<00:01:22.660> foot<00:01:22.870> long<00:01:23.080> power<00:01:23.440> cables<00:01:23.890> because<00:01:26.220> these

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
75 foot long power cables because these

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.090 
75 foot long power cables because these
campsites<00:01:28.240> basically<00:01:29.020> have<00:01:29.260> quad<00:01:30.570> pedestals

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
campsites basically have quad pedestals

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.940 
campsites basically have quad pedestals
and<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.460> pedestals<00:01:33.970> are<00:01:34.180> set<00:01:34.420> up<00:01:34.950> one

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
and the pedestals are set up one

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.120 
and the pedestals are set up one
pedestal<00:01:36.490> to<00:01:36.580> four<00:01:36.790> campsites

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
pedestal to four campsites

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.610 
pedestal to four campsites
and<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:40.390> us<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.710> pedestals<00:01:42.220> way<00:01:42.520> too<00:01:42.580> far<00:01:43.620> the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
and for us the pedestals way too far the

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.860 
and for us the pedestals way too far the
wrong<00:01:44.800> campsite<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:46.540> most<00:01:47.440> pedestals<00:01:48.040> are<00:01:48.870> set

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
wrong campsite so most pedestals are set

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.100 
wrong campsite so most pedestals are set
up<00:01:50.020> so<00:01:50.380> they<00:01:50.680> are<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:52.690> center<00:01:52.990> between

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
up so they are in the center between

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.100 
up so they are in the center between
four<00:01:53.650> campsites<00:01:54.190> but<00:01:54.790> ours<00:01:55.060> is<00:01:55.240> way<00:01:55.600> over<00:01:55.930> on

of<00:03:46.310> an<00:03:46.459> interesting<00:03:46.790> little<00:03:47.150> pattern<00:03:47.600> there

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
of an interesting little pattern there

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.270

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.770 
on the ground on the base of the tree
now<00:03:52.280> this<00:03:52.459> might<00:03:52.700> be<00:03:52.880> one<00:03:53.060> of<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.300> few<00:03:53.480> places

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
now this might be one of the few places

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.740 
now this might be one of the few places
in<00:03:53.989> the<00:03:54.200> whole<00:03:54.350> country<00:03:54.620> where<00:03:55.480> we<00:03:56.480> don't<00:03:56.630> have
