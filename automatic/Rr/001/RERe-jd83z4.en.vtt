 I did not hear about this dutton his hall 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:19.140

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.949

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.949

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:32.900
 all nishtyak have a wonderful combination 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:36.620
 here it is not necessary to implement somehow 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:39.130
 you can sit down you can try to come up 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.130
 something 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.539
 but I came up with questions better there for 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.519
 Michka wants to go out with us 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.899

 Need to remarkably tusk at all in the very 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.820

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.630
 says we will collect everyone says 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.149
 it will be generally cool 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.560
 Well, that's all pretty much the principle 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:32.110
 not bad it as I tell you did not understand 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.409
 why don't the drums come to me that 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.289

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:43.560
 controls there tusk of course there 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:48.159
 more important is the chicken that it will take there 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.740

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.929

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.060
 principle on the screen like vivir it almost 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:59.709
 never dies rare 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.369
 exceptions at zak injected shit to need 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:02.369

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:20.010

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.520

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.940

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.850
 I say pooj 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.690

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.690
 there is no options 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.830
 but what is it that you did very 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.720
 strange 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.720
 even this one flies everywhere 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.580
 us 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:13.310
 Aha gave 100 on 1 10 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:15.739
 nothing so much like under the blue spheres 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.939
 find out in general that it’s like drugs 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:25.519
 go under them and get bonuses 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:27.560
 additional beauty there for example 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:31.430
 this heroin 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:36.549
 vexa cocaine exort it as anti 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.670
 meth not twix is meth 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:45.730
 exort 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:49.299
 This is this what is normal so compared 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.299
 do you think someone is there 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.050
 you still stand me low 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.790
 usually 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:09.130
 all the creed flew though probably Manushyan 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:13.290
 great minus minus 4 padshi in general 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:18.150
 live fact she is like I told you 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.150
 Pooja pokes game playing 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.970
 So 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:38.259
 yet it is now on the left to cast 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.259
 do you understand 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.910
 that's all 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:54.430
 so with a little more 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:05:00.400
 focused focused here with us 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:02.100
 ghoul walks try again to crank 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.950

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.700

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.850
 built-BCB is very unpleasant if 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:19.120
 Nokero is a very unpleasant man said 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.920
