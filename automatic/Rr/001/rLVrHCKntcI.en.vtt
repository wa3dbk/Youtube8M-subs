00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.110
 The coast is a stage 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:18.990
 Although mackerel us I did not have ties to much local ever 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.590
 The prefecture started construction of the breakwater this year and started to work on various activities by forming an organization 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.130
 Was 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.220
 Report of a reporter 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.220

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:34.440
 We look for wave which typhoon 24 brought on on the 13th early in the morning 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:40.890
 Surfers came in one after another went in the back of Iso 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:46.990
 From surfers in Iso Roh Ura the point where you can enjoy surfing in one of the few sandy beaches in Kansai 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:49.270
 It is said that it is known by the nickname of Yuko and hundreds of thousands of people visit it annually 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:52.330
 Now everyone is not involved 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:56.410
 I think I do not know I did not have one 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:58.490
 In cold strong I feel I have been already obsessed day 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.560
 No passer board rush 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.560
 Hmmm I already work from now 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:12.210
 However, the Ura of tide of March Iso this year instead of a sudden increase 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:17.729
 The accident of the surfers was one after another 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:22.080
 Wakayama Prefecture is on the west side of the coast as a countermeasure for storm surges in the coastal area 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:26.630
 Surfer and sea ​​water temperature customers do extension work of jetty 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.630
 It was sucked in between the easing blocks 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:41.229
 The accident points to the father the tip of the jetty that was extending straight up to that point 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:41.229
 It was because the flow of use changed to the jetty because it was bent in the shape of a tax 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.060
 If everyone gets up on the ambulance, it's quite like that 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.880
 Dark hair power 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.550
 It is to say may not come anymore Isono et al. 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.360
 If you go to me 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:03.010
 Well, I have been practicing here for a long time 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:10.210
 It is such a sea that you will be in trouble if the child is gone 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:15.980
 Prefecture talked in advance about contents of construction to local residents' association or fishery association 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:19.700
 But there was no explanation to surfers all year round come here 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:24.290
 In general people who are coming to sea ​​bathing and servers 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:28.879
 And there is a place where quality that can I quite well-known is up to such a person 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.610
 To like say that an unspecified number It is the organization now if there is a kind of organization 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:37.680
 Say this 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:42.810

 The Yoshi Matsumoto was's representative was not anything told that instructors 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.510
 I think there is a cause for Hager too . 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:12.390
 But if you say a surfer 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.390
 The future is outlawly like three shots 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.060

 If you are a dentist who has just started, you should be fine 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:52.160
 There are times when there is a high rate of trashing, but after all those who have been doing for many years the theme 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:56.270
 Naa I'm doing well 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:02.600
 At the beginning of the network to prevent the accident of the surfer 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:06.440
 And patrolling of the danger zone in cooperation with the prefecture WARNING erected a sign on the beach 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:10.130

 Be able to become 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:23.400
 I was admitted the crime of the local people 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.400
 If a pen is also recognized 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:30.790
 Like that 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.790
 Also say that creating a surfing organization 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:46.919
 Not make the most of the hands of people such as more wave-dissipating blocks on the back of the ISO, which is the target of the network 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:52.250
 About request to want in the whole country by PC communication or mail under Mr. Matsumoto 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:52.250
 More than 30,000 signatures from the surfer 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:05.190
 Mr. Matsumoto visited the Wakayama prefectural government office with members of the network on the 4th of this month so far 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:12.600

 Young people who say they are brown and loose now 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:37.110
 Like this 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:43.409
 You can understand one flow of politics and money society through activities 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:47.550
 Well it seems to the administration that such little young people are small and heavy 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:52.380
 Become thing most grateful if Tsujire
