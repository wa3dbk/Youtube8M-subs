00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.400
 Fischer is sitting opposite me 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.620
 fischer is, so to speak, the bosses' declarer 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.800
 from cosmos he trains traders 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.990
 journalists and knows how to people 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.090
 player explains why you should then 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.110
 I explain people at all 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.890
 mine in every game is one too 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.960
 instruction in it 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.520
 are the registration is fortunately 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.220
 Of course you also need them in there 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.980
 but optimally it is actually and for 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.420
 many also the most beautiful because of the game 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.739
 get to know him if there is someone 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.050
 explains because one of the very big 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.510
 Entry hurdles is the number one example 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.530
 sit down then read the rule ins 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.390
 play come in 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.730
 the easiest way to start a game is 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.559
 one explains me only if 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.600
 This explanation really exciting 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.610
 and grippingly formulated is we explain 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.649
 Now another new game star 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.270
 wars attack the clone warriors like that 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.090
 because works and what mistakes you make 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.190
 should avoid it before explaining it 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.500
 you have to start the game, too 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.449
 times you should build there already 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.080
 The players involved yes that that 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.520
 would be best 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.930
 Of course it depends 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.899
 you have an incredibly complex game 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.369
 faster game of a card game in the 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.240
 Optimal case, I also use the material 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.740
 just to explain something 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.420
 if I play something complex now 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.890
 Of course I should not say so 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.229
 now only an hour open and let 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.479
 I can see everyone there 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.459
 what to prepare as good but explainable 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.410
 then you should really the material 

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:30.890
 use something from the material 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.110
 demonstrate 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.649
 Everything that is really shown remains 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.509
 actually better than you would 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.440
 Of course, the story is best 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.450
 with install 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.849
 you would just say yes before 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.869
 We are now on the planet of the evil 

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:49.310
 Count Dooku has pack and a few 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.170
 Jedi Knight captured 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.819
 the standing in an arena should be inside 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.190
 drive a lot again 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:57.770
 for example it could be that one 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.420
 must fight against ex and that 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.259
 of course the jedi-knights create them 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.270
 free yourself again and the players 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.080
 may now play a role of the jedi 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.860
 Knights take over them 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.000
 fight drones and if possible 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.980
 restrained the whole thing is one 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.560
 Cooperative game means the players 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.739
 game 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.540
 together they have to deny their moves and 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.310
 then you would actually start like that 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.819
 and would say hey until when is that possible 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.190
 actually play with yoga 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.300
 good for the Republican guns 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.190
 has arrived 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.950
 there you can see very beautiful that can completely 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.330
 drive around the outside until the goal so long 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.080
 The fighting cow must keep them at bay 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.120
 being held 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.250
 why is not it so good about that 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.510
 explaining mechanism is very important 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.459
 I have to look at it a bit 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.380
 how do i explain a game so if i have 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.910
 to go to people where I know the 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.440
 They really do play a lot 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.480
 know from the beginning that is the goal 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.010
 how do i get there how is the mechanics 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.319
 then I can do it that way 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.090
 at star wars you would have been nice 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.190
 and explain it relatively quickly 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.239
 That's about using dice 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.140
 I have to try that 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.780
 hinzubekommen 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.459
 but that's great, of course if 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.470
 I want reinziehen someone to play 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.450
 then I'll do that best too 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.549
 the story and, of course, that's how it is 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.390
 Things like star were optimal at that 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.769
 hinzubekommen 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.090
 and you always have to be a bit 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.340
 Think about who the game is then 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.590
 thought and here is star wars already 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.019
 the target group so from eight guys there 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.370
 really go out and there you should open 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.170
 Either way, have the story with you 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.510
 they recognize themselves then falls off them 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.220
 also much easier the gameplay 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.019
 pursue because then yes in the story 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.109
 I am not and do not have to be abstract about that 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.030
 mechanically note so watch how explain 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.290
 me and then either a bit 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.850
 more detailed or a bit faster 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.470
 I usually want to do it then 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.480
 explain or explain before 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.459
 you actually start playing 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.510
 Extremely on the game so that should be 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.209
 have a look in advance 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.040
 there are always games where you can 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.139
 should start as soon as possible 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.579
 So my principle is always I have to 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.109
 cling explain what it is about 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.609
 actually about the story like this 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.010
 bit clear the goal of the game 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.569
 make and then as quickly as possible already 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.069
 the new kind of material in hand 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.359
 give that they do not have what 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.620
 can imagine and in the game 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.319
 find your way in quickly 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.690
 so not only for 20 minutes that 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.430
 explain whole game and all players 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.280
 Already sitting there so that is 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.049
 a lot but start and then maybe 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.609
 later minor things too 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.650
 later in the game is going to be interesting 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.030
 explain but also there it stays that way 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.190
 there are always players who say then 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.600
 I would have known that before too 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.460
 but always say 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.580
 you should get to know a game so 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.160
 the expectation of a game directly at the 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.110
 first attempt to get it perfect only 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.340
 to claim some players have found 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.690
 I always play a bit sad 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.610
 get to know several games 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.050
 play like a good book first 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.490
 come in and then get to know each other 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.020
 usually explained one does not play 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.340
 but just sit there and sit 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.910
 at least looking at the first game 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.890
 at times 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.990
 especially if you do not settle all now 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.880
 explains how many tips should one then 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.830
 just give the game group if you 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.900
 the possibility has in a game 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.430
 should stay in the course of the 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.070
 of course every rule explains 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.780
 be very clear and with the tips 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.640
 possible a bit hold back because 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.230
 especially the learning effect has to play 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.050
 you can clearly say cooperative games 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.520
 very important, the group should yes mistakes 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.080
 she should also make herself up 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.600
 can pull yourself out if now 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.190
 explained worked that was unwise 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.570
 make it different 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.150
 then, of course, a joke of such a 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.280
 play something away you should always watch 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.750
 that no rule mistakes happen so 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.920
 that one really says sony is allowed 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.360
 not now because that's the game 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.790
 on falsify the task of 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.920
 but does not explain too many strategic 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.580
 give tips because that is the group 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.140
 learn 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.820
 you should get the game which tip 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.390
 should call the explainers of star 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:39.870
 It was by no means betrayed 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:43.010
 yes that's a good question of course you 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:52.320
 but should not betray 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:53.580
 that one should not say one is supposed to be yes 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.030
 do not betray that's why I do that 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.580
 neither 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.440
 So here it is with star wars really 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.210
 so we also quite cleverly in the 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.440
 rule for the rule Lisa already a few 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.050
 have installed tips 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.870
 and this can be done by then 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.240
 So, jutta reads that of course 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.730
 For example, he says cool tips 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.600
 you should completely vacate your area 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:16.980
 in his usual language and that's exactly what 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.750
 you should do that too 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.430
 And that's exactly what the tips are 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.740
 where they say maybe they should 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.330
 players prefer to come on it themselves and 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.420
 not so with the nose on it 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.420
 become
