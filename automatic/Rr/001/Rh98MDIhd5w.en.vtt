00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:45.749 
them a bit too fanatical and really

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:49.189 
them a bit too fanatical and really
generally<00:00:46.289> offensive<00:00:46.859> to<00:00:47.100> everyone<00:00:47.519> else<00:00:48.210> so

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
generally offensive to everyone else so

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:50.869 
generally offensive to everyone else so
it's<00:00:50.100> interesting<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.609> they've<00:00:50.850> been

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
it's interesting that they've been

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.209 
it's interesting that they've been
trying<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.989> make<00:00:52.109> more<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.440> more<00:00:52.559> games<00:00:52.859> I

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
trying to make more and more games I

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.560 
trying to make more and more games I
think<00:00:53.429> that<00:00:53.579> it's<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.890> improve<00:00:55.999> the<00:00:56.999> view<00:00:57.510> that

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
think that it's to improve the view that

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.180 
think that it's to improve the view that
the<00:00:57.780> public<00:00:58.079> has<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.559> them<00:00:58.739> although<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.039> don't

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
the public has on them although I don't

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.549 
the public has on them although I don't
think<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.579> it's<00:00:59.730> necessarily<00:01:00.210> helping<00:01:00.719> but

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
think that it's necessarily helping but

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.919 
think that it's necessarily helping but
more<00:01:02.339> and<00:01:02.399> more<00:01:02.550> people<00:01:02.789> are<00:01:03.149> visiting<00:01:03.539> their

more and more people are visiting their
website<00:01:03.960> because<00:01:04.559> they<00:01:05.159> want<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.400> play<00:01:05.519> these

is really nicely done the graphics are
great<00:02:16.739> but<00:02:17.040> just<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.400> way<00:02:17.579> that<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:17.819> plays<00:02:18.150> its

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
great but just the way that it plays its

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.110 
great but just the way that it plays its
kind<00:02:18.629> of

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
kind of

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.180 
kind of
roaring<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:19.569> gets<00:02:19.750> kind<00:02:19.959> of<00:02:19.989> monotonous<00:02:20.230> so

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
roaring it gets kind of monotonous so

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.190 
roaring it gets kind of monotonous so
you<00:02:21.670> know<00:02:21.790> with<00:02:22.120> with<00:02:22.540> them<00:02:22.720> coming<00:02:22.989> out<00:02:23.049> with

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.860 
more and more hopefully they'll end up
taking<00:02:24.700> that<00:02:24.790> critique<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.390> we<00:02:25.510> can<00:02:25.659> have

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
taking that critique and we can have

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.740 
taking that critique and we can have
better<00:02:26.049> games<00:02:26.379> who<00:02:26.739> knows<00:02:26.980> but<00:02:27.879> yeah<00:02:28.480> so

start<00:02:36.640> with<00:02:36.909> because<00:02:37.209> perhaps<00:02:37.810> they<00:02:38.079> tweak

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
start with because perhaps they tweak

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.569 
start with because perhaps they tweak
some<00:02:38.650> things<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:39.040> made<00:02:39.159> it<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.310> little<00:02:39.430> bit

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579
