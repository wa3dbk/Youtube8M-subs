 materials aluminum chassis it without 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.389
 disturbing elements of wood side panels and 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.580
 a surface around a laptop or a 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.380
 another keyboard on the vpc 1 too 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.720
 and of course there is one 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.639
 music stand the vpc 1 is so far

 controller specifically for virtual 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.460
 software camos has been developed and is 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:24.410
 thus predestined for recording studios and
