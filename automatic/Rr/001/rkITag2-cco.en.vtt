this<00:00:14.969> has<00:00:15.089> kind<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.299> been<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.480> last<00:00:15.690> couple<00:00:15.960> of

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
this has kind of been the last couple of

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.150 
this has kind of been the last couple of
days<00:00:16.170> we've<00:00:16.410> been<00:00:16.500> getting<00:00:16.740> ready<00:00:16.890> for<00:00:17.010> this

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
days we've been getting ready for this

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.189 
days we've been getting ready for this
demo<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:18.270> can<00:00:18.300> see<00:00:18.510> it's<00:00:18.660> it's<00:00:18.869> kind<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.109> a

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
demo you can see it's it's kind of a

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.609 
demo you can see it's it's kind of a
mess<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.619> think<00:00:20.510> if<00:00:21.510> your<00:00:21.960> table<00:00:22.350> looks<00:00:22.529> like

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
mess I think if your table looks like

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.900 
mess I think if your table looks like
this<00:00:22.740> then<00:00:23.160> this<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.279> probably<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.699> toy<00:00:23.850> you

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
this then this is probably a toy you

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.209 
this then this is probably a toy you
want<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.180> play<00:00:24.330> with<00:00:28.730> the<00:00:29.730> life<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.119> hacker

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
want to play with the life of a hacker

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:33.830 
want to play with the life of a hacker
so<00:00:32.219> at<00:00:32.309> MIT<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.669> started<00:00:33.120> getting<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.329> robotics

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
so at MIT I started getting to robotics

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.180 
so at MIT I started getting to robotics
and<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.079> had<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.380> weird<00:00:34.739> fortune<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.130> coming

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
and I had the weird fortune of coming

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.180 
and I had the weird fortune of coming
into<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.670> lab<00:00:36.110> where<00:00:37.110> they<00:00:37.800> had<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:37.980> odd

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
into this lab where they had this odd

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.889 
into this lab where they had this odd
philosophy<00:00:38.820> about<00:00:38.940> how<00:00:39.239> robots<00:00:39.420> should<00:00:39.750> move

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
philosophy about how robots should move

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.590 
philosophy about how robots should move
you're<00:00:40.350> used<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.620> robots<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.460> move<00:00:41.730> really

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
you're used to robots that move really

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.850 
you're used to robots that move really
stiff<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.530> know

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
stiff you know

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.250 
stiff you know
c-3po<00:00:44.309> starting<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.910> 70s<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.750> then<00:00:46.140> you

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
c-3po starting in the 70s and then you

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.930 
c-3po starting in the 70s and then you
move<00:00:46.410> on<00:00:46.559> even<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.980> Asamoah<00:00:47.399> right<00:00:47.579> now<00:00:47.700> if<00:00:47.850> you

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
move on even to Asamoah right now if you

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.490 
move on even to Asamoah right now if you
ever<00:00:48.059> seen<00:00:48.239> Honda's<00:00:48.780> Asamoah<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> five

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
ever seen Honda's Asamoah is a five

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.200 
ever seen Honda's Asamoah is a five
hundred<00:00:49.620> thousand<00:00:50.070> dollar<00:00:50.100> robot<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.969> can<00:00:51.000> do

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
hundred thousand dollar robot you can do

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.189 
hundred thousand dollar robot you can do
anything<00:00:51.420> but<00:00:51.750> when<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:51.960> walks<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.350> walks<00:00:52.530> like

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
anything but when it walks it walks like

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:55.880 
anything but when it walks it walks like
really<00:00:55.199> low<00:00:55.350> CG

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
really low CG

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.650 
really low CG
really<00:00:56.190> big<00:00:56.340> feet<00:00:56.579> just<00:00:56.789> kind<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.000> close<00:00:57.390> lying

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
really big feet just kind of close lying

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.139 
really big feet just kind of close lying
flat<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.280> you<00:00:59.280> know<00:00:59.370> my<00:00:59.489> research<00:00:59.789> advisors

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
flat and you know my research advisors

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.020 
flat and you know my research advisors
said<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.899> won't<00:01:01.079> do<00:01:01.260> what<00:01:02.100> can<00:01:02.250> we<00:01:02.370> do<00:01:02.520> to

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
said that won't do what can we do to

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.359 
said that won't do what can we do to
make<00:01:03.149> robots<00:01:03.359> move<00:01:03.719> more<00:01:03.989> agile<00:01:04.500> more<00:01:04.739> fluidly

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
make robots move more agile more fluidly

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.090 
make robots move more agile more fluidly
with<00:01:05.640> more<00:01:06.080> you<00:01:07.080> know<00:01:07.200> grace<00:01:07.530> really<00:01:07.830> more

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
with more you know grace really more

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.800 
with more you know grace really more
like<00:01:08.220> animals<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.820> return<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.570> machine

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
like animals and return to machine

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.450 
like animals and return to machine
learning<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.350> turns<00:01:10.530> out<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.220> same

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
learning and it turns out that the same

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.910 
learning and it turns out that the same
tools<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:12.210> machine<00:01:12.510> learning<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:12.920> are

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
tools in machine learning that are

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.590 
tools in machine learning that are
really<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> solution<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.000> making<00:01:15.180> robots

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
really the solution to making robots

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.420 
really the solution to making robots
move<00:01:15.900> more<00:01:16.140> like<00:01:16.290> animals<00:01:16.680> it's<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.189> same

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
move more like animals it's the same

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.649 
move more like animals it's the same
tools<00:01:17.670> they<00:01:17.790> used<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.060> do<00:01:18.180> statistical

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
tools they used to do statistical

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.420 
tools they used to do statistical
analysis<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:19.350> things<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:19.799> machine<00:01:20.009> vision

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
analysis for things like machine vision

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.990 
analysis for things like machine vision

speech to text text to speech spam

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.760 
speech to text text to speech spam
filtering<00:01:24.509> it's<00:01:24.780> all<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.020> same<00:01:25.229> algorithms

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
filtering it's all the same algorithms

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.950 
filtering it's all the same algorithms
and<00:01:26.030> you<00:01:27.030> know<00:01:27.090> we're<00:01:27.390> only<00:01:27.600> now<00:01:27.930> just

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
and you know we're only now just

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.200 
and you know we're only now just
discovering<00:01:28.590> what<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.890> power<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:30.030> new

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
discovering what the power of this new

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.310 
discovering what the power of this new
field<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.509> computer<00:01:30.810> science<00:01:30.840> could<00:01:31.200> really

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
field of computer science could really

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.710 
field of computer science could really
do<00:01:31.470> for<00:01:31.650> us<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.850> studying<00:01:33.090> robotics<00:01:33.240> one<00:01:33.630> of

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
do for us so in studying robotics one of

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.999 
do for us so in studying robotics one of
the<00:01:33.780> worst<00:01:33.990> things<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.380> happens<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.920> you

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
the worst things that happens is you

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.590 
the worst things that happens is you
have<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.220> build<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.640> robot<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.210> know<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.390> can

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
have to build a robot you know you can

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.480 
have to build a robot you know you can
only<00:01:36.630> do<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:36.960> much<00:01:37.049> math<00:01:37.259> on<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.560> board<00:01:37.799> until

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
only do so much math on the board until

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.760 
only do so much math on the board until
it<00:01:38.579> comes<00:01:38.729> time<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.030> actually<00:01:39.840> make<00:01:40.439> something

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
it comes time to actually make something

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.399 
it comes time to actually make something
like<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.040> like<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.369> plane<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.200> when<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.259> make

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
like this like a plane and when you make

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.499 
like this like a plane and when you make
your<00:01:43.439> prototypes<00:01:43.979> for<00:01:44.700> your<00:01:44.909> algorithms<00:01:45.299> you

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
your prototypes for your algorithms you

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.240 
your prototypes for your algorithms you
end<00:01:45.659> up<00:01:45.750> using<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.170> computer<00:01:46.619> just<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.920> regular

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
end up using a computer just a regular

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.670 
end up using a computer just a regular
desktop<00:01:47.430> machine<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.990> nice<00:01:49.200> thing<00:01:49.590> to

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
desktop machine and so the nice thing to

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.109 
desktop machine and so the nice thing to
do<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.189> try<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.490> put<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> desktop<00:01:51.090> machine

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
do is to try and put a desktop machine

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.859

on<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.930> robot<00:01:52.470> like<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:53.030> plane<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.780> can

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
on a robot like this plane and you can

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:55.789 
on a robot like this plane and you can
see<00:01:54.960> there's<00:01:55.110> not<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.229> whole<00:01:55.350> lot<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.500> space<00:01:55.740> for

see there's not a whole lot of space for

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.090 
see there's not a whole lot of space for
a<00:01:56.009> desktop<00:01:56.340> machine<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.079> and<00:01:58.079> if<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.799> look<00:01:59.009> at

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
a desktop machine and and if you look at

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.289 
a desktop machine and and if you look at
the<00:01:59.219> robots<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.520> are<00:01:59.640> out<00:01:59.759> there<00:01:59.790> they<00:02:00.180> kind

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
the robots that are out there they kind

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.630 
the robots that are out there they kind
of<00:02:00.420> reflect<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:01.110> clunkiness<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.369> fact<00:02:02.549> that

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
of reflect that clunkiness the fact that

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.980 
of reflect that clunkiness the fact that
they<00:02:02.700> had<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.880> put<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.030> big<00:02:03.299> hunk<00:02:03.869> of

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
they had to put a big hunk of

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.139 
they had to put a big hunk of

they<00:02:09.569> were<00:02:09.629> too<00:02:09.840> lazy<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.319> really<00:02:10.730> does

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
they were too lazy to really does

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.060 
they were too lazy to really does
their<00:02:12.150> own<00:02:12.300> embedded<00:02:12.870> systems<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.770> so<00:02:13.950> what

their own embedded systems and so what

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.590 
their own embedded systems and so what
we<00:02:14.160> wanted<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.430> do<00:02:14.640> was<00:02:14.910> make<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.150> hardware

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
we wanted to do was make a hardware

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.570 
we wanted to do was make a hardware
suite<00:02:15.840> where<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.740> didn't<00:02:17.070> have<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.400> put<00:02:17.550> a

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
suite where you didn't have to put a

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
computer on your robot you just put

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.110 
computer on your robot you just put
exactly<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:20.040> electronics<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:20.910> needed

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
exactly the electronics that you needed

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.730 
exactly the electronics that you needed
no<00:02:21.840> more<00:02:21.990> no<00:02:22.260> less

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
no more no less

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
and going straight and it's because the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.020 
and going straight and it's because the
math<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.260> easy<00:02:28.410> but<00:02:29.130> what<00:02:29.250> we<00:02:29.340> want<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:29.580> do<00:02:29.700> is

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
math is easy but what we want to do is

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.730 
math is easy but what we want to do is
really<00:02:30.540> push<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.930> limits<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.380> what<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.650> can

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
really push the limits of what you can

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.800 
really push the limits of what you can
make<00:02:31.950> an<00:02:32.040> autopilot<00:02:32.340> do<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:33.540> nice<00:02:33.660> thing

about<00:02:33.870> these<00:02:34.050> boards<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:34.710> they're

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
about these boards is they're

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.040

interface<00:03:23.040> on<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:23.490> should<00:03:23.550> just<00:03:23.670> be<00:03:23.880> able

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
interface on it you should just be able

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.480 
interface on it you should just be able
to<00:03:24.060> plop<00:03:24.300> it<00:03:24.450> in<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:25.530> know<00:03:25.680> nice<00:03:26.070> easy-to-use

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
to plop it in you know nice easy-to-use

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.640 
to plop it in you know nice easy-to-use
tool<00:03:26.760> chain<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.000> prototype<00:03:27.750> it<00:03:27.900> not<00:03:28.320> even

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
tool chain and prototype it not even

step<00:03:29.130> back<00:03:29.340> yeah<00:03:29.990> we<00:03:30.990> said<00:03:31.200> it<00:03:31.320> we<00:03:31.530> set<00:03:31.770> it<00:03:31.890> up

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
step back yeah we said it we set it up

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:56.710 
step back yeah we said it we set it up
here<00:03:32.270> because

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720

is there any battery left in this thing
11<00:04:16.890> volts<00:04:17.130> serious<00:04:17.489> there<00:04:18.060> 7<00:04:18.360> your<00:04:18.480> room<00:04:19.010> so

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
11 volts serious there 7 your room so

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.710 
11 volts serious there 7 your room so
we're<00:04:20.370> going<00:04:20.520> across<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.180> street<00:04:21.480> to<00:04:21.630> the

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
we're going across the street to the

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.810 
we're going across the street to the
park<00:04:21.750> it's<00:04:22.590> a<00:04:22.710> baseball<00:04:22.920> field<00:04:23.280> hopefully

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
park it's a baseball field hopefully

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.140 
park it's a baseball field hopefully
there's<00:04:24.000> not<00:04:24.150> too<00:04:24.720> many<00:04:24.840> little<00:04:25.140> kids<00:04:25.520> hit<00:04:26.520> I'm

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
there's not too many little kids hit I'm

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.580 
there's not too many little kids hit I'm
fairly<00:04:27.450> confident<00:04:27.870> that<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.080> computer<00:04:28.440> can

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
fairly confident that the computer can

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.350 
fairly confident that the computer can
fly<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:28.800> plane<00:04:28.890> better<00:04:29.340> than<00:04:29.550> that<00:04:30.060> anyone<00:04:30.330> I

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
fly the plane better than that anyone I

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:42.520 
fly the plane better than that anyone I
didn't<00:04:30.600> released

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.500 

whoa<00:04:43.950> hell<00:04:44.490> yeah<00:04:44.700> it's<00:04:44.880> not<00:04:45.000> sure<00:04:45.300> your

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
whoa hell yeah it's not sure your

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.990 
whoa hell yeah it's not sure your
Cratchit<00:04:46.110> you're<00:04:46.290> gonna<00:04:46.410> crash<00:04:46.830> oh<00:04:47.160> he<00:04:47.880> knows

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
Cratchit you're gonna crash oh he knows

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.770 
Cratchit you're gonna crash oh he knows
oh<00:04:48.060> he's<00:04:48.210> going<00:04:48.510> over<00:04:48.690> the<00:04:48.810> tree<00:04:50.510> this<00:04:51.510> is<00:04:51.570> why

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
oh he's going over the tree this is why

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.910 
oh he's going over the tree this is why
you<00:04:51.840> don't<00:04:51.960> want<00:04:52.050> to<00:04:52.200> put<00:04:52.290> $1,000<00:04:52.800> worth<00:04:52.860> of

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
you don't want to put $1,000 worth of

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.230 
you don't want to put $1,000 worth of
electronics<00:04:53.280> on<00:04:53.580> this<00:04:53.790> thing<00:04:55.160> the

our<00:05:03.570> board<00:05:03.840> to<00:05:04.080> do<00:05:04.230> on<00:05:04.380> this<00:05:04.470> airplane<00:05:04.950> will<00:05:05.490> be

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
our board to do on this airplane will be

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.820 
our board to do on this airplane will be
able<00:05:05.760> to<00:05:05.970> stabilize<00:05:06.480> the<00:05:06.930> airplane<00:05:07.320> and<00:05:07.560> make

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
able to stabilize the airplane and make

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.860 
able to stabilize the airplane and make
it<00:05:07.980> easier<00:05:08.280> for<00:05:08.550> you<00:05:08.640> to<00:05:08.730> fly<00:05:08.940> so<00:05:09.570> we<00:05:09.690> have<00:05:09.840> a

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
it easier for you to fly so we have a

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.170 
it easier for you to fly so we have a
switch<00:05:10.590> back<00:05:10.890> and<00:05:10.920> forth<00:05:11.130> where<00:05:11.550> you<00:05:11.730> can<00:05:11.880> you

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
switch back and forth where you can you

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.150 
switch back and forth where you can you
can<00:05:12.330> you<00:05:12.600> can<00:05:12.630> switch<00:05:13.050> to<00:05:13.080> the<00:05:13.380> computer

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
can you can switch to the computer

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.970 
can you can switch to the computer
control<00:05:14.520> or<00:05:15.060> you<00:05:15.270> can<00:05:15.420> control<00:05:15.750> yourself<00:05:15.980> yeah

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
control or you can control yourself yeah

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:17.960 
control or you can control yourself yeah
when<00:05:17.100> you<00:05:17.160> have<00:05:17.190> limited<00:05:17.370> resources<00:05:17.910> you

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
when you have limited resources you

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.270 
when you have limited resources you
really<00:05:18.180> learn<00:05:18.300> how<00:05:18.330> to<00:05:18.480> put<00:05:18.630> things<00:05:18.750> together

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
really learn how to put things together

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.120 
really learn how to put things together
that's<00:05:20.280> really<00:05:20.520> what<00:05:20.640> makes<00:05:20.760> a<00:05:20.850> good<00:05:20.940> hacker
