00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.449 
sorry anyways swapping with four fingers
actually<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.259> made<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.680> four<00:02:08.129> fingers

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
actually I made it to four fingers

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.089 
actually I made it to four fingers
because<00:02:08.970> people<00:02:09.959> have<00:02:10.170> been<00:02:10.349> complaining<00:02:10.530> or

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
because people have been complaining or

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.280 
because people have been complaining or
I<00:02:11.340> saw<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.270> common<00:02:12.599> saying

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
I saw in the common saying

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.720 
I saw in the common saying
how<00:02:13.560> they<00:02:13.799> can't<00:02:14.040> scroll<00:02:14.430> through<00:02:14.670> your

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
how they can't scroll through your

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.149 
how they can't scroll through your
history<00:02:15.390> with<00:02:15.689> your<00:02:16.200> three<00:02:16.409> fingers<00:02:16.620> at<00:02:16.920> you

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
history with your three fingers at you

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.880 
history with your three fingers at you
we<00:02:17.459> were<00:02:17.579> all<00:02:17.819> used<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.299> in<00:02:18.359> Snow<00:02:18.569> Leopard

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
we were all used to in Snow Leopard

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.369 
we were all used to in Snow Leopard
that's<00:02:19.890> all<00:02:20.459> changed<00:02:21.150> because<00:02:21.540> if<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.290> go

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
that's all changed because if you go

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.530 
that's all changed because if you go
into<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.620> system<00:02:22.950> preferences<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.609> go<00:02:24.390> into

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
into the system preferences and go into

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.809 
into the system preferences and go into
track<00:02:24.810> crab<00:02:25.019> it's<00:02:25.260> same<00:02:25.560> exact<00:02:25.890> thing<00:02:26.099> as<00:02:26.129> this

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
track crab it's same exact thing as this

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.089 
track crab it's same exact thing as this
swipe<00:02:27.120> between<00:02:27.269> pages<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:28.079> just<00:02:28.650> change<00:02:28.950> it

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
swipe between pages I just change it

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.270 
swipe between pages I just change it
from<00:02:29.359> two<00:02:30.359> fingers<00:02:30.659> to<00:02:30.689> three<00:02:30.959> fingers<00:02:31.290> not<00:02:32.250> a

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
from two fingers to three fingers not a

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.619 
from two fingers to three fingers not a
huge<00:02:32.609> difference<00:02:32.879> I<00:02:33.120> know<00:02:33.180> if<00:02:33.359> you're<00:02:33.540> just

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
huge difference I know if you're just

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.059 
huge difference I know if you're just
used<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:33.959> that<00:02:34.140> it<00:02:34.379> should<00:02:34.530> change<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:34.859> back

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
used to that it should change it back

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.970 
used to that it should change it back
and<00:02:35.840> because<00:02:36.840> initially<00:02:37.109> when<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:37.709> first

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
and because initially when you first

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.979 
and because initially when you first
install<00:02:38.129> it<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.489> swiping<00:02:39.120> between<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.810> full

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
install it it swiping between the full

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.960 
install it it swiping between the full
screen<00:02:40.170> apps<00:02:40.379> was<00:02:40.590> four<00:02:41.010> fingers<00:02:41.430> I'm<00:02:41.639> three

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
screen apps was four fingers I'm three

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.330 
screen apps was four fingers I'm three
fingers<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.590> just<00:02:43.590> changed<00:02:43.799> that<00:02:43.950> before

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
fingers and I just changed that before

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.539 
fingers and I just changed that before
so<00:02:44.639> if<00:02:45.359> I<00:02:45.689> adapted<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:46.739> really<00:02:47.159> easily

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
so if I adapted to that really easily

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.619 
so if I adapted to that really easily
and<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:48.810> was<00:02:48.959> annoying<00:02:49.230> when<00:02:49.470> i<00:02:49.500> first<00:02:50.599> set<00:02:51.599> it

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
and it was annoying when i first set it

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.599 
and it was annoying when i first set it
up<00:02:51.810> because<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.889> know<00:02:52.980> three-finger<00:02:53.489> swipe

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
up because you know three-finger swipe

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.520 
up because you know three-finger swipe
was<00:02:53.939> going<00:02:54.269> back<00:02:54.419> and<00:02:54.629> forth<00:02:54.989> i<00:02:55.169> was<00:02:55.319> really

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
was going back and forth i was really

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.379 
was going back and forth i was really
used<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.829> that<00:02:55.919> and<00:02:56.189> I<00:02:56.250> would<00:02:56.370> keep<00:02:56.609> going<00:02:56.939> back

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:57.389 
used to that and I would keep going back

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.659 
used to that and I would keep going back
and<00:02:57.450> forth<00:02:57.840> through<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.019> page<00:02:58.400> spaces<00:02:59.400> so

00:02:59.659 --> 00:02:59.669 
and forth through the page spaces so

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:03.319 
and forth through the page spaces so
yeah<00:03:00.629> that<00:03:01.049> was<00:03:01.169> pretty<00:03:01.290> annoying<00:03:02.000> anyways<00:03:03.000> um

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
yeah that was pretty annoying anyways um

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.399 
yeah that was pretty annoying anyways um

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
down but scrolling with your trackpad is

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.970 
down but scrolling with your trackpad is
the<00:03:14.489> best<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:15.359> how<00:03:15.689> it<00:03:15.900> just<00:03:16.230> fades<00:03:16.409> away<00:03:16.500> it's
