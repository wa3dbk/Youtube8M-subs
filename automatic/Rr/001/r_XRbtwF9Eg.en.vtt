00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
have to agree with that marketing

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.069 
have to agree with that marketing
because<00:00:25.189> it<00:00:25.519> really<00:00:25.759> is<00:00:25.910> this<00:00:26.720> is<00:00:26.839> the<00:00:26.929> only

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:27.079 
because it really is this is the only

its own email address which is really

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.420 
its own email address which is really
cool<00:00:32.960> I<00:00:33.230> set<00:00:33.530> this<00:00:33.650> up<00:00:33.710> and<00:00:35.770> it<00:00:36.770> took<00:00:36.950> about<00:00:37.160> 20

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
cool I set this up and it took about 20

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.250 
cool I set this up and it took about 20
seconds<00:00:37.820> to<00:00:37.940> email<00:00:38.180> a<00:00:38.210> photo<00:00:38.480> directly<00:00:38.810> to<00:00:39.140> the

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
seconds to email a photo directly to the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.110 
seconds to email a photo directly to the

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
of an idea of what the web frame is

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.110 
of an idea of what the web frame is
capable<00:00:46.910> of<00:00:48.880> anyways

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
were probably aware of that it'll come

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:06.429 
were probably aware of that it'll come
with<00:01:05.210> an<00:01:05.360> adapter<00:01:05.780> or<00:01:05.810> something<00:01:06.110> like<00:01:06.229> this

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
with an adapter or something like this

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.419

actually and also I was amazed at how
quickly<00:01:34.759> this<00:01:35.060> thing<00:01:35.299> got<00:01:35.450> set<00:01:35.749> up<00:01:35.869> it

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
quickly this thing got set up it

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.080 
quickly this thing got set up it
literally<00:01:36.829> took<00:01:37.100> less<00:01:37.340> time<00:01:37.369> to<00:01:37.579> set<00:01:37.850> up<00:01:37.880> than

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
literally took less time to set up than

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.090 
literally took less time to set up than
a<00:01:38.149> Windows<00:01:38.420> computer<00:01:38.569> on<00:01:39.020> a<00:01:39.049> network<00:01:39.139> believe

control it'll be a little tab in there I

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.620 
control it'll be a little tab in there I
should<00:01:49.280> have<00:01:49.369> known<00:01:49.549> better<00:01:49.579> but<00:01:50.060> anyways

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
should have known better but anyways

there'll be a little tab in there of

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.590 
there'll be a little tab in there of
