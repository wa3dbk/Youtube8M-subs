00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
will you over new I think there isn't

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.100 
will you over new I think there isn't
much<00:04:40.800> money<00:04:41.130> in<00:04:41.310> it<00:04:41.400> either<00:04:41.720> but<00:04:42.720> if<00:04:42.840> we<00:04:42.930> can

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
much money in it either but if we can

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.560 
much money in it either but if we can
find<00:04:43.349> the<00:04:43.560> funds<00:04:43.860> and<00:04:44.160> work<00:04:44.340> on<00:04:44.550> it<00:04:44.699> then<00:04:45.479> I

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
find the funds and work on it then I

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.420 
find the funds and work on it then I
think<00:04:45.810> football<00:04:46.050> can<00:04:46.440> really<00:04:46.710> develop<00:04:46.919> here

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
think football can really develop here

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.969 
think football can really develop here
in<00:04:47.580> a<00:04:47.639> positive<00:04:47.849> fashion<00:04:48.380> in<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:49.500> next<00:04:49.740> five

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
in a positive fashion in the next five

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.169 
in a positive fashion in the next five
to<00:04:50.250> ten<00:04:50.490> years<00:04:50.900> do<00:04:51.900> one<00:04:52.139> thing
