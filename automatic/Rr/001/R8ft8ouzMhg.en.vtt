benefit services oconee me code is from
an<00:00:22.420> environmental<00:00:22.630> perspective<00:00:23.050> and<00:00:23.650> this

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.520 
an environmental perspective and this

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.120 
an environmental perspective and this
gives<00:00:24.670> us<00:00:25.180> a<00:00:25.270> great<00:00:25.390> opportunity<00:00:25.480> to<00:00:26.110> go<00:00:26.890> along

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
gives us a great opportunity to go along

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.230 
gives us a great opportunity to go along
with<00:00:27.279> the<00:00:27.369> image<00:00:27.580> of<00:00:27.670> the<00:00:27.730> NSX

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
with the image of the NSX

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.120 
with the image of the NSX
environmentally<00:00:28.930> friendly<00:00:29.350> and<00:00:29.859> we'll<00:00:30.039> get

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
environmentally friendly and we'll get

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.410 
environmentally friendly and we'll get
chance<00:00:30.369> to<00:00:30.490> learn<00:00:30.730> about<00:00:30.789> this<00:00:31.180> and<00:00:31.330> then

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
chance to learn about this and then

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.660 
chance to learn about this and then
maybe<00:00:31.630> use<00:00:32.169> it<00:00:32.320> in<00:00:32.439> our<00:00:32.590> manufacturing<00:00:33.370> months

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
maybe use it in our manufacturing months

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.250 
maybe use it in our manufacturing months
later<00:00:33.850> as<00:00:34.030> well<00:00:34.210> is<00:00:34.449> that<00:00:34.899> one<00:00:35.079> of<00:00:35.109> the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
later as well is that one of the

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.529 
later as well is that one of the
benefits<00:00:35.859> of<00:00:35.979> the<00:00:36.129> NSX<00:00:36.609> you<00:00:36.789> can<00:00:37.030> sort<00:00:37.329> of<00:00:37.420> play

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:37.539 
benefits of the NSX you can sort of play

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:39.930 
benefits of the NSX you can sort of play
around<00:00:37.780> with<00:00:38.289> new<00:00:38.440> technologies<00:00:39.190> I<00:00:39.519> wouldn't

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
around with new technologies I wouldn't

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.059 
around with new technologies I wouldn't
necessarily<00:00:40.059> say<00:00:40.449> play<00:00:40.629> around<00:00:40.929> it's<00:00:41.769> it's

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:42.069 
necessarily say play around it's it's

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:43.379 
necessarily say play around it's it's
actually<00:00:42.429> a<00:00:42.460> great<00:00:42.550> opportunity<00:00:42.850> for<00:00:43.179> us

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:43.389 
actually a great opportunity for us

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:45.090 
actually a great opportunity for us
though<00:00:43.690> I<00:00:43.719> mean<00:00:43.899> there<00:00:44.050> are<00:00:44.199> as<00:00:44.710> I<00:00:44.800> mentioned

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
though I mean there are as I mentioned

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.289 
though I mean there are as I mentioned
the<00:00:45.159> speech<00:00:45.399> there's<00:00:45.639> a<00:00:45.670> lot<00:00:45.819> of<00:00:45.850> things<00:00:46.149> that

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:46.299 
the speech there's a lot of things that

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:47.549 
the speech there's a lot of things that
we're<00:00:46.420> doing<00:00:46.539> that's<00:00:46.899> going<00:00:47.019> to<00:00:47.079> be<00:00:47.170> unique<00:00:47.409> in

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
we're doing that's going to be unique in

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.459 
we're doing that's going to be unique in
that<00:00:47.620> plants<00:00:48.190> like<00:00:48.969> we<00:00:49.149> do<00:00:49.269> with<00:00:49.449> racing<00:00:49.899> we'll

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
that plants like we do with racing we'll

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.259 
that plants like we do with racing we'll
take<00:00:50.649> those<00:00:50.799> technologies<00:00:51.190> and<00:00:51.789> the<00:00:51.819> ones

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
take those technologies and the ones

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:53.219 
take those technologies and the ones
that<00:00:52.389> really<00:00:52.600> work<00:00:52.899> for<00:00:52.929> mass<00:00:53.199> production

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:53.229 
that really work for mass production

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:54.930 
that really work for mass production
will<00:00:53.889> then<00:00:54.069> transfer<00:00:54.370> into<00:00:54.639> mass<00:00:54.909> production

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
will then transfer into mass production

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.840 
will then transfer into mass production
funds<00:00:55.539> you<00:00:56.049> also<00:00:56.199> talked<00:00:56.559> about<00:00:56.649> a<00:00:56.799> new<00:00:57.129> paint

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
funds you also talked about a new paint

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.149 
funds you also talked about a new paint
process<00:00:58.629> that<00:00:59.199> you're<00:00:59.319> using<00:00:59.530> on<00:00:59.769> you<00:00:59.889> on<00:01:00.039> your

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159 
process that you're using on you on your

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.399 
process that you're using on you on your
mass<00:01:00.339> production<00:01:00.729> cars<00:01:01.209> they<00:01:01.479> cut<00:01:01.809> I<00:01:02.079> think

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 
mass production cars they cut I think

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:04.229 
mass production cars they cut I think
you<00:01:02.499> say<00:01:02.649> forty<00:01:03.069> percent<00:01:03.399> energy<00:01:03.940> and<00:01:04.119> you

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
you say forty percent energy and you

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.970 
you say forty percent energy and you
explain<00:01:04.900> that<00:01:05.050> a<00:01:05.110> little<00:01:05.290> bit<00:01:05.500> well

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
explain that a little bit well

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.680 
explain that a little bit well
traditionally<00:01:06.160> we've<00:01:06.640> used<00:01:06.820> a<00:01:06.970> four<00:01:07.210> coat<00:01:07.450> and

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
traditionally we've used a four coat and

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.140 
traditionally we've used a four coat and
three<00:01:07.900> bait<00:01:08.110> process<00:01:08.620> paint<00:01:08.860> process<00:01:09.150> by

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
three bait process paint process by

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.240 
three bait process paint process by
eliminating<00:01:10.570> one<00:01:10.840> of<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.200> coding<00:01:11.770> and<00:01:11.920> baking

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
eliminating one of the coding and baking

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.770 
eliminating one of the coding and baking
processes<00:01:12.730> of<00:01:12.910> course<00:01:13.120> we<00:01:13.240> can<00:01:13.390> reduce<00:01:13.510> the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
processes of course we can reduce the

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.450 
processes of course we can reduce the
energy<00:01:13.870> that's<00:01:14.200> used<00:01:14.410> in<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:15.010> baking<00:01:15.370> process

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
energy that's used in the baking process

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.550 
energy that's used in the baking process
or<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.060> ovens<00:01:16.420> and<00:01:16.660> that's<00:01:17.140> what's<00:01:17.350> allowed

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
or the ovens and that's what's allowed

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.020 
or the ovens and that's what's allowed
us<00:01:17.680> to<00:01:17.710> do<00:01:17.860> it<00:01:17.920> and<00:01:18.010> we<00:01:18.070> can<00:01:18.220> maintain<00:01:18.490> the<00:01:18.820> same

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
us to do it and we can maintain the same

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.910 
us to do it and we can maintain the same
or<00:01:19.240> even<00:01:19.360> improve<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:19.810> level<00:01:19.960> of<00:01:20.110> quality<00:01:20.440> how

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
or even improve the level of quality how

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.290 
or even improve the level of quality how
do<00:01:20.980> you<00:01:21.070> do<00:01:21.190> that<00:01:21.220> because<00:01:21.490> I<00:01:21.700> think<00:01:21.910> a<00:01:22.090> lot<00:01:22.120> of

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
do you do that because I think a lot of

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.880 
do you do that because I think a lot of
people<00:01:22.390> watching<00:01:22.870> right<00:01:23.080> now<00:01:23.230> would<00:01:23.560> be<00:01:23.680> what

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
people watching right now would be what

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.320 
people watching right now would be what
do<00:01:23.950> you<00:01:24.040> mean<00:01:24.190> you're<00:01:24.370> putting<00:01:24.640> less<00:01:24.820> paint<00:01:25.120> on

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
do you mean you're putting less paint on

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.260 
do you mean you're putting less paint on
a<00:01:25.360> car<00:01:25.600> how<00:01:25.840> can<00:01:26.020> that<00:01:26.050> be<00:01:26.200> better<00:01:26.470> yeah<00:01:27.010> we're

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
a car how can that be better yeah we're

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.730 
a car how can that be better yeah we're
of<00:01:28.270> course<00:01:28.510> we<00:01:28.660> do<00:01:29.020> all<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.230> testing<00:01:29.590> to<00:01:29.710> make

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
of course we do all the testing to make

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.080 
of course we do all the testing to make
sure<00:01:29.890> that<00:01:30.190> things<00:01:30.400> such<00:01:30.640> as<00:01:30.670> corrosion

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
sure that things such as corrosion

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.840 
sure that things such as corrosion
protection<00:01:31.330> etc<00:01:31.660> are<00:01:32.110> maintained<00:01:32.560> but<00:01:33.430> just

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
protection etc are maintained but just

protection etc are maintained but just
by<00:01:33.970> looking<00:01:34.270> at<00:01:34.330> working<00:01:34.720> with<00:01:34.870> our<00:01:35.050> suppliers

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
by looking at working with our suppliers

by looking at working with our suppliers
the<00:01:35.620> paint<00:01:35.830> development<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:36.460> working<00:01:37.030> with

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
the paint development and working with

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.550 
the paint development and working with
our<00:01:37.180> hundred<00:01:37.540> engineering<00:01:37.930> company<00:01:38.260> for<00:01:38.470> the

our hundred engineering company for the

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.500 
our hundred engineering company for the
application<00:01:38.950> we<00:01:39.640> found<00:01:39.820> a<00:01:39.970> way<00:01:40.090> that<00:01:40.300> we<00:01:40.390> can

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
application we found a way that we can

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.240 
application we found a way that we can
manage<00:01:40.720> to<00:01:41.020> use<00:01:41.230> less<00:01:41.470> codes<00:01:41.770> and<00:01:42.070> get<00:01:42.160> the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
manage to use less codes and get the

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.010 
manage to use less codes and get the
same<00:01:42.460> protection<00:01:42.940> I<00:01:43.270> think<00:01:43.659> that's<00:01:43.810> very

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
same protection I think that's very

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.380 
same protection I think that's very
significant<00:01:44.590> dollar<00:01:44.800> huge<00:01:45.550> reduction<00:01:46.180> in<00:01:46.300> the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
significant dollar huge reduction in the

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.030 
significant dollar huge reduction in the
amount<00:01:46.480> of<00:01:46.720> energy<00:01:46.810> needed<00:01:47.110> to<00:01:47.470> paint<00:01:47.740> a<00:01:47.860> car
