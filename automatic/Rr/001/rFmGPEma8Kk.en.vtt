today's<00:00:09.339> lesson<00:00:09.580> Tom<00:00:10.179> will<00:00:10.330> be<00:00:10.450> speaking

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:10.839 
today's lesson Tom will be speaking

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:13.110 
today's lesson Tom will be speaking
about<00:00:11.019> basic<00:00:11.679> lighting<00:00:12.040> and<00:00:12.339> metering<00:00:12.610> part

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.120 
about basic lighting and metering part

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.250 
about basic lighting and metering part
two<00:00:13.330> he<00:00:13.990> lights<00:00:14.230> the<00:00:14.469> light<00:00:16.020> basic<00:00:17.020> lighting

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:17.260 
two he lights the light basic lighting

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.920 
two he lights the light basic lighting
metering<00:00:17.890> part<00:00:18.130> one<00:00:18.310> we<00:00:19.300> worked<00:00:19.510> on<00:00:19.660> lighting

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
metering part one we worked on lighting

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.930 
metering part one we worked on lighting
an<00:00:20.020> object<00:00:20.320> so<00:00:20.410> we<00:00:20.470> had<00:00:20.620> light<00:00:20.890> side<00:00:21.220> against

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:21.940 
an object so we had light side against

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.420 
an object so we had light side against
dark<00:00:22.150> side<00:00:22.420> dark<00:00:23.410> side<00:00:23.650> against<00:00:24.010> light<00:00:24.160> side

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
dark side dark side against light side

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.490 
dark side dark side against light side
so<00:00:24.610> we<00:00:24.730> could<00:00:24.850> separate<00:00:25.180> the<00:00:25.360> object<00:00:25.500> basic

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
so we could separate the object basic

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.720 
so we could separate the object basic
lighting<00:00:26.680> in<00:00:26.860> the<00:00:26.920> year<00:00:27.070> in<00:00:27.160> part<00:00:27.370> two<00:00:27.550> we're

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
lighting in the year in part two we're

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.100 
lighting in the year in part two we're
going<00:00:27.820> to<00:00:27.880> do<00:00:27.970> the<00:00:28.060> same<00:00:28.240> thing<00:00:28.510> except<00:00:29.080> for

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110 
going to do the same thing except for

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.540 
going to do the same thing except for
now<00:00:29.440> we're<00:00:29.650> going<00:00:29.740> to<00:00:29.800> close<00:00:30.100> down<00:00:30.130> the

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
now we're going to close down the

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.490 
now we're going to close down the
dynamic<00:00:31.060> range<00:00:31.300> of<00:00:31.450> the<00:00:31.510> object<00:00:31.990> we're<00:00:32.379> going

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
dynamic range of the object we're going

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.200 
dynamic range of the object we're going
to<00:00:32.559> make<00:00:32.740> sure<00:00:32.950> that<00:00:33.490> the<00:00:33.730> light<00:00:33.940> side<00:00:34.180> and

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
to make sure that the light side and

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.150 
to make sure that the light side and
darkside<00:00:34.840> are<00:00:34.960> close<00:00:35.230> enough<00:00:35.260> together<00:00:35.710> in

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
darkside are close enough together in

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.770 
darkside are close enough together in
terms<00:00:36.340> of<00:00:36.550> dynamic<00:00:36.970> range<00:00:37.120> so<00:00:37.270> we<00:00:37.450> can<00:00:37.570> capture

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
terms of dynamic range so we can capture

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.900 
terms of dynamic range so we can capture
both<00:00:37.990> on<00:00:38.410> film<00:00:38.680> so<00:00:39.220> what<00:00:39.340> I'll<00:00:39.430> do<00:00:39.579> is<00:00:39.730> I'll

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
both on film so what I'll do is I'll

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.450 
both on film so what I'll do is I'll
position<00:00:40.480> my<00:00:40.810> objects<00:00:41.380> so<00:00:41.560> I<00:00:41.590> have<00:00:41.860> light

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
position my objects so I have light

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.750 
position my objects so I have light
against<00:00:42.730> dark<00:00:43.060> to<00:00:43.390> dark<00:00:43.630> pitch<00:00:43.900> light<00:00:44.640> when<00:00:45.640> it

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
against dark to dark pitch light when it

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.960 
against dark to dark pitch light when it
gets<00:00:45.910> dark<00:00:46.180> dark<00:00:46.570> it's<00:00:46.750> late<00:00:46.989> as<00:00:47.200> I<00:00:47.260> did<00:00:47.410> before

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
gets dark dark it's late as I did before

in<00:01:19.680> most<00:01:19.890> setups<00:01:20.250> we<00:01:20.369> have<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> cue<00:01:20.820> light<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
to do this we have to establish one

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
soften my shadows but I'm going to keep

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.850 
soften my shadows but I'm going to keep
