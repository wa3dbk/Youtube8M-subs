00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello today I cook duck 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.029
 breast with orange sauce 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.370
 this dish is traditionally French cuisine 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.910
 restaurant and u need to cook homemade 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.980
 version of 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.710
 there is a simpler sauce and it is smaller 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.289
 components and so it will also be delicious 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.720
 very tasty so start the night out 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.910
 cooking sauce sauce for this dish 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.400
 prepare two stages in the first stage 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.980
 by the way here is this sauce basis for sauce you 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.680
 you can cook in advance even the day before 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.599
 either an hour before you fry 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.910
 breast and for starters we need to cook 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.460
 caramel screen did I take 25 grams 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.100
 sugar added to the same 100 grams of hot 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.450
 water and api can take more thing 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.309
 The main thing is that all the sugar is completely 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.469
 dissolved, that is, there were no crystals 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.420
 sugar it should dissolve before starting 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.300
 boiling as soon as boiling begins 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.829
 more we do not interfere with the mixture when we wait 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.680
 will turn into caramel 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.660
 so nice about this 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.149
 saturated brown then go here 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.280
 add a tablespoon of white vinegar 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.469
 the wine is very eager either any 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.290
 when added to saturday neatly 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.570
 take care of your vinegar and dissolve the caramel 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.540
 and 5 here add juice from 2 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.830
 oranges about three quarters of a glass 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.290
 Here it is very desirable that 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.970
 oranges were unsweetened oxide tab 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.250
 very well suited for this purpose 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.290
 spanish oranges if you and paisley 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.200
 lining it maybe makes sense 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.250
 add a little lemon juice 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.830
 evaporated to about half 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.960
 and then add the broth and day here 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.810
 I cooked this broth on a bone 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.180
 since I butchered the whole duck here 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.009
 add one and a half cups of broth if 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.290
 suddenly there is no duck broth 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.930
 his beef or at worst take 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.409
 chicken beef course it will be the best 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.299
 replacement of italy we evaporated we evaporated somewhere 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.310
 also about half that is with us 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.770
 should get almost sauce on he should 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.570
 be still watery at this stage sauce i 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.640
 didn't add any spices even his 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.649
 Salted all this we will do on the second 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.659
 the stage duck brought me I salted 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.000
 peppered did it from two sides and 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.009
 then leave the minutes for 15 pads 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.119
 marinate leave open 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.159
 there is nothing on the bed will not 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.590
 you need to fry right before 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.460
 serving because sang well on heat 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.110
 if it stays up it gets drier 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.110
 all about everything you need literally 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.570
 20 minutes I will talk on the olive 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.370
 butter oil are heated to the hot 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.740
 of course not very hot 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.470
 since olive oil cannot stand 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.790
 high temperatures it burns and 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.100
 fry breast fry with two 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.080
 parties of five to six minutes this time 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.630
 the breast reaches the average roasting then 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.160
 eat inside it will be reddish and 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.560
 roasting is considered ideal for breasts 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.680
 duck if you want that was completely 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.750
 fry then increase the time to 7 8 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.300
 minutes the degree of roasting is determined by 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.160
 the degree of density of the meat it should be 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.440
 about the same in density as 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.620
 the thumb pad then here everything 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.660
 as well as with steak cooking lay out 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.650
 fried breast covered with foil 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.900
 right away 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.670
 and leave for 10 minutes of the site time 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.010
 local juices are evenly distributed 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.600
 by volume and not go under the example behind it 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.430
 that is, the dish will be more succulent on 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.710
 I do not lay out a griddle from a Catholic 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.230
 sliced â€‹â€‹orange slices thin in 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.940
 are about half a centimeter and slightly 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.040
 fry on both sides literally 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.720
 minute of the extensive segments postponed 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.480
 Optional pans add dining 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.460
 a spoonful of vinegar will dissolve vinegar 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.130
 glazed everything that we have become attached to 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.590
 the bottom of the pan and the taste of the sauce 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.140
 enrich then add here 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.780
 the basis of which we have welded earlier and already 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.240
 completed the sauce we need first of all I 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.530
 add vinegar, balsamic I can 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.660
 basically add any 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.050
 using a spatula I will cut all that 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.850
 prikipela to the bottom add the base of the sauce to us 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.280
 will need it again firstly the guy 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.370
 to the desired consistency of the author to bring them 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.740
 taste so that we had a little sauce 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.480
 sourness is felt in her a little 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.810
 sugar but at the same time it was outside jam 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.520
 so that after it was harmoniously how it went 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.040
 and the most difficult since there is no one 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.510
 the recipe has it all depends this how 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.480
 creativity all depends on your 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.890
 perceptions so try maybe you 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.840
 want the sauce to be a little bit 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.880
 more closely interrogate a little lemon 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.830
 there is not enough juice from the sweetness 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.160
 a lot of sugar to harmony 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.990
 sour to salty and sweet pump i 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.330
 practically did not reach the right 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.100
 consistency at the end I will add 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.100
 a little orange peel only 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.360
 the yellow part and quite a bit and already in 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.550
 the very end of pi is necessary 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.590
 salt sauce and this thing is really in 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.330
 very end because if you do 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.990
 before easily miss easy 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.560
 salted after the sauce will 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.300
 ready 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.699
 if you add a tablespoon 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.099
 butter to make 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.610
 the sauce is more brilliant to him so 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:43.550
 turned out 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.169
 nice silky texture and oil 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:50.270
 additionally the word will launch 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:52.009
 dissolve the butter sauce and the sauce is ready so 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:57.830

 if you fry it will be more dry but 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:18.710
 if you are not at ease if you want 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.389
 so that it was completely fried 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.360
 just increase the frying time 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:25.550
 served with sauce is perfect here
