this<00:01:36.119> comes<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.450> book<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.960> both<00:01:37.110> styles<00:01:37.530> this

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
this comes on book and both styles this

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.550 
this comes on book and both styles this
is<00:01:37.680> obvious<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.400> I'll<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:38.640> grab<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.939> brown

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
is obvious and I'll just grab the brown

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.020 
is obvious and I'll just grab the brown
so<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.680> brown<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> slightly<00:01:41.369> paler<00:01:41.820> color

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
gore-tex lined which makes obviously

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.569 
gore-tex lined which makes obviously
gore-tex<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.259> waterproof<00:01:52.829> membrane<00:01:53.220> which

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
is visible so it's like basically a sock

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.720 
is visible so it's like basically a sock
inside<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.140> shoe<00:04:15.320> a<00:04:15.530> waterproof<00:04:16.220> sock<00:04:16.459> inside

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
inside the shoe a waterproof sock inside

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.849 
inside the shoe a waterproof sock inside
the<00:04:16.820> shoe<00:04:16.970> and<00:04:17.090> that's<00:04:17.299> what<00:04:17.570> gives<00:04:18.470> it<00:04:18.620> its

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
the shoe and that's what gives it its

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.790 
the shoe and that's what gives it its
longevity<00:04:19.070> as<00:04:19.730> waterproof<00:04:20.660> boot<00:04:21.850> it<00:04:22.850> has<00:04:23.180> a

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
longevity as waterproof boot it has a

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.140 
longevity as waterproof boot it has a
very<00:04:24.800> soft

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
very soft

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.689 
very soft
rubber<00:04:28.150> material<00:04:28.720> on<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:28.960> sole<00:04:29.169> and<00:04:29.699> this

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
rubber material on the sole and this

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.219 
rubber material on the sole and this
provides<00:04:31.030> excellent<00:04:31.389> wear<00:04:31.659> but<00:04:31.870> also<00:04:31.990> it's

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
provides excellent wear but also it's

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.950 
provides excellent wear but also it's
very<00:04:32.259> start<00:04:32.650> it's<00:04:32.800> not<00:04:32.949> extremely<00:04:33.759> it<00:04:34.509> like

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
very start it's not extremely it like

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.379 
very start it's not extremely it like
flexible<00:04:35.530> but<00:04:36.069> it's<00:04:36.190> very<00:04:36.370> it<00:04:36.970> provides<00:04:37.270> a

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
flexible but it's very it provides a

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.439 
flexible but it's very it provides a
very<00:04:37.419> good<00:04:37.720> cushion<00:04:38.349> when<00:04:39.039> you<00:04:39.220> walk<00:04:40.090> with

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
very good cushion when you walk with

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.920 
very good cushion when you walk with
these<00:04:40.900> boots<00:04:41.139> and<00:04:41.520> I<00:04:42.520> think<00:04:43.330> for<00:04:43.449> this<00:04:43.569> reason

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
these boots and I think for this reason

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.480 
these boots and I think for this reason
I<00:04:44.169> think<00:04:44.289> it's<00:04:44.500> probably<00:04:44.650> combination<00:04:45.220> of<00:04:45.310> the

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
I think it's probably combination of the

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.950 
I think it's probably combination of the
the<00:04:45.669> sole<00:04:45.909> this<00:04:46.150> rubber<00:04:46.360> and<00:04:46.539> the<00:04:46.599> soul<00:04:46.810> and

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
the sole this rubber and the soul and

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.719 
the sole this rubber and the soul and
the<00:04:47.650> insole<00:04:47.949> that<00:04:47.979> makes<00:04:48.460> them<00:04:48.580> so

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
the insole that makes them so

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.839 
the insole that makes them so
comfortable<00:04:48.909> but<00:04:49.780> to<00:04:50.259> be<00:04:50.349> honest<00:04:50.620> you<00:04:51.520> have<00:04:51.729> to

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
comfortable but to be honest you have to

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:53.070 
comfortable but to be honest you have to
really<00:04:52.000> put<00:04:52.150> your<00:04:52.240> foot<00:04:52.360> on<00:04:52.419> them<00:04:52.569> to<00:04:52.720> believe

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
really put your foot on them to believe

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.140 
really put your foot on them to believe
them<00:04:53.379> how<00:04:53.620> comfortable<00:04:54.009> they<00:04:54.159> are<00:04:54.280> if<00:04:54.789> I<00:04:55.060> was

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
them how comfortable they are if I was

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.529 
them how comfortable they are if I was
to<00:04:55.240> look<00:04:55.360> at<00:04:55.509> the<00:04:55.569> downside<00:04:56.050> of<00:04:56.110> this<00:04:56.319> plush<00:04:56.560> I

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
to look at the downside of this plush I

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:00.570 
to look at the downside of this plush I
would<00:04:58.539> say<00:04:58.780> possibly<00:04:59.770> a<00:05:00.039> little<00:05:00.159> bit<00:05:00.310> on<00:05:00.490> the

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
would say possibly a little bit on the

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.760 
would say possibly a little bit on the
heavy<00:05:00.669> side<00:05:00.819> and<00:05:01.270> when<00:05:02.229> you<00:05:02.319> have<00:05:02.469> them<00:05:02.650> on

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
heavy side and when you have them on

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.529 
heavy side and when you have them on
they<00:05:03.190> feel<00:05:03.490> a<00:05:03.849> little<00:05:04.599> bit<00:05:04.690> big<00:05:05.280> Bush<00:05:06.310> I<00:05:06.610> think

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
they feel a little bit big Bush I think

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:08.760 
they feel a little bit big Bush I think
the<00:05:07.629> positives<00:05:07.990> outweigh<00:05:08.229> the<00:05:08.289> negatives<00:05:08.680> and

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
the positives outweigh the negatives and

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.029 
the positives outweigh the negatives and
the<00:05:08.860> positives<00:05:08.889> really<00:05:09.490> are<00:05:11.039> durability

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
the positives really are durability

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.240 
the positives really are durability
quality<00:05:12.599> comfort<00:05:13.889> waterproofness<00:05:14.889> and

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
quality comfort waterproofness and

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.249 
quality comfort waterproofness and
they're<00:05:15.940> they're<00:05:16.449> a<00:05:16.479> good-looking<00:05:16.719> but<00:05:17.110> they

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:17.259 
they're they're a good-looking but they

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:19.820 
they're they're a good-looking but they
don't<00:05:17.469> look<00:05:17.889> like<00:05:18.190> a<00:05:18.250> typical<00:05:18.520> safety<00:05:19.000> Bush

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
don't look like a typical safety Bush

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.649 
don't look like a typical safety Bush
