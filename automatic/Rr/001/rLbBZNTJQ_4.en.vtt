one side without any cuts in it and to

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.150 
one side without any cuts in it and to
that<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.320> simply<00:00:31.590> add<00:00:32.059> with<00:00:33.059> paper<00:00:33.480> tape<00:00:34.160> is

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
that you simply add with paper tape is

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:43.430 
that you simply add with paper tape is
simply<00:00:35.550> putting<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:35.969> together<00:00:42.230> down<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
simply putting it together down the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.619 
simply putting it together down the
center<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.870> mold<00:00:46.700> ok<00:00:47.700> there's<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.270> center

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
center of the mold ok there's the center

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.020 
center of the mold ok there's the center
of<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.809> base<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:50.160> center<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.640> top<00:00:50.850> I

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
of the base the center of the top I

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.709 
of the base the center of the top I
always<00:00:51.390> fold<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.079> over<00:00:52.879> put<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> tape<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
always fold it over put the tape and the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.279 
always fold it over put the tape and the
week<00:00:54.899> over<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.520> holds<00:00:56.699> really<00:00:56.940> well

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
week over so that it holds really well

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.080 
week over so that it holds really well
snip<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.410> off<00:00:58.530> now<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.280> other<00:00:59.460> half<00:00:59.760> when<00:01:00.000> you

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
snip it off now the other half when you

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.840 
snip it off now the other half when you
cut<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.420> out<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.750> mold<00:01:01.100> you<00:01:02.100> need<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.430> cut<00:01:02.670> a

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
cut it out of the mold you need to cut a

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.670 
cut it out of the mold you need to cut a
wedge<00:01:03.210> out<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.719> base<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.320> there<00:01:04.589> is

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
wedge out of the base so that there is

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.500 
wedge out of the base so that there is
somewhere<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.250> pour<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:07.939> when<00:01:08.939> it's<00:01:09.090> together

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
somewhere to pour it when it's together

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
somewhere to pour it when it's together
ok<00:01:10.350> those<00:01:10.530> two<00:01:10.830> halves<00:01:11.100> go<00:01:11.400> together<00:01:15.380> this<00:01:16.380> is

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
ok those two halves go together this is

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.469 
ok those two halves go together this is
where<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.920> will<00:01:17.009> pour<00:01:17.369> most<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.240> malls

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
where you will pour most of the malls

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.850 
where you will pour most of the malls
have<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> slightly<00:01:19.049> larger<00:01:19.380> area<00:01:20.100> than<00:01:20.130> that

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
have a slightly larger area than that

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.440 
have a slightly larger area than that
alright<00:01:22.860> most<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.490> them<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.820> larger<00:01:24.270> area

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
alright most of them have a larger area

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.390 
alright most of them have a larger area
than<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.900> but<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.530> one's<00:01:25.770> quite<00:01:26.009> small<00:01:26.340> but

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
than that but this one's quite small but

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.670 
than that but this one's quite small but
of<00:01:26.670> course<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.060> does<00:01:27.240> work<00:01:27.570> now<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.200> hold<00:01:28.500> it

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
of course it does work now to hold it

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.780 
of course it does work now to hold it
together<00:01:29.570> you<00:01:30.570> need<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.900> get<00:01:33.259> fallback<00:01:34.259> tubes

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
together you need to get fallback tubes

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.210 
together you need to get fallback tubes
nice<00:01:35.790> strong<00:01:36.240> ones<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:37.409> most<00:01:37.619> important<00:01:38.159> part

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
nice strong ones the most important part

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.370 
nice strong ones the most important part
is<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.549> make<00:01:38.820> sure<00:01:39.030> nothing<00:01:39.180> comes<00:01:39.659> through<00:01:39.780> at

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
is to make sure nothing comes through at

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.950 
is to make sure nothing comes through at
the<00:01:40.920> top<00:01:41.189> remember<00:01:42.060> your<00:01:42.210> candles<00:01:42.630> are<00:01:42.720> poured

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
the top remember your candles are poured

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.690 
the top remember your candles are poured
upside<00:01:43.350> down<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.799> that's<00:01:43.860> quite<00:01:44.100> confusing

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
upside down and that's quite confusing

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.649 
upside down and that's quite confusing
for<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.030> lot<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.180> people<00:01:47.030> ok<00:01:48.030> once<00:01:48.329> you've<00:01:48.509> done

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
for a lot of people ok once you've done

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.410 
for a lot of people ok once you've done
that<00:01:48.950> and<00:01:49.950> it's<00:01:50.100> actually<00:01:50.250> ready<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.850> pour<00:01:51.090> I

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
that and it's actually ready to pour I

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.010 
that and it's actually ready to pour I
always<00:01:52.020> stabilize<00:01:52.890> mine<00:01:53.220> in<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.119> box<00:01:54.540> area

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
always stabilize mine in in a box area

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.539 
always stabilize mine in in a box area
you'll<00:01:55.170> find<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:55.829> all<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.130> instructions

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
you'll find that on all the instructions

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.840 
you'll find that on all the instructions
but<00:01:57.420> there<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.840> ready<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.829> pour<00:01:59.009> into<00:01:59.579> that

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
but there it is ready to pour into that

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.730 
but there it is ready to pour into that
hole<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.390> then<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.140> end<00:02:01.350> up<00:02:01.500> with<00:02:01.710> a

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
hole and then you end up with a

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.709 
hole and then you end up with a
beautiful<00:02:02.280> little<00:02:02.969> candle<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:06.060> candles<00:02:06.479> been

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
beautiful little candle the candles been

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.020 
beautiful little candle the candles been
sitting<00:02:07.079> overnight<00:02:07.520> generally<00:02:08.520> candles<00:02:08.970> are

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
sitting overnight generally candles are

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.080 
sitting overnight generally candles are
left<00:02:09.209> overnight<00:02:10.009> we've<00:02:11.009> poured<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:11.760> keep

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
left overnight we've poured it in keep

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.900 
left overnight we've poured it in keep
breaking<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.780> seal<00:02:13.110> there<00:02:13.410> and<00:02:13.709> pour<00:02:14.280> inside

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
breaking the seal there and pour inside

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.760 
breaking the seal there and pour inside
the<00:02:15.270> wax<00:02:15.480> contracts<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.440> it's<00:02:16.560> really

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
the wax contracts and it's really

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.640 
the wax contracts and it's really
