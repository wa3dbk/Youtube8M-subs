00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
tons in there and I'm actually gonna

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.970 
tons in there and I'm actually gonna
give<00:04:08.630> a<00:04:08.660> glass<00:04:08.840> of<00:04:08.989> this<00:04:09.110> to<00:04:09.290> Sarah<00:04:09.530> as<00:04:09.739> well

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
give a glass of this to Sarah as well

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:10.979 
give a glass of this to Sarah as well
but

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
but

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.809 
but
it's<00:04:11.319> high-calorie<00:04:11.859> because<00:04:12.400> it<00:04:12.549> has<00:04:12.670> the

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
it's high-calorie because it has the

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.789 
it's high-calorie because it has the
apple<00:04:13.120> juice<00:04:13.269> instead<00:04:13.689> of<00:04:13.780> water<00:04:13.989> and<00:04:14.319> dates

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
apple juice instead of water and dates

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.529 
apple juice instead of water and dates
and<00:04:15.129> so<00:04:15.459> for<00:04:15.640> a<00:04:15.670> small<00:04:15.939> amount<00:04:16.030> of<00:04:16.239> dates<00:04:16.389> you

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
and so for a small amount of dates you

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.420 
and so for a small amount of dates you
get<00:04:16.660> a<00:04:16.690> lot<00:04:16.870> of<00:04:16.900> calories<00:04:17.109> so<00:04:17.889> this<00:04:18.039> gonna<00:04:18.130> fill

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
get a lot of calories so this gonna fill

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.120 
get a lot of calories so this gonna fill
me<00:04:18.579> up<00:04:18.609> good<00:04:18.910> floor<00:04:19.239> before<00:04:19.419> my<00:04:19.720> swim<00:04:20.039> so<00:04:21.039> I'm

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.930 
two-minute hill climbs and so those were
pretty<00:05:44.750> intense<00:05:45.080> but<00:05:46.040> I<00:05:46.220> feel<00:05:46.580> really<00:05:46.610> good

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
pretty intense but I feel really good

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.060 
pretty intense but I feel really good
now<00:05:47.150> that<00:05:47.270> my<00:05:47.330> workouts<00:05:47.690> over<00:05:48.050> so<00:05:48.710> came<00:05:48.920> onto

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
now that my workouts over so came onto

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.430 
now that my workouts over so came onto
the<00:05:49.250> car<00:05:49.490> and<00:05:49.850> you<00:05:50.270> can<00:05:50.450> see<00:05:50.690> like<00:05:51.080> you<00:05:51.200> can't

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
the car and you can see like you can't

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.950 
the car and you can see like you can't
see<00:05:51.590> out<00:05:51.710> the<00:05:51.800> window<00:05:52.100> that's<00:05:52.730> ice<00:05:53.060> so<00:05:53.660> I<00:05:53.690> have

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
see out the window that's ice so I have

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.690 
see out the window that's ice so I have
to<00:05:54.080> sit<00:05:54.260> in<00:05:54.320> here<00:05:54.620> and<00:05:54.650> wait<00:05:55.040> for<00:05:55.070> my<00:05:55.310> car<00:05:55.550> to

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
to sit in here and wait for my car to

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.400 
to sit in here and wait for my car to
defrost<00:05:56.060> because<00:05:56.480> it's<00:05:57.050> like<00:05:57.170> a<00:05:57.200> big

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
defrost because it's like a big

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.700 
defrost because it's like a big
snowstorm<00:05:57.680> here<00:05:59.110> which<00:06:00.110> is<00:06:00.230> why<00:06:00.350> I<00:06:00.380> couldn't

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
snowstorm here which is why I couldn't

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.350 
snowstorm here which is why I couldn't
end<00:06:00.920> up<00:06:01.010> going<00:06:01.250> to<00:06:01.280> my<00:06:01.460> swimming<00:06:01.700> downtown<00:06:02.210> I'm

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
so glad I didn't go I saw pictures and

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.970 
so glad I didn't go I saw pictures and
that<00:06:04.700> the<00:06:05.210> buses<00:06:05.630> are<00:06:05.930> like<00:06:06.110> sideways<00:06:06.620> on<00:06:06.860> the

streets and stuff so I made the right

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.950 
streets and stuff so I made the right
choice<00:06:08.870> by<00:06:09.080> not<00:06:09.530> going<00:06:09.770> to<00:06:10.220> my<00:06:10.750> swim<00:06:11.750> class
