size and if i'm not mistaken their lip
products<00:01:42.299> i<00:01:42.479> think<00:01:42.750> are<00:01:42.869> like<00:01:43.170> 20<00:01:43.850> 22<00:01:44.850> dollars

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
products i think are like 20 22 dollars

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.760 
products i think are like 20 22 dollars
or<00:01:45.509> something<00:01:45.869> like<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.500> basically

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
or something like that so basically

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.270 
or something like that so basically
almost<00:01:47.340> pays<00:01:47.850> for<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.360> set<00:01:49.229> itself<00:01:49.829> so

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
almost pays for this set itself so

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.550 
almost pays for this set itself so
that's<00:01:50.310> awesome<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.390> then<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.049> does<00:01:52.229> come

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
that's awesome and then it does come

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.249 
that's awesome and then it does come
with<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.950> sephora<00:01:53.430> rouge<00:01:53.930> infusion<00:01:54.930> the

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
with a sephora rouge infusion the

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.999 
with a sephora rouge infusion the
neutrals<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:57.259> peony<00:01:58.259> which<00:01:58.649> i

neutrals and this is in peony which i

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.240 
neutrals and this is in peony which i
think<00:01:59.159> this<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.640> like<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.090> lip<00:02:00.390> tint<00:02:00.869> oil<00:02:01.290> um
