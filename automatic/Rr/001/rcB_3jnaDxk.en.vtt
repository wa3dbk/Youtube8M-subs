00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.110
 hello youtube hello everyone who is me 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.730
 looking in this video I want to poke 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.910
 electronic meters 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:13.209
 heating and hot water 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.459
 who stand at my job here 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:18.880
 non hot water meter 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:23.289
 well here's a heating meter every meter 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:26.289
 consists of a daemon control unit 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:29.230
 shown from a controller or just like that 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:32.650
 tell the mini computer to each counter 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:39.040
 connect temperature sensors and 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:40.410
 water flow now I'll show it to you 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:47.440
 not by wire 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:50.730
 pipe temperature sensor this is on the flow 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.550
 worth but the return sensor 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.910
 the ultrasonic transducer still stands duct 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.270
 water is to attack here on return and for sure 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.600
 also 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:07.290
 heating is also an ultrasonic sensor 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.290
 duct and here, too, temperature sensors 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.790
 also each have an optical counter 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.210
 the output connects to it optical 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.240
 cable 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.750
 This cable is customized printer and you can 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.300
 unravel 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.659
 print out the values ​​that he 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.790
 recorded the fact that this counter 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.570
 fixes such values ​​current 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:35.140
 value fix totals 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:40.840
 hourly and diurnal there are hours and 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:44.159
 calendars can fix it completely 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:49.620
 package temperature supply gigacalories 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.620
 leakage in general to the device 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.260
 see what 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:06.320
 You can choose the value of the current and 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:11.300
 the final hour daily hours of it and 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:14.330
 there is a calendar here it shows this 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:22.160
 moment of temperature is 45 this in innings here in 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:28.000
 the return pipe is the flow of water 8 cubes in 75 here 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.000
 return flow here is water flow here gigacalories 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.590
 Thank you for watching
