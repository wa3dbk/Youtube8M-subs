again I appreciate the thought more than

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:04.100 
again I appreciate the thought more than
the<00:05:00.870> card<00:05:01.550> because<00:05:02.550> you<00:05:03.150> know<00:05:03.300> somebody<00:05:03.900> who

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
the card because you know somebody who

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.420 
the card because you know somebody who
wasn't<00:05:04.379> gonna<00:05:04.620> be<00:05:04.800> able<00:05:04.860> to<00:05:04.949> get<00:05:05.039> this<00:05:05.189> card

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
wasn't gonna be able to get this card

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.999 
wasn't gonna be able to get this card
would<00:05:06.060> value<00:05:06.599> the<00:05:06.719> card<00:05:06.990> more<00:05:07.409> than<00:05:07.439> I<00:05:07.740> would

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
would value the card more than I would

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.149 
would value the card more than I would
because<00:05:08.659> you<00:05:09.659> know<00:05:09.779> they<00:05:10.259> probably<00:05:10.830> would

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159 
because you know they probably would

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:12.439 
because you know they probably would
never<00:05:11.279> get<00:05:11.550> it<00:05:11.639> like<00:05:11.789> I<00:05:11.879> said<00:05:12.060> eventually<00:05:12.150> I

would've<00:05:12.659> got<00:05:12.750> the<00:05:12.870> card<00:05:13.110> eventually<00:05:13.740> you

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:14.219 
would've got the card eventually you

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:15.649 
would've got the card eventually you
know<00:05:14.370> not<00:05:14.550> that<00:05:14.669> I<00:05:14.729> you<00:05:14.819> know<00:05:14.969> of<00:05:15.270> course<00:05:15.449> I
