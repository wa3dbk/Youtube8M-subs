fucking shoving his swamp shit down his
throat<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.030> mean<00:01:18.360> if<00:01:18.540> he's<00:01:19.200> losing<00:01:19.439> to

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
throat and I mean if he's losing to

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.770 
throat and I mean if he's losing to
caribou<00:01:20.250> then<00:01:20.729> he<00:01:20.909> wasn't<00:01:21.119> much<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.540> threat

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
caribou then he wasn't much of a threat

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.539 
caribou then he wasn't much of a threat
to<00:01:22.080> begin<00:01:22.350> with<00:01:22.560> we<00:01:22.830> don't<00:01:23.009> really<00:01:23.280> need<00:01:23.490> to

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
to begin with we don't really need to

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.700 
to begin with we don't really need to
worry<00:01:23.790> about<00:01:23.970> him<00:01:24.240> but<00:01:24.540> he's<00:01:25.020> probably<00:01:25.259> just<00:01:25.500> a

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
worry about him but he's probably just a

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.160 
worry about him but he's probably just a
foot<00:01:25.979> soldier<00:01:26.280> if<00:01:26.790> he<00:01:27.030> does<00:01:27.330> belong<00:01:27.900> in

foot soldier if he does belong in
kaido's<00:01:29.070> army<00:01:29.640> or<00:01:29.850> maybe<00:01:30.090> he's<00:01:30.329> an<00:01:30.479> officer<00:01:30.810> of

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020

kaido's army or maybe he's an officer of
some<00:01:31.229> sort<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:31.740> he's<00:01:32.189> not<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.460> strong<00:01:33.090> if

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
Rebecca somehow retain her memories and

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.100

remember whose sole son was in his

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.050 
remember whose sole son was in his
previous<00:03:22.620> life<00:03:22.799> before<00:03:22.860> he<00:03:23.310> became<00:03:23.610> a<00:03:23.670> toy<00:03:23.910> and

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
previous life before he became a toy and

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.620 
previous life before he became a toy and
that's<00:03:24.150> why<00:03:24.510> they<00:03:25.170> had<00:03:25.829> that<00:03:26.100> connection<00:03:27.030> but

like<00:04:18.299> you're

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
like you're

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.439 
like you're
typical<00:04:19.440> one-piece<00:04:20.190> backstory<00:04:21.120> there<00:04:21.239> wasn't

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
typical one-piece backstory there wasn't

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:25.309 
typical one-piece backstory there wasn't
anything<00:04:22.160> too<00:04:23.160> huge<00:04:24.150> here<00:04:24.569> was<00:04:24.810> kind<00:04:25.110> of<00:04:25.139> like

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:25.319 
anything too huge here was kind of like

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:29.420

okay<00:04:26.129> it<00:04:26.490> wasn't<00:04:26.940> really<00:04:27.270> unique<00:04:28.020> I<00:04:28.409> guess<00:04:28.860> it

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
okay it wasn't really unique I guess it

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.990 
okay it wasn't really unique I guess it
kind<00:04:29.610> of<00:04:29.669> is<00:04:29.789> because<00:04:30.090> we<00:04:30.210> haven't<00:04:30.780> had

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
kind of is because we haven't had

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.020 
kind of is because we haven't had
royalty<00:04:33.030> lose<00:04:33.780> their<00:04:33.990> parents<00:04:34.650> and<00:04:34.800> then

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
raised by toy before but it just felt

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.749 
raised by toy before but it just felt
like<00:04:39.080> okay<00:04:40.080> it's<00:04:40.680> kind<00:04:40.919> of<00:04:41.039> typical<00:04:41.550> at<00:04:41.639> this

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 
like okay it's kind of typical at this

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:42.260 
like okay it's kind of typical at this
point

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270
