power and a little bit more economy from
the<00:01:06.540> engines<00:01:06.870> I<00:01:07.050> reckon<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.710> means<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
the engines I reckon that means it's a

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:17.260 
the engines I reckon that means it's a
little<00:01:08.550> bit<00:01:08.700> better<00:01:08.880> value<00:01:13.880> so<00:01:15.080> good<00:01:16.080> car<00:01:16.320> then

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
little bit better value so good car then

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:24.890 
little bit better value so good car then
the<00:01:18.270> end<00:01:21.590> actually<00:01:22.590> not<00:01:22.740> quite<00:01:23.720> you<00:01:24.720> see<00:01:24.869> I

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
the end actually not quite you see I

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.450 
the end actually not quite you see I
think<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.229> c-class<00:01:25.590> deserves<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.070> bit<00:01:26.280> more

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
think the c-class deserves a bit more

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.270 
think the c-class deserves a bit more
attention<00:01:26.940> than<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.920> Mercedes<00:01:28.920> have<00:01:29.040> tried

to make it scratch resistant I love the
fact<00:04:21.959> that<00:04:22.229> at<00:04:22.380> motorway<00:04:22.830> speeds<00:04:23.220> the

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
fact that at motorway speeds the

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.840 
fact that at motorway speeds the
