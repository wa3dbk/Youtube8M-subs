00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
the bags in the back and there's also a

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.910 
the bags in the back and there's also a
little<00:02:39.060> bit<00:02:39.180> more<00:02:39.269> storage<00:02:39.630> space

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.890 

here's<00:02:44.550> a<00:02:44.610> quick<00:02:44.850> look<00:02:44.970> at<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.240> storage<00:02:45.630> space

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.670 
here's a quick look at the storage space
so<00:02:46.710> in<00:02:47.569> looking<00:02:48.569> back<00:02:48.600> here<00:02:49.140> I'm<00:02:49.319> not<00:02:49.620> sure

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
so in looking back here I'm not sure

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.710 
so in looking back here I'm not sure
that<00:02:50.220> there<00:02:50.430> would<00:02:50.550> be<00:02:50.580> enough<00:02:50.970> space<00:02:51.120> in<00:02:51.480> here
