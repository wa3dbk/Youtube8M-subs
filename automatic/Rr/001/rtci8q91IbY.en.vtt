 Automatically translated by the machine. This is a simple tutorial to make the display 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.899
 The area of ​​false eyelashes allows you to store them easily. 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.899
 It's simple and very efficient space. You will need cardboard, beautiful paper, lace, 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.279
 Tape, scissors, glue gun and transparent plastic paper. 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.370
 I reused one of the materials I had two years ago. 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.940
 Cut a piece of cardboard as big as you want to finish the result and a nice look 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.410
 File, the file is a few centimeters larger than cardboard. 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.899
 Lay the good side of the paper and the cardboard. 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:50.469
 Edge folded paper and tape in place. 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:57.469
 Flip it over and you already have this. Place it in a clear plastic sleeve. 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:07.960
 You can use any kind of plastic, but I just use an old plastic office display. 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.560
 Pull the sleeve and the tape in place so the front is completely smooth. 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.590
 You should have something like this. Next, cut the length of the tape and stick it 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.810
 Side right side panel. Repeat 2 slings. 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.960
 Make sure they are all sticky sides up. This is the eyelash that will be held on the blackboard 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.680
 So make sure you have enough tapes for the number of eyelashes. 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.329
 Now put a piece of tape on the side of the edge 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.329
 The first three. Repeat with another piece on another tape 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:45.329
 side. I mentioned the whole thing. 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.619
 Folded to the back and the edge of the tape, they stuck to it. 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:58.619
 Cut off any hanging tape. What should you have? 3 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.110
 The tape strip holds the eyelashes. Renovation time. 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.850
 I want to use some cute lace. With hot glue, folded lace edges 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.850
 And stick to it in place. One side of the glue board. 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:21.350
 Fold the corners into a dot and continue to bond the underside. 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:31.290
 Keep all the roads around the bond. There are many other things that you can use 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:54.200
 Such as ribbons, stickers or flower decorations. 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.740
 When you reach the finish, cut off, cold edges and glue in place. 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.050
 Now take your eyelashes and you're done. 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.100
 carry out! Eyelashes are held with tape, but 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:19.100
 Can be removed, it is easy to restuck. Just make sure you don't use tape or something 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:26.200
