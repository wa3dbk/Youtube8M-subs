00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
everyday lives which which i have been

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.719 
everyday lives which which i have been
using<00:01:12.810> after<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.710> it's<00:01:13.920> nice<00:01:14.130> trusting

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
using after that so it's nice trusting

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.480 
using after that so it's nice trusting
it's<00:01:15.030> good<00:01:15.180> there<00:01:15.750> was<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> lot<00:01:16.080> more

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
it's good there was a lot more

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.080 
it's good there was a lot more
straightforward<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.610> simple<00:01:17.759> than<00:01:18.060> I

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
straightforward and simple than I

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.050 
straightforward and simple than I
expected<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:19.049> it's<00:01:20.009> easy<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.430> pass<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
expected so it's easy to pass on the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.060 
expected so it's easy to pass on the
message<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.540> other<00:01:21.720> people<00:01:22.020> as<00:01:22.110> well<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.560> that

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
message to other people as well so that

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.219 
message to other people as well so that
was<00:01:23.220> probably<00:01:23.400> if<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:23.970> like<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.479> under<00:01:24.780> convince
