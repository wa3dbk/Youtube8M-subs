00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
hey guys this is CG animator and today

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.340 
hey guys this is CG animator and today
I'm<00:00:02.970> going<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.179> show<00:00:03.389> you<00:00:03.449> how<00:00:03.540> to<00:00:03.750> record<00:00:04.080> game

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
I'm going to show you how to record game

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.000 
I'm going to show you how to record game
physics<00:00:04.620> in<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.700> game<00:00:05.879> engine<00:00:06.089> to<00:00:06.420> eyeball

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.010 
physics in a game engine to eyeball

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.190 
physics in a game engine to eyeball
pretty<00:00:08.010> simple<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:08.610> what<00:00:09.389> you<00:00:09.540> see<00:00:09.570> how<00:00:10.050> it

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
pretty simple and what you see how it

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.049 
pretty simple and what you see how it
works<00:00:10.349> you<00:00:10.920> should<00:00:11.070> have<00:00:11.190> no<00:00:11.340> problem<00:00:11.370> so

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
works you should have no problem so

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.480 
works you should have no problem so

tutorials and more videos ok so let's
get<00:00:23.640> started<00:00:24.410> so<00:00:25.849> if<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:27.090> want<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.359> record<00:00:27.630> the

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
get started so if you want to record the

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.359 
get started so if you want to record the
physics<00:00:28.230> then<00:00:28.410> you're<00:00:28.529> gonna<00:00:28.619> need<00:00:28.859> objects

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
physics then you're gonna need objects

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.820 
physics then you're gonna need objects
to<00:00:29.490> fall<00:00:29.519> on<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.029> each<00:00:30.150> other<00:00:30.359> or<00:00:30.599> fall<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.619> I'm

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
to fall on to each other or fall so I'm

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.340 
to fall on to each other or fall so I'm
just<00:00:32.009> going<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.219> use<00:00:32.399> dominoes<00:00:32.989> see<00:00:33.989> people

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
just going to use dominoes see people

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.010 
just going to use dominoes see people
like<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:35.460> we're<00:00:36.030> gonna<00:00:36.149> model<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.630> domino

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
like that so we're gonna model a domino

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.680 
like that so we're gonna model a domino
real<00:00:37.200> quick<00:00:37.410> it's<00:00:38.340> really<00:00:38.489> easy<00:00:38.820> just<00:00:39.000> take<00:00:39.629> a

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
real quick it's really easy just take a

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.900 
real quick it's really easy just take a
few<00:00:40.020> press<00:00:40.379> s<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.710> scale<00:00:41.250> X<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.719> x<00:00:42.870> axis<00:00:43.020> and

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
few press s to scale X on the x axis and

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.110 
few press s to scale X on the x axis and
pull<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.000> towards<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.270> center<00:00:46.910> and<00:00:47.910> that's

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
pull it towards the center and that's

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.830 
pull it towards the center and that's
pretty<00:00:48.360> good<00:00:48.539> make<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.079> little<00:00:49.260> thinner<00:00:49.500> sy

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
pretty good make a little thinner sy

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.350 
pretty good make a little thinner sy
that's<00:00:51.840> good<00:00:52.489> now<00:00:53.489> bring<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.820> up<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.180> base

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
that's good now bring it up to the base

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.600 
that's good now bring it up to the base
just<00:00:55.050> press<00:00:55.199> 0<00:00:55.230> g<00:00:55.579> z<00:00:56.579> 1

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
just press 0 g z 1

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.740 
just press 0 g z 1
there<00:00:59.240> you<00:00:59.330> go<00:00:59.480> and<00:00:59.810> let's<00:01:00.650> give<00:01:00.830> it<00:01:00.860> a<00:01:00.980> floor

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
there you go and let's give it a floor

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.000 
there you go and let's give it a floor
the<00:01:02.750> space<00:01:03.080> add<00:01:03.710> mesh<00:01:04.190> plane<00:01:05.650> scale<00:01:06.650> it<00:01:06.800> up<00:01:06.890> a

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
the space add mesh plane scale it up a

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.040 
the space add mesh plane scale it up a
little<00:01:07.190> bit<00:01:07.310> let's<00:01:08.000> turn<00:01:08.270> it<00:01:08.390> red<00:01:08.540> so<00:01:08.810> we<00:01:08.900> can

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
little bit let's turn it red so we can

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.380 
little bit let's turn it red so we can
see<00:01:09.260> it<00:01:09.380> better

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.570 

you<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:13.110> go<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.350> them<00:01:13.620> she'll<00:01:13.860> stab<00:01:14.190> let's

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
you just go to them she'll stab let's

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.780 
you just go to them she'll stab let's
add<00:01:14.790> new<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.240> trend<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.570> red<00:01:16.580> let's<00:01:17.580> do<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
add new and trend is red let's do the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.149 
add new and trend is red let's do the
same<00:01:18.030> for<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.810> domino<00:01:19.260> except<00:01:19.650> with<00:01:19.770> premise

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
same for the domino except with premise

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.430 
same for the domino except with premise
one<00:01:20.400> blew<00:01:23.119> up

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.850 

silver

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
silver

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.720 
silver
sleep<00:01:29.520> before<00:01:29.730> a<00:01:30.000> little<00:01:30.210> bigger<00:01:30.920> SSX<00:01:34.730> so

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
sleep before a little bigger SSX so

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.060 
sleep before a little bigger SSX so
let's<00:01:36.000> make<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.570> properties<00:01:37.080> for<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.380> domino

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
let's make the properties for the domino

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.930 
let's make the properties for the domino
to<00:01:38.130> fall<00:01:38.280> down<00:01:38.610> go<00:01:39.890> to<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.130> latter<00:01:41.400> tab<00:01:41.730> here

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
to fall down go to the latter tab here

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.090 
to fall down go to the latter tab here
the<00:01:42.660> static<00:01:43.430> and<00:01:44.430> go<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.700> rigid<00:01:45.210> body<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:46.100> this

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
the static and go to rigid body and this

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.250 
the static and go to rigid body and this
makes<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:48.090> reacts<00:01:48.420> visits<00:01:49.080> in<00:01:49.200> a

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
makes it so that it reacts visits in a

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.570 
makes it so that it reacts visits in a
game<00:01:49.440> engine<00:01:49.760> but<00:01:50.760> now<00:01:51.090> from<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.479> crispy<00:01:52.580> it

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
game engine but now from the crispy it

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.600 
game engine but now from the crispy it
falls<00:01:53.880> now<00:01:54.090> but<00:01:54.840> if<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.680> look<00:01:56.100> then<00:01:56.580> you

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
falls now but if you look then you

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.840 
falls now but if you look then you
should<00:01:56.910> like<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:58.280> falls<00:01:59.280> through<00:01:59.760> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
should like this falls through the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.890 
should like this falls through the
middle

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
middle

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.410 
middle
it<00:02:02.470> stops<00:02:02.920> in<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.160> middle<00:02:03.250> there<00:02:03.610> well<00:02:04.030> that's

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
it stops in the middle there well that's

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.540 
it stops in the middle there well that's
a<00:02:04.510> bad<00:02:04.660> example<00:02:05.130> make<00:02:06.130> sure<00:02:06.160> you<00:02:06.430> can<00:02:06.580> see

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.700 

so<00:02:10.150> and<00:02:10.510> that's<00:02:10.690> a<00:02:10.810> problem<00:02:11.080> you<00:02:11.530> know<00:02:11.650> you

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
so and that's a problem you know you

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.200 
so and that's a problem you know you
can't<00:02:12.040> have<00:02:12.130> you<00:02:12.220> gained<00:02:12.460> reacting<00:02:13.060> like<00:02:13.150> that

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
can't have you gained reacting like that

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.590 
can't have you gained reacting like that
an<00:02:13.780> easy<00:02:14.620> way<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:14.890> fix<00:02:15.250> that<00:02:15.490> is<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:16.090> give<00:02:16.480> it

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
an easy way to fix that is to give it

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.560 
an easy way to fix that is to give it
down<00:02:16.900> if<00:02:17.800> you<00:02:18.220> want<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.460> see<00:02:18.670> certain<00:02:19.240> balance

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
down if you want to see certain balance

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.280 
down if you want to see certain balance
all<00:02:20.020> you<00:02:20.230> have<00:02:20.320> to<00:02:20.410> do<00:02:20.530> this<00:02:20.560> game<00:02:21.460> up<00:02:21.820> here<00:02:22.290> go

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
all you have to do this game up here go

you know there's come on that's all

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.090 
you know there's come on that's all
triangle<00:02:52.010> mesh<00:02:52.240> but<00:02:53.240> that's<00:02:54.230> for<00:02:54.440> this<00:02:54.590> right

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
triangle mesh but that's for this right

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:02.350

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.990 
now is box so cuz all g I'm just going
to<00:03:02.420> restore<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.780> settings<00:03:02.960> and<00:03:03.700> now<00:03:04.700> that<00:03:04.910> we

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
to restore the settings and now that we

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.660 
to restore the settings and now that we
have<00:03:05.030> this<00:03:05.450> we're<00:03:05.990> gonna<00:03:06.170> duplicate<00:03:06.560> it<00:03:06.920> then

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
have this we're gonna duplicate it then

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.950 
have this we're gonna duplicate it then
put<00:03:08.150> more<00:03:10.570> dominoes<00:03:11.570> tha<00:03:12.280> show<00:03:13.540> cook<00:03:14.540> a<00:03:14.570> front

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
put more dominoes tha show cook a front

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.199 
put more dominoes tha show cook a front
view

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.820 

and<00:03:18.209> make<00:03:18.599> sure<00:03:18.629> before<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:19.170> duplicate<00:03:19.709> you

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
and make sure before you duplicate you

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.619 
and make sure before you duplicate you
have<00:03:19.950> all<00:03:20.069> these<00:03:20.190> settings<00:03:20.549> on<00:03:20.730> for<00:03:21.090> or<00:03:21.420> else

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
have all these settings on for or else

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.649 
have all these settings on for or else
you'll<00:03:22.319> have<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.940> apply<00:03:23.940> these<00:03:24.000> settings<00:03:24.450> to

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659 
you'll have to apply these settings to

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:25.880 
you'll have to apply these settings to
each<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:24.930> every<00:03:25.110> one<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.440> that's<00:03:25.620> annoying

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
each and every one and that's annoying

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.970 
each and every one and that's annoying
so<00:03:26.819> I'll<00:03:26.909> press<00:03:27.030> shift<00:03:27.360> be<00:03:27.629> and<00:03:27.959> then<00:03:28.860> the

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
so I'll press shift be and then the

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.949 
so I'll press shift be and then the
specs<00:03:29.250> up<00:03:29.519> for<00:03:29.730> along<00:03:29.909> the<00:03:30.030> x-axis<00:03:30.330> and<00:03:30.750> move

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
specs up for along the x-axis and move

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.199 
specs up for along the x-axis and move
it<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.319> right<00:03:31.349> about<00:03:31.650> there<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.819> so<00:03:33.090> that

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
it to the right about there and so that

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.680 
it to the right about there and so that
we<00:03:33.329> can<00:03:33.450> have<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.720> Domino's<00:03:34.110> react<00:03:35.540> move<00:03:36.540> it

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
we can have the Domino's react move it

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.240 
we can have the Domino's react move it
over<00:03:37.010> about<00:03:38.010> their<00:03:38.400> straight<00:03:39.180> up<00:03:39.360> and<00:03:40.250> we're

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
over about their straight up and we're

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.670 
over about their straight up and we're
going<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.430> use<00:03:41.579> this<00:03:41.730> red<00:03:41.940> line<00:03:41.970> as<00:03:42.450> our<00:03:42.750> floor

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
going to use this red line as our floor

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.910 
going to use this red line as our floor

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
X move it over 50 X DX that's good one

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.260 
X move it over 50 X DX that's good one
more

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.090 

I<00:04:04.360> fair<00:04:05.520> now<00:04:07.380> I'm<00:04:08.380> going<00:04:08.560> to<00:04:08.620> fix<00:04:08.740> the<00:04:08.890> lighting

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
I fair now I'm going to fix the lighting

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.360 
I fair now I'm going to fix the lighting
that's<00:04:09.520> all<00:04:09.730> disease<00:04:10.090> and<00:04:11.100> to<00:04:12.100> go<00:04:12.220> on<00:04:12.250> the

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
that's all disease and to go on the

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.580 
that's all disease and to go on the
textured<00:04:12.700> month<00:04:12.880> and<00:04:13.660> it<00:04:13.960> can<00:04:14.110> use<00:04:14.230> one<00:04:14.440> more

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
textured month and it can use one more

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.560 
textured month and it can use one more
lap<00:04:14.770> so<00:04:15.130> just<00:04:15.520> put<00:04:15.760> the<00:04:15.880> lamp<00:04:16.090> in<00:04:16.239> there<00:04:16.420> should

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
lap so just put the lamp in there should

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.360 
lap so just put the lamp in there should
be<00:04:17.280> move<00:04:18.280> it<00:04:18.400> over<00:04:18.489> a<00:04:18.670> little<00:04:18.959> nsp<00:04:19.959> good<00:04:20.340> so<00:04:21.340> now

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
be move it over a little nsp good so now

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:28.990 
be move it over a little nsp good so now
if<00:04:21.790> you<00:04:21.910> press<00:04:22.090> p

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.630 

so<00:04:29.570> the<00:04:29.960> physics<00:04:30.170> happens<00:04:30.740> and<00:04:31.040> it<00:04:31.130> looks<00:04:31.430> very

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
so the physics happens and it looks very

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.790 
so the physics happens and it looks very
good<00:04:31.790> was<00:04:32.420> pretty<00:04:32.630> normal<00:04:32.810> I'm<00:04:33.290> going<00:04:33.560> to<00:04:33.620> turn

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
good was pretty normal I'm going to turn

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.880 
good was pretty normal I'm going to turn
off<00:04:33.830> the<00:04:34.190> shelf<00:04:34.580> physics<00:04:34.900> visualization<00:04:35.900> now

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
off the shelf physics visualization now

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.620 
off the shelf physics visualization now
but<00:04:37.250> if<00:04:37.400> we<00:04:37.520> press<00:04:37.730> all<00:04:37.940> day<00:04:38.180> to<00:04:38.240> play<00:04:38.480> the

but if we press all day to play the

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.500 
but if we press all day to play the
animation<00:04:39.370> nothing<00:04:40.370> happens<00:04:40.760> so<00:04:41.030> if<00:04:41.210> you<00:04:41.360> want
