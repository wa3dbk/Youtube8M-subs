00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
nendroid okay so let's take a look at

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.290 
nendroid okay so let's take a look at
the<00:01:47.800> stand<00:01:48.099> first<00:01:48.840> as<00:01:49.840> I<00:01:50.800> mentioned<00:01:51.429> this<00:01:51.910> is

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
the stand first as I mentioned this is

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.469 
the stand first as I mentioned this is
the<00:01:52.869> older<00:01:53.200> nindroids<00:01:53.679> then<00:01:54.000> about<00:01:55.000> this<00:01:55.179> must

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
the older nindroids then about this must

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.540 
the older nindroids then about this must
be<00:01:55.660> really<00:01:56.470> old<00:01:56.500> one<00:01:56.890> I've<00:01:57.009> never<00:01:57.190> seen<00:01:57.429> it

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
be really old one I've never seen it

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.290 
be really old one I've never seen it
like<00:01:57.640> this<00:01:57.729> so<00:01:58.720> it<00:01:58.750> basically<00:01:59.259> has<00:01:59.619> the<00:02:00.300> main

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
like this so it basically has the main

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.969 
like this so it basically has the main
stand<00:02:01.840> piece<00:02:02.110> and<00:02:02.530> then<00:02:03.340> a<00:02:03.700> little<00:02:04.239> peg<00:02:04.599> and<00:02:06.149> a

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
stand piece and then a little peg and a

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.050 
stand piece and then a little peg and a
holder<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.459> holding<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:09.849> droid<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:12.550> is<00:02:12.849> easy

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
holder the holding the droid it is easy

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.410 
holder the holding the droid it is easy
to<00:02:13.390> attach<00:02:14.190> but<00:02:15.190> I<00:02:15.220> like<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.849> newer<00:02:16.060> stands

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
to attach but I like the newer stands

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.630 
to attach but I like the newer stands
better<00:02:16.629> of<00:02:16.989> course<00:02:17.020> because<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:18.280> goes<00:02:18.460> into

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
better of course because it goes into

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.520 
better of course because it goes into
the<00:02:18.790> back<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.300> it<00:02:19.540> holds<00:02:19.840> them<00:02:20.140> better<00:02:20.320> and

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
the back and it holds them better and

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.600 
the back and it holds them better and
you<00:02:20.590> don't<00:02:20.770> knock<00:02:20.920> them<00:02:21.160> over

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
you don't knock them over

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.480 
you don't knock them over

what's<00:03:03.490> interesting<00:03:03.790> about<00:03:04.060> this<00:03:04.420> is<00:03:04.660> that

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
what's interesting about this is that

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.130 
what's interesting about this is that
the<00:03:06.250> hand<00:03:06.460> pieces<00:03:06.640> are<00:03:07.090> completely<00:03:07.690> attached

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
the hand pieces are completely attached

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.590 
the hand pieces are completely attached
arm<00:03:08.620> but<00:03:09.250> then<00:03:09.370> your<00:03:09.520> nindroids<00:03:10.030> they<00:03:10.300> come

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
arm but then your nindroids they come

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.390 
arm but then your nindroids they come
with<00:03:10.810> a<00:03:11.020> bunch<00:03:11.200> of<00:03:11.470> different<00:03:11.650> hand<00:03:12.190> pieces

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
with a bunch of different hand pieces

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.310 
with a bunch of different hand pieces
that<00:03:12.880> you<00:03:13.030> can<00:03:13.180> attach<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.780> different<00:03:14.110> arms

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
that you can attach the different arms

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.380 
that you can attach the different arms
so<00:03:15.160> I<00:03:15.220> think<00:03:15.370> it's<00:03:15.490> interesting<00:03:15.700> with<00:03:16.090> older

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.110 
so I think it's interesting with older
nindroids<00:03:16.840> don't<00:03:17.140> have<00:03:17.440> that<00:03:17.910> instead<00:03:18.910> they

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
nindroids don't have that instead they

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.410 
nindroids don't have that instead they
just<00:03:19.150> gave<00:03:19.540> separate<00:03:20.320> arm<00:03:20.440> pieces<00:03:20.760> with<00:03:21.760> hands

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.060 
out I think you're supposed to take them
out<00:05:30.919> first<00:05:31.099> and<00:05:31.340> then<00:05:31.400> take<00:05:31.610> the<00:05:31.729> hair<00:05:31.909> out<00:05:32.030> but

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
out first and then take the hair out but

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.649 
out first and then take the hair out but
you<00:05:34.070> can<00:05:34.340> still<00:05:34.580> slide<00:05:34.849> the<00:05:35.030> hair<00:05:35.210> out<00:05:35.360> so<00:05:35.630> I

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659 
you can still slide the hair out so I

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:41.430 
you can still slide the hair out so I
just<00:05:35.870> did<00:05:36.229> that<00:05:36.820> but<00:05:37.820> these<00:05:38.030> are<00:05:38.240> removable

and<00:06:03.870> there<00:06:04.229> we<00:06:04.319> go<00:06:04.440> okay<00:06:05.250> one<00:06:05.430> last<00:06:05.639> thing<00:06:05.819> I

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
and there we go okay one last thing I

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.629 
and there we go okay one last thing I
want<00:06:06.210> to<00:06:06.300> know<00:06:06.509> is<00:06:06.810> this<00:06:07.680> stand<00:06:08.159> the<00:06:08.400> reason

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 
want to know is this stand the reason

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.159 
want to know is this stand the reason
why<00:06:08.699> it<00:06:08.789> was<00:06:08.909> different<00:06:09.120> is<00:06:09.479> because<00:06:09.990> it

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
why it was different is because it

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:14.839 
why it was different is because it
actually<00:06:10.620> holds<00:06:10.949> her<00:06:12.139> skirt<00:06:13.139> piece<00:06:13.440> so<00:06:14.310> you

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:14.849 
actually holds her skirt piece so you

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:18.170 
actually holds her skirt piece so you
just<00:06:15.389> place<00:06:15.659> her<00:06:15.810> in<00:06:15.990> right<00:06:16.229> there<00:06:16.470> and<00:06:17.180> hold

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
just place her in right there and hold

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.740

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
but again it's really easy to kind of

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.110
