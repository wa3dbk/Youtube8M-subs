00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
 Do you dream of conquering your professional space? 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.790
 on friday 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.630
 the market wants 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.799
 - all of you 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:10.529
 if ps trust 

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:12.669
 Policemen were attacked is the best 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:18.230
 and close to you sign up already this quest all with a twist 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.340
 What is the hurry of the students right now? 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.410
 the December technical discipline applied to the safety course of the 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.600
 job 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.870
 I'm professional for men 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.680
 and say I'll go to you 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.810
 has an excellent performance 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.680
 in your activities 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.640
 during 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.720
 the unfolding of our classes 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.830
 told you explained that people are born with the gift of china 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.760
 manages to pass on paper without great effort everything that 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.200
 imagined 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.420
 others feel safe to do in five states 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.680
 and avoid situations that require this type of expression 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.210
 no matter in which of the groups you fit 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.409
 to successfully follow this module and technical drawing 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.640
 applied to safety at work 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.370
 the dam reasons that justify our confidence in its performance 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.960
 the first one 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.200
 is that the unemployment that is unique is different from the artistic drawing 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.960
 you do not have to be a genius drawing like lÃ©o on the second 20 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.300
 to have a good result in the recent 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.600
 the second 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.030
 is that this course is not intended to make you a designer 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.370
 it is true that you will learn some notions of graphical representation 

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.349
 of the technical drawing 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.039
 but the larger goal 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:16.779
 is that at the end of the course you will be able to understand 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.039
 ground floor 

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:21.529
 we identify relative component 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:24.559
 the promotion of health and safety at work 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:27.129
 the third 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.769
 is that our classes are organized in paulo sequence 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.889
 If you're going to start the study? 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:34.779
 for very simple subjects 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:37.639
 demonstrated step-by-step 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:41.489
 gradually acquire more complex knowledge 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:46.280
 that require application in a year of previous knowledge 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:50.879
 in this module 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.129
 we are going to learn the following contents concept evolution 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.339
 historical of the german dax 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:58.109
 project technician 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:02.089
 2 is a flight reading reading interpretation project of collecting in plants 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:05.149
 take the following competency 

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:08.499
 know the concepts and study without technician 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:11.099
 and security project 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.029
 to make myself familiar with reading too 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:17.519
 interpretation 2 in curicica used in architecture plants 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.269
 applied to the work safety course 

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:25.329
 the subjects dealt with nations or springs of lessons 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.719
 are also shown on television 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:32.609
 the director watch the classes on TV and then read the text in the handout 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:35.360
 the squid is registered 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.950
 written in a language 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.329
 simple and with the concern to convey the important issues 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:46.359
 reading interpretation of the technical drawing darci make clearer by 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:47.699
 cent 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.699
 a fundamental part of our formulas are the exercises 

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:54.419
 to learn how to read and interpret December 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:55.299
 technician 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.299
 we need to do a lot of exercises 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.099
 only then do we gain confidence in what we have just known 

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:06.039
 we avoided preparing for the next class 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.590
 in case you can not do some exercise 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.569
 do not get discouraged 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.169
 I searched the content again 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:16.099
 until then by the bank 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.049
 and after they redo the exercise 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.990
 if they still persist with life says proc 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.300
 the help of his 'teacher' 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.509
 he is prepared to take 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.610
 your doubts 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.529
 sorry now we are going to make an introduction 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:36.529
 from the dams to the 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:40.929
 technical information on how to award 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.669
 can be transmitted 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.610
 from one person to another 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.610
 through the written word 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:51.120
 the girl 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.949
 however that it stays healthy becomes more and more complex 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:58.449
 by detail view the engineer 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:04:59.840
 the project is 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.999
 the technician the designer 

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:03.219
 I gear 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:07.619
 need to use methods and annotations for proper description 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.800
 a perspective 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.279
 in the photo 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:14.589
 would help describe the building 

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:20.590
 only a technical drawing can present a description of the work 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.349
 much fuller 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:25.650
 in the floor was technical floor 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.219
 since small by the universal language 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:33.590
 which provides all the information that the engineer the designer works on sheila 

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:36.229
 peace what phase we need to know 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:37.949
 the reading of unemployment 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:42.400
 is the process of interpreting lines and traced the 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.240
 to form a mental image 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.240
 however for edification it is in reality 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.629
 December technical training and reading that includes not only the 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:59.590
 knowledge of certain basic principles of representation in one or 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.249
 more lists 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:05.629
 I also the development of skills due to the galiza floor the 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:07.289
 execution process 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.129
 of the building 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:10.749
 in our case 

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:14.609
 the technician needs to develop understanding of conventions 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.479
 or universal standards 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:20.479
 symbols and signs and other techniques used 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:24.710
 must also develop some fundamental mutability 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:30.840
 drawn from pockets and tastes are sketches quoted with shape measurements 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.210
 what with a pencil and paper 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.210
 officially registered. 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:38.490
 in the western gaucho 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:39.960
 what is the draft 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.949
 to relativize dimensions of notations 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:45.949
 other detail needed for construction 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.569
 elements common to all drawings 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:52.110
 can be the coach 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.509
 when analyzed 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:56.509
 presents lines and experts of different thicknesses 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:06:58.930
 these lines 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.860
 combined sad 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.779
 determine the way details 

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:04.869
 and size 

00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:06.259
 no object 

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:07.770
 of a building 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.999
 this combination of lines 

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:13.389
 when representing both of an object 

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:15.839
 it's called sight 

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:20.479
 for a more precise description of the object thus represented 

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:24.149
 dimensions and notations will be included in china 

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:28.770
 the fundamental principles of reading and interpretation of technical drawing 

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.999
 will be presented below 

00:07:31.999 --> 00:07:36.610
 obeying the following order distant lineages 

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.610
 donations and notes 

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:43.719
 no sugar at the next norris meeting 

00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:44.840
 we will try 

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.309
 two characters 

00:07:47.309 --> 00:07:49.939
 writing ssput elizaga in technical drawing
