00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.880
 hey people and there is one now 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.700
 small guide like your motorcycle 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.870
 best winter gets and the first 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.940
 away you will then immediately to the gas station 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.970
 where he once completely filled the tank 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.470
 makes what has the consequence that the 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.789
 tank Russians, not everyone can no longer 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.920
 has a tank and the next thing you 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.099
 make it once the air pressure 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.599
 around 0.5 bar and that then ensures that 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.599
 she does not get a square ride 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.210
 next would have to 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.739
 is once completely clean and 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.680
 a really good rheingau of the vans 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.760
 At the time, take care of s100 3 only afterwards 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.800
 that really completely once 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.480
 is washed off because then pretty much 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.269
 react aggressively to some parts 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.159
 So can make the coast completely clean 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.890
 not like me because we are already victorious 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.510
 I have such a small plaster lamp and 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.070
 Let's clean up the chain as well 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.409
 completely complete the chain once 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.360
 Clean and pinion and the front 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:05.530
 remove the pinion cover and 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.009
 completely the puzzle in front 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.009
 clean up 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.390
 if your box in a complete 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.970
 dry and clean and is derived 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.580
 or the other way server and dry and off 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.470
 device is then you can start with it 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.890
 All the chrome and stainless steel parts too 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.060
 conserve and I would not 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.590
 do advertising but there are each 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.060
 lots of good stuff what you easy then 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.560
 also with and what then ensures that 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.560
 just keep all parts are preserved 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.000
 next, take care of that 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.830
 Gasoline from the carburetor arrives and at 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.670
 You usually have older machines 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:53.050
 here on an exhibition or on 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.100
 reserve settings and sets 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.130
 now just such a thing 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.530
 gasoline tap on office respectively 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.090
 that you shut down the gasoline and then 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.420
 was the simple way out of the box 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.860
 and with that you have explained your carburetor 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.450
 and with newer machines must therefore 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.340
 do it manually then there's down 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.060
 mostly a screw was the gasoline 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.060
 can drain 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.710
 is the battery remove and they are 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.340
 actually almost always under the 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.530
 cover and these would either have to 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.940
 connect a charger or her 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.280
 buy a battery trainer like that 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.670
 actually do not cost that much most of the time 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.050
 between 30 and 50 euros and that should 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.730
 actually for the battery in the 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.230
 winter then completely uploaded once 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.330
 is being downloaded again and that is 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.550
 alternately so that the battery stops 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.550
 never come into the team leadership 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.600
 a whole 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.920
 the question is before the moth 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.130
 or after the moth 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.710
 and actually quite clearly before that 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.180
 Winter make the oil change because the 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.680
 whole rest backward around here 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.570
 swim and then sit down somewhere 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.980
 firmly and therefore, of course, now completely 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.060
 clearly better that one before the einmotten 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.060
 makes an oil change 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.969
 we come up jacking and in 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.290
 in principle, it would really only have to be 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:18.209
 Pay attention that both wheels are in the air 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.549
 float so that you no plates from 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.109
 someday either you have one 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.090
 HauptstÃ¤nder then you have to stop for it 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.010
 make the internet the front wheel 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.390
 also often plays afterwards or you 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.400
 Do the three every four weeks once 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.209
 mature around 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.730
 and if you only have a side stand 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.310
 then he either stands up and moves 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.189
 motorcycle every three four weeks or her 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.599
 buys one on construction sites may the 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:42.209
 Do not cost too much 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.500
 Or you make a construction 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.420
 made of wood and placed under the 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.790
 Engine block allowing both wheels in front 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.790
 So stand behind and in front 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:04.180
 it is cold so the tarpaulin and 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.710
 Although if you have a chic garage 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.990
 then actually enough an old one 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.070
 bed sheet and in my case about not 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.250
 such a poor pig that I still have 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.810
 not even when the bed sheet can afford 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.989
 fun aside as I said one 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.430
 bed sheet right out completely if 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.380
 but new motorcycle outside 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.459
 wintering then you have to urgently 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.740
 Be careful that you really have one 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.600
 breathable planners so have the 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.880
 usually cost the 80 100 euro 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.470
 and then transported the 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.030
 moisture from the inside out 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.910
 Make sure you have one 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:37.780
 breathable plan and have ohso still 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.520
 which some think is really great 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.300
 he would be his motorcycle but especially 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:48.450
 but does not do that so expensive 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.450
 motorcycle absolutely not good that 's all 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.270
 there 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:26.409
 In addition, therefore, it has come to us 

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:26.409
 destroy without suits they are naked
