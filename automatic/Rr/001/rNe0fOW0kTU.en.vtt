00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
these over so there's actually quite a

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.700 
these over so there's actually quite a
lot<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.820> cross-pollination<00:00:57.089> of<00:00:57.899> what

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
lot of cross-pollination of what

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.619 
lot of cross-pollination of what
elements<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.160> can<00:00:59.190> borrow<00:00:59.460> from<00:00:59.879> one<00:01:00.089> ERA<00:01:00.300> and

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
elements you can borrow from one ERA and

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.049 
elements you can borrow from one ERA and
use<00:01:00.960> them<00:01:01.110> in<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.290> next<00:01:01.320> one<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.399> there<00:01:02.969> was

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
use them in the next one so there was

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.939 
use them in the next one so there was
actually<00:01:03.390> trial<00:01:03.659> and<00:01:04.019> error<00:01:04.199> going<00:01:04.680> back<00:01:04.830> and

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
actually trial and error going back and

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.430 
actually trial and error going back and
forth<00:01:05.129> three<00:01:05.309> sketching<00:01:05.899> etc<00:01:06.899> he<00:01:07.140> was<00:01:07.259> very

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
forth three sketching etc he was very

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.070 
forth three sketching etc he was very
much<00:01:07.710> an<00:01:08.070> experiment<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.270> think<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:10.049> I

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
much an experiment that I think that I

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.359 
much an experiment that I think that I
was<00:01:10.229> lucky<00:01:10.440> enough<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.920> worked<00:01:11.100> at<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
was lucky enough that it worked at the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:30.440 
was lucky enough that it worked at the
end

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.929 

I<00:01:33.500> was<00:01:34.500> really<00:01:34.890> not<00:01:35.219> aware<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.820> could

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
I was really not aware that you could

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.359 
I was really not aware that you could
actually<00:01:36.350> use<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.380> sort<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.860> technology

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
actually use that sort of technology

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.029 
actually use that sort of technology
within<00:01:38.549> clothing<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:40.170> was<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.860> clothes

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
within clothing it was and the clothes

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.990 
within clothing it was and the clothes
are<00:01:41.219> beautiful

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
are beautiful

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.029 
are beautiful
it<00:01:42.149> wasn't<00:01:42.570> like<00:01:42.659> just<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.140> show<00:01:43.920> of

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
it wasn't like just a show of

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:45.830 
it wasn't like just a show of
showmanship<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.820> thought<00:01:45.210> they're<00:01:45.360> incredibly

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
showmanship I thought they're incredibly

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.680 
showmanship I thought they're incredibly
beautiful<00:01:46.289> pieces<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.649> there

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.840 

I<00:01:51.780> think<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.410> was<00:01:52.530> no<00:01:52.710> mean<00:01:52.950> feat<00:01:52.980> to<00:01:53.550> achieve

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
I think that was no mean feat to achieve

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.790 
I think that was no mean feat to achieve
all<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.300> with<00:01:54.540> clothes<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:55.590> was<00:01:55.680> an

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
all of that with clothes it was an

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:13.780 
all of that with clothes it was an
extraordinary<00:01:56.490> combination

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.070 

the<00:02:14.790> same<00:02:15.000> as<00:02:15.180> being<00:02:15.390> mother<00:02:15.540> stuck<00:02:15.840> with<00:02:15.990> the

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
the same as being mother stuck with the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.930 
the same as being mother stuck with the
label<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:16.500> he's<00:02:16.620> at<00:02:16.830> fashioned<00:02:17.280> buffin<00:02:17.790> that

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
label that he's at fashioned buffin that

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.970 
label that he's at fashioned buffin that
is<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.150> sort<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.390> ideas<00:02:18.930> guide<00:02:19.290> but<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:19.890> think

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
is the sort of ideas guide but I think

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.800 
is the sort of ideas guide but I think
tonight<00:02:20.310> he<00:02:20.670> proved<00:02:20.970> once<00:02:21.240> and<00:02:21.390> for<00:02:21.600> all<00:02:21.630> that

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
tonight he proved once and for all that

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.070 
tonight he proved once and for all that
