00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.730
 Hello everyone after the release of the 6 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.650
 weeks and there was a small 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.420
 misunderstanding is it true that 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.639
 comparator returned opportunity 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.350
 update blocks in front of you let's 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.420
 try to understand me here 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.340
 give out the comparator if we serve 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.080
 the signal then the distributor starts to work 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.510
 it would seem really an update 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.310
 returned but it is not quite true 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.980
 In fact, the comparator updates the status 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.929
 redstone in front of him at his exit 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.300
 this can be seen in this 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.950
 the example here is my distributor constantly, 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.380
 that is, will respond to all 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.550
 changing blocks around is very easy 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.040
 this can be checked with 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.809
 repeater switchable repeater and 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.789
 as you can see the object fly away 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.710
 there is a distributor reacting to a number from me 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.079
 the comparator is located but it is not 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.300
 makes the dispenser work even if 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.550
 we comparator switches then distributed at 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.620
 the update does not work accordingly 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.750
 This block is being updated. 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.609
 before the comparator it's even better 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.890
 see on this example here i have 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.449
 similarity bada upper piston we will have 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.470
 work right away because here 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.330
 paved roadstone 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.790
 and the lower pistons will play the role 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.240
 bada turn on extends only the top 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.710
 porsche 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.020
 despite the fact that the bottom porsche 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.520
 is bodom please post 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.960
 here the lower piston unit also 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.090
 advances for the purity of the experiment 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.310
 take the following place our 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.990
 the comparator next to the piston that is to 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.450
 he is working directly on 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.729
 porsche turn on and back out 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.979
 only top send update 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.820
 no blocks in front of the comparator 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.590
 and finally 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.270
 interesting such an experiment in what 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.340
 upgrade advantage over 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.229
 standard mode comparator left u 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.240
 i'm located distributions working in 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.640
 update mode on the right hand 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.979
 working just from the comparator in both 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.500
 the creator of my fasting wool 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.899
 further from his distributor I have 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.640
 feedback and while there will always be 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.350
 that is, while in the left distributor and we 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.840
 there are items this mechanism will 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.149
 work let's run it and check 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.740
 that we will succeed I already know that the left 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.509
 distributions work faster 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.759
 it is de-energized and we can see 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.560
 how many times faster than normal 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.659
 mode operation of the comparator 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.270
 now we must end the store 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.400
 by the way ended we'll see in the left 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.130
 Distributors are empty and right 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.200
 distributors we have 20 items that is in 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.450
 update mode the dispenser is running 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.400
 faster than just comparator mode 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.380
 that is, the comparator only responds to 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.810
 the update of the signal is so interesting 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.910
 experiment hope that this question is about 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.610
 comparator area volume update blocks 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.440
 in front of you have disappeared they can not 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.480
 only fixed bug 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.550
 caused sticking of chain signals before 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.100
 a comparator on this for today all 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.569
 thank you very much for your attention do not forget
