00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.590
 metallized with a soft brush from 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.250
 eye shadow on the entire eyelid 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.250

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.550
 on the eyebrow arch 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.710

 metallic and with a brush from 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.759

 correspondence of the natural fold 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.899

 movable eyelid supporting one 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.770
 sponge on the cheek so that i 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.260
 excess glitter does not fall on 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:00.750
 face wetting a little angled brush 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.460

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.549
 matching eyeliner line 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.840

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.540
 always with black and the brush 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.369
 angled 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.259
 we design a line also in the area 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.939
 lower starting from the inside 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.420
 of the eye and remaining however a little 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.350
 detached from the lash line 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.350

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.510

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:42.480

 shiny scarlet and we fill the lips 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.420
 helping us with the special brush in 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.600

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.600
 smudges

 like me to spread some glitter 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.510
 along the lashes that with every beat 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.860
