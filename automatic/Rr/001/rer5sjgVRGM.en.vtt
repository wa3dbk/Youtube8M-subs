reviewing the new oh ye correct me if

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.840 
reviewing the new oh ye correct me if
that<00:00:19.140> pronunciations<00:00:19.890> roll<00:00:20.070> out<00:00:20.220> but<00:00:20.340> no<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.550> do

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
that pronunciations roll out but no I do

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.590 
that pronunciations roll out but no I do
you<00:00:21.029> see<00:00:21.300> it

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
you see it

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.740 
you see it
LTE<00:00:22.380> CPE<00:00:24.260> b-59<00:00:25.260> 3<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:26.730> come<00:00:27.330> back<00:00:27.449> in<00:00:27.630> two

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
LTE CPE b-59 3 so come back in two

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.130 
LTE CPE b-59 3 so come back in two
minutes

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
minutes

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.870 
minutes
once<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.410> put<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.740> box<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.189> I'll<00:00:29.340> show<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.640> how

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
once I put the box and I'll show you how

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.160 
once I put the box and I'll show you how
fast<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.330> goes<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:32.180> guess<00:00:33.180> rate<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:33.750> we've<00:00:33.899> gotta

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
fast it goes I guess rate so we've gotta

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.530 
fast it goes I guess rate so we've gotta
save<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.590> box<00:00:34.800> now<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.309> basically<00:00:36.059> as<00:00:36.390> you

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
save the box now and basically as you

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.110 
save the box now and basically as you
can<00:00:36.660> see<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.370> you've<00:00:38.370> got<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.579> normal<00:00:38.940> sort

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
can see and you've got the normal sort

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.180 
can see and you've got the normal sort
of<00:00:39.210> vapor<00:00:39.629> indicators<00:00:40.379> WLAN<00:00:41.129> indicators<00:00:41.850> and

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
of vapor indicators WLAN indicators and

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.330 
of vapor indicators WLAN indicators and
WPS<00:00:44.190> telephone<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.300> modes<00:00:45.899> I'm<00:00:46.890> guessing

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
WPS telephone and modes I'm guessing

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.860 
WPS telephone and modes I'm guessing
that<00:00:47.430> these<00:00:47.550> lights<00:00:47.789> will<00:00:47.940> come<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:48.450> basically

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that these lights will come on basically

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.529 
that these lights will come on basically
when<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.110> fire<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:50.489> Box<00:00:50.700> up<00:00:50.969> we've<00:00:51.360> got<00:00:51.390> a

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
when I fire the the Box up we've got a

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.869 
when I fire the the Box up we've got a
signal<00:00:51.989> strength<00:00:52.260> indicator<00:00:52.440> which<00:00:53.070> well<00:00:53.730> I

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
signal strength indicator which well I

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.520 
signal strength indicator which well I
mean<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.360> will<00:00:54.510> do<00:00:54.660> what<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.930> says<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.260> tent

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
mean it will do what it says in the tent

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.549 
mean it will do what it says in the tent
and<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:56.610> went<00:00:56.820> down<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.149> my<00:00:57.690> local<00:00:57.840> shop<00:00:58.109> that

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
and I went down to my local shop that

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.229 
and I went down to my local shop that
doesn't<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.039> lot<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.730> you<00:01:00.000> could<00:01:00.120> go

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
doesn't a lot of it for you you could go

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.970 
doesn't a lot of it for you you could go
to<00:01:00.300> three<00:01:00.600> or<00:01:00.899> any<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.230> other<00:01:01.350> places<00:01:01.620> out

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
to three or any of the other places out

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.030 
to three or any of the other places out
there<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.609> doesn't<00:01:02.820> really<00:01:03.120> matter<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.409> was

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
there it doesn't really matter and I was

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.590 
there it doesn't really matter and I was
SEC<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.580> basically<00:01:06.060> having<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.450> have<00:01:06.540> a

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
SEC of just basically having to have a

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.090 
SEC of just basically having to have a
connection<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.350> having<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> land

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
connection and having to have a land

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.310 
connection and having to have a land
link<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.670> would<00:01:08.850> get<00:01:09.060> broadband<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:10.290> I

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
link you would get broadband so I

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.370 
link you would get broadband so I
thought<00:01:10.770> well<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.340> may<00:01:12.180> as<00:01:12.299> well<00:01:12.330> try<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.689> take

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
thought well I may as well try and take

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.280 
thought well I may as well try and take
advantage<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.010> 4G<00:01:14.400> network<00:01:14.869> well<00:01:15.869> that's

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
advantage of the 4G network well that's

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.450 
advantage of the 4G network well that's
exactly<00:01:16.439> what<00:01:16.799> I've<00:01:16.860> done<00:01:16.920> with<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> SIM<00:01:17.430> card

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
exactly what I've done with a SIM card

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.109 
exactly what I've done with a SIM card
it's<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.970> 4G<00:01:18.330> SIM<00:01:18.570> card<00:01:18.900> with<00:01:19.229> 15<00:01:19.650> gig<00:01:19.979> am<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.939> it

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
it's a 4G SIM card with 15 gig am on it

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.240 
it's a 4G SIM card with 15 gig am on it
so<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.450> cost<00:01:21.630> me<00:01:21.780> 20<00:01:22.080> pages<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.799> I'm<00:01:22.890> guessing

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
so that cost me 20 pages so I'm guessing

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.160 
so that cost me 20 pages so I'm guessing
that<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.430> will<00:01:23.820> probably<00:01:23.850> last<00:01:24.689> me<00:01:24.869> for<00:01:25.110> a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
that that will probably last me for a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.760 
that that will probably last me for a
very<00:01:25.350> month

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
very month

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.969 
very month
now<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.369> same<00:01:26.610> card<00:01:26.909> slides<00:01:27.500> simply<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.770> look

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
now the same card slides simply and look

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.230 
now the same card slides simply and look
at<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.130> front<00:01:29.340> there<00:01:29.490> nice<00:01:29.880> sort<00:01:30.180> of

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
at the front there nice sort of

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.179 
at the front there nice sort of
fastening<00:01:30.900> mechanism<00:01:31.439> there<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.829> then

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
fastening mechanism there and then

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.280 
fastening mechanism there and then
you've<00:01:32.310> got<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> load<00:01:32.610> off<00:01:32.759> button<00:01:33.210> along<00:01:34.170> the

you've got a load off button along the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.219 
you've got a load off button along the
back<00:01:34.470> we've<00:01:35.130> got<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.400> for<00:01:36.030> LAN<00:01:36.270> ports<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:37.079> LAN

fired the box up and then need to

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.350 
fired the box up and then need to
connect<00:02:28.770> anything<00:02:29.160> didn't<00:02:29.520> need<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.640> do<00:02:30.210> any

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360

settings<00:02:30.930> at<00:02:31.140> all<00:02:31.350> literally<00:02:32.310> just<00:02:32.520> put<00:02:32.820> the

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
settings at all literally just put the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.170 
settings at all literally just put the
SIM<00:02:33.150> card<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.720> switched<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:34.650> on<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:36.000> seems

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
SIM card and switched it on and it seems

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.970 
SIM card and switched it on and it seems
to<00:02:36.240> be<00:02:36.330> flashing<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.900> week<00:02:37.020> wait<00:02:37.290> nicely

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
to be flashing a week wait nicely

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.460 
to be flashing a week wait nicely
there's<00:02:38.460> nothing<00:02:38.790> red<00:02:39.030> there<00:02:39.360> which<00:02:39.930> makes<00:02:40.260> me

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
there's nothing red there which makes me

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.990 
there's nothing red there which makes me
think<00:02:40.740> that<00:02:40.800> it's<00:02:40.980> probably<00:02:41.280> working<00:02:41.850> all

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
think that it's probably working all

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.230 
think that it's probably working all
right

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
right

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.040 
right
and<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:43.260> seem<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.650> have<00:02:43.770> four<00:02:44.280> bars<00:02:44.870> now<00:02:45.870> I'm

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
and I seem to have four bars now I'm

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.020 
and I seem to have four bars now I'm
just<00:02:46.350> outside<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:47.070> center<00:02:47.460> of<00:02:47.550> Milton<00:02:47.850> Keynes

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030

which<00:02:48.420> has<00:02:48.570> a<00:02:48.600> 4G<00:02:49.170> area<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:49.800> um<00:02:50.310> hopefully<00:02:50.610> I've

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
which has a 4G area so um hopefully I've

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.700 
which has a 4G area so um hopefully I've
got<00:02:51.090> some<00:02:51.270> 4G<00:02:51.690> going<00:02:51.990> on<00:02:52.140> there<00:02:52.320> because<00:02:52.500> the

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
got some 4G going on there because the

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.080 
got some 4G going on there because the
box<00:02:52.920> will<00:02:53.160> change<00:02:53.460> between<00:02:53.700> 3G<00:02:54.330> 4G<00:02:54.690> G<00:02:55.290> into<00:02:55.440> G

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
box will change between 3G 4G G into G

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.060 
box will change between 3G 4G G into G
whichever<00:02:57.090> signal<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.630> can<00:02:57.750> actually<00:02:57.960> get<00:02:58.380> so

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
whichever signal it can actually get so

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.420 
whichever signal it can actually get so
M<00:02:59.510> let's<00:03:00.510> say<00:03:00.780> go<00:03:01.350> into<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.680> box<00:03:01.890> itself<00:03:02.220> have

now

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.770 

and<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:43.770> should<00:03:43.980> take<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.160> street<00:03:44.610> in<00:03:44.780> excellent

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
and I should take a street in excellent

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.930 
and I should take a street in excellent
rate<00:03:45.990> so<00:03:46.230> we<00:03:46.350> are<00:03:46.500> we're<00:03:46.740> running<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.040> 4G

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
rate so we are we're running a 4G

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.860 
rate so we are we're running a 4G
network<00:03:47.970> if<00:03:48.570> you<00:03:48.660> can<00:03:48.810> see<00:03:49.020> that<00:03:49.230> there<00:03:49.470> and

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
network if you can see that there and

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.560 
network if you can see that there and
basically<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:52.410> gets<00:03:52.740> you<00:03:53.040> it<00:03:53.400> tracks<00:03:53.820> how<00:03:54.180> much

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
basically it gets you it tracks how much

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.770 
basically it gets you it tracks how much
usage<00:03:55.170> you've<00:03:55.530> actually<00:03:55.740> had<00:03:56.190> so<00:03:56.520> so<00:03:57.209> far<00:03:57.450> I've

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
usage you've actually had so so far I've

try<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:33.610> find<00:04:33.970> out<00:04:34.180> what<00:04:34.510> speed<00:04:35.170> we're

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010

try and find out what speed we're
running<00:04:36.400> up<00:04:36.550> so<00:04:37.500> let's<00:04:38.500> just<00:04:38.740> do<00:04:38.890> a<00:04:38.920> standard
