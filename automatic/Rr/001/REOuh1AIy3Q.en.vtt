players now I've got a very solid team
if<00:00:16.980> we<00:00:17.070> stuck<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.340> manager<00:00:17.760> on<00:00:17.820> this<00:00:18.029> we<00:00:18.570> would

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
if we stuck a manager on this we would

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.660 
if we stuck a manager on this we would
have<00:00:18.779> something<00:00:19.140> like<00:00:19.260> 99<00:00:19.949> chemistry<00:00:20.520> or

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
have something like 99 chemistry or

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.210 
have something like 99 chemistry or
maybe<00:00:20.880> even<00:00:21.060> better<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:22.050> hundred<00:00:22.800> chemistry

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
maybe even better a hundred chemistry

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.670

team if we stuck a manager in I don't
think<00:00:25.740> chemistry<00:00:26.099> as<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.760> as<00:00:27.240> important<00:00:27.990> this

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
think chemistry as is as important this

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.529

year<00:00:28.410> as<00:00:28.619> previous<00:00:29.099> years<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.640> think<00:00:30.150> morale

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
year as previous years I think morale

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.630 
year as previous years I think morale
and<00:00:30.810> fitness<00:00:31.289> are<00:00:31.439> just<00:00:31.740> as<00:00:31.859> important<00:00:32.430> this

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
and fitness are just as important this

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.530
