color and it's not real human hair so

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.660 
color and it's not real human hair so
you<00:00:09.809> can't<00:00:10.050> really<00:00:10.260> just<00:00:10.469> dye<00:00:10.679> it<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:11.040> found<00:00:11.519> a

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
you can't really just dye it I found a

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.049 
you can't really just dye it I found a
pretty<00:00:11.880> weird<00:00:12.870> way<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.620> do<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:14.009> so<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:14.730> thought

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
pretty weird way to do it so I thought

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.790 
pretty weird way to do it so I thought

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
color out of the little pen thingy and I

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.350 
color out of the little pen thingy and I
used<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.350> screwdriver<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.640> hammer<00:00:47.670> for<00:00:48.149> that

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
used a screwdriver and a hammer for that

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.869 
used a screwdriver and a hammer for that
so<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.870> took<00:00:49.020> out<00:00:49.320> about<00:00:49.710> half<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.550> then

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
so I took out about half of it and then

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.580 
so I took out about half of it and then
I<00:00:51.030> also<00:00:51.300> put<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.809> little<00:00:51.960> bit<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.320> bloom

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
I also put in a little bit of bloom

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.100 
I also put in a little bit of bloom
after<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.460> just<00:00:53.760> shook<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.149> up<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.539> then<00:00:55.079> I

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
after that I just shook it up and then I

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.029 
after that I just shook it up and then I
let<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.530> dissolve<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:56.309> about<00:00:56.520> 30<00:00:56.879> minutes

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
let it dissolve for about 30 minutes

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.650 
let it dissolve for about 30 minutes
here<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.160> can<00:00:59.340> see<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.609> colors<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.120> used<00:01:00.329> again

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
here you can see the colors I used again

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.540 
here you can see the colors I used again
and<00:01:00.960> yeah<00:01:01.530> that's<00:01:01.770> pretty<00:01:01.829> much<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.370> that's

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
and yeah that's pretty much it that's

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.060 
and yeah that's pretty much it that's
how<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.760> make<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.239> hair<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.899> just<00:01:04.409> use

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
how you make the hair that I just use

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.130 
how you make the hair that I just use
paper<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.640> cover<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.030> floor<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.570> then<00:01:06.930> I

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
paper to cover the floor and then I

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.380 
paper to cover the floor and then I
sprayed<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.860> color<00:01:08.070> onto<00:01:08.310> my<00:01:08.460> wig<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.090> brush

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
sprayed the color onto my wig and brush

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.480 
sprayed the color onto my wig and brush
it<00:01:09.570> through<00:01:09.600> that's<00:01:10.110> pretty<00:01:10.409> much<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.070> yeah

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
it through that's pretty much it so yeah

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.340 
it through that's pretty much it so yeah
it's<00:01:11.760> really<00:01:12.030> simple<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.540> just<00:01:12.840> let<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.049> dry

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
it's really simple you just let it dry

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.560 
it's really simple you just let it dry
or<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.799> can<00:01:13.950> also<00:01:14.130> use<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.460> blow<00:01:14.850> dryer<00:01:14.880> if<00:01:15.420> you

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
or you can also use a blow dryer if you

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.770 
or you can also use a blow dryer if you
want<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.930> be<00:01:16.080> faster<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.799> that's<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.970> so

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
want it to be faster and that's it so

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.530 
want it to be faster and that's it so
here<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.170> just<00:01:19.200> put<00:01:19.470> my<00:01:19.799> hair<00:01:20.100> into<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.670> bun<00:01:20.820> and

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
here I just put my hair into a bun and

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.420 
here I just put my hair into a bun and
then<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.930> put<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.320> wig<00:01:22.530> cap<00:01:22.560> over<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.100> which

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.380 
smaller and I definitely need those
because<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.860> have<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.220> smallest<00:01:38.520> head<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.240> yeah

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
because I have the smallest head so yeah

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.210

then<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.720> just<00:01:39.990> adjust<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.500> wig<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.799> little<00:01:40.829> bit

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
then I just adjust the wig a little bit

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.399 
then I just adjust the wig a little bit
and<00:01:41.549> pull<00:01:42.329> on<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.570> head<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.960> make<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.140> look

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
and pull on the head to make it look

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.100 
and pull on the head to make it look
more<00:01:43.439> natural<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.340> that's<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:45.030> yeah<00:01:45.780> that's
