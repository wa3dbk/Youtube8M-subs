that show that too first of all how big
are<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.570> blocks<00:00:39.810> the<00:00:40.350> blocks<00:00:40.590> are<00:00:40.740> two<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.010> a

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
are the blocks the blocks are two and a

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.340 
are the blocks the blocks are two and a
half<00:00:41.190> inches<00:00:41.340> okay<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.570> then<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.900> have<00:00:43.110> that

little tiny triangle say Shing how big
is<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:47.150> 316<00:00:48.150> actually<00:00:48.720> and<00:00:49.710> then<00:00:50.070> as<00:00:50.970> I<00:00:51.150> did

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
is that 316 actually and then as I did

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.350 
is that 316 actually and then as I did
the<00:00:51.390> blocks<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:52.050> kind<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:53.030> went<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.210> different

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the blocks I kind of went to different

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.620 
the blocks I kind of went to different
sets<00:00:54.810> and<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.770> tried<00:00:56.250> flying<00:00:56.550> geese<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.210> they

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 
sets and I I tried flying geese and they

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.330 
sets and I I tried flying geese and they
turned<00:00:57.930> out<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.230> be<00:00:58.380> a<00:00:58.560> little<00:00:58.829> too<00:00:59.040> big<00:00:59.280> for

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
turned out to be a little too big for

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.970 
turned out to be a little too big for
the<00:00:59.730> proportion<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.870> had<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.110> downsize<00:01:01.410> and

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the proportion so I had to downsize and

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.350 
the proportion so I had to downsize and
I<00:01:02.040> went<00:01:02.220> to<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> half<00:01:02.489> square<00:01:02.730> triangles<00:01:03.210> and

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
I went to the half square triangles and

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.410 
I went to the half square triangles and
put<00:01:03.510> them<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.690> point<00:01:04.079> and<00:01:04.700> that<00:01:05.700> worked<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
put them on point and that worked the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.780 
put them on point and that worked the
best<00:01:06.600> for<00:01:06.810> me<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.680> did<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.190> then<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.550> course

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
best for me it did and then of course

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.600 
best for me it did and then of course
you<00:01:08.970> framed<00:01:09.390> them<00:01:09.659> with<00:01:10.020> two<00:01:10.590> tiny<00:01:11.159> little

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
you framed them with two tiny little

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.000 
you framed them with two tiny little
borders<00:01:12.210> tell<00:01:12.810> us<00:01:12.990> how<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.200> did<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.740> very

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
borders tell us how you did that very

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.600

them as small as I could but I just
sewed<00:01:24.180> them<00:01:24.270> on<00:01:24.390> like<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.690> would<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> regular<00:01:25.170> a

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
you can adjust your needle to go smaller

personally<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.650> that<00:01:44.010> if<00:01:44.490> i<00:01:44.670> were<00:01:44.850> doing<00:01:45.210> that

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
personally is that if i were doing that

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.390 
personally is that if i were doing that
and<00:01:45.659> those<00:01:45.750> are<00:01:45.990> what<00:01:46.200> about<00:01:46.500> an<00:01:46.710> eighth<00:01:47.010> of<00:01:47.250> an

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
and those are what about an eighth of an

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.039 
and those are what about an eighth of an
inch<00:01:47.520> wide<00:01:47.880> they're<00:01:48.330> a<00:01:48.360> little<00:01:48.600> bit<00:01:48.780> bigger

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
inch wide they're a little bit bigger

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.960 
inch wide they're a little bit bigger
than<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.260> probably<00:01:49.530> but<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:50.460> did<00:01:50.820> you

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
than that probably but you just did you

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.179 
than that probably but you just did you
sew<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> bigger<00:01:51.689> piece<00:01:52.020> on<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.619> then<00:01:52.740> trim<00:01:53.040> it

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
sew a bigger piece on and then trim it

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.359 
sew a bigger piece on and then trim it
down<00:01:53.220> no<00:01:53.790> those<00:01:54.030> are<00:01:54.180> all<00:01:54.330> foundation<00:01:54.900> piece

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
down no those are all foundation piece

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.000 
down no those are all foundation piece
so<00:01:56.369> my<00:01:57.000> foundation<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.840> small<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.680> so

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
so my foundation is that small and so

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.770 
so my foundation is that small and so
i'm<00:01:59.130> just<00:01:59.159> putting<00:01:59.520> little<00:01:59.759> pieces<00:02:00.060> I'm<00:02:00.509> just

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
i'm just putting little pieces I'm just

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.109 
i'm just putting little pieces I'm just
building<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.560> foundation<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.790> those<00:02:03.090> of

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
building it on foundation so those of

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.340 
building it on foundation so those of
you<00:02:03.420> who<00:02:03.659> are<00:02:03.689> at<00:02:03.840> home<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.770> know<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
you who are at home so and you know the

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.770 
you who are at home so and you know the
foundation<00:02:06.040> abort<00:02:06.549> foundation<00:02:07.270> piecing<00:02:07.689> a

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
foundation abort foundation piecing a

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.109 
foundation abort foundation piecing a
border<00:02:08.229> is<00:02:08.619> another<00:02:09.130> nice<00:02:09.490> trick<00:02:09.910> for

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
border is another nice trick for

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.720 
border is another nice trick for
accuracy<00:02:10.780> isn't<00:02:10.990> it<00:02:11.230> yes<00:02:11.440> yes<00:02:11.890> that<00:02:12.160> there<00:02:12.400> the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
accuracy isn't it yes yes that there the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.220 
accuracy isn't it yes yes that there the
whole<00:02:12.880> thing<00:02:13.120> is<00:02:13.270> foundation<00:02:13.780> piece<00:02:13.959> for<00:02:14.170> the

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
whole thing is foundation piece for the

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.600 
whole thing is foundation piece for the
most<00:02:14.380> part<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.709> blocks<00:02:14.950> are<00:02:15.130> foundation

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
most part the blocks are foundation

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.240 
most part the blocks are foundation
piece<00:02:15.819> and<00:02:16.060> one<00:02:16.600> of<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.840> things<00:02:16.870> that<00:02:17.170> made<00:02:18.069> it

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
piece and one of the things that made it

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.940 
piece and one of the things that made it
more<00:02:18.370> possible<00:02:18.610> for<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.870> blocks<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.709> look

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
more possible for the the blocks to look

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.330 
more possible for the the blocks to look
crisp<00:02:21.640> was<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:23.230> Japanese<00:02:23.739> fabric<00:02:24.130> that<00:02:24.280> I

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
crisp was the Japanese fabric that I

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.150 
crisp was the Japanese fabric that I
used<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:25.150> black<00:02:25.390> is<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:26.020> very<00:02:26.319> tight<00:02:26.650> woven

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
used the black is a very tight woven

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.750 
used the black is a very tight woven
thinner<00:02:28.620> fabric<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:30.069> so<00:02:30.280> when<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:30.550> go<00:02:30.700> to

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
thinner fabric and so when you go to

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.410 
thinner fabric and so when you go to
press<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.450> it's<00:02:32.170> very<00:02:32.620> crisp<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.520> of<00:02:34.239> course

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
press it it's very crisp and of course

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.820 
press it it's very crisp and of course
the<00:02:34.540> boutiques<00:02:34.930> are<00:02:35.110> always<00:02:35.319> good<00:02:35.590> at<00:02:35.770> that

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
the boutiques are always good at that

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.040 
the boutiques are always good at that
and<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.760> combination<00:02:36.940> of<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.510> two<00:02:37.690> kind

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
and so the combination of the two kind

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.570 
and so the combination of the two kind
of<00:02:38.110> gave<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:38.319> the<00:02:38.530> dimension<00:02:39.100> that<00:02:39.250> I<00:02:39.400> was

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
of gave it the dimension that I was

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.550 
of gave it the dimension that I was
looking<00:02:39.850> for<00:02:40.090> so<00:02:40.480> that<00:02:40.660> made<00:02:40.930> it<00:02:40.959> so<00:02:41.290> that<00:02:41.319> you

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
looking for so that made it so that you

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.199 
looking for so that made it so that you
didn't<00:02:41.860> have<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:42.040> peek<00:02:42.370> in<00:02:42.580> the<00:02:42.700> center<00:02:43.030> of<00:02:43.060> your

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
didn't have a peek in the center of your

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.990 
didn't have a peek in the center of your
stars<00:02:43.660> isn't<00:02:44.080> it<00:02:44.319> right<00:02:44.590> all<00:02:45.580> right<00:02:45.760> then

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
stars isn't it right all right then

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.790 
stars isn't it right all right then
another<00:02:46.150> thing<00:02:46.660> that<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:46.840> added<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.290> it<00:02:47.590> was<00:02:47.769> a

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
another thing that you added to it was a

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.580 
another thing that you added to it was a
really<00:02:48.310> tiny<00:02:48.610> little<00:02:48.940> piping<00:02:49.540> yes<00:02:49.989> a<00:02:50.019> secret

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
really tiny little piping yes a secret

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.860 
really tiny little piping yes a secret
there<00:02:50.890> well<00:02:51.550> I<00:02:51.580> tried<00:02:52.060> several<00:02:52.360> things<00:02:52.660> but

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
there well I tried several things but

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.699 
there well I tried several things but
again<00:02:53.200> I<00:02:53.500> wanted<00:02:54.220> to<00:02:54.310> do<00:02:54.430> small<00:02:54.730> scale<00:02:55.000> so<00:02:55.330> I

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
again I wanted to do small scale so I

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.050 
again I wanted to do small scale so I
started<00:02:56.709> getting<00:02:56.860> out<00:02:57.130> my<00:02:57.280> crochet<00:02:57.730> thread

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
started getting out my crochet thread

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.199 
started getting out my crochet thread
and<00:02:58.590> sure<00:02:59.590> enough<00:02:59.620> I<00:03:00.100> had<00:03:00.310> a<00:03:00.340> crochet<00:03:00.850> thread

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
and sure enough I had a crochet thread

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.870 
and sure enough I had a crochet thread
there<00:03:01.480> that<00:03:02.140> was<00:03:02.319> tiny<00:03:03.190> enough<00:03:03.489> that<00:03:03.790> it

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
there that was tiny enough that it

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.150 
there that was tiny enough that it
suited<00:03:04.030> my<00:03:04.269> purpose<00:03:04.660> and<00:03:04.810> larger<00:03:05.799> yet<00:03:05.980> then

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
suited my purpose and larger yet then

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.920 
suited my purpose and larger yet then
probably<00:03:06.489> most<00:03:06.730> people<00:03:07.030> do<00:03:07.150> with<00:03:07.269> crochet<00:03:07.690> but

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
probably most people do with crochet but

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.530 
probably most people do with crochet but
I<00:03:08.110> use<00:03:08.709> that<00:03:08.739> instead<00:03:09.250> of<00:03:09.519> pearl<00:03:09.820> cotton<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.329> lot

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
I use that instead of pearl cotton a lot

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.060 
I use that instead of pearl cotton a lot
of<00:03:10.630> people<00:03:10.840> use<00:03:10.989> probe<00:03:11.200> cotton<00:03:11.560> but<00:03:11.709> this<00:03:11.860> was

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
of people use probe cotton but this was

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.440 
of people use probe cotton but this was
this<00:03:12.400> work<00:03:12.579> better<00:03:12.760> for<00:03:13.000> me<00:03:13.090> had<00:03:13.329> a<00:03:13.360> little

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
this work better for me had a little

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.810 
this work better for me had a little
more<00:03:13.600> stability<00:03:13.810> I<00:03:14.140> think<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:14.980> it<00:03:15.400> was<00:03:15.549> small

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
more stability I think and it was small

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.060 
more stability I think and it was small
enough<00:03:15.850> to<00:03:16.180> fill<00:03:16.540> it<00:03:16.720> nicely<00:03:16.959> yes<00:03:17.530> and<00:03:17.829> give

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
enough to fill it nicely yes and give

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.670 
enough to fill it nicely yes and give
you<00:03:18.220> a<00:03:18.250> nice<00:03:18.519> little<00:03:18.820> edge<00:03:19.090> there<00:03:19.420> exactly<00:03:20.079> all

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
you a nice little edge there exactly all
