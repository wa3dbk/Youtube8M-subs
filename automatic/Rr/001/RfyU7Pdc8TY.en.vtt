the<00:00:35.880> sad<00:00:36.540> part<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.790> you<00:00:38.790> can't<00:00:39.030> get<00:00:39.210> more

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
the sad part is that you can't get more

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.180 
the sad part is that you can't get more
in<00:00:39.690> life<00:00:39.840> during<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.350> demo<00:00:40.649> as<00:00:40.829> you'll<00:00:41.010> see

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
in life during the demo as you'll see

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.670 
in life during the demo as you'll see
here<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.910> there's<00:00:42.480> only<00:00:42.570> one<00:00:42.690> continue<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.590> if

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
here and there's only one continue so if

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.990 
here and there's only one continue so if
your<00:00:43.800> partner<00:00:44.129> dies<00:00:44.340> while<00:00:44.700> you're<00:00:44.820> playing

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
your partner dies while you're playing

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.709 
your partner dies while you're playing
then<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:46.440> don't<00:00:46.620> get<00:00:46.850> one<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.090> audience

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
then you don't get one of you audience

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.330 
then you don't get one of you audience
continues<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.440> kind<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.770> sucks<00:00:49.980> but<00:00:50.219> it's

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
continues so kind of sucks but it's

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.250 
continues so kind of sucks but it's
