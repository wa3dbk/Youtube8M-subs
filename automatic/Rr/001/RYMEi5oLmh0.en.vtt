outsiders base take it out the easy
percentages<00:01:49.730> and<00:01:49.940> as<00:01:50.450> you<00:01:50.630> can<00:01:50.780> see<00:01:50.810> we're

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
percentages and as you can see we're

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.690 
percentages and as you can see we're
already<00:01:51.170> at<00:01:51.380> forty<00:01:51.740> seven<00:01:52.040> percent<00:01:52.070> and<00:01:52.670> the

Congrats we got it and a very easy one
at<00:02:04.430> that<00:02:04.730> and<00:02:05.000> now<00:02:05.630> we're<00:02:05.900> just<00:02:05.930> cleaning<00:02:06.230> out

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
at that and now we're just cleaning out

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.070 
at that and now we're just cleaning out
the<00:02:06.560> outside

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
the outside

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.410 
the outside
this<00:02:07.170> entire<00:02:07.500> base<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.400> we<00:02:08.520> do<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.670> few<00:02:09.150> troops

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
this entire base and we do a few troops

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.940 
this entire base and we do a few troops
left<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:09.840> let's<00:02:09.930> see<00:02:10.110> what<00:02:10.140> percentage<00:02:10.710> we<00:02:10.830> can

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
left so let's see what percentage we can

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.180 
left so let's see what percentage we can
get<00:02:11.070> to<00:02:11.250> all<00:02:12.290> right<00:02:13.290> so<00:02:13.440> while<00:02:13.650> I<00:02:13.680> finish<00:02:14.010> up

successfully<00:02:36.900> in<00:02:36.990> my<00:02:37.140> opinion<00:02:37.440> at<00:02:37.920> least

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
successfully in my opinion at least

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.120 
successfully in my opinion at least
among<00:02:39.330> youtubers<00:02:40.020> no<00:02:40.170> one<00:02:40.350> uses<00:02:40.560> goblins

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
among youtubers no one uses goblins

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.490 
among youtubers no one uses goblins
about<00:02:41.370> 3200<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.630> I'm<00:02:42.780> very<00:02:42.810> proud<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:43.380> and

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
about 3200 so I'm very proud of that and

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.810 
about 3200 so I'm very proud of that and
therefore<00:02:43.800> I've<00:02:44.100> decided<00:02:44.130> that<00:02:44.580> I'm<00:02:44.730> gonna

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
therefore I've decided that I'm gonna

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.900 
therefore I've decided that I'm gonna
push<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.240> 37<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.080> go<00:02:46.380> beyond<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:47.100> I<00:02:47.610> figured

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
push to 37 and go beyond and I figured

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.190 
push to 37 and go beyond and I figured
what<00:02:48.090> would<00:02:48.240> make<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.540> easy<00:02:48.690> since<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.080> on<00:02:49.170> a

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
what would make it easy since it on a

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.870 
what would make it easy since it on a
lot<00:02:49.380> of<00:02:49.470> time<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.800> attack<00:02:50.040> what<00:02:50.580> little

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
lot of time to attack what little

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.210 
lot of time to attack what little
adjustment<00:02:51.390> can<00:02:51.510> I<00:02:51.540> make<00:02:51.900> so<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:52.980> is<00:02:53.100> the

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
adjustment can I make so this is the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.220 
adjustment can I make so this is the
adjustment<00:02:53.490> I<00:02:53.730> can<00:02:54.000> make<00:02:54.240> and<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.750> adding

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
adjustment I can make and it is adding

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.990 
adjustment I can make and it is adding
two<00:02:55.410> golems<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:55.980> it'll<00:02:56.520> add<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.700> meat<00:02:56.970> shield

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
two golems and it'll add a meat shield

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.850 
two golems and it'll add a meat shield
and<00:02:57.480> allow<00:02:57.690> me<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.870> get<00:02:58.080> up<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:58.290> that<00:02:58.380> to<00:02:58.590> star<00:02:58.830> a

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
and allow me to get up to that to star a

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.240 
and allow me to get up to that to star a
lot<00:02:59.130> easier<00:02:59.900> so<00:03:00.900> as<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.410> can<00:03:01.500> see<00:03:01.650> I<00:03:01.680> did<00:03:02.010> take

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
lot easier so as you can see I did take

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.610 
lot easier so as you can see I did take
out<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.970> mortar<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.630> wizard<00:03:04.050> and<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.290> did

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
out that mortar and wizard and I did

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.680 
out that mortar and wizard and I did
make<00:03:04.890> one<00:03:05.130> mistake<00:03:05.280> here<00:03:05.790> see<00:03:06.030> how<00:03:06.090> even<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.570> is

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
make one mistake here see how even it is

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.480 
make one mistake here see how even it is
I<00:03:06.810> could<00:03:07.020> have<00:03:07.110> easily<00:03:07.350> taken<00:03:07.709> out<00:03:08.010> one<00:03:08.250> or<00:03:08.400> the

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
I could have easily taken out one or the

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.790 
I could have easily taken out one or the
other<00:03:08.630> but<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:09.870> went<00:03:10.110> for<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.320> middle<00:03:10.560> trying

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
other but I went for the middle trying

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.440 
other but I went for the middle trying
to<00:03:10.920> interim<00:03:11.220> both<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:11.640> take<00:03:11.760> out<00:03:11.910> one<00:03:12.209> and

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
to interim both and take out one and

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.990 
to interim both and take out one and
look<00:03:13.350> at<00:03:13.470> that<00:03:13.590> motor<00:03:13.830> just<00:03:14.070> would<00:03:14.430> not<00:03:14.670> die

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
look at that motor just would not die

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.210 
look at that motor just would not die
unfortunately<00:03:15.720> so<00:03:15.989> a<00:03:16.170> little<00:03:16.650> bit<00:03:16.800> of<00:03:16.860> mistake

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
unfortunately so a little bit of mistake

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.699 
unfortunately so a little bit of mistake
there<00:03:17.489> but<00:03:18.030> luckily<00:03:18.239> we<00:03:18.510> have<00:03:18.600> golems<00:03:19.050> so<00:03:19.440> that

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
there but luckily we have golems so that

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.190 
there but luckily we have golems so that
should<00:03:20.100> help<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.489> bit<00:03:20.870> otherwise<00:03:21.870> you'd

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
should help a bit otherwise you'd

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.449 
should help a bit otherwise you'd
normally<00:03:22.320> be<00:03:22.530> in<00:03:22.620> a<00:03:22.680> bit<00:03:22.800> of<00:03:22.830> trouble<00:03:22.920> because

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
normally be in a bit of trouble because

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.940 
normally be in a bit of trouble because
you<00:03:23.489> do<00:03:23.850> not<00:03:24.120> want<00:03:24.180> that<00:03:24.840> many<00:03:25.470> mortars<00:03:25.830> and

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
you do not want that many mortars and

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.040 
you do not want that many mortars and
wizards<00:03:26.250> left<00:03:26.370> on<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.550> board<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:27.570> you<00:03:27.660> can<00:03:27.900> see

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
wizards left on the board so you can see

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.600 
wizards left on the board so you can see
there's<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.350> huge<00:03:28.920> amount<00:03:29.010> of<00:03:29.250> buildings<00:03:29.550> on

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
there's a huge amount of buildings on

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.400 
there's a huge amount of buildings on
the<00:03:29.700> outside<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.090> base<00:03:30.269> probably<00:03:31.110> good

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
the outside the base probably good

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.930 
the outside the base probably good
thirty<00:03:31.620> forty<00:03:31.950> percent<00:03:32.220> outside<00:03:32.610> actually

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
thirty forty percent outside actually

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.699 
thirty forty percent outside actually
about<00:03:33.030> 30<00:03:33.269> probably<00:03:33.630> but<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:34.260> can<00:03:34.470> see<00:03:34.560> we're

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
about 30 probably but you can see we're

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.380 
about 30 probably but you can see we're
gonna<00:03:34.830> pick<00:03:35.040> off<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.400> easy<00:03:35.550> ones<00:03:35.850> we<00:03:35.970> can<00:03:36.180> just

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
gonna pick off the easy ones we can just

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.820 
gonna pick off the easy ones we can just
by<00:03:36.510> dropping<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.959> couple<00:03:37.200> arches<00:03:37.530> around<00:03:37.769> the

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
by dropping a couple arches around the

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.520 
by dropping a couple arches around the
base<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.280> take<00:03:39.209> out<00:03:39.360> that<00:03:39.510> easy<00:03:39.870> percentage

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
base and take out that easy percentage

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.930 
base and take out that easy percentage
and<00:03:40.709> that's<00:03:41.160> what<00:03:41.280> you<00:03:41.370> want<00:03:41.550> to<00:03:41.610> do<00:03:41.730> if<00:03:41.820> you

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
and that's what you want to do if you

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.520 
and that's what you want to do if you
can<00:03:42.060> see<00:03:42.269> there's<00:03:42.480> obviously<00:03:42.959> a<00:03:43.050> couple<00:03:43.410> out

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
can see there's obviously a couple out

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
can see there's obviously a couple out
there<00:03:43.560> they'll<00:03:43.830> just<00:03:43.980> be<00:03:44.100> taken<00:03:44.489> without

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
there they'll just be taken without

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.120 
there they'll just be taken without
losing<00:03:45.030> troops<00:03:45.269> go<00:03:45.959> for<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.350> and<00:03:46.440> then<00:03:46.890> take

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
losing troops go for it and then take

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.250 
losing troops go for it and then take
out<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.430> ones<00:03:47.640> you<00:03:47.790> can<00:03:48.000> after<00:03:48.269> that<00:03:48.540> by

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
out the ones you can after that by

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.780 
out the ones you can after that by
dropping<00:03:49.620> on<00:03:49.709> a<00:03:49.739> normal<00:03:49.980> stream<00:03:50.400> around<00:03:50.670> the

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
dropping on a normal stream around the

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.540 
dropping on a normal stream around the
edges<00:03:50.989> saving<00:03:51.989> about<00:03:52.080> half<00:03:52.440> your<00:03:52.650> force<00:03:52.950> you

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
edges saving about half your force you

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.160 
edges saving about half your force you
want<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:53.910> waste<00:03:54.090> about<00:03:54.300> half<00:03:54.540> its<00:03:54.750> take<00:03:54.959> out<00:03:55.080> as

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
want to waste about half its take out as

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.780 
want to waste about half its take out as
many<00:03:55.290> building<00:03:55.620> as<00:03:55.709> possible<00:03:56.160> and<00:03:56.310> save<00:03:56.640> the

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
many building as possible and save the

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.580 
many building as possible and save the
other<00:03:56.940> half<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.390> follow<00:03:57.600> the<00:03:57.780> gut<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.260> golems

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
other half to follow the gut the golems

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.550 
other half to follow the gut the golems
into<00:03:58.769> the<00:03:58.860> base<00:03:59.239> now<00:04:00.239> I<00:04:00.269> know<00:04:00.600> this<00:04:01.080> looks<00:04:01.140> and

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
into the base now I know this looks and

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.810 
into the base now I know this looks and
sounds<00:04:01.890> like<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.040> different<00:04:02.340> strategy<00:04:02.550> than

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
sounds like a different strategy than

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.180 
sounds like a different strategy than
the<00:04:03.180> one<00:04:03.360> you<00:04:03.540> just<00:04:03.570> watched<00:04:04.049> reason<00:04:04.799> being<00:04:04.980> is

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
the one you just watched reason being is

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.130 
the one you just watched reason being is
this<00:04:05.400> strategy<00:04:05.910> focused<00:04:06.390> on<00:04:06.540> guaranteeing

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
this strategy focused on guaranteeing

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.990 
this strategy focused on guaranteeing
the<00:04:07.290> fifty<00:04:07.560> percent<00:04:07.890> and<00:04:08.130> then<00:04:08.549> going<00:04:08.700> for<00:04:08.940> the

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
the fifty percent and then going for the

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.370 
the fifty percent and then going for the
two-star<00:04:09.360> where<00:04:09.600> is<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:09.870> last<00:04:10.110> strategy

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
two-star where is the last strategy

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.740 
two-star where is the last strategy
focused<00:04:10.980> on<00:04:11.130> going<00:04:11.459> for<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:12.150> town<00:04:12.420> hall<00:04:12.720> on

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
focused on going for the town hall on

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.840 
focused on going for the town hall on
the<00:04:12.930> center<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.440> then<00:04:13.950> picking<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.459> to<00:04:14.610> start

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
the center and then picking the to start

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.420 
the center and then picking the to start
off<00:04:14.970> at<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.209> end<00:04:15.390> so<00:04:16.109> it's<00:04:16.500> really<00:04:16.830> deciding

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
off at the end so it's really deciding

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.860 
off at the end so it's really deciding
on<00:04:17.549> whether<00:04:17.910> you<00:04:18.030> want<00:04:18.330> to<00:04:18.390> risk<00:04:18.539> going<00:04:18.660> for

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
on whether you want to risk going for

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.849 
on whether you want to risk going for
the<00:04:18.930> town<00:04:19.109> hall<00:04:19.380> or<00:04:19.919> a<00:04:19.950> few<00:04:20.190> swats<00:04:20.400> at<00:04:20.549> these

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
the town hall or a few swats at these

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.649 
the town hall or a few swats at these
50<00:04:21.189> and<00:04:21.370> then<00:04:21.609> worry<00:04:21.909> about<00:04:22.000> it<00:04:22.270> so<00:04:22.389> this<00:04:22.509> is<00:04:22.629> a

00:04:22.649 --> 00:04:22.659 
50 and then worry about it so this is a

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:24.869 
50 and then worry about it so this is a
safer<00:04:23.110> route<00:04:23.289> you<00:04:24.069> take<00:04:24.250> out<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.490> buildings

00:04:24.869 --> 00:04:24.879 
safer route you take out the buildings

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:26.459 
safer route you take out the buildings
and<00:04:25.030> then<00:04:25.240> you<00:04:25.389> work<00:04:25.599> your<00:04:25.629> way<00:04:25.900> into<00:04:26.139> get<00:04:26.379> to

00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:26.469 
and then you work your way into get to

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:28.830 
and then you work your way into get to
the<00:04:26.560> two<00:04:26.770> star<00:04:27.039> whereas<00:04:27.969> I<00:04:28.120> am<00:04:28.180> pretty<00:04:28.659> good

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
the two star whereas I am pretty good

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.499 
the two star whereas I am pretty good
with<00:04:28.900> guard<00:04:29.199> so<00:04:29.740> I<00:04:29.949> tend<00:04:30.550> to<00:04:30.669> go<00:04:30.849> right<00:04:31.090> flat<00:04:31.300> to

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
with guard so I tend to go right flat to

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:33.809 
with guard so I tend to go right flat to
star<00:04:31.780> and<00:04:31.930> is<00:04:32.080> more<00:04:32.319> risky<00:04:32.560> but<00:04:33.520> especially

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:33.819 
star and is more risky but especially

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:35.939 
star and is more risky but especially
with<00:04:34.120> these<00:04:34.210> golems<00:04:34.509> it's<00:04:34.900> way<00:04:35.259> less<00:04:35.500> risky

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
with these golems it's way less risky

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:37.469 
with these golems it's way less risky
now<00:04:36.129> so<00:04:36.669> you<00:04:36.729> can<00:04:36.879> see<00:04:36.969> there's<00:04:37.150> actually

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
now so you can see there's actually

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:38.999 
now so you can see there's actually
three<00:04:37.509> goals<00:04:37.900> once<00:04:38.169> again<00:04:38.349> my<00:04:38.469> clanmates<00:04:38.860> been

three goals once again my clanmates been

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:40.379 
three goals once again my clanmates been
