00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.399
 I'm just explaining how fast it is 

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:09.780
 that software is installed in shock 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:12.840
 do too 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.929
 his taxiing then he will come to 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.929
 on here 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:22.710
 the more compact it 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.199
 that viewer will not have 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.210
 these files here these files here 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.539
 For the time being I did not go back to the first thing 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.539
 What will I do? 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:39.050
 unpack these files first 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:43.630
 take out what is the xkr-s 3 26 01 until the 1 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:50.770
 stay in 3 26 39 after you 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:52.930
 mark and if you do not have it extracted 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.660
 This is where you will extract these files 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:59.120
 here the ks 23 2 x 6 4 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.510
 while zeroing 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.510
 up until 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.200
 the last one here and have it extracted again 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.649
 had betrayed here 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.729
 So after entering and going, it's going to generate 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:13.729
 these two folders here 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.000
 a playmaker 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.000
 and the installer is not 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.600
 will not execute the file right 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.600
 let's do it 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.920
 to start the installation 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.680
 honest 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.680
 I do not advance 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.750
 Who will choose who is there 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.750
 cel 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.920
 initial 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.920
 save a minute then 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.380
 to finish in relation to where 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.220
 so it's open here but for now 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.790
 You can not tell what you have to do. 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.790
 in the tool 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.930
 in this folder, right? 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.830
 will copy this file here will scroll 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.630
 in the folder where it was installed 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.380
 to replace the file 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.380
 another file 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.610
 so little here 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.020
 the shelter where the file is installed was 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.770
 installed right? 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.840
 so here it is there 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.840
 How much to replace in paste 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.829
 copying replace 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.829
 the conversation is not 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.200
 minimize here 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:04.860
 now did not have a general key a password 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.860
 This one is really for me. 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.250
 two clicks 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.370
 put any name you want 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.090
 the attack 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.090
 the general demand 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:25.480
 generate the school where you want to save it 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.200
 just here on the desktop 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.580
 to save 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.280
 O 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:38.490
 saying that it was successfully saved 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.490
 We did not close, I closed. 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.790
 the program 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:47.300
 So here it is not going to take that 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.300
 license 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.830
 click here 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:00.380
 What about that license? 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.380
 go look in the work area, right? 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.690
 here is she 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:15.110
 The program gives you the opportunity to use it now. 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.110
 It's personal thanks.
