hi and welcome to another bruja video in

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.480 
hi and welcome to another bruja video in
this<00:00:03.570> video<00:00:03.870> we're<00:00:04.110> going<00:00:04.259> to<00:00:04.560> be<00:00:04.740> wracking

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
this video we're going to be wracking

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.120 
this video we're going to be wracking
the<00:00:05.670> Belgian<00:00:06.120> saison<00:00:06.600> that<00:00:06.930> we<00:00:07.049> brewed<00:00:07.319> in

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
the Belgian saison that we brewed in

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.759 
the Belgian saison that we brewed in
another<00:00:08.400> video<00:00:09.050> we've<00:00:10.050> completed<00:00:10.469> the

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
another video we've completed the

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.700 
another video we've completed the
fermentation<00:00:11.570> we<00:00:12.570> fermented<00:00:13.110> at<00:00:13.230> 280<00:00:13.650> degrees

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
fermentation we fermented at 280 degrees

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.320 
fermentation we fermented at 280 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.790> we<00:00:14.910> maintain<00:00:15.299> that

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
Fahrenheit and we maintain that

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.300 
Fahrenheit and we maintain that
temperature<00:00:15.719> by<00:00:16.350> running<00:00:16.740> warm<00:00:17.039> water

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
temperature by running warm water

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.590 
temperature by running warm water
through<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.600> jacket<00:00:19.140> we<00:00:19.500> had<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:20.070> Ranko<00:00:21.029> ET<00:00:21.359> c

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
through the jacket we had the Ranko ET c

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.349 
through the jacket we had the Ranko ET c
was<00:00:21.930> controlling<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.650> solenoid<00:00:23.160> down<00:00:24.090> at<00:00:24.240> the

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
was controlling the solenoid down at the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.120 
was controlling the solenoid down at the
bottom<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.930> would<00:00:25.170> open<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.619> solenoid

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
bottom and would open the solenoid

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.950 
bottom and would open the solenoid
letting<00:00:26.550> warm<00:00:26.789> water<00:00:27.060> into<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.480> jacket

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
letting warm water into the jacket

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.720 
letting warm water into the jacket
whenever<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.439> temperature<00:00:28.859> dropped<00:00:29.189> below

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
whenever the temperature dropped below

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.749 
whenever the temperature dropped below
80<00:00:30.330> degrees<00:00:30.689> Fahrenheit<00:00:31.309> we<00:00:32.309> think<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.640> this

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
80 degrees Fahrenheit we think that this

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.260 
80 degrees Fahrenheit we think that this
also<00:00:32.969> helped<00:00:33.840> with<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.260> fermentation

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
also helped with the fermentation

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.270 
also helped with the fermentation
because<00:00:36.270> every<00:00:37.110> time<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.500> warm<00:00:37.710> water<00:00:37.980> came

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
because every time the warm water came

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.920 
because every time the warm water came
into<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.700> cone<00:00:38.910> at<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.210> bottom<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.809> would

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
into the cone at the bottom it would

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.860 
into the cone at the bottom it would
warm<00:00:40.200> up<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.950> yeast<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.489> was<00:00:41.760> dropping<00:00:42.719> out

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
warm up the yeast that was dropping out

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.510 
warm up the yeast that was dropping out
a<00:00:42.899> little<00:00:43.079> bit<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.469> creating<00:00:43.829> some<00:00:44.100> current

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
a little bit and creating some current

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.500 
a little bit and creating some current
inside<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.149> fermenter<00:00:45.530> we<00:00:46.530> used<00:00:47.090> 3724<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.390> Y

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
inside the fermenter we used 3724 the Y

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.490 
inside the fermenter we used 3724 the Y
yeast<00:00:49.129> DuPont<00:00:50.239> saison<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.570> if<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.320> look

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
yeast DuPont saison and if you look

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.720 
yeast DuPont saison and if you look
online<00:00:52.680> you'll<00:00:53.100> see<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.309> lot<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.520> people

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
online you'll see a lot of people

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.160 
online you'll see a lot of people
complaining<00:00:54.270> about<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.320> tends<00:00:55.890> to

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
complaining about it that it tends to

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.150 
complaining about it that it tends to
stick<00:00:58.340> some<00:00:59.340> right<00:00:59.550> around<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.120> point<00:01:00.510> 300

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
stick some right around the point 300

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.520 
stick some right around the point 300
mark<00:01:02.160> even<00:01:02.969> Yee<00:01:03.390> stalks<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.170> might<00:01:04.350> have

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
mark even Yee stalks that you might have

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.740 
mark even Yee stalks that you might have
to<00:01:04.650> heat<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.189> fermenter<00:01:05.970> up<00:01:06.119> in<00:01:06.270> order<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.600> get

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
to heat the fermenter up in order to get

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.109 
to heat the fermenter up in order to get
it<00:01:06.869> going<00:01:07.049> again<00:01:07.260> we<00:01:08.070> didn't<00:01:08.369> see<00:01:08.610> any<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.909> that

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
it going again we didn't see any of that

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.600 
it going again we didn't see any of that
we<00:01:09.360> had<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.540> good<00:01:09.810> fermentation<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:11.280> wasn't

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
we had a good fermentation it wasn't

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.520 
we had a good fermentation it wasn't
overly<00:01:11.820> fast<00:01:12.180> but<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.689> was<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> good<00:01:13.140> healthy

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
overly fast but it was a good healthy

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.520 
overly fast but it was a good healthy
fermentation<00:01:14.220> for<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.520> whole<00:01:14.700> period<00:01:15.060> until

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
fermentation for the whole period until

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.890 
fermentation for the whole period until
it<00:01:16.530> was<00:01:16.680> complete<00:01:17.450> so<00:01:18.450> we've<00:01:18.600> got<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
it was complete so we've got the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.260 
it was complete so we've got the
fermenter<00:01:19.409> here<00:01:19.740> we've<00:01:20.640> cleaned<00:01:20.909> out<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
fermenter here we've cleaned out the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.690 
fermenter here we've cleaned out the
racking<00:01:21.720> port<00:01:22.020> at<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.170> bottom<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.860> put<00:01:23.549> some

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
racking port at the bottom I put some

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.240 
racking port at the bottom I put some
sanitizer<00:01:23.970> into<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.080> we've<00:01:25.320> sanitized<00:01:25.950> our

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
sanitizer into it we've sanitized our

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.179

with a plug in them different Brewers
have<00:02:35.870> different<00:02:36.670> gas<00:02:37.670> fittings<00:02:38.240> so<00:02:38.959> we<00:02:39.080> don't

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
have different gas fittings so we don't

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.470 
have different gas fittings so we don't
try<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:39.590> match<00:02:39.890> it<00:02:39.920> for<00:02:40.400> everybody<00:02:40.640> we<00:02:41.450> just

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
try to match it for everybody we just

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.840 
try to match it for everybody we just
send<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:41.989> NPT<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:42.770> then<00:02:42.890> you<00:02:43.070> can<00:02:43.250> just<00:02:43.459> get<00:02:43.670> a

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
send the NPT and then you can just get a

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.800 
send the NPT and then you can just get a
fitting<00:02:44.750> that<00:02:44.930> will<00:02:45.050> go<00:02:45.230> from<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:46.010> NPT<00:02:47.000> to<00:02:47.450> the

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
fitting that will go from the NPT to the

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.710 
fitting that will go from the NPT to the
gas<00:02:48.680> in<00:02:49.040> if<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:49.760> have<00:02:49.940> any<00:02:50.090> questions<00:02:50.540> about

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
gas in if you have any questions about

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.110 
gas in if you have any questions about
how<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:51.020> do<00:02:51.230> that<00:02:51.410> feel<00:02:52.070> free<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.340> contact<00:02:52.640> us

so<00:02:57.320> we're<00:02:58.070> just<00:02:58.100> going<00:02:58.520> to<00:02:58.550> hook<00:02:59.060> up<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.390> gas

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
so we're just going to hook up the gas

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.870 
so we're just going to hook up the gas
to<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.500> three<00:03:00.739> and<00:03:00.860> one<00:03:01.040> we're<00:03:01.700> going<00:03:01.790> to

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
to the three and one we're going to

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.040 
to the three and one we're going to
connect<00:03:02.270> the<00:03:02.330> line<00:03:02.570> and<00:03:02.810> we're<00:03:02.900> going<00:03:02.930> to

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
connect the line and we're going to

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.680 
connect the line and we're going to
start<00:03:03.290> to<00:03:03.440> transfer<00:03:03.950> it<00:03:04.070> over<00:03:04.540> okay

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
start to transfer it over okay

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.120 
start to transfer it over okay
so<00:03:05.959> we're<00:03:06.140> just<00:03:06.170> about<00:03:06.470> ready<00:03:06.620> to<00:03:06.920> start

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
so we're just about ready to start

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.600 
so we're just about ready to start
racking<00:03:07.550> the<00:03:08.030> beer<00:03:08.390> directly<00:03:08.900> into<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.260> keg

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
racking the beer directly into the keg

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.030 
racking the beer directly into the keg
we've<00:03:10.610> attached<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.270> co2<00:03:11.720> to<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.230> gas<00:03:12.470> in<00:03:12.800> on

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
we've attached the co2 to the gas in on

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.610 
we've attached the co2 to the gas in on
the<00:03:13.190> three<00:03:13.430> and<00:03:13.610> one<00:03:13.690> we've<00:03:14.690> adjusted<00:03:14.870> the

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
the three and one we've adjusted the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.030 
the three and one we've adjusted the
regulator<00:03:16.250> on<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.820> co2<00:03:17.120> so<00:03:18.019> that<00:03:18.200> is<00:03:18.320> just<00:03:18.620> a

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
regulator on the co2 so that is just a

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.039 
regulator on the co2 so that is just a
couple<00:03:19.400> psi<00:03:20.030> you<00:03:20.239> don't<00:03:20.420> need<00:03:20.600> very<00:03:20.630> much

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
couple psi you don't need very much

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.990 
couple psi you don't need very much
pressure<00:03:21.440> but<00:03:22.130> you<00:03:22.280> don't<00:03:22.459> want<00:03:22.670> very<00:03:22.880> much

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
pressure but you don't want very much

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.930 
pressure but you don't want very much
pressure<00:03:23.450> just<00:03:24.170> a<00:03:24.260> couple<00:03:24.470> psi<00:03:25.040> is<00:03:25.100> fine<00:03:25.549> so<00:03:25.820> we

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
pressure just a couple psi is fine so we

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.860 
pressure just a couple psi is fine so we
relieved<00:03:26.330> the<00:03:26.840> gas<00:03:27.650> in<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:28.340> regulator<00:03:28.870> turned

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
relieved the gas in the regulator turned

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.920 
relieved the gas in the regulator turned
out<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:30.170> regulator<00:03:31.060> until<00:03:32.060> it<00:03:32.180> was<00:03:32.299> zero<00:03:32.630> and

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
out the regulator until it was zero and

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.960 
out the regulator until it was zero and
then<00:03:33.320> slowly<00:03:33.590> started<00:03:34.070> to<00:03:34.190> screw<00:03:34.430> it<00:03:34.549> in<00:03:34.640> until

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
then slowly started to screw it in until

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.560 
then slowly started to screw it in until
we<00:03:35.060> get<00:03:35.209> a<00:03:35.239> couple<00:03:35.480> psi<00:03:36.019> going<00:03:36.440> into<00:03:36.739> here

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
we get a couple psi going into here

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.180 
we get a couple psi going into here
first<00:03:38.570> we're<00:03:38.810> just<00:03:38.840> going<00:03:39.049> to<00:03:39.380> empty<00:03:39.620> out<00:03:39.829> this

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
first we're just going to empty out this

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.880 
first we're just going to empty out this
port<00:03:40.640> here<00:03:40.730> a<00:03:41.150> little<00:03:41.360> bit<00:03:41.600> one<00:03:42.440> other<00:03:42.590> thing

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
port here a little bit one other thing

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.979 
port here a little bit one other thing
that<00:03:42.920> we<00:03:43.100> did<00:03:43.370> is<00:03:43.519> close<00:03:43.850> the<00:03:44.120> top<00:03:44.329> valve<00:03:44.660> here

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
that we did is close the top valve here

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.289 
that we did is close the top valve here
you<00:03:45.680> don't<00:03:45.829> want<00:03:46.040> your<00:03:46.130> gas<00:03:46.340> all<00:03:46.670> escaping<00:03:47.209> on

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
you don't want your gas all escaping on

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.050 
you don't want your gas all escaping on
the<00:03:47.450> top<00:03:47.980> first<00:03:48.980> we're<00:03:49.220> just<00:03:49.250> going<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.820> just

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
the top first we're just going to just

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.830 
the top first we're just going to just
flush<00:03:50.329> out<00:03:51.700> any<00:03:52.700> yeast<00:03:53.150> that<00:03:53.450> has<00:03:53.630> collected

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
flush out any yeast that has collected

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.280 
flush out any yeast that has collected
in<00:03:54.799> the<00:03:54.980> bottom<00:03:55.130> port<00:03:55.610> here<00:03:56.140> it's<00:03:57.140> looking

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
in the bottom port here it's looking

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.330 
in the bottom port here it's looking
pretty<00:03:57.680> good<00:03:59.650> and<00:04:00.650> we're<00:04:00.799> gonna<00:04:00.890> take<00:04:01.160> our

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
pretty good and we're gonna take our

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.940 
pretty good and we're gonna take our
hose<00:04:01.549> out<00:04:01.940> of<00:04:02.120> our<00:04:02.299> stars'<00:04:02.750> and<00:04:03.049> bucket<00:04:03.500> that

we have

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.030 
we have
just<00:04:04.709> to<00:04:04.800> keep<00:04:04.950> it<00:04:05.069> sanitary<00:04:06.650> and<00:04:07.650> we're<00:04:07.950> gonna

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
just to keep it sanitary and we're gonna

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.020 
just to keep it sanitary and we're gonna
connect<00:04:08.489> it<00:04:08.640> up

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
connect it up

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.750 
connect it up
we<00:04:09.870> also<00:04:10.050> sprayed<00:04:10.560> a<00:04:10.590> bit<00:04:10.800> of<00:04:10.920> star<00:04:11.129> sand<00:04:11.459> into

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
we also sprayed a bit of star sand into

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.559 
we also sprayed a bit of star sand into
here<00:04:12.120> a<00:04:12.300> couple<00:04:12.599> minutes<00:04:12.840> ago<00:04:13.290> just<00:04:14.150> to<00:04:15.150> ensure

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
here a couple minutes ago just to ensure

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:23.409 
here a couple minutes ago just to ensure
that<00:04:15.680> the<00:04:16.790> valve<00:04:17.790> here<00:04:18.769> was<00:04:19.769> sanitary<00:04:20.310> as<00:04:20.609> well

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.230 

now<00:04:24.419> star<00:04:24.990> San<00:04:25.290> is<00:04:25.470> a<00:04:25.500> nohrin<00:04:25.919> sanitizer<00:04:26.850> so

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
now star San is a nohrin sanitizer so

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.750 
now star San is a nohrin sanitizer so
you<00:04:27.330> don't<00:04:27.540> need<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:27.810> clean<00:04:28.020> it<00:04:28.199> out<00:04:28.320> I

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
you don't need to clean it out I

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.740 
you don't need to clean it out I
generally<00:04:29.760> like<00:04:29.910> to<00:04:30.090> clean<00:04:30.300> it<00:04:30.419> out<00:04:30.540> a<00:04:30.600> bit

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
generally like to clean it out a bit

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.860 
generally like to clean it out a bit
just<00:04:31.669> because<00:04:32.669> I<00:04:32.760> don't<00:04:32.940> like<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.270> idea<00:04:33.600> of

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
just because I don't like the idea of

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.920 
just because I don't like the idea of
any<00:04:34.050> unnecessary<00:04:35.060> chemical<00:04:36.060> going<00:04:36.419> into<00:04:36.780> my

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
any unnecessary chemical going into my

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:37.990 
any unnecessary chemical going into my
brew

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
brew

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.350 
brew
so<00:04:39.000> I'll<00:04:39.180> just<00:04:39.419> flush<00:04:39.660> out<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:39.990> line<00:04:40.200> a<00:04:41.360> little

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
so I'll just flush out the line a little

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.240 
so I'll just flush out the line a little
bit<00:04:43.310> just<00:04:44.310> by<00:04:44.490> running<00:04:44.729> some<00:04:45.120> beer<00:04:46.070> through<00:04:47.070> it

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
bit just by running some beer through it

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.969 
bit just by running some beer through it
and<00:04:47.970> over<00:04:48.330> into<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:49.050> bucket<00:04:49.919> down<00:04:50.040> there<00:04:51.979> it's

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
and over into the bucket down there it's

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.240 
and over into the bucket down there it's
that<00:04:53.280> one<00:04:53.460> more<00:04:53.669> time<00:04:54.500> these<00:04:55.500> stainless<00:04:55.860> steel

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
that one more time these stainless steel

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.760 
that one more time these stainless steel
couplings<00:04:56.789> are<00:04:58.220> great<00:05:00.229> really<00:05:01.229> easy<00:05:01.410> to<00:05:01.500> clean

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
couplings are great really easy to clean

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.150 
couplings are great really easy to clean
real<00:05:02.639> easy<00:05:02.820> to<00:05:02.940> take<00:05:03.150> apart<00:05:03.560> you<00:05:04.560> just<00:05:04.770> connect

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
real easy to take apart you just connect

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.460 
real easy to take apart you just connect
it<00:05:05.310> to<00:05:05.850> the<00:05:05.970> outline<00:05:06.449> so<00:05:06.810> it's<00:05:06.960> gonna<00:05:07.050> go<00:05:07.289> in

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
it to the outline so it's gonna go in

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.170 
it to the outline so it's gonna go in
the<00:05:07.590> tube<00:05:07.800> all<00:05:08.100> the<00:05:08.130> way<00:05:08.280> to<00:05:08.430> the<00:05:08.669> bottom<00:05:08.880> of

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
the tube all the way to the bottom of

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:15.020 
the tube all the way to the bottom of
the<00:05:09.300> cake<00:05:10.850> relieve<00:05:11.850> the<00:05:12.120> pressure<00:05:13.639> and<00:05:14.639> start

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
the cake relieve the pressure and start

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.129 
the cake relieve the pressure and start
to<00:05:15.210> fill<00:05:15.389> it<00:05:16.729> you<00:05:17.729> can<00:05:17.910> purge<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.720> keg<00:05:19.110> a

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
to fill it you can purge the keg a

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:21.230 
to fill it you can purge the keg a
little<00:05:19.530> bit<00:05:19.680> with<00:05:19.830> co2<00:05:20.130> before<00:05:20.729> you<00:05:20.820> start<00:05:21.120> to

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
little bit with co2 before you start to

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.930 
little bit with co2 before you start to
fill<00:05:21.419> it<00:05:21.599> just<00:05:21.780> to<00:05:22.470> flush<00:05:22.710> all<00:05:22.919> the<00:05:23.070> air<00:05:23.370> out<00:05:23.400> as

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
fill it just to flush all the air out as

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.080 
fill it just to flush all the air out as
well<00:05:24.599> so<00:05:24.919> we've<00:05:25.919> got<00:05:26.099> the<00:05:26.220> bleed<00:05:26.430> line<00:05:26.669> open

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
well so we've got the bleed line open

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.730 
well so we've got the bleed line open
we're<00:05:27.210> gonna<00:05:27.300> open<00:05:27.660> it<00:05:27.780> up<00:05:27.900> and<00:05:28.169> just<00:05:28.320> look<00:05:28.560> at

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
we're gonna open it up and just look at

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.379 
we're gonna open it up and just look at
it<00:05:28.919> in<00:05:29.010> a<00:05:29.070> few<00:05:29.099> minutes<00:05:29.610> just<00:05:29.729> to<00:05:29.910> see<00:05:30.090> where

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
it in a few minutes just to see where

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:35.000 
it in a few minutes just to see where
the<00:05:30.660> level<00:05:31.440> is<00:05:33.110> you<00:05:34.110> can<00:05:34.229> hear<00:05:34.410> the<00:05:34.560> regulator

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
the level is you can hear the regulator

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.640 
the level is you can hear the regulator
is<00:05:35.220> pumping<00:05:35.700> co2<00:05:36.030> into<00:05:36.539> the<00:05:36.570> top<00:05:36.840> here<00:05:37.169> to

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
is pumping co2 into the top here to

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.909 
is pumping co2 into the top here to
displace<00:05:38.099> it<00:05:38.310> and<00:05:38.460> push<00:05:38.870> the<00:05:39.870> all<00:05:40.440> the<00:05:40.710> beer

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
displace it and push the all the beer

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:43.070 
displace it and push the all the beer
over<00:05:40.950> once<00:05:41.639> the<00:05:41.940> water<00:05:42.180> level<00:05:42.570> or<00:05:42.750> the<00:05:42.900> beer

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
over once the water level or the beer

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.810 
over once the water level or the beer
level<00:05:43.260> gets<00:05:43.620> below<00:05:43.950> the<00:05:44.160> top<00:05:44.340> of<00:05:44.370> the<00:05:44.610> keg

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
level gets below the top of the keg

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.550 
level gets below the top of the keg
you'd<00:05:45.060> have<00:05:45.180> a<00:05:45.270> hard<00:05:45.450> time<00:05:45.690> getting<00:05:45.960> this<00:05:46.229> over

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
you'd have a hard time getting this over

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.010 
you'd have a hard time getting this over
unless<00:05:46.740> you<00:05:46.950> drop<00:05:47.220> the<00:05:47.400> keg<00:05:47.610> a<00:05:47.639> bit<00:05:47.910> lower<00:05:48.090> but

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
unless you drop the keg a bit lower but

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.260 
unless you drop the keg a bit lower but
with<00:05:49.169> the<00:05:49.260> pressure<00:05:49.530> of<00:05:49.740> the<00:05:49.950> gas<00:05:50.370> inside<00:05:51.030> the

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
with the pressure of the gas inside the

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.909 
with the pressure of the gas inside the
three<00:05:51.510> and<00:05:51.660> one<00:05:51.810> it<00:05:51.990> just<00:05:52.020> keeps<00:05:52.380> pushing<00:05:52.680> it

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
three and one it just keeps pushing it

00:05:52.919 --> 00:06:00.620 
three and one it just keeps pushing it
over<00:05:53.039> into<00:05:53.400> the<00:05:53.639> keg<00:05:57.950> okay<00:05:58.950> so<00:05:59.639> that's<00:05:59.970> full

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
over into the keg okay so that's full

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:07.940 
over into the keg okay so that's full
I'll<00:06:01.169> close<00:06:01.680> that<00:06:01.710> valve<00:06:06.470> see<00:06:07.470> on<00:06:07.590> the<00:06:07.710> first

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
I'll close that valve see on the first

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.029 
I'll close that valve see on the first
keg<00:06:08.250> off

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:23.909 

that's<00:06:13.039> one<00:06:13.369> keg<00:06:13.699> already<00:06:14.089> depressurise

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:34.389 

connect<00:06:24.919> it<00:06:25.099> to<00:06:25.279> the<00:06:25.399> second<00:06:25.819> cake<00:06:32.979> okay<00:06:33.979> so<00:06:34.039> we

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:34.399 
connect it to the second cake okay so we

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:40.509 
connect it to the second cake okay so we
have<00:06:34.989> just<00:06:35.989> about<00:06:36.289> our<00:06:37.119> 38<00:06:38.119> litres<00:06:39.219> and<00:06:40.219> 10

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:40.519 
have just about our 38 litres and 10

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:46.659 
have just about our 38 litres and 10
gallons<00:06:44.769> must<00:06:45.769> have<00:06:45.919> a<00:06:45.979> little<00:06:46.219> bit<00:06:46.339> left<00:06:46.519> over

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:46.669 
gallons must have a little bit left over

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:51.939 
gallons must have a little bit left over
inside<00:06:47.119> the<00:06:47.179> fermenter<00:06:50.469> as<00:06:51.469> soon<00:06:51.649> as<00:06:51.769> this<00:06:51.889> is

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:51.949 
inside the fermenter as soon as this is

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:54.189 
inside the fermenter as soon as this is
done<00:06:52.099> here<00:06:52.610> in<00:06:52.699> a<00:06:52.759> minute<00:06:52.909> I'm<00:06:53.360> gonna<00:06:53.569> take<00:06:54.079> the

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:54.199 
done here in a minute I'm gonna take the
