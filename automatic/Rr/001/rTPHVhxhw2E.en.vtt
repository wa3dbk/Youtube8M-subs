see<00:01:58.020> here<00:01:59.179> this<00:02:00.179> is<00:02:00.239> I<00:02:00.599> broke<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.349> once<00:02:01.560> when

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
see here this is I broke this once when

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.649 
see here this is I broke this once when
I<00:02:02.429> was<00:02:02.610> cleaning<00:02:02.789> and<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.090> was<00:02:03.209> opening<00:02:03.539> the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
I was cleaning and I was opening the

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:03.919 
I was cleaning and I was opening the
door

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
door

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:10.759 
door
and<00:02:04.130> then<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:06.560> I<00:02:08.090> also<00:02:09.090> heard<00:02:09.299> that<00:02:09.769> kids

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
and then I just I also heard that kids

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.380 
and then I just I also heard that kids
sometimes<00:02:11.280> lick<00:02:11.940> their<00:02:12.090> fingers<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:14.120> pokes<00:02:15.120> a

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
sometimes lick their fingers and pokes a

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.280 
sometimes lick their fingers and pokes a
hole<00:02:15.620> so<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.920> doesn't<00:02:17.160> make<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.310> sound<00:02:17.519> but<00:02:18.290> yeah

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
hole so it doesn't make a sound but yeah

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.020 
hole so it doesn't make a sound but yeah
it<00:02:19.350> as<00:02:19.889> you<00:02:20.069> can<00:02:20.250> see<00:02:20.370> it's<00:02:20.489> a<00:02:20.609> lot<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.790> holes

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
it as you can see it's a lot of holes

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.069 
it as you can see it's a lot of holes
and<00:02:21.269> stuff<00:02:21.389> breaks<00:02:21.959> previously<00:02:22.819> and<00:02:24.079> that's

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
and stuff breaks previously and that's

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:30.140 
and stuff breaks previously and that's
why<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:26.150> probably<00:02:27.150> heard<00:02:28.160> sometimes<00:02:29.160> in<00:02:30.030> my

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
why you probably heard sometimes in my

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.330 
why you probably heard sometimes in my
other<00:02:30.329> videos<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:31.440> television<00:02:32.100> from<00:02:32.250> the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
other videos the television from the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.360 
other videos the television from the
grandfather<00:02:32.850> on<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.989> side<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.230> that<00:02:34.440> at<00:02:35.130> wall

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
grandfather on the side of that at wall

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.180 
grandfather on the side of that at wall
because<00:02:35.720> it's<00:02:36.720> breaking<00:02:36.989> practically<00:02:37.859> no

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
because it's breaking practically no
