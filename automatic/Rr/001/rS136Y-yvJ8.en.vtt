this<00:00:08.700> week's<00:00:08.940> video<00:00:09.269> we're<00:00:09.480> talking<00:00:09.840> about

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
this week's video we're talking about

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.350 
this week's video we're talking about
the<00:00:10.559> inductance<00:00:11.130> setting<00:00:11.490> on<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.639> MIG<00:00:11.880> welder<00:00:11.910> a

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
the inductance setting on a MIG welder a

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.480 
the inductance setting on a MIG welder a
lot<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.019> new<00:00:13.170> inverters<00:00:13.650> have<00:00:13.740> inductance

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
lot of the new inverters have inductance

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.890 
lot of the new inverters have inductance
setting<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.000> it's<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.210> good<00:00:15.360> setting<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.750> have

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
setting and it's a good setting to have

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.330 
setting and it's a good setting to have
so<00:00:16.379> we're<00:00:16.500> going<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.710> try<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.890> explain<00:00:17.070> a

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
so we're going to try to explain a

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.769 
so we're going to try to explain a
little<00:00:17.520> bit<00:00:17.730> about<00:00:17.880> what<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.090> does<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.690> how

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
little bit about what that does and how

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.660 
little bit about what that does and how
it<00:00:18.810> winds<00:00:19.230> up<00:00:19.380> looking<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.890> final<00:00:20.220> outcome

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
it winds up looking in the final outcome

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.870 
it winds up looking in the final outcome
I'll<00:00:21.539> run<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.020> joint<00:00:22.740> or<00:00:22.920> two<00:00:23.070> with<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> very<00:00:23.640> low

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
I'll run a joint or two with a very low

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.640 
I'll run a joint or two with a very low
inductance<00:00:24.390> setting<00:00:24.750> as<00:00:24.900> well<00:00:25.080> as<00:00:25.230> some<00:00:25.500> with

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
inductance setting as well as some with

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.320 
inductance setting as well as some with
a<00:00:25.680> very<00:00:25.920> high<00:00:26.189> inductance<00:00:26.670> setting<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.119> kind

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
a very high inductance setting to kind

gas with a high inductance setting and

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.780 
gas with a high inductance setting and
we'll<00:00:34.500> talk<00:00:34.649> about<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:34.950> along<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.520> way<00:00:35.640> and

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
we'll talk about that along the way and

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.190 
we'll talk about that along the way and
what<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.030> means<00:00:36.300> now<00:00:36.480> this<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.870> settings

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
what that means now this is the settings

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.940 
what that means now this is the settings
I<00:00:37.320> use<00:00:37.530> with<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.860> c25<00:00:38.489> gas<00:00:39.020> to<00:00:40.020> 65<00:00:40.530> inches<00:00:40.890> a

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
I use with the c25 gas to 65 inches a

going to do I'm going to set the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.720 
going to do I'm going to set the
inductance<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.570> 95<00:00:52.260> which<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.280> pretty<00:00:53.489> high

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
inductance to 95 which is pretty high

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.209 
inductance to 95 which is pretty high
but<00:00:54.059> for<00:00:54.719> an<00:00:54.780> outside<00:00:55.140> quarter<00:00:55.530> joint<00:00:55.829> like

this and quarter-inch steel it lets it
wet<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.129> really<00:00:59.430> nicely<00:00:59.670> it's<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.660> kind<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.899> a

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
wet in really nicely it's a kind of a

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.349 
wet in really nicely it's a kind of a
soft<00:01:01.320> dark<00:01:01.649> kind<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.550> lets<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.850> space<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
soft dark kind of lets you space the

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.880 
soft dark kind of lets you space the
ripples<00:01:03.690> out<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.870> little<00:01:04.110> bit<00:01:04.320> doesn't<00:01:04.559> crown

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
ripples out a little bit doesn't crown

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
also called C 25 gas and it lets you you

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.359 
also called C 25 gas and it lets you you
know<00:01:15.750> make<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> nice<00:01:16.530> bead<00:01:16.799> width<00:01:17.040> with<00:01:17.340> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
know make a nice bead width with a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.730 
know make a nice bead width with a
ripple<00:01:18.299> spacing<00:01:18.780> nice<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.229> depending<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:19.590> how

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
ripple spacing nice and depending on how

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.969 
ripple spacing nice and depending on how
how<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.340> use<00:01:20.580> your<00:01:20.759> technique<00:01:21.180> but<00:01:22.049> now<00:01:22.799> we're

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
how you use your technique but now we're

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.010 
how you use your technique but now we're
going<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.189> run<00:01:23.340> one<00:01:23.580> really<00:01:24.420> low<00:01:24.600> inductance

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
going to run one really low inductance

setting of five trying to use about the
same<00:01:27.750> technique<00:01:28.290> but<00:01:28.590> since<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.040> manual

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
same technique but since this is manual

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.890 
same technique but since this is manual
welding<00:01:29.700> there's<00:01:30.360> going<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.540> be<00:01:30.600> some

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
welding there's going to be some

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.630 
welding there's going to be some
differences<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.740> ripple<00:01:32.009> spacing<00:01:32.490> and

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
differences in the ripple spacing and

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.450 
differences in the ripple spacing and
whatnot<00:01:33.390> it's<00:01:34.229> hard<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.500> duplicate<00:01:35.009> one<00:01:35.220> thing

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
whatnot it's hard to duplicate one thing

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.039 
whatnot it's hard to duplicate one thing
after<00:01:35.759> another<00:01:35.790> when<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.750> know<00:01:36.869> when

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
after another when you you know when

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.899 
after another when you you know when
it's<00:01:37.200> manual<00:01:37.470> but<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:37.860> already<00:01:38.250> see<00:01:38.670> a

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
it's manual but you can already see a

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.330 
it's manual but you can already see a
difference<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:40.049> spatter<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:41.070> hear<00:01:41.310> a

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
the frequency higher on a TIG welder

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.840 
the frequency higher on a TIG welder
because<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.380> increases<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.040> frequency<00:01:47.220> at

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
because it increases the frequency at

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.569

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
little bit more spatter makes it crown

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.100 
little bit more spatter makes it crown
up<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.520> little<00:01:56.700> bit<00:01:56.850> more<00:01:57.060> but<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:57.899> certain

there<00:03:12.370> you<00:03:12.520> can<00:03:12.670> go<00:03:12.940> ahead<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:13.240> use<00:03:13.360> pretty

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
there you can go ahead and use pretty

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.840 
there you can go ahead and use pretty
much<00:03:13.720> your<00:03:13.990> regular<00:03:14.320> regulator<00:03:14.950> so<00:03:15.700> I'm

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
inductance to ninety I tried it all the

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.630 
inductance to ninety I tried it all the
way<00:03:23.320> up<00:03:23.350> to<00:03:23.590> max<00:03:23.830> and<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.160> didn't<00:03:24.370> work<00:03:24.400> quite

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
way up to max and it didn't work quite

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.880 
way up to max and it didn't work quite
as<00:03:24.880> well<00:03:24.910> at<00:03:25.780> a<00:03:25.840> hundred<00:03:26.080> so<00:03:26.320> I<00:03:26.350> backed<00:03:26.650> it<00:03:26.800> off

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
as well at a hundred so I backed it off

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.680 
as well at a hundred so I backed it off
just<00:03:27.070> to<00:03:27.250> ninety<00:03:27.550> and<00:03:27.670> it<00:03:27.760> worked<00:03:28.300> out<00:03:28.450> pretty

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
just to ninety and it worked out pretty

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.020 
just to ninety and it worked out pretty
well<00:03:28.810> but<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.650> wire<00:03:29.920> feed<00:03:30.190> speed<00:03:30.250> was<00:03:30.790> way<00:03:30.970> too

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
well but the wire feed speed was way too

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.350 
well but the wire feed speed was way too
high<00:03:31.390> so<00:03:32.200> I<00:03:32.230> wound<00:03:32.470> up<00:03:32.620> having<00:03:32.830> to<00:03:33.160> I<00:03:33.640> wound<00:03:34.209> up

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
high so I wound up having to I wound up

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.210 
high so I wound up having to I wound up
having<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.810> turn<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.230> wire<00:03:35.530> feed<00:03:35.800> speed<00:03:35.830> down

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
having to turn the wire feed speed down

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.140 
having to turn the wire feed speed down
to<00:03:36.250> 190<00:03:36.580> and<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.420> voltage<00:03:37.750> up<00:03:37.930> to<00:03:38.290> 21

a<00:04:04.060> really<00:04:04.299> good<00:04:04.420> setting<00:04:05.019> but<00:04:05.200> once<00:04:05.350> you<00:04:05.470> find

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
a really good setting but once you find

a really good setting but once you find
that<00:04:05.830> it's<00:04:06.040> not<00:04:06.190> too<00:04:06.400> bad<00:04:06.640> I'm<00:04:07.150> doing<00:04:07.390> a<00:04:07.450> little

a<00:04:17.410> lot<00:04:17.590> more<00:04:17.830> like<00:04:18.100> c25<00:04:18.820> and<00:04:19.380> there<00:04:20.380> are

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
a lot more like c25 and there are

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.290 
a lot more like c25 and there are
different<00:04:20.859> ripple<00:04:21.250> spacings<00:04:21.789> here<00:04:22.120> and

different ripple spacings here and

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.380 
different ripple spacings here and
that's<00:04:22.930> kind<00:04:23.140> of<00:04:23.200> a<00:04:23.289> preference<00:04:23.560> and<00:04:24.390> actually

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
that's kind of a preference and actually
