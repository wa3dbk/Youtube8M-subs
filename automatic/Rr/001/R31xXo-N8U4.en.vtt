00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.950
 hello guys I sound and baritones of the 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.900
 top less old vic or the top five 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.880
 composed of semi-clips that note us all 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.340
 the weeks that this top is seeing 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.380
 five cinquew.it I was too sour 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.939
 ya prescription linking now I would say 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.860
 as usual, starting with the fifth 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.869
 position that leads us to these institutions 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.730
 virtual is found on black ops with a 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.950
 bartender me with thermal sight on hi jack 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.899
 and overlooks this corridor 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.640
 he takes a triple bill then concludes 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.079
 the clip with a nice quot fit a clip 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.489
 which I think deserved the fifth 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.190
 position now we leave immediately 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.470
 fourth clip that we will trinacria door 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.840
 ukhov sorry if I ever spoke the 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.500
 your name found on biolab with a 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.820
 sm 1 modified is definitely not that 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.170
 traditional because as you see the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.170
 a little different viewfinder I can't tell you 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.580
 exactly which model of sm 1 is but 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.220
 I think it matters little 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.049
 bring me the weapon clip if it is thousands 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.790
 send a few sent more serious emails 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.100
 are the comments you like and 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.079
 in fact it brings us quite a few kilos in 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.079
 little time on advanced warfare 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:15.060
 as you can see here, it does not look good 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.590
 in fact exaggerate if I put it there 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.020
 fourth position not in more positions 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.659
 high because to deserve the position 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.249
 higher with a clip like that you have to 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.319
 make you really a known massacre is me 

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:26.759
 arrived I think you put it to the 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:28.259
 second position 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.200
 the clip is over possible height 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.179
 we find that jack had already brought us 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.100
 two clips in the last top is on 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.380
 black ops 2 on studios and was not jean 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.149
 cap seats in hand makes a bit of a trick then 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.429
 concludes the clip with his by sr 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.219
 thermal obviously in no purpose to 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.600
 second position we find price not 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:47.310
 I was able to read the full name 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.659
 so maybe he'll write his name 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.209
 in the comments you will see that it was chosen 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.159
 for us there this top with a pretty 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:55.740
 trick shot on advanced order su crimen 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.329
 with the pretty cute mors in my opinion 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.499
 unfortunately deserved the second position 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.509
 the quality and hurley that was not the 

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:02.039
 maximum as it is not the maximum and also the 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.779
 quality of this clip that I think 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.819
 however it deserves the first position in easy 

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:07.679
 brings a triple one xpr e 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.690
 then a 5 men on screen 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.569
 the top until I hope you enjoyed it 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.269
 sarkozy 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.739
