00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.529
 Hey, how are you welcome? 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.089
 back to my channel and good in this 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:09.099
 occasion we are in the tutorial of how 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:14.670
 install the engines for the car touring 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:14.670
 custom zombie hardware we go there 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.150
 first good to go to the page 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.109
 that I'm going to leave you in the description 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.880
 flame boom x diagonal dot modes 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.070
 forum who knows what else but good that 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.489
 I'll leave it in the fabric description 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.610
 and well there are two ways I'm going to teach 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:36.760
 the two but good the first is to get 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:40.149
 here where youtube says xmap manager 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:44.109
 and he's going to send this thing to this 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:48.370
 then you give him in here x axis the 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:51.149
 newer or that is the x manager axis of 1.4 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:55.269
 point 0 in this case that is the newest 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.519
 and here they are going to download it here they are going to 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:01.000
 leave something to download they say that 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:05.409
 come out here they will give you in download file 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.330
 and I do it because I already have it and it's going 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.870
 to leave something like this 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.270
 gx Manager 1.3 point 4 as seen already 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.350
 I have updated as much as more 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.480
 I can 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.740
 the most recent rather 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.340
 and they dispute as administrator 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.340
 10 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.549
 and this is going to come out, we hope that 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.210
 load and as you can see here are the maps 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:35.360
 of gx and those of which are made by 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.640
 the community like these in this case I 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.610
 I'm going to download this 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.130
 they give it in download select map and it goes 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.350
 start to download 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.960
 with this form you do not have to do anything 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.390
 they just have to just wait 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.250
 to be downloaded and only only 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.509
 installs only gets in the folder of 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.509
 fashion but good 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.710
 and look good as it has finished 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.770
 download and here everything is shown already 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.270
 is already had just downloaded not 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.060
 they have to do nothing just get into the 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.460
 color and world work ethics in mods and what 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.190
 they launch but good now we go with the 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.800
 second form 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.640
 well the second way they go to this 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.710
 tab that says maps and here they go to go 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.160
 to look for a map that does not have next 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:27.620
 manager that is just normal me in 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.569
 this case I'm going to click on rise 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.260
 because I have been told that it is very good 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.450
 Map 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.519
 let's see then here is it 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.340
 opening of new stability postcard 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:41.180
 and they will say once a description of what 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.689
 what is the map and all that 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.260
 I do not know if they can put a trailer or something 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:49.200
 well but good 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.829
 here it says to download and as you can see there 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.930
 two mega options and without clicking on this 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.569
 case I will choose if I step on it because it gives me 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.739
 is giving me problems I do not know why 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.150
 but well let's see how it is going to 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.340
 wake up 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.810
 good here is the soap like defile 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.069
 rice point x then it gives nothing 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.550
 they give to toulon av 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:13.880
 and the download will begin in this 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.240
 the bottom 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.470
 an elevator 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.470
 We wait for it to download 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.630
 and an idea I have same for the jce in my 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.260
 needle folder x comic and maps 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.670
 and good to win plan to execute as 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.569
 administrator 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.690
 and good is going to say windows is more good 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.069
 nothing more information and leonardo and any 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.690
 way because it has no virus and nothing of 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:46.510
 windows I do not know why he criticizes like that but 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.510
 you have nothing to gain that you want 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.430
 to the same as bmx modernist ledesma 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.470
 brushes blah blah 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.650
 I'm a gwinnett 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.780
 and the typical thing 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.959
 is being downloaded and when 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.049
 download, we're good, it's just 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.450
 settle and we will see you in fine 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.319
 he will not leave this here anymore 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.379
 we can erase this 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.840
 then leave this and well I'm going to stop 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:20.350
 record to then go to the 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.639
 game that we now do good I 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.400
 We came back and as you can see we are with the 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.900
 mode with the mold rice then let's 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.680
 show how you see here is the map that 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.390
 download before with 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.360
 with the look x map 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.710
 loader I think that thing is called good 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.110
 that teaches them at the beginning but good 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:41.300
 how it works perfectly has to 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:45.270
 depend on whatever it is has has its 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:48.840
 bottom all your options then we go 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:52.849
 to see to show him runs well and everything and 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:56.779
 well, it does not come out of that of activision 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:05:00.200
 and as you can see, it runs perfectly already 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:05:02.590
 we are on the wife map 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:06.100
 everything works fine 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.850
 We are here normally for any 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.850
 zombie brand 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:18.720
 I hope you liked that they liked it 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.220
 and if they do not do nothing but good 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.920
 maybe it was this map 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.100
 you probably know but good until 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.100
 then
