00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.760
 every year 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.599
 daily we hear the headlines 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.610
 we see the tears and we see the despair while the story is 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:15.669
 unwind before our eyes 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:20.100
 like the hands of a potter who is behind the events that mold 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:21.169
 our world 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:23.749
 the obvious is always in sight 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:27.529
 but the fate of the Soviet empire rests on the will of these 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.439
 champions of change 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.410
 who is responsible for the spiritual peace among those before in the minute 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.940
 2 an explosive growth of Christianity in such challenging places 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.100
 history is full of secrets and questions without answers for those who do not 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.180
 can discern spiritually 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.080
 but for intercessors like esther gil the past is simply an account 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.090
 of the hidden work of God 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.460
 through the prayers of those who have been with passion in front of 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.310
 the 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.780
 other of the so-called shakers of this world this and two other tracks of 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.870
 western virginia have been moving the hand that moves this world 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.330
 with prayer 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.520
 in moments the prayer has been a battle 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.770
 but God has shown them that not only has it been the best thing they have done if it is not 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.760
 The only thing they can do a-data almeriense de sochi instances mujeres

 of the union of women 26 from west virginia 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.060
 despite we are going to have an association with another country and we did not have resources to 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.690
 to handle like the others so we look at what resources we have and the only 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.190
 that we found was prayer the center has its first commitment was 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.780
 pray for three years for a country and we chose a concert 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.540
 here they prayed 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.560
 for when the time of prayer commitment was nearing its end 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.050
 mongolia began to develop from one of the least repressive countries 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.140
 and communists of the world to an explosive harvest field esther is convinced

 thanks to those who constantly raised their voices towards him 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.050
 well we started to see some said there was the possibility bikini 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.060
 gathered in the mind 4 cristian is a judge in the world 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.179

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:27.889

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:31.460

 thank you parents for hour with the country 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.879
 this is very serious there is again 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:58.740
 although many years have passed 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.920
 the prayers are still rising for the people of Mongolia 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.059
 but as an attempt ray of light 

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:09.529
 these and their prayer partners have set their sights on perhaps the greatest 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:11.039
 challenge so far 

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:14.369
 the political Buddhists of the nation of Bhutan 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:16.919
 history will be repeated 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:21.999
 we know that God is answering the pressures because the cadiz listen 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:24.449
 Mons recently in 20 years 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:29.649
 that the government is concerned about the growth and Christianity in that country 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:32.840
 it stays so we know there are new believers 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.840
 I feel happy 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.649
 in the hands of the potter 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:43.479
 the story belongs to the intercessors 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:47.699
 but if all Christians voluntarily embrace the call to do
