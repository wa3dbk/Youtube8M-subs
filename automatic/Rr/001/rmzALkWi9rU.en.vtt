00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.380
Ray:  What's up guys, it's Ray and Gavin from AchievementHunter.com

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.500
Gavin: This is our first video

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.580
together Ray
Ray: This is our first video.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:05.080
together, and I am

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:05.840
excited.
Gavin: I am moist.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.380
Ray: We are gonna... You too? Alright we are gonna do "The Lie" achievement in Minecraft

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.300
which requires you to make a... make a cake.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.100
Gavin: Speaking of moist,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.460
this cake is very moist.
Ray: Speaking of.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.100
Ray: Now, I brought you in because you are the only one in the office.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.900
that's played Minecraft for an extended period of time.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.380
Gavin: I have played it all... I played hours of it on the PC

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.380
I've not played on the

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.880
Xbox but it looks very good
Ray: Ohh it's...

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.380
O nice i like mine craft this game really makes you get creative

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.240
Ray: It does look very good
Gavin: It looks... I'm

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.060
Ray: If you're looking for some
Gavin: not worried about it.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.080
Ray: If you're looking for some hardcore, like, Minecraft action

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.080
I'm guessing, like, going on the PC would be better

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.260
cause you got like mods and all that shit.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.720
Ray: But
Gavin: You know, I never really got into mods though, I just liked vanilla Minecraft.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.000
Ray: Oh, if you like vanilla Minecraft

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.900
then 360 is..
Gavin: I also... I also like vanilla cake.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.380
Ray: Vanilla cake is good.  There is...
Gavin: Is there vanilla in this cake?

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.969
Ray: There's is vanilla frosting on the cake.  So...
Gavin: That is good.

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.539
Ray: First thing you gotta do to make a cake, you to get
some iron ore you find it randomly just

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.919
go mining, hence Minecraft
Gavin: Yep... yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:50.459
and then when you find that you go to your little shithole

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.340
apartment that I made here.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.920
Make a furnace
Gavin: I like your floor made of sand.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.570
Ray: Yea, well listen
Gavin: That's a nice touch.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.870
listen as a Puerto Rican you just take
the floor as you can all right maybe one

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.390
day I'll be able to afford dirt. Anyway, you mine some
iron ore and to make iron inguns

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.210
Ray: Inguns?

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.710
Gavin: Ingots.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.630
Ray: Ingots?  Bars.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.970
Gavin: Is this for your bucket in this video?

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.790
Ray: This is for your bucket.  So melt

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.970
that or whatever you make the iron bars
and you need

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.860
Gavin: you're currently smelting.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.360
Ray: I'm smelting? Is?

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.920
Gavin: In your furnace.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.860
Ray: In my furnace
in my 3 by 3 apartment.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.620
Gavin: Yep.
Ray: So, ya

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.450
need uh, nine iron bars to make three
buckets so here i am doing and I sped it

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.649
up a little bit but that's what the
process looks like and then you go to your

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.740
Gavin: You need coal as well.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.740
Ray: You do need coal
Gavin: To fuel your furnace

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.590
Gavin: Or with like wood

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.579
You can burn trees
Ray: Yeah, you burn wood and wood to make coal, I think, which makes perfect sense

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.049
Gavin: You can make charcoal from wood

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.789
Ray: Yeah
Gavin: Or you could mine coal from rock.

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:36.409
Ray: See, this is why I brought you on

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.409
Gavin: Dropping knowledge on you, Ray, right now.

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.409
Ray: You're like a Minecraft Wikipedia right here.

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.669
I had to pull up Minecraft Wikipedia to learn all this stuff.

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:43.209
So anyway...

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.760
Ray: Once you make the buckets, you need to get the milk from the cows.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.760
Gavin: That cow looks- He knows what you're up to.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.760
Ray: He knows I'm gonna fucking feel him up and get the milk.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.280
Ray: Thankfully though, I thought it had to be different cows,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.280
Ray: But you can use the same cow

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.720
Ray:You just walk up with your bucket and hit left trigger

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.720
can use the same count you just walk up with your bucket

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.100
they have plenty of milk

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.180
let me tell you so um

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.720
There you go, your three milk buckets

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.680
so that is done

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.240
Next we have to plant the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.460
get some seeds

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.440
Get some wheat going on so
