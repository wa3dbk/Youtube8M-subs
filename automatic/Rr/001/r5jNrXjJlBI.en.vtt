everything for this particular
foundation<00:00:40.930> we<00:00:41.890> chose<00:00:42.100> to<00:00:42.280> use<00:00:42.430> a<00:00:42.640> cement<00:00:43.090> and

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270

lime<00:00:43.450> mixture<00:00:43.809> I<00:00:44.080> like<00:00:44.739> lime<00:00:45.070> because<00:00:45.550> of<00:00:45.850> its

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
lime mixture I like lime because of its

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.960 
lime mixture I like lime because of its
hydroscopic<00:00:46.770> capabilities<00:00:47.770> of<00:00:48.010> sucking

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970

reminder<00:01:17.100> before<00:01:18.100> you<00:01:18.220> set<00:01:18.430> your<00:01:18.550> foundation

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
reminder before you set your foundation

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.570 
reminder before you set your foundation
is<00:01:19.720> to<00:01:19.960> organize<00:01:20.440> all<00:01:20.740> your<00:01:20.770> plumbing<00:01:21.190> and

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
is to organize all your plumbing and

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.609 
is to organize all your plumbing and
your<00:01:22.000> piping<00:01:22.420> and<00:01:22.660> your<00:01:22.840> electrical<00:01:23.259> conduit

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
your piping and your electrical conduit

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.859 
your piping and your electrical conduit
ahead<00:01:24.100> of<00:01:24.250> time<00:01:24.430> so<00:01:24.670> that<00:01:25.270> you<00:01:25.539> don't<00:01:25.690> have<00:01:25.750> to

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
ahead of time so that you don't have to

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.350 
ahead of time so that you don't have to
worry<00:01:26.050> about<00:01:26.170> it<00:01:26.380> later<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.670> we<00:01:27.789> designed<00:01:28.180> this

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
worry about it later so we designed this

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.359 
worry about it later so we designed this
method<00:01:28.690> of<00:01:28.780> construction<00:01:29.350> so<00:01:29.950> that<00:01:30.100> all<00:01:30.250> the

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
method of construction so that all the

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.820 
method of construction so that all the
materials<00:01:30.910> are<00:01:31.000> easy<00:01:31.240> to<00:01:31.420> gather<00:01:31.649> take<00:01:32.649> for

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
materials are easy to gather take for

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.320 
materials are easy to gather take for
example<00:01:32.860> if<00:01:33.369> we<00:01:33.460> wanted<00:01:33.670> to<00:01:33.729> cut<00:01:33.940> this<00:01:34.060> tree

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
example if we wanted to cut this tree

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.930 
example if we wanted to cut this tree
down<00:01:34.509> and<00:01:34.830> utilize<00:01:35.830> it<00:01:35.860> for<00:01:36.009> the<00:01:36.190> posts<00:01:36.640> or<00:01:36.820> the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
down and utilize it for the posts or the

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.510 
down and utilize it for the posts or the
beams<00:01:37.149> so<00:01:38.080> much<00:01:38.320> endeavor<00:01:38.680> is<00:01:38.890> going<00:01:39.220> to<00:01:39.310> be

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
beams so much endeavor is going to be

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.789 
beams so much endeavor is going to be
needed<00:01:39.820> to<00:01:39.850> cut<00:01:40.390> this<00:01:40.510> down<00:01:40.750> and<00:01:41.140> so<00:01:41.619> much

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
needed to cut this down and so much

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.340 
needed to cut this down and so much
large<00:01:42.369> machinery<00:01:42.820> and<00:01:43.240> a<00:01:43.930> large

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
large machinery and a large

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.280 
large machinery and a large
environmental<00:01:45.100> impact<00:01:45.460> would<00:01:45.820> be<00:01:45.880> caused<00:01:46.720> by

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
environmental impact would be caused by

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.289 
environmental impact would be caused by
trying<00:01:47.530> to<00:01:47.650> use<00:01:47.799> this<00:01:47.979> wood<00:01:48.189> so<00:01:48.909> we're<00:01:49.119> trying

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
trying to use this wood so we're trying

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.990 
trying to use this wood so we're trying
to<00:01:49.390> utilize<00:01:49.860> small<00:01:50.860> eat<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:51.670> handle

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
to utilize small eat the handle

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.820 
to utilize small eat the handle
materials<00:01:52.479> that<00:01:52.780> are<00:01:52.930> renewable<00:01:53.350> over<00:01:53.650> time

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
materials that are renewable over time

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.179 
materials that are renewable over time
and<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:55.810> can<00:01:56.020> see<00:01:56.170> for<00:01:56.320> example<00:01:56.409> that<00:01:56.830> these

I had was that when water hits this wall

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.780 
I had was that when water hits this wall
and<00:02:22.440> since<00:02:23.440> it's<00:02:23.769> going<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:23.950> have<00:02:24.160> soil<00:02:24.519> in<00:02:24.670> the
