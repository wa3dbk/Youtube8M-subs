white<00:00:30.990> shiny<00:00:31.590> lips<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:33.380> think<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.620> could

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
white shiny lips I think that you could

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.130 
white shiny lips I think that you could
also<00:00:34.920> use<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.370> regular<00:00:35.969> white<00:00:36.480> paint<00:00:36.780> if<00:00:37.020> you

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
also use a regular white paint if you

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.360 
also use a regular white paint if you
don't<00:00:37.320> have<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.800> sparkly<00:00:38.460> or<00:00:38.760> metallic<00:00:39.300> white

don't have a sparkly or metallic white
the<00:00:41.370> metallic<00:00:41.790> white<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.180> quite<00:00:42.480> nicely<00:00:42.809> for

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
the metallic white is quite nicely for

look slightly sinister this isn't meant

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.310 
look slightly sinister this isn't meant
to<00:01:47.509> be<00:01:47.600> a<00:01:48.580> scary<00:01:49.580> design<00:01:50.300> but<00:01:50.869> just<00:01:51.170> something

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
to be a scary design but just something

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.020 
to be a scary design but just something
a<00:01:51.500> little<00:01:51.649> bit<00:01:51.800> darker<00:01:51.979> that<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.460> boys<00:01:52.700> will

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
a little bit darker that the boys will

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.100 
a little bit darker that the boys will
like<00:01:54.610> so<00:01:55.610> now<00:01:55.790> I<00:01:55.820> have<00:01:55.939> black<00:01:56.390> on<00:01:56.630> my<00:01:56.780> sponge

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
like so now I have black on my sponge

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.510 
like so now I have black on my sponge
and<00:01:58.150> I'm<00:01:59.150> just<00:01:59.329> going<00:01:59.540> to<00:01:59.600> go<00:02:00.220> closer<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:01.369> the

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
and I'm just going to go closer to the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.370 
and I'm just going to go closer to the
eyes<00:02:01.850> again<00:02:02.329> with<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.140> black<00:02:03.409> and<00:02:03.770> blend<00:02:04.310> that

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
eyes again with the black and blend that

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.270 
eyes again with the black and blend that
towards<00:02:06.380> a<00:02:06.470> dark<00:02:06.710> blue<00:02:08.619> well<00:02:09.619> into<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:09.979> corner

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
towards a dark blue well into the corner

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.949 
towards a dark blue well into the corner
of<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.489> eyes<00:02:10.610> and<00:02:11.209> that<00:02:11.390> just<00:02:11.600> gives<00:02:11.660> the

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
of the eyes and that just gives the

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:19.839 
of the eyes and that just gives the
darkness<00:02:12.500> to<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.769> eyes

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.690 

and<00:02:20.849> that's<00:02:21.030> all<00:02:21.239> for<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.510> sponging<00:02:22.580> next<00:02:23.580> I

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
and that's all for the sponging next I

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.509 
and that's all for the sponging next I
get<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:24.150> number<00:02:24.690> two<00:02:24.959> round<00:02:25.260> brush<00:02:25.620> with<00:02:26.250> some

I'm<00:03:32.220> creating<00:03:32.940> a<00:03:33.320> large<00:03:34.400> starburst<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:35.820> this

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
I'm creating a large starburst and this

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.990 
I'm creating a large starburst and this
will<00:03:36.540> be<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.870> basis<00:03:37.350> for<00:03:37.380> my<00:03:38.390> snowflakes<00:03:41.000> I'm

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
will be the basis for my snowflakes I'm

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.610 
will be the basis for my snowflakes I'm
keeping<00:03:42.360> them<00:03:42.510> fairly<00:03:42.780> simple<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:43.500> this

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
keeping them fairly simple so this

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.760 
keeping them fairly simple so this
design<00:03:44.010> can<00:03:44.250> be<00:03:44.280> painted<00:03:44.700> quickly<00:03:45.590> you<00:03:46.590> can

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
design can be painted quickly you can

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.650 
design can be painted quickly you can
get<00:03:47.040> quite<00:03:47.340> intricate<00:03:47.730> with<00:03:48.000> snowflakes<00:03:48.480> if

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
get quite intricate with snowflakes if

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.060 
get quite intricate with snowflakes if
you<00:03:48.810> like<00:03:49.940> I'm<00:03:50.940> just<00:03:51.240> doing<00:03:51.420> a<00:03:51.480> quick<00:03:51.660> version

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.480 
you can see now I'm adding some little
tenderly<00:03:55.260> bits<00:03:55.970> to<00:03:56.970> each<00:03:57.120> of<00:03:57.330> the<00:03:57.510> starburst

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
tenderly bits to each of the starburst

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.360 
tenderly bits to each of the starburst
strokes<00:03:59.490> and<00:04:00.170> that<00:04:01.170> turns<00:04:01.530> that<00:04:01.830> star<00:04:02.100> burst

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
strokes and that turns that star burst

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.870 
strokes and that turns that star burst
into<00:04:02.760> a<00:04:02.790> snowflake<00:04:03.480> kind<00:04:04.380> of<00:04:04.500> design<00:04:07.880> so

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
into a snowflake kind of design so

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.730 
into a snowflake kind of design so
there's<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.150> nice<00:04:09.360> simple<00:04:09.600> snowflakes<00:04:10.410> that

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.370 
sparkly effect and with a nice fine
nozzle<00:06:27.640> I<00:06:27.880> can<00:06:28.300> really<00:06:28.570> put<00:06:28.780> it<00:06:28.870> exactly<00:06:28.990> where

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380 
nozzle I can really put it exactly where

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.270 
nozzle I can really put it exactly where
I<00:06:29.530> want<00:06:29.800> to<00:06:29.950> and<00:06:30.130> highlight<00:06:30.490> those<00:06:30.760> snowflakes

I want to and highlight those snowflakes

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.530 
I want to and highlight those snowflakes
you<00:06:33.280> could<00:06:33.490> use<00:06:33.670> a<00:06:33.700> white<00:06:34.060> glitter<00:06:34.450> I<00:06:36.540> think

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:37.540 
you could use a white glitter I think

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.190 
you could use a white glitter I think
this<00:06:37.660> looks<00:06:37.870> pretty<00:06:38.940> and<00:06:39.940> it's<00:06:40.240> still<00:06:40.450> boyish

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:41.200 
this looks pretty and it's still boyish

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:55.280 
this looks pretty and it's still boyish
enough<00:06:41.670> doesn't<00:06:42.670> make<00:06:42.940> it<00:06:43.150> a<00:06:43.210> girly<00:06:43.450> design

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:55.290 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.270 

beautiful

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 
beautiful

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.160 
beautiful
I<00:06:57.340> think<00:06:58.150> this<00:06:58.240> design<00:06:58.600> could<00:06:58.840> be<00:06:58.930> used
