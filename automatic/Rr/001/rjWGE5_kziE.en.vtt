00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello there are ideas for you again 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.290
 the editorial 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.859
 I wish you much fun 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.859
 look at 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:20.160
 I'll show you a lever pattern today 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:22.730
 with kinky rows on the right and knitted 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.010
 three colors 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:31.320
 I'm just knitting those 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.360
 work series and then I explain it like that 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.730
 and go 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.629
 The pattern must be divisible by four 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.829
 plus an extra mesh on the edge 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.469
 so that the pattern goes up +2 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.700
 So I have 19 stitches here 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:54.930
 not struck 16 by four lusti 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.059
 an additional mesh on the edge +2 edge 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.760
 meshes are 19 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.550
 if you work the whole thing in round 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.769
 So the mesh number just has to be 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.769
 be divisible by four 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.680
 You start now with red as I have 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.369
 here here always turns red blue 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.630
 and white off and per color will respectively 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.869
 two rows worked all the work 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.630
 I from the hitler 12 the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.500
 Rheintalstrecke I the first mass 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.869
 take off 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.600
 doing the path of loving the work with 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:41.549
 lead and make three stitches right again 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:46.350
 Lift the thread behind work 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:49.430
 with lead this is important again three 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.430
 most right 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.969
 three machines right lifting mesh and 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:04.450
 the thread just prevented work with 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:06.569
 lead three stitches right and their 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.550
 turn off 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:13.989
 in the back dirigent mesh 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.000
 knit the first stitch is back the 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.430
 lift up the mesh but we take off 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.470
 This time now the thread just before 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.840
 work with lead to him on the 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.810
 back one would lie in round 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.819
 would work here also the rides 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.239
 hindered work than lying on the 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:34.450
 inside the cap or whatever you want 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:37.900
 in rounds works the next three 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.060
 knit stitches right again here as well 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.400
 If you do the round you would 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.630
 These meshes between ports in 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.549
 every second stitch will knit left 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.950
 Now knit the back and forth 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:55.170
 always row right-hand stitches 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:58.630
 as it is usual in the circle right 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.530
 So three right stitches the lifting mesh 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:06.329
 three right stitches 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:09.519
 the lifting stitch and three right stitches 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:12.120
 and the lifting stitches and their mass 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.120
 take off 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.560
 Now it comes with lurking further 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:23.019
 knit the edge stitch where now 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.319
 put the lifting mesh so you 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:29.920
 starts now with two stitches right and 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:37.530
 works then only the pretty now 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:37.530
 three stitches on the right, three stitches on the right 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:46.960
 three stitches on the right lift musher and 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:51.390
 again twice right and the 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.890
 turn rhythmic off 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.860
 and now she is going back to the 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.560
 handbag going and the two stitches 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.200
 right and the lifting mesh will be back 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.950
 lifted but just now the thread again 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:11.700
 on the front of before work with 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:17.080
 lead three stitches right lifting people 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:21.550
 three stitches on the right, three stitches 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:26.880
 mesh-right lift mesh three stitches 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:29.800
 right and the edge mass take off 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.270
 Now it comes with white on 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:37.210
 The pattern repeats itself now 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:40.270
 So after the purse comes again 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:45.820
 Immediately prevented the lifting mesh rides 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:52.720
 work and the three maschen Rechtshilfe 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:57.610
 mesh three stitches right next to three 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:02.050
 marry right yeast mesh three stitches 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:04.800
 right around the lifting mesh and the hand 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:08.080
 take off 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:12.900
 knit by hand and start with 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:14.110
 a lifting mesh three stitches right 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:20.290
 take off 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:24.780
 take off three times right and so on 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:28.680
 just repeat the four rows 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.680
 and these three colors 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:40.180
 Now comes back to the red row 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.930
 You start with a handbag and 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:49.030
 just only again with two male right 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:53.940
 and a midwife three times legal assistance 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.940
 mesh three times from the right 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.770
 I think the logic of this pattern is 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:07.110
 clearly a fairly simple pattern though 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.110
 with a great effect 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.880
 I wish you much fun with it
