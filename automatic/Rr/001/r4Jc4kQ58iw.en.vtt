hey guys Here I am back again it's my
idea<00:00:03.780> of<00:00:04.520> instead<00:00:05.520> of<00:00:05.580> using<00:00:05.819> a<00:00:05.970> PWM<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:06.810> all

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080

idea of instead of using a PWM and all
that<00:00:07.259> stuff<00:00:07.470> which<00:00:08.130> is<00:00:08.250> extremely

complicated this is probably the

hurtin<00:02:48.150> on<00:02:48.270> you<00:02:48.980> so<00:02:49.980> this<00:02:50.700> is<00:02:50.880> my<00:02:51.090> answer<00:02:51.540> to

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
hurtin on you so this is my answer to

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.360 
hurtin on you so this is my answer to
the<00:02:51.810> PWM<00:02:52.850> now<00:02:53.930> what<00:02:54.930> I've<00:02:55.050> done<00:02:55.410> what<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:55.920> RC

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
the PWM now what I've done what the RC

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.449 
the PWM now what I've done what the RC
timing<00:02:57.330> circuit<00:02:57.540> here<00:02:57.950> instead<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.010> using<00:02:59.250> a

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
timing circuit here instead of using a

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.060 
timing circuit here instead of using a
fixed<00:02:59.880> resistor<00:03:00.060> I've<00:03:00.600> used<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:01.410> variable

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
fixed resistor I've used a variable

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.820 
fixed resistor I've used a variable
resistor<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.130> can<00:03:05.280> switch<00:03:05.550> in<00:03:05.790> other

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
resistor and you can switch in other

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.080 
resistor and you can switch in other
capacitors<00:03:07.830> in<00:03:07.980> here<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.430> make<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.760> frequency

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
capacitors in here to make the frequency

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.930 
capacitors in here to make the frequency
go<00:03:09.450> higher<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:10.260> course<00:03:10.470> it's<00:03:10.680> frequency<00:03:11.250> gets

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
go higher of course it's frequency gets

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.360 
go higher of course it's frequency gets
too<00:03:12.239> high<00:03:12.709> then<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.860> core<00:03:14.100> of<00:03:14.250> the

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
too high then the core of the

transformer<00:03:14.640> is<00:03:15.239> going<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:15.750> saturate<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:17.480> all

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
transformer is going to saturate and all

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.750

it's<00:03:18.630> going<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.810> do<00:03:18.900> is<00:03:18.959> you<00:03:19.140> burn<00:03:19.650> up<00:03:19.800> the<00:03:20.010> it's

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
it's going to do is you burn up the it's

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.860 
it's going to do is you burn up the it's

volt<00:03:35.780> transformer<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:37.680> just<00:03:38.459> remember

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
volt transformer and just remember

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.830 
volt transformer and just remember
reading<00:03:39.120> it<00:03:39.360> backwards<00:03:39.600> a<00:03:39.989> 240<00:03:40.530> volt<00:03:40.739> now<00:03:41.840> when

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
reading it backwards a 240 volt now when

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.190 
reading it backwards a 240 volt now when
you<00:03:42.959> rewind<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:44.090> secondary<00:03:45.090> like<00:03:45.870> I<00:03:45.989> said

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
you rewind the secondary like I said

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.820 
you rewind the secondary like I said
that's<00:03:46.350> between<00:03:46.790> as<00:03:47.790> 24<00:03:48.330> turns<00:03:48.660> of<00:03:48.989> number<00:03:49.290> 22

that's between as 24 turns of number 22

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.650 
that's between as 24 turns of number 22
is<00:03:50.040> what<00:03:50.220> I'm

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
is what I'm

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.970 
is what I'm
but<00:03:52.660> you<00:03:52.989> can<00:03:53.140> use<00:03:53.290> a<00:03:55.080> heavier<00:03:56.080> wire<00:03:56.440> for<00:03:56.950> a

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
but you can use a heavier wire for a

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.520 
but you can use a heavier wire for a
heavier<00:03:57.400> amount<00:03:58.090> of<00:03:58.209> current<00:03:58.569> I<00:03:58.750> said<00:03:59.410> this

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
heavier amount of current I said this

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.710 
heavier amount of current I said this
was<00:03:59.739> only<00:03:59.890> good<00:04:00.099> for<00:04:00.310> about<00:04:00.370> 300<00:04:00.940> watts<00:04:03.720> you

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
was only good for about 300 watts you

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.809 
was only good for about 300 watts you
can<00:04:04.900> use<00:04:05.050> much<00:04:05.500> every<00:04:05.770> year<00:04:05.800> watches<00:04:06.430> this<00:04:06.760> is

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
can use much every year watches this is

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.350 
can use much every year watches this is

that complicated digital jutsu and let's

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.069 
that complicated digital jutsu and let's
go<00:04:18.519> back<00:04:18.549> to<00:04:18.850> doing<00:04:19.120> something<00:04:19.329> simple<00:04:19.840> like

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
go back to doing something simple like

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.350 
go back to doing something simple like
transistors<00:04:21.070> piece<00:04:21.639> those<00:04:21.940> things<00:04:22.180> were

transistors piece those things were

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.840 
transistors piece those things were
around<00:04:22.690> for<00:04:22.930> a<00:04:22.960> long<00:04:23.229> time<00:04:23.290> and<00:04:23.860> they<00:04:24.550> worked

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
around for a long time and they worked

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.400 
around for a long time and they worked
extremely<00:04:25.600> well<00:04:25.930> and<00:04:27.930> you<00:04:28.930> probably<00:04:29.169> even

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
extremely well and you probably even

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.409 
extremely well and you probably even
hear<00:04:29.680> this<00:04:29.830> fits<00:04:30.220> for<00:04:30.520> this<00:04:30.700> if<00:04:30.850> you<00:04:30.970> wanted<00:04:31.270> to

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
hear this fits for this if you wanted to

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.540 
hear this fits for this if you wanted to
if<00:04:31.479> you<00:04:31.540> want<00:04:31.750> to<00:04:31.810> use<00:04:31.960> a<00:04:31.990> power<00:04:32.320> FET<00:04:32.710> you<00:04:33.430> could

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
if you want to use a power FET you could

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.219 
if you want to use a power FET you could
probably<00:04:33.760> use<00:04:34.000> a<00:04:34.030> power<00:04:34.300> pet<00:04:34.570> it's<00:04:34.870> a<00:04:34.990> very

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
probably use a power pet it's a very

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.590 
probably use a power pet it's a very
extremely<00:04:35.800> simple<00:04:36.250> circuit<00:04:36.669> it's<00:04:37.150> just<00:04:37.479> a

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
extremely simple circuit it's just a

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.790 
extremely simple circuit it's just a
flip-flop<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:38.830> like<00:04:39.729> I<00:04:39.820> said<00:04:39.880> 24<00:04:40.660> turns<00:04:41.139> the

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
flip-flop and like I said 24 turns the

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.909 
flip-flop and like I said 24 turns the
center<00:04:42.070> tap<00:04:42.389> on<00:04:43.389> our<00:04:43.870> old<00:04:45.389> microwave<00:04:46.389> oven

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
center tap on our old microwave oven

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.680 
center tap on our old microwave oven
transformer<00:04:47.919> you<00:04:48.430> pull<00:04:48.700> off<00:04:48.880> the<00:04:48.910> secondary

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
transformer you pull off the secondary

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.800 
transformer you pull off the secondary
and<00:04:49.930> you<00:04:50.139> rewind<00:04:50.530> it<00:04:50.740> with<00:04:50.919> 24<00:04:51.400> turns<00:04:51.790> and<00:04:52.660> a

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
and you rewind it with 24 turns and a

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.000 
and you rewind it with 24 turns and a
center<00:04:53.080> tap<00:04:53.290> at<00:04:53.710> 12<00:04:54.250> turns<00:04:55.020> so<00:04:56.020> that's<00:04:56.229> my<00:04:56.470> idea

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
center tap at 12 turns so that's my idea

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:03.570 
center tap at 12 turns so that's my idea
on<00:04:58.710> how<00:04:59.710> to<00:04:59.770> get<00:05:00.310> higher<00:05:01.060> voltage<00:05:01.780> a<00:05:02.160> lot<00:05:03.160> less

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
on how to get higher voltage a lot less

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.850 
on how to get higher voltage a lot less
complicated<00:05:04.479> than<00:05:06.690> using<00:05:07.690> this<00:05:07.780> PWM<00:05:08.530> stuff

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
complicated than using this PWM stuff

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.100 
complicated than using this PWM stuff
which<00:05:09.190> is<00:05:09.370> cool<00:05:09.840> but<00:05:10.840> I<00:05:11.110> think<00:05:11.530> this<00:05:11.680> is<00:05:11.919> more

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
which is cool but I think this is more

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.779 
which is cool but I think this is more
this<00:05:14.110> is<00:05:14.320> very<00:05:14.590> good<00:05:14.860> for<00:05:15.640> our<00:05:15.910> use<00:05:17.280> okay<00:05:18.310> just

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
this is very good for our use okay just

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:23.100 
this is very good for our use okay just
my<00:05:18.970> idea<00:05:19.510> there<00:05:20.440> it<00:05:20.620> is<00:05:21.419> extremely<00:05:22.419> simple<00:05:22.600> I'm
