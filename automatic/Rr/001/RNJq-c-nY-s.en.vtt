00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.330
 the kitten the yarn identifying yarn 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.060
 negative and positive post-key and direct 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.400
 of the car's electric battery 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.960
 dedicated to pomegranate altair friend 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.640
 I usually say that the best 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.439
 tools are created by those who are 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.719
 involved in your work 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.329
 recently I posted two videos of 

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:33.700
 how to install an automotive choke 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:36.879
 checking account and an anti-theft 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.350
 steppe is in the course of one of the videos 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.989
 to the moment when it is necessary and 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.239
 identify on certain wires and a 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.079
 whip with dozens of movies and color 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.890
 varied 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.899
 it is the technique that was used at the time 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.120
 it was very efficient but a bit 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:55.390
 labor the people there wore a stiletto 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.339
 a bit dangerous too, then playing 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.999
 some experiences and ideas with a 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:03.879
 friend altar and I came the idea of 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:06.250
 create pliers and help people and 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.770
 dedication of the threads is in a way 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.560
 more comfortable efficient 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.780
 the main one that does not decrease spinning damage 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.320
 and the result is that there are pliers 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.680
 special that I baptized is with the name of 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.140
 plier fury wire is so if you are from 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.640
 branch and electric car or even 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.920
 it is no longer is interested in 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.600
 install a new component in your car 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.370
 this video can be very intimate 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.050
 So, without further ado, we'll have the 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.390
 our step by step then start to 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.850
 be using decimal nozzle pliers 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.000
 English but with all you have and 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.870
 then with your tongue you 're tuning 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.040
 side of it will reduce there an average of 4 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.940
 mm 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.590
 It's from that end to the 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.260
 officers will get to know the stones 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.170
 They are seeing from girls go 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.270
 get a nail 17/21 and we'll make the 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.970
 our adaptation will be taking a 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.010
 pliers and holding it film will be 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.130
 releasing there in that part that people 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.900
 made a narrowing made a reduction 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:13.480
 so I'm using it here to be able to do 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:15.370
 this service the solder mig is not wanted 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.370
 wear dress director 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:22.240
 what this is even more guaranteed 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.550
 family finishing here with high in 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.490
 end of the year get burned 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.880
 pec there to testify is not taking here 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:34.090
 excess with saw-art for later 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.680
 make a finish until the tse is 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.290
 being removed 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:44.070
 the thing is black text begins to do 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:50.310
 a stoning from there using our file 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:53.020
 I already started giving a stoned here 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.020
 in that loose play that people preach 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.150
 that the soldier had placed the 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:02.350
 tac to a little more thin 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:05.440
 It helps that it is time to make the 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.220
 drilling there on the wire without causing 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.230
 much damage 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.980
 then this is the effect that will be 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:15.010
 doing now on the whip and will be 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:19.030
 learning here on the wire can be the son of 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.320
 various thickness is being able to make the 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.410
 identification 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.590
 there in the personal car whip that the 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:31.239
 our test kant is on you 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:35.790
 here is one more time at this test time 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:39.760
 here in the terminal should tend jacarezinho 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:45.790
 back playing one of them here in the 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:54.850
 car and other terminal 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:57.750
 our test is putting here meter 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.750
 the reality 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.480
 then that part can be fixed 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.520
 in a permanent way here in the pliers 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.230
 so that's because he has navy in 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.050
 maranha of yarn 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.020
 we will have to identify which is 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:17.830
 for example a wire per xavi a field is 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:20.290
 battery will be picking up the pliers and 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:27.240
 giving a small stick here and not 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:27.240
 will damage the spiked wire 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:41.259
 she defended to release 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:46.030
 so the person gets much stronger 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:49.870
 that way, what will not 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:52.569
 damaging the wiring only one 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:05:00.729
 hole there followed after 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:05:05.370
 insulate with the insulation tape 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.370
 you see that the hole he makes is well 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:17.139
 subtle even if almost imperceptible 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:21.909
 at your discretion and say that tip 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:24.039
 and more so your will 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:26.139
 so these people want the video 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.340
 can be useful not only to 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.860
 professionals ae 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:33.219
 but with everyone who has to do 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.960
 installation and jack an alarm sound or 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:35.800
 some maintenance on their 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.229
 vehicles 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.389
 Thank you, my friend, for the team. 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.860
 that she says she was given in construction 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:43.680
 of this tool 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:47.080
 remembering that it can be for sure 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.990
 further improve access to the blog of 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.990
 kill for blogspot.com or sign up 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.509
 on the channel staying on the word sign up 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.089
