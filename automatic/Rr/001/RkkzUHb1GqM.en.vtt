 we recommend the presence to the seminar 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.310
 because I hope and give the best of myself 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.260
 in this aspect and I hope to help all 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.400
 the people who really come 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.019
 do something so that anyone but 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.659
 try from the experience of a 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.060
 competitor active person 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:43.579
 stroman powerlifting doing the 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.170
 movements and that trains both 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.959
 same as a whole team of 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.670
 competition of these sports try 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:54.590
 show you though there is no trick of these 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:58.250
 secrets try to give the guidelines 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.819
 that you to the people who attend 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.519

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.700
 much higher performance to your 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.989
 movements and your strength that is 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.940
 we recommend how that 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.310
 transform the presence because we believe 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.130
 it will be very worthwhile nobody is going to 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.289
 bored and nobody goes home saying 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.900
 I learned this and we will try to 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:23.510

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.820
 books I will try so good that the 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.370
 I train and that the practice is 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.320
 intense and that everyone enjoys 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.490
