 video I wish you a lot of fun 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:49.020
 the first app will show up today 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.309
 Rossi wants to call himself red and that is 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.079
 really a hot tip from me 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.100
 and I became really last time 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.600
 from very many people 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.850
 I proposed now all even 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.260
 can not mention by name and me 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.510
 had the app itself already in the eye 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.280
 caught that was only for ios 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.600
 and now she is also for android 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.400
 Of course, that's what got me out a lot 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.540
 happy because I do the whole thing like me 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.119
 even I enjoy it and also from the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.650
 graphic like me very handsome we 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.820
 Just play a character here 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.500
 may that look like i have eg 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.799
 basketball player as there is still everything 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.110
 other really pigs 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.869
 frogs what I what, and this we must 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.390
 hold as far as possible through this 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.100
 infinite number of roads lead 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.630
 So it always crosses the streets we 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.189
 can by tapping him forward 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.950
 send or stop by a wipe 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.380
 left or right and yes it is 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.360
 always after the timing yes the question 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.380
 and if you master it correctly 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.759
 you get hold you stop pretty much 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.890
 far and the further you get the better 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.899
 bigger with the highschool and soest 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.220
 game mode so the goal is one 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.000
 highest possible highscore here too 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.500
 to reach 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.880
 and yes that was it already 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.380
 of the gameplay I would like me 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.030
 What are your highscore interest 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.390
 is definitely trying the game 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.390
 out 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.110
 the next one will open tomorrow 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.910
 equipment that is supposed to be a central place 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.350
 be on the morning of all 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.090
 inform important things 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.890
 and beyond that, the alarm clock 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.080
 can edit and enter, so to speak 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.869
 or exhibit or even stop the time 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.820
 adjust and yes as I said you can 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.380
 here also the news or news 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.210
 so to speak, see the halt just 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.150
 currently you are in the morning 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.650
 right up to date is and 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.850
 if you can see nice article then 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.780
 the same people on the internet 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.670
 to open 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.010
 I find that a very good thing and 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.870
 another function is also the goods 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.310
 the same weather gets displayed there 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.350
 you can, so to speak, stop his place 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.850
 Add and then you get those here 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.010
 whatever it is in this app 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.020
 that's pretty handy too 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.970
 and of course you can also see which 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.470
 day of which just woke up if 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.060
 someone in the morning, pretty much in the wind 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:48.990
 is that of course a useful one 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:51.900
 Orientation The next is called 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.940
 possible and jan post wants 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.780
 actually no English word 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.489
 united impossible 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.380
 that has me a bit 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.150
 irritated but the app is actually 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.860
 We are very nice and we can 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.650
 by tapping left or right 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.050
 Here I say at this time this pipe 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.910
 Change the position and always one way 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.230
 slip back and forth a bit and 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.700
 We can stop by this 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.820
 obstacles come here world 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.040
 and as soon as we touch 100 , that's it 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.630
 score set and we get then must 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.310
 I depending on how long we did that 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.060
 highscore did what he did 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.280
 from a minute 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.350
 you can see that right up there too 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.330
 time runs out and that's just it 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.920
 at the same time the store and I think 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.650
 actually as of atmosphere is the 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.680
 nicely done so with those blue ones 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.300
 the city day and at night I like it 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.010
 very good, but the biggest disadvantage 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.470
 of this is that this whole here 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.030
 paid is so who else one 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.280
 a bit of money, for example, through his 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.930
 Survey app on the google play account 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.930
 should definitely have access 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:55.569
 and another cool app is called 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.269
 dark horse comics to put it that way 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.069
 a central point where you can comics 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.620
 can acquire or hold also for free 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.689
 For example, we get avatar there 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.890
 also free comics but of course 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.540
 also the newest will be here 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.530
 then the one summarized here 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.319
 can acquire 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.819
 the whole is unfortunately in English so 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.530
 because the whole comic stops her at the 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.970
 English that's just the disadvantage 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.859
 but mostly anyway in the 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.370
 original language of comics kula den 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.139
 read 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.850
 that's why the whole thing is good for me 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.110
 fallen and just so one 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.600
 You can really get a taste of it here 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.919
 few free com download and 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.889
 I did that too, we can do that 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.990
 just look what comics 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.370
 have downloaded then open and 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.300
 I think that's nice too 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.970
 you can just go through it 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.410
 then did wipe the pictures and that's 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.300
 actually clear now as well 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.889
 the quality is the whole really 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.690
 good if you pull it in there 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.280
 it is not very high resolution 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.169
 is and you really nothing to 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.000
 I like that very much 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.570
 and all comic fans should come here 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.570
 drop by 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.080
 last app for today is called 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.730
 niemegk network and the difficult one here 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.770
 is that we stop two at the same time 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.200
 figures must be and would have to yes 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.160
 not the whole thing through this parcours 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.570
 simply by looking at the screen 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.940
 type in and if you are in the top 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.740
 half of the picture presses the upper one 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.750
 character and am and retention of 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.130
 lower characters and difficult 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.200
 it's just that, too 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.640
 reversed is thus the bottom 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.450
 Characters still cute with down 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.490
 so to speak 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.260
 and if you want to manage that it 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.180
 quite difficult difficult than that 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.740
 maybe here might like and found 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.370
 I'm pretty funny that you should 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.370
 just have a look 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.520
 that was it from the 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.260
 seventieth edition of the best napster 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.670
 week up here and galaxy i am happy 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.290
 again, that you are back today 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.970
 have turned on and now I have 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.830
 still a video for you and recommend 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.680
 Although a video in which I give you the 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.790
 show best apps for your smart watch 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.600
 that's how I'm interesting about it 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.400
 just to see 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.320
 what are all so possible with is 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.640
 a smart watch so look there 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.320
 purely and otherwise we will see each other 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.490
 next time until then much fun 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.490
 and goodbye
