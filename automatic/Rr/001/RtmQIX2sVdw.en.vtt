 will enlarge itself to wait for 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.610
 charge about 20 seconds this is 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.520
 normal because when ingesting minecraft every

 and will shrink to return it for 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.490
 to enlarge it to isaki so it is 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.560
