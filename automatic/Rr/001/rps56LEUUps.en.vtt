00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello friends in this video we are going to 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.529
 learn to make a delicious sponge cake 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.529
 of chocolate 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.320
 to make our cake 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:20.619
 we will need oil flour sugar milk 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.350
 tail cao two eggs yeast and a 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.060
 pot where he chatted all 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.830
 If you prefer milk, you can 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.510
 change for a coconut yogurt that's going 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.150
 to give a different flavor and it will be very 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.400
 rich 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.860
 First of all, you know, we take the 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.860
 we break them eggs 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:44.000
 and we throw it from inside 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.920
 in the pot 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.920
 1 and 2 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.829
 and the shells are thrown away 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.890
 of course we can start to go 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:03.530
 beating everything now let's take 7 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.680
 tablespoons of oil 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.920
 1 2 3 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.610
 4 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.750
 5 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.750
 and 7 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.400
 then let's take half a glass 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.850
 of easy milk by the easy ones with 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.090
 we made half a glass of milk and 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.090
 we miss 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:35.320
 then let's throw 9 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:35.320
 tablespoons of flour and sugar 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.850
 and we beat we always beat and now we go 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.750
 to throw another 9 tablespoons but this time 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.460
 of cocoa 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.050
 what has been with the cava of all 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.590
 life 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:56.110
 just that of the day because in my case not 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.350
 There is money for more 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:03.329
 and 9 and we beat again 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.909
 here I am putting everything done a 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.869
 disgust but it does not matter because then we go 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.860
 to clean, it looks good and 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.870
 while we give the last challenges 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.580
 while we carry out the final touches 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.580
 let's go putting the oven preheat 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.630
 about 200 degrees 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.379
 for at least 10 minutes to 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:33.420
 then let's oil the mold 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.690
 where are we going to put the cake 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.510
 it will be enough to pour a little oil 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:43.290
 and extend it with your hands 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.989
 so the cake will not stick to the mold and 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.060
 It will look nice and we'll take our mix 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.030
 inside the mold 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.040
 I used to have a pot to put 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.230
 here in the middle of the mold to come out 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.450
 the cake like a hole in the middle 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.700
 scratched not but my mother says I know 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.560
 I lost because of course the whole neighborhood 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.080
 He knows that I go out to walk the mold of 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.890
 Biscuit 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:12.319
 to the street then a stone 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.319
 let's also clear 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.180
 we can not waste anything 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.969
 that all these biscuits 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.459
 good future is a car and then with 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:28.280
 very careful we put the mountain with the 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.760
 cake inside the oven with care of 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.760
 do not burn 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.140
 good and we've finished now just 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.989
 you have to wait like an hour with the 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.370
 oven at about 200 degrees or 180 and when 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.519
 have finished we just have to take out the 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.519
 discussion 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.379

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.120

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.450
 detail that is to teach the sponge cake already 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.269
 done but it turns out that I forgot and I 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.489
 I ate it before I recorded it but well no 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.640
