00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:06.490
 but as I told you now I'm going to 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.490
 teach how to make these little houses 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.170
 birds that are very nice to place 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.330
 outside in the park on a balcony 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.119
 even inside and they look very good 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.429
 these houses are very decorative and what 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.929
 I made are different pages that attention 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:22.119
 with these pages because they can 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:24.279
 use in furniture also if for 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.619
 large surfaces are very good are 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.439
 very fashionable these worn out techniques 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.150
 the houses are combined with decoupage 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.280
 so it's a technique that can 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.710
 take advantage of any accessory that 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.110
 you have and also in the houses 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.570
 that are very good of course good 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.070
 I tell you the surface in the case of 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.670
 ceiling what they have to do is 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.699
 paint it a dark color if a ground 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.160
 shadow a chocolate they are going to paint it very 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.250
 well that the surface is neat and what 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:01:00.210
 they will do is it not frighten one 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.210
 sail let's learn it and they'll go there 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:07.030
 pulling irregularly if they want 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.630
 they can mark somewhere else the 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.020
 paraffin then what we do a little 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:19.170
 more to turn it off 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.969
 and with the bottom of the candle we're going 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.159
 to make stripes always in the same 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:27.630
 felt as if the wood had streaks 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:32.780
 yes it is to say that I am not going to do 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:35.570
 drawings like that but always in the same 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:41.720
 what I do now is take acrylic 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:44.260
 white or white latex paint over 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.540
 the paraffin 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:51.700
 I'm going to paint over the entire surface 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:56.550
 pressing and covering very well so they go 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:01.920
 moving forward and then what they are going to do 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:04.800
 once dry it is to take this curls of 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.970
 steel if a kitchen sponge and go 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.210
 to press very well then well that 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.870
 where is the paraffin the material is going 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.680
 to leave 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:22.319
 and so to advance irregularly and 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.319
 pressing more in one place than in another 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.989
 we leave there and remove the dust yes and 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.989
 let's take a sandpaper 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.790
 i 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.790
 what if 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.280
 so we are going to move forward doing many 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.620
 forces and of step they do exercises and 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.400
 they will also take in this case is a 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:02.510
 knife so have a handsaw and go 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.510
 to go there hurting the wood even more 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:17.680
 very well there what we do 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.420
 remove of course all the dust and 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.700
 If some parts were very 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:28.080
 marked we can take more material 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:31.860
 and retouch if in some places like to 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:36.300
 give a lighting all these points 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.220
 what we achieve with the paraffin imitate everything 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.680
 the wear of the wood is to say that 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.790
 what we are imitating is that 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:49.220
 this new object is actually old 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:52.830
 and that time was altering it and it was 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:56.549
 this one getting old and she's an accessory 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:00.090
 who has his years what we do 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:03.269
 then let it dry and start 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.700
 move forward with the decoupage but before 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.660
 I want to show the other skates that 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.470
 I show here 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.299
 look we had the dark surface like this 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.670
 like the previous 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:19.739
 what we do is paint white 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:22.139
 continuously in the same line we leave 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.750
 dry without covering completely and what 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.790
 we do is dry in this case do not use 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.729
 paraffin one possibility is with paraffin 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:34.849
 that is as hard as that 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.849
 more worn and another is this way 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.680
 so they see that they are getting different 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.900
 tones and this piece of furniture wore out this 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.719
 object is worn and you can see the 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:55.319
 different layers with which they were 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:59.129
 painted and gives a very old tone like that 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:05:01.289
 this is the famous worn patina and 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:04.590
 with white and dark background always remains 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:07.469
 very good in this in this case as you see 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.199
 I wear it even more use the 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:13.080
 knife press more in different 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:16.710
 parts to make them look older 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.900
 more vintage more worn 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.950
 For example, I 'm going to show you here 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.390
 the finished look in this sector 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.370
 what they say they see this is the patina that 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:31.200
 has paraffin here what I did was 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:33.120
 cut out this paper napkin that 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.670
 has scores only in some 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:40.190
 sectors and with vinyl adhesive the 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:44.880
 stick see in some sectors yes and with 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:47.070
 papers without decoupage what we do is 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.970
 cut them out and I stuck it in this 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.510
 surface 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:53.820
 well vinyl water adhesive stuck on 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:57.210
 the patina and here also have in the 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:59.040
 in front of a design with the combination of 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.640
 these papers that I show you if 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:06.410
 painted vinyl sticker as seen in the 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.610
 part of the facade of the house 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:12.270
 only here is painted white 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.920
 but on unpainted virgin wood 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.900
 then what you see is a patina more 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.050
 clear me what I did that directly 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.960
 on the wood I painted white and then 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.800
 choose then it looks clearer if not 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.860
 is it so 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.020
 dark as in this sector and in this 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.690
 also look at this is the other technique 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.180
 what is the sanding technique and what 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:36.720
 I did was decorate with flowers that cut 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:41.550
 by the outline well with stripes and also 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:43.500
 with flowers and more stripes yes and these houses 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.900
 If you want to do them, you can get them 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.030
 know where they visit our blog 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:51.150
 day of friends and there they will have the data 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:53.729
 to be able to make them equal they have 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:56.610
 You want to take advantage of this 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:58.379
 page also make decoupage good 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.389
 I hope they do, I want them to send me 

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:03.349
 the photo of how they fit and good 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:03.349
 we continue with the girls 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:13.639
 well you deal with it, besides I 

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:13.639
 loved these little houses that have 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.100
 and they are my assistants 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:25.700
 and according to the ine a cash fraud 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.970
 these houses are very romantic and good 

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.970
 they have 

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.610
 is here
