00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.500
 the fascination with 3 d films is 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.000
 simply that is the entire movie 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.830
 To bring spectators much closer one feels 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.540
 rather part of the story 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.920
 that's just what dragon taming is all about 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.210
 very special because the whole flight 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.640
 sequences that is just crazy 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.619
 bombastic that's pretty cool 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:36.250
 all this if you really go with it 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:37.720
 was it all comes down to one for 3d 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.059
 filming is that is an incredible 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.410
 unique experience is another 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.760
 experience in such a story with 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.650
 this dragon with these worlds like 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.839
 Plows are shown through the sky 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.400
 it's just something very special 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.500
 at this sound as we the 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.920
 then snowflakes and diesel locomotives 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.600
 somehow the whole team is very funny 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.100
 but also with a lot of feeling 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.960
 Everything we know about you is wrong 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.730
 important is a good story that is 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.770
 essential to the film this story 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.600
 is very good it is beautifully animated 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.850

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.570
 Dragons are beautifully animated that 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.570

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.320

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.979
 [Music] 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.509
 this is just a big adventure 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.130

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.130
