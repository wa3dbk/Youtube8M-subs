then<00:04:28.960> kill<00:04:29.110> it<00:04:29.140> off<00:04:29.290> against<00:04:29.560> an<00:04:29.680> ice<00:04:29.800> beam<00:04:30.010> but

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
then kill it off against an ice beam but

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.100 
then kill it off against an ice beam but
that<00:04:30.970> didn't<00:04:31.150> happen<00:04:31.450> so<00:04:31.630> I<00:04:31.690> come<00:04:31.900> up<00:04:31.990> the

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
that didn't happen so I come up the

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.990 
that didn't happen so I come up the
Gengar<00:04:32.560> here<00:04:32.919> at<00:04:33.010> mega<00:04:33.220> drain<00:04:33.460> seems<00:04:33.790> pretty

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
Gengar here at mega drain seems pretty

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.940 
Gengar here at mega drain seems pretty
obvious<00:04:34.510> so<00:04:34.540> you<00:04:34.720> can<00:04:34.870> flip<00:04:35.020> to<00:04:35.050> his<00:04:35.200> Alakazam

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
obvious so you can flip to his Alakazam

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.240 
obvious so you can flip to his Alakazam
so<00:04:36.610> good<00:04:37.450> play<00:04:37.690> cuz<00:04:37.960> Alakazam<00:04:38.440> is<00:04:38.620> a<00:04:38.650> huge<00:04:39.010> wall

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
so good play cuz Alakazam is a huge wall

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.659 
so good play cuz Alakazam is a huge wall
too

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
too

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.880 
too
so<00:04:40.390> now<00:04:40.780> I'm<00:04:40.900> gonna<00:04:41.020> now<00:04:41.380> I'm<00:04:41.470> gonna<00:04:41.590> come<00:04:41.770> up

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
so now I'm gonna now I'm gonna come up

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.770 
so now I'm gonna now I'm gonna come up
to<00:04:41.919> my<00:04:42.070> execute<00:04:42.460> or<00:04:42.640> predicting<00:04:43.180> psychic<00:04:43.600> if

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
to my execute or predicting psychic if

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.120 
to my execute or predicting psychic if
he<00:04:43.900> goes<00:04:44.050> to<00:04:44.260> that<00:04:44.350> but<00:04:44.530> he<00:04:44.620> gets<00:04:44.740> a<00:04:44.860> point<00:04:45.010> in

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
he goes to that but he gets a point in

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.650 
he goes to that but he gets a point in
this<00:04:45.250> grid<00:04:45.460> because<00:04:45.820> crit<00:04:46.150> only<00:04:46.360> does<00:04:46.510> like

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
this grid because crit only does like

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.840 
this grid because crit only does like
30%<00:04:47.260> I<00:04:47.530> think<00:04:48.010> though<00:04:48.070> fittest<00:04:48.310> seismic<00:04:48.669> toss

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
30% I think though fittest seismic toss

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.670 
30% I think though fittest seismic toss
now<00:04:48.880> just<00:04:49.390> to<00:04:49.479> get<00:04:49.570> some<00:04:49.750> good<00:04:50.110> damage<00:04:50.320> off

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
now just to get some good damage off

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.710 
now just to get some good damage off
putting<00:04:51.010> over<00:04:51.100> it's<00:04:51.310> done<00:04:51.340> spore<00:04:51.760> to<00:04:52.479> slow

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
putting over it's done spore to slow

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.150 
putting over it's done spore to slow
this<00:04:52.870> guy<00:04:53.080> down<00:04:53.140> and<00:04:53.650> I<00:04:53.770> go<00:04:53.950> for<00:04:54.100> the

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
this guy down and I go for the

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.610 
this guy down and I go for the
explosions<00:04:54.729> and<00:04:55.180> that's<00:04:55.570> abdellah<00:04:56.020> Alakazam

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
explosions and that's abdellah Alakazam

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.770 
explosions and that's abdellah Alakazam
so<00:04:56.950> that's<00:04:57.340> basically<00:04:57.820> like<00:04:57.940> I<00:04:58.240> said<00:04:58.479> what<00:04:58.630> my

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
so that's basically like I said what my

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.110 
so that's basically like I said what my
executor<00:04:59.260> does<00:04:59.500> so<00:05:00.250> he<00:05:00.340> comes<00:05:00.520> as<00:05:00.610> a<00:05:00.700> Chauncey

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
executor does so he comes as a Chauncey

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.790 
executor does so he comes as a Chauncey
if<00:05:01.330> I<00:05:01.570> knew<00:05:01.750> he<00:05:01.870> had<00:05:01.900> this<00:05:02.260> I<00:05:02.380> would<00:05:02.530> have<00:05:02.560> saved

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
if I knew he had this I would have saved

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.219 
if I knew he had this I would have saved
it<00:05:03.040> you<00:05:03.340> know<00:05:03.460> just<00:05:03.490> every<00:05:04.479> time<00:05:04.720> it<00:05:04.900> happens

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
it you know just every time it happens

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.350 
it you know just every time it happens
but<00:05:05.470> my<00:05:06.100> Rhydon<00:05:06.400> can<00:05:06.729> easily<00:05:06.970> take<00:05:07.120> care<00:05:07.300> of

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
but my Rhydon can easily take care of

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.909 
but my Rhydon can easily take care of
this<00:05:07.450> Chauncey<00:05:07.870> so<00:05:08.050> that's<00:05:08.260> easily<00:05:08.560> to<00:05:08.740> get

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
this Chauncey so that's easily to get

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:10.680 
this Chauncey so that's easily to get
with<00:05:09.070> that<00:05:09.100> EQ<00:05:09.640> but<00:05:09.910> unfortunately<00:05:10.540> I'm<00:05:10.600> gonna

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
with that EQ but unfortunately I'm gonna

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.740 
with that EQ but unfortunately I'm gonna
die<00:05:10.960> to<00:05:11.020> another<00:05:11.290> ice<00:05:11.500> beam<00:05:11.800> so<00:05:12.580> it<00:05:13.090> all<00:05:13.330> comes

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
die to another ice beam so it all comes

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.500 
die to another ice beam so it all comes
down<00:05:13.900> toros<00:05:14.800> cuz<00:05:15.160> I<00:05:15.280> really<00:05:15.580> need<00:05:15.729> Toro<00:05:16.030> so<00:05:16.210> I'm

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
down toros cuz I really need Toro so I'm

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.020 
down toros cuz I really need Toro so I'm
gonna<00:05:16.690> come<00:05:16.930> out<00:05:16.960> to<00:05:17.169> Toros<00:05:17.560> go<00:05:18.310> over<00:05:18.460> the<00:05:18.580> EQ

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
gonna come out to Toros go over the EQ

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.050 
gonna come out to Toros go over the EQ
but<00:05:19.150> he<00:05:19.300> lives<00:05:19.600> it<00:05:19.900> I<00:05:20.050> just<00:05:20.500> tours<00:05:21.430> his<00:05:21.700> attack

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
but he lives it I just tours his attack

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.120 
but he lives it I just tours his attack
he's<00:05:22.330> just<00:05:22.570> really<00:05:22.900> underrated<00:05:23.260> in<00:05:23.710> this<00:05:23.890> game

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
he's just really underrated in this game

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.550 
he's just really underrated in this game

completely so I go for the blizzard
eight<00:05:51.199> of<00:05:51.319> the<00:05:51.409> good<00:05:51.589> chunks<00:05:51.949> 30%<00:05:52.580> probably

00:05:53.109 --> 00:05:53.119 
eight of the good chunks 30% probably

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:56.019 
eight of the good chunks 30% probably
from<00:05:53.629> that<00:05:53.809> range<00:05:54.229> it's<00:05:54.619> a<00:05:54.769> a<00:05:54.800> for<00:05:55.129> a<00:05:55.159> KO<00:05:55.399> and

00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:56.029 
from that range it's a a for a KO and

bring on my gang guard here and I'm just
gonna<00:06:01.189> go<00:06:01.369> for<00:06:01.489> the<00:06:01.550> explosion<00:06:01.909> hopefully<00:06:02.479> I

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:02.539 
gonna go for the explosion hopefully I

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:04.299 
gonna go for the explosion hopefully I
get<00:06:02.629> the<00:06:02.749> kill<00:06:02.989> and<00:06:03.289> I<00:06:03.649> don't<00:06:03.709> think<00:06:03.860> that<00:06:04.129> guy

00:06:04.299 --> 00:06:04.309 
get the kill and I don't think that guy

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:06.219 
get the kill and I don't think that guy
really<00:06:04.550> mattered<00:06:04.909> because<00:06:05.330> I<00:06:05.689> think<00:06:06.080> it<00:06:06.139> would

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
really mattered because I think it would

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:08.619 
really mattered because I think it would
