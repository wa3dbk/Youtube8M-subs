and super simple today we're going to
show<00:00:07.200> you<00:00:07.230> how<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.040> tell<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.429> difference

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
show you how to tell the difference

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.749 
show you how to tell the difference
between<00:00:08.940> raw<00:00:09.420> or<00:00:09.690> boiled<00:00:09.719> eggs<00:00:10.370> now<00:00:11.370> it<00:00:11.550> may

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
between raw or boiled eggs now it may

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.610 
between raw or boiled eggs now it may
sound<00:00:12.059> like<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.360> silly<00:00:12.599> experiment<00:00:13.259> but<00:00:13.500> it's

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
sound like a silly experiment but it's

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.740 
sound like a silly experiment but it's
actually<00:00:13.980> some<00:00:14.160> interesting<00:00:14.700> science<00:00:15.120> all

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
actually some interesting science all

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.870 
actually some interesting science all
you're<00:00:15.960> going<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.199> need<00:00:16.379> are<00:00:16.710> two<00:00:17.010> eggs<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.460> a

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
you're going to need are two eggs and a

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.650 
you're going to need are two eggs and a
marker<00:00:18.240> pen

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
marker pen

have<00:00:19.109> one<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.289> your<00:00:19.470> parents<00:00:19.680> boil<00:00:20.340> one<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.609> the

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
have one of your parents boil one of the

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.790 
have one of your parents boil one of the
eggs<00:00:20.880> for<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.570> not<00:00:21.930> tell<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.410> which<00:00:22.769> is

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
eggs for you and not tell you which is

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.509 
eggs for you and not tell you which is
which<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:25.050> first<00:00:25.320> step<00:00:25.560> in<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:25.890> experiment

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
which the first step in this experiment

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.689 
which the first step in this experiment
is<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.910> label<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.390> eggs<00:00:27.599> one<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.410> two<00:00:28.769> at<00:00:29.550> this

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
is to label the eggs one and two at this

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.709 
is to label the eggs one and two at this
point<00:00:29.820> we<00:00:30.599> don't<00:00:30.750> know<00:00:30.869> which<00:00:31.289> egg<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.830> which

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
point we don't know which egg is which

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.299 
point we don't know which egg is which
now<00:00:33.719> from<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.020> outside<00:00:34.469> they<00:00:34.710> look<00:00:34.739> basically

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
now from the outside they look basically

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.760 
now from the outside they look basically
identical<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.870> same<00:00:37.079> size<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
identical that the same size and the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.150 
identical that the same size and the
same<00:00:37.950> shape<00:00:37.980> they're<00:00:38.879> even<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.149> same<00:00:39.329> color

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
same shape they're even the same color

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.709 
same shape they're even the same color
the<00:00:41.160> first<00:00:41.340> step<00:00:41.579> in<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.790> experiment<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.420> to

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
the first step in the experiment is to

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.279 
the first step in the experiment is to
simply<00:00:43.050> spin<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.530> eggs<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.160> spot<00:00:45.289> note

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
simply spin the eggs on the spot note

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.799 
simply spin the eggs on the spot note
any<00:00:46.559> differences<00:00:47.100> between<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.550> two<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:48.600> this

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
any differences between the two in this

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.869 
any differences between the two in this
case<00:00:49.050> number<00:00:49.620> one<00:00:49.770> starts<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.250> roll<00:00:50.489> away<00:00:50.670> as

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
case number one starts to roll away as

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.139 
case number one starts to roll away as
soon<00:00:51.059> as<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.300> stops<00:00:52.070> number<00:00:53.070> 2<00:00:53.250> however<00:00:53.460> even

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
soon as it stops number 2 however even

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.209 
soon as it stops number 2 however even
if<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.360> try<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.690> stop<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.110> seems<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.860> continue

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
if you try and stop it seems to continue

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.970 
if you try and stop it seems to continue
spinning<00:00:56.960> so<00:00:57.960> there<00:00:58.140> we<00:00:58.230> already<00:00:58.590> have<00:00:58.800> a

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
spinning so there we already have a

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.610 
spinning so there we already have a
clear<00:00:59.280> difference<00:00:59.460> between<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.090> two<00:01:00.210> eggs

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
clear difference between the two eggs

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.860 
clear difference between the two eggs
but<00:01:01.620> what<00:01:01.739> else<00:01:01.890> can<00:01:02.100> we<00:01:02.190> do<00:01:02.510> well<00:01:03.510> another

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
but what else can we do well another

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.020 
but what else can we do well another
thing<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.229> do<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.979> turn<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.339> egg<00:01:05.460> onto<00:01:05.880> its

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
thing to do is to turn the egg onto its

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.350 
thing to do is to turn the egg onto its
top<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.570> spin<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.530> way<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:08.880> first<00:01:09.119> egg

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
top and spin it that way the first egg

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.899 
top and spin it that way the first egg
seems<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.780> spin<00:01:09.990> quite<00:01:10.260> well<00:01:10.500> but<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.520> second

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
seems to spin quite well but the second

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.210 
seems to spin quite well but the second
one<00:01:12.030> hardly<00:01:12.479> spins<00:01:12.869> at<00:01:13.020> all<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.439> fact<00:01:14.040> it

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
one hardly spins at all in fact it

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.330 
one hardly spins at all in fact it
immediately<00:01:14.640> falls<00:01:15.090> over<00:01:18.860> so<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.979> question

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
immediately falls over so the question

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.480 
immediately falls over so the question
remains<00:01:20.460> which<00:01:21.299> egg<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.840> which<00:01:25.070> well<00:01:26.070> very

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
remains which egg is which well very

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.700 
remains which egg is which well very
simply<00:01:26.939> we<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:27.570> find<00:01:27.780> out<00:01:27.930> by<00:01:27.960> breaking<00:01:28.590> the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
simply we can find out by breaking the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:37.550 
simply we can find out by breaking the
eggs<00:01:30.590> number<00:01:31.590> one<00:01:33.950> was<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:34.979> boiled<00:01:35.610> egg<00:01:36.560> which

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
eggs number one was the boiled egg which

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.770 
eggs number one was the boiled egg which
of<00:01:37.740> course<00:01:37.770> means<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.460> number<00:01:38.939> two<00:01:39.150> was<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
of course means that number two was the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.249 
of course means that number two was the
raw<00:01:40.110> egg<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:42.360> reason<00:01:42.720> we<00:01:42.840> found<00:01:43.110> these

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
raw egg the reason we found these

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.530 
raw egg the reason we found these
differences<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.070> quite<00:01:44.610> simply<00:01:45.060> because<00:01:45.240> of

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
differences is quite simply because of

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.289 
differences is quite simply because of
the<00:01:45.630> center<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:45.990> gravity<00:01:46.820> because<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.939> boiled

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
the center of gravity because the boiled

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.880 
the center of gravity because the boiled
egg<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.720> solid<00:01:49.110> it's<00:01:49.350> center<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.799> gravity

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
egg is solid it's center of gravity

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.600 
egg is solid it's center of gravity
remains<00:01:50.460> constant<00:01:51.409> whereas<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.590> raw<00:01:52.799> egg<00:01:53.100> has

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
remains constant whereas the raw egg has

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.580 
remains constant whereas the raw egg has
liquid<00:01:54.090> inside<00:01:54.420> which<00:01:54.780> means<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.259> as<00:01:55.439> it

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
liquid inside which means that as it

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.859 
liquid inside which means that as it
turns<00:01:55.829> around<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.670> center<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.149> gravity<00:01:57.630> and

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
turns around the center of gravity and

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.899 
turns around the center of gravity and
therefore<00:01:58.350> it's<00:01:58.590> center<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.040> weight<00:01:59.369> is

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
therefore it's center of weight is

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.999 
therefore it's center of weight is
constantly<00:02:00.600> moving<00:02:00.780> around<00:02:01.020> making<00:02:01.860> things

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
constantly moving around making things

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.130 
constantly moving around making things
like<00:02:02.399> spinning<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.000> spot<00:02:03.360> completely

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
like spinning on the spot completely

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.109 
like spinning on the spot completely
impossible<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:05.100> there<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.340> have<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.640> that's

impossible so there you have it that's
how<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.390> can<00:02:06.659> find<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.960> difference<00:02:07.320> between

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
how you can find the difference between

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.070 
how you can find the difference between
a<00:02:07.680> raw<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.459> boiled<00:02:08.849> egg<00:02:09.030> with<00:02:09.629> just<00:02:09.869> one

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
a raw and a boiled egg with just one
