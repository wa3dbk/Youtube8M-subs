00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
texture and this one's flat but doesn't

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.790 
texture and this one's flat but doesn't
I<00:02:28.450> don't<00:02:28.599> really<00:02:28.720> care<00:02:28.989> because<00:02:29.200> what<00:02:29.680> they

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
I don't really care because what they

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.979 
I don't really care because what they
did<00:02:29.860> is<00:02:30.220> they<00:02:30.640> molded<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.180> wrists<00:02:31.599> onto<00:02:31.900> the

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
did is they molded the wrists onto the

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.470 
did is they molded the wrists onto the
forearms<00:02:32.230> hence<00:02:32.800> no<00:02:33.099> articulation<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:34.030> you

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
forearms hence no articulation and you

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.509 
forearms hence no articulation and you
know<00:02:34.569> what<00:02:34.720> Hasbro<00:02:35.290> guess<00:02:35.560> what<00:02:35.769> you<00:02:36.040> geniuses

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
know what Hasbro guess what you geniuses

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.910 
know what Hasbro guess what you geniuses
out<00:02:36.640> there<00:02:36.870> designing<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.230> articulation

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
out there designing the articulation

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.220 
out there designing the articulation
stores<00:02:39.370> this<00:02:39.940> is<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.360> reason<00:02:40.780> you<00:02:41.049> need

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
stores this is the reason you need

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.259 
stores this is the reason you need
articulation<00:02:42.129> in<00:02:42.370> their<00:02:42.610> wrists<00:02:42.880> look<00:02:43.180> at

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
articulation in their wrists look at

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.160 
articulation in their wrists look at
that<00:02:43.450> all<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:44.200> can<00:02:44.349> do<00:02:44.560> is<00:02:44.830> just<00:02:45.069> that<00:02:45.310> I<00:02:45.610> mean

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
that all you can do is just that I mean

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.470 
that all you can do is just that I mean
yeah<00:02:47.170> so<00:02:47.799> you<00:02:47.860> think<00:02:48.340> kids<00:02:48.579> you<00:02:48.880> can<00:02:49.030> fool<00:02:49.180> kids

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
yeah so you think kids you can fool kids
