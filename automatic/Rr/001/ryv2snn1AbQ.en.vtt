00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.260
 but really the horse world exhales one and this because of the outbreak of one 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.590
 dangerous variant of the casino 4s and our country already had to become horses 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:09.519
 finished 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.499
 breathing says that the advice seems to be not transporting their horse for the time being 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:17.060
 that virus in the horses and was looking for flu and in the worst case even 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.029
 rise 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.999
 very strong as the weakest links he is a teacher at the dutch equestrian 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:22.859
 anyway ops training 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.480
 peter welcome tonight 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.269
 what kind of virus is there 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.919
 hunt you could compare it to one 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.690
 with flu among gdp people 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.650
 only there are the three variants 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.680
 the first variant is that let the 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.950
 injured even though 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.580
 a few of the best can be will press freedom can be prevented 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.750
 schools 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.800
 that is all we can see once more than once 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.230
 can be and so that gentleman 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.700
 jac have a fever 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.780
 normally week for example two years restore ms 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.340
 another variant is that the reports are scotland and therefore more that is that day 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.440
 one that 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.040
 then repay the debts 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.740
 and the last variant is the poster for most horse lovers 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.040
 biggest problem is 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.800
 is the neurological variant that means that then the horses between striking 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.490
 phenomenon the or shortly thereafter cypers create gray body parts thus 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.680
 that she no longer 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.720
 was committed to the sport and what the front door most of course 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.800
 Microsoft is also the worst and oh yes 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.780
 is this now a new 4s 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.150
 no this is all virus which of course has been known for years and the and the city 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.130
 but well it is just now they have come in the press and too slow and three years in the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.870
 impression in publicity 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.170
 that the daddy went through it 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.900
 is about how many cases he gibberish 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.410
 Well I understand the tone that the two cases are known 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.050
 of which the us is also clearly the non-biological variant 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.920
 that seems to me not very much seems to me a lot of problems nevertheless it will be 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.310
 also widely measured in the media we are afraid 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.270
 yes I can imagine that you know that we are afraid 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.230
 country 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.700
 not everyone has that much experience with horses the first time 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.839
 And there are certainly riding stables where people are standing 

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:11.369
 with horses that 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:13.149
 yes what the enthusiast 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:16.669
 and of course perhaps the first horse is also only as pater guidelines 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.649
 are you yourself a teacher 

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:20.949
 what do you think they're up there 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:25.819
 yes we also advise the students in the or even we have the 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.299
 pupils take part-time training so that in the week and to school 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:29.999
 come 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:33.629
 we have so I said that they do not go to school with their horses 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.839
 have to come try of course 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:37.049
 preventive ok 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.579
 to be and thus also follow the advice of the fed 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:44.420
 of the of the two so get through the sector council through want what measures 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:45.969
 you take even more 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:48.769
 well we have but it was actually before 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.949
 before the rush is more emphasized 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:56.669
 We have been here from crisis to points the horses of the students who 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:59.309
 so come to us to have it grafted 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:00.910
 not just for the influenza 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.149
 because that's the standard 

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:04.949
 yes that is the standard therefore also x what 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:08.929
 what schools all paths just a compulsory youngsters have to follow 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:11.959
 competitions and tests are going on, but the city is also mandatory 

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:15.709
 run and have achieved for the 3 0 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.730
 so you must have all horses 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.720
 yes all the paths that are therefore all the paths of the students that are 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.089
 they are in advance 

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:26.609
 before they come to us for years, they are also checked for them 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:30.469
 had to be keen and support for influenza and for those who struggle because 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:32.940
 the wording will have to stop sometimes it can excite 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.149
 what is this virus transferable 

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:38.049
 it is transferable from park appart 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.670
 And it is so direct and so so that that contract is not in aviation 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.719
 just won't be covered by the air it is 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:49.290
 next to each other a year ago a salsa merengue about this yet 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.279
 get apart 

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:54.649
 BNN it is on it is also true that you can hear it even though they are next to each other 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.649
 And that is how the deed becomes 

00:03:57.649 --> 00:04:01.389
 in that since also infected but that so that also the other horse 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:02.489
 too sick of it 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.849
 the handlebar is on a piece of resistance in yes 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.049
 with horses and that becomes like the one who ever had one 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.799
 I regret the manner of speaking that is no guarantee that you will not 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.059
 you get the flu again outside it's like this is how you should see it 

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:18.909
 horses luca if they determined the parquet that little resistance 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.469
 it also runs the highest risk 

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:23.999
 but a few games canceled 

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:27.469
 all competitions are all canceled at the moment 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:32.219
 of three knows the Dutch championship last weekend 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.170
 reason for the basic sport in in Emmeloord 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.449
 it has been canceled and the next two weeks canceled 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:44.419
 so all the championships have been canceled and 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:45.629
 the 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:49.169
 basic competitive sport the multi-colored procession of kms also recommends the 

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:51.610
 all matches in between 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.580
 with that you can 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.159
 yes this is it is of course a concern and and fear is 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.309
 and it is also a sick preventive 

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:03.979
 I think the buildings on the other side too 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.559
 that one should not panic completely it is not a virus what now 

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:08.449
 in one go 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:12.169
 it comes from the sky what bred beforehand not known what works 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.810
 if there's brabant at indoor because it's coming again 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.170
 and the director marcel hunze has attracted because then one goes small 

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:23.639
 I also think that it can just continue I think it is the 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:24.520
 worth hearing 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.879
 good thing 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:29.729
 who then lives who then takes care of work and it is still true that quite a whole 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:35.659
 time away rudi never before the ship was the variants is is alcohol 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:38.759
 long known but my constant pressure 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:41.949
 but the problem is greater than that it is right 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:46.050
 Of course through a decree the meantime is always difficult to 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.259
 say that or you 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:49.410
 but i hope you can do so 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.610
 worked safely and makes worries I think a good one is a good feature 

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:58.729
 Yes on the other hand, even though you remain realistic after you are 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.509
 story of course it has been years that happen to be just two 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:06.190
 plates he died of it earlier there was nothing in advance 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.050
 something wrong with those paths but also good in this ek it is very sad if you 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.810
 if it happens to you it can also be done in india 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.830
 there are indications that development will continue if you get good ones there 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.069
 you're welcome 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:20.309
 thereby definitely be curious about your response after a few days of this 

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:24.539
 virus that there is a proposition four the fans actually book four hundred 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:28.969
 jobs a serious threat or it is no more than a movie let us know 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:31.449
 know to be no response 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:32.459
 the book
