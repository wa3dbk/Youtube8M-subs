very<00:00:45.420> cute

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:45.810 
very cute

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.430 
very cute
omocha<00:00:46.230> it's<00:00:46.950> timid<00:00:47.580> and<00:00:47.820> it's<00:00:48.270> max<00:00:48.570> speed<00:00:48.870> EVs

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
omocha it's timid and it's max speed EVs

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.940 
omocha it's timid and it's max speed EVs
so<00:00:50.220> somehow<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.240> out<00:00:51.390> speeds<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:52.320> event<00:00:52.830> oh<00:00:52.920> I

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
so somehow it out speeds this event oh I

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.820 
so somehow it out speeds this event oh I
think<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.310> just<00:00:53.370> an<00:00:53.580> in-game<00:00:53.820> team<00:00:54.120> so

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:54.830 
think this is just an in-game team so

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.860 
think this is just an in-game team so
yeah<00:00:55.830> so<00:00:56.220> it<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.790> was<00:00:56.940> super<00:00:57.210> effective<00:00:57.300> damage

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
yeah so it it was super effective damage

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.100 
yeah so it it was super effective damage
on<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:59.250> volt<00:00:59.460> switch<00:00:59.610> and<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.540> switch<00:01:00.720> out<00:01:00.840> into

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
on the volt switch and I switch out into

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.990 
on the volt switch and I switch out into
my<00:01:02.120> Prabhu<00:01:03.120> pass<00:01:03.360> which<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:04.339> my<00:01:05.339> mix<00:01:05.580> defense

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
my Prabhu pass which is my mix defense

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.969 
my Prabhu pass which is my mix defense
wall<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.540> specially<00:01:07.260> as<00:01:07.380> well<00:01:07.560> physically

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
wall is specially as well physically

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.210 
wall is specially as well physically
defensive<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.869> takes<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.950> powers

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
defensive so it takes this that powers

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.650 
defensive so it takes this that powers
really<00:01:11.580> nice<00:01:11.790> even<00:01:12.060> though<00:01:12.119> it's<00:01:12.390> like

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
really nice even though it's like

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.640 
really nice even though it's like
booster<00:01:13.110> by<00:01:13.550> Dan<00:01:14.550> aura<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.290> well<00:01:16.290> he<00:01:16.440> switches

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
booster by Dan aura and well he switches

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.870 
booster by Dan aura and well he switches
out<00:01:16.830> because<00:01:17.040> he<00:01:17.160> knows<00:01:17.280> he<00:01:17.369> can't<00:01:17.520> really<00:01:17.759> do

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
out because he knows he can't really do

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.570 
out because he knows he can't really do
much<00:01:17.910> to<00:01:18.210> me<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.770> I<00:01:19.770> take<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.009> opportunity

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
much to me and I take this opportunity

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.700 
much to me and I take this opportunity
to<00:01:20.610> set<00:01:21.180> up<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> staff<00:01:21.780> rock<00:01:22.020> wall<00:01:22.259> he<00:01:22.410> switches

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
to set up a staff rock wall he switches

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.760 
to set up a staff rock wall he switches
to<00:01:22.830> his<00:01:23.040> Lucario<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:28.020> lockers<00:01:28.320> obviously

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
to his Lucario and the lockers obviously

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.200 
to his Lucario and the lockers obviously
is<00:01:28.830> going<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.190> go<00:01:29.310> for<00:01:29.520> close<00:01:29.700> combat<00:01:29.940> which

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
is going to go for close combat which

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.460 
is going to go for close combat which
would<00:01:30.390> definitely<00:01:31.140> kill<00:01:31.410> me<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:33.290> turned<00:01:34.290> to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
would definitely kill me so I turned to

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.960 
would definitely kill me so I turned to
my<00:01:34.649> bulky<00:01:35.960> dragon<00:01:36.960> dance

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
my bulky dragon dance

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.710 
my bulky dragon dance
Altaria<00:01:40.070> which<00:01:41.070> takes<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.880> close<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.270> combat

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
Altaria which takes the close of combat

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.620 
Altaria which takes the close of combat
pretty<00:01:42.960> nicely

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.289 

and<00:01:50.220> after<00:01:51.220> that<00:01:51.310> he<00:01:51.430> gets<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.700> defense<00:01:52.000> drop

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
and after that he gets the defense drop

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.090 
and after that he gets the defense drop
so<00:01:52.509> I<00:01:52.540> don't<00:01:52.900> think<00:01:52.960> we'll<00:01:53.470> be<00:01:53.590> staying<00:01:53.740> in

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
so I don't think we'll be staying in

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.920 
so I don't think we'll be staying in
match<00:01:54.250> so<00:01:54.490> I<00:01:54.520> took<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:55.090> opportunity<00:01:55.299> to<00:01:55.750> set

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
match so I took the opportunity to set

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.990 
match so I took the opportunity to set
up<00:01:56.020> one<00:01:56.670> dragon<00:01:57.670> dance<00:01:58.080> and<00:01:59.610> you<00:02:00.610> see<00:02:00.790> as<00:02:00.909> he
