electric vehicle the battery pack is in
the<00:00:40.770> floor<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> car<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.879> keeps<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
the floor of the car so it keeps the

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.119 
the floor of the car so it keeps the
weight<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.540> those<00:00:42.600> batteries<00:00:43.050> down<00:00:43.200> low<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
rear wheels for great weight

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.590 
rear wheels for great weight
distribution<00:00:46.940> because<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.030> battery<00:00:48.270> pack<00:00:48.450> is

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
distribution because the battery pack is

the mapping data comes from Google but

but<00:02:23.489> overall<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.880> can<00:02:24.000> do<00:02:24.180> Google<00:02:24.360> point<00:02:24.690> of

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
but overall you can do Google point of

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.090 
but overall you can do Google point of
interest<00:02:25.019> search<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.530> again<00:02:25.800> you've<00:02:25.950> got<00:02:25.980> a

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
interest search and again you've got a

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.370

full satellite imagery here as well and

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.199 
full satellite imagery here as well and
perhaps<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:29.010> most<00:02:29.160> talked-about<00:02:29.430> feature<00:02:29.970> of

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
perhaps the most talked-about feature of

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.140 
perhaps the most talked-about feature of
this<00:02:30.300> car<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.840> full<00:02:31.709> WebKit<00:02:32.310> browser<00:02:32.910> built

this car a full WebKit browser built

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.030 
this car a full WebKit browser built
into<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.690> dashboard<00:02:33.870> which<00:02:34.350> you<00:02:34.530> can<00:02:34.769> yes

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.580 
into the dashboard which you can yes
control<00:02:35.580> even<00:02:36.390> while<00:02:36.660> you're<00:02:36.900> driving<00:02:37.440> the

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.490 
control even while you're driving the
car<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:38.250> it's<00:02:38.400> not<00:02:38.519> perhaps<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.090> most

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
car so it's not perhaps the most

while you're driving if you like but

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.650 
while you're driving if you like but
let's<00:02:47.610> talk<00:02:47.790> about<00:02:47.940> more<00:02:48.269> important<00:02:48.630> things

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
let's talk about more important things

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.080 
let's talk about more important things
like<00:02:48.900> actually<00:02:49.230> driving<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.980> car<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.910> on<00:02:51.030> the

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
like actually driving the car so on the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.670 
like actually driving the car so on the
highway<00:02:51.390> now<00:02:51.600> cruising<00:02:52.080> in<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.200> Model<00:02:52.530> S<00:02:52.650> and

highway now cruising in the Model S and
the<00:02:52.920> first<00:02:53.130> thing<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.400> notice<00:02:53.730> is<00:02:53.820> of<00:02:54.000> course

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
the first thing you notice is of course

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.030 
the first thing you notice is of course
that<00:02:54.570> there's<00:02:54.780> not<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:54.989> lot<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.290> notice<00:02:55.620> from<00:02:55.860> an

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
that there's not a lot to notice from an

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.040 
that there's not a lot to notice from an
audio<00:02:56.340> standpoint<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.060> is<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.420> course<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.870> very

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
audio standpoint it is of course a very

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.199 
audio standpoint it is of course a very
quiet<00:02:58.410> car<00:02:58.709> we're<00:02:58.890> talking<00:02:59.190> about<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.459> Puri<00:02:59.880> V

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
quiet car we're talking about a Puri V

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.670 
quiet car we're talking about a Puri V
here<00:03:00.480> there's<00:03:00.660> no<00:03:00.810> hybrid<00:03:01.230> motor<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.590> be

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
here there's no hybrid motor to be

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.020 
here there's no hybrid motor to be
humming<00:03:01.860> away<00:03:02.130> or<00:03:02.280> anything<00:03:02.370> like<00:03:02.640> that<00:03:02.700> so

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
humming away or anything like that so

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.390 
humming away or anything like that so
it's<00:03:03.330> very<00:03:03.600> quiet<00:03:03.930> but<00:03:04.140> even<00:03:04.680> going<00:03:05.010> beyond

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
it's very quiet but even going beyond

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.470 
it's very quiet but even going beyond
the<00:03:05.550> fact<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:05.820> there's<00:03:06.000> no<00:03:06.150> internal

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
have a conversation very easily or you

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.060 
have a conversation very easily or you

can enjoy this 7.1 surround system that
they<00:03:24.160> put<00:03:24.340> in<00:03:24.430> here<00:03:24.550> too

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
they put in here too

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.300 
they put in here too
now<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.510> driving<00:03:25.990> dynamics<00:03:26.500> of<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.740> car<00:03:26.950> are

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
now the driving dynamics of the car are

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.910 
now the driving dynamics of the car are
a<00:03:27.850> little<00:03:28.060> bit<00:03:28.240> complicated<00:03:28.540> to<00:03:28.990> explain<00:03:29.110> this

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
a little bit complicated to explain this

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.820 
a little bit complicated to explain this
is<00:03:30.130> a<00:03:30.160> very<00:03:30.550> heavy<00:03:30.850> car<00:03:31.230> 4,600<00:03:32.230> pounds<00:03:32.260> which

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
is a very heavy car 4,600 pounds which

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.530 
is a very heavy car 4,600 pounds which
definitely<00:03:33.130> puts<00:03:33.460> it<00:03:33.640> at<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:34.000> top<00:03:34.240> of<00:03:34.270> its

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
definitely puts it at the top of its

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.630 
definitely puts it at the top of its
weight<00:03:34.720> class<00:03:34.990> by<00:03:35.710> longshot<00:03:36.190> but<00:03:36.370> again

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
weight class by longshot but again

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.280 
weight class by longshot but again
because<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.120> battery<00:03:37.450> pack<00:03:37.630> is<00:03:37.780> mount<00:03:37.990> is<00:03:38.110> so

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
because the battery pack is mount is so

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.990 
because the battery pack is mount is so
low<00:03:38.470> it<00:03:38.650> actually<00:03:38.920> handles<00:03:39.100> very<00:03:39.310> well<00:03:39.550> for<00:03:39.970> a

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
low it actually handles very well for a

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.970 
low it actually handles very well for a
car<00:03:40.210> of<00:03:40.300> this<00:03:40.420> weight<00:03:40.690> it's<00:03:41.260> not<00:03:41.380> exactly

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.380 
reassuringly and with the rear wheel
drive<00:03:48.220> it's<00:03:48.460> definitely<00:03:48.760> a<00:03:48.790> lot<00:03:48.910> of<00:03:49.030> fun<00:03:49.210> with

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
fun at least until the traction control

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.830 
fun at least until the traction control
kicks<00:03:54.010> in<00:03:54.190> but<00:03:54.790> you<00:03:54.910> can<00:03:55.030> turn<00:03:55.150> that<00:03:55.300> off<00:03:55.420> now

thankfully<00:04:02.380> Tesla's<00:04:02.740> made<00:04:02.920> all<00:04:03.070> the<00:04:03.190> buttons

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:04.920 
thankfully Tesla's made all the buttons
big<00:04:03.730> so<00:04:03.910> they're<00:04:04.030> pretty<00:04:04.120> easy<00:04:04.330> to<00:04:04.510> find<00:04:04.660> and

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
big so they're pretty easy to find and

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.420 
big so they're pretty easy to find and
the<00:04:05.020> important<00:04:05.380> ones<00:04:05.590> like<00:04:05.890> changing<00:04:06.340> the

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
the important ones like changing the

the important ones like changing the
temperature<00:04:06.730> and<00:04:07.330> the<00:04:07.510> volume<00:04:07.870> are<00:04:08.260> always<00:04:08.530> in

temperature and the volume are always in
the<00:04:08.709> same<00:04:08.860> place<00:04:09.040> so<00:04:09.310> you<00:04:09.370> can<00:04:09.550> pretty<00:04:09.820> quickly

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
the same place so you can pretty quickly

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.090 
the same place so you can pretty quickly
get<00:04:10.330> some<00:04:10.480> muscle<00:04:10.750> memory<00:04:10.990> going<00:04:11.200> but<00:04:11.950> there's

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
get some muscle memory going but there's
