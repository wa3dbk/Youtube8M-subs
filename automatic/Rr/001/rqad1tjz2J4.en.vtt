originally<00:04:37.830> took<00:04:38.830> because<00:04:39.250> he<00:04:39.430> rough<00:04:39.640> around

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
originally took because he rough around

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.540 
originally took because he rough around
the<00:04:39.970> edges<00:04:40.090> just<00:04:40.360> normal<00:04:41.020> as<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:41.230> surface<00:04:41.710> so

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
the edges just normal as the surface so

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.260 
the edges just normal as the surface so
wasn't<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:44.110> then<00:04:44.290> there's<00:04:44.530> that<00:04:45.090> when<00:04:46.090> people

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
wasn't and then there's that when people
