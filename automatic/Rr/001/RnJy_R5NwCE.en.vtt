00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:02.959
 but the spectators themselves stand out not 3 4 7 and 7 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:05.279
 tell you how to spend electricity 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.250
 beds northerners ax 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.180
 who does not know how to repair equipment 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.849
 look at their development 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.969
 even the very beginning of the answer did not give Titian 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.590
 on two points, that is, on the diagonal of a, 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.710
 to point b 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.710
 dealing with reverse direct 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.759
 so 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.519
 for the competition click on one point 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.339
 Kamyshin amendment click on another 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:28.380
 point by the way we see a message that 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.740
 fastened flowers 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.220
 that is, it pays the energy parameter 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.460
 authorities from July 1 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.770
 so we give her what we need now 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:36.940
 make limits 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.270
 after arrival of cubes of mission top 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.510
 will be your territory but to 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.890
 do not suffer and count to whom 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.540
 just made without limits i.e. 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.270
 made the upper hand it will be your title to the end 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.700
 that minimum to heaven 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.950
 So this is what the press writes. 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.030
 purpose of the action 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.590
 all pulled alerts that the limits were down 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.920
 and up 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.460
 advanced to the end of the previous one 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.429
 maximum 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:00.520
 so 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.840
 Now we have allocated the same territory 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.570
 only secure for themselves we write flights 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.620
 craig 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.080
 but for some reason on its territory 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.650
 m.ostapenko 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.670
 but I am baptized in the chat for myself and the sites 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.670
 due to this stage 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.530
 itar tass we all did transport 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.960
 our tour no one can our 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.400
 territory to be thrust 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.380
 I will explain to myself and play with my friend 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.650
 and you want your friend to be here too 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.670
 being built 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.009
 tuesday he doesn't have to be 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:32.810
 sits next reproaches your territory you 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.290
 can residents can do it yourself 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.310
 let's say without tons there are two ways 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.159
 how can you allow your friend system 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:41.950
 quote assign it canceled 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.680
 but assigned to admins player and your 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.090
 friend only 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.780
 being kept on protecting your friend by exchange 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.390
 then he himself must be and prescribe 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.640
 one 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.220
 the functions of which he will be himself 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.229
 resolves the abishy becomes like that and he 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.920
 the most powerful prescribe yourself 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.210
 what can he do in your territory 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.350
 but if you didnâ€™t bring the amount 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.220
 other customs and enter into account 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.830
 shared so consider the first how 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.459
 put your friend on 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.789
 write commander to save 

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:14.979
 this is an array of the main of which are configured 

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:16.480
 everything in the world and any slaves 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.079
 so we write once 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:19.779
 then us they are your territories ours with 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:22.139
 considering that stage then a space 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:24.519
 companion entered the friend of the deceased friend 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.169
 then space 

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:29.169
 in the Cabinet 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:31.989
 in practice 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.489
 as you wish 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.980
 aut training seems rotation will be 5 and so 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.219
 same moment 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.309
 if you see the text faxes 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:40.929
 it means to do everything right 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:42.799
 lubricate the rector refreshed and your friend 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.799
 became admins 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:47.629
 practice 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:48.989
 If you 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.189
 do not trust your friend that something can 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:52.899
 screw up your territory 

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:55.369
 yes you can tune yourself 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:57.619
 separately without this 3 and 4 main 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:59.009
 I write the flag in which you can 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:01.639
 construction marked their most 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.409
 lot 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.629
 let's start pumped out our array to paint 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.289
 then space 

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:09.639
 In Kazan, our territory TEC 1 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.349
 photo of Vladimir friend 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.489
 Here on that in protection we admit 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.029
 let build your friend write 

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:19.179
 release build 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:22.559
 here is the flag when to build chat 

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:25.029
 EU flag is when you allow 

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:28.029
 enjoy rpz jeremiah broadcast 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.639
 percent of these strings 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.559
 it's all allowed to do what 

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:36.699
 click refills mouse button noticing 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:39.249
 if you don't have a chest 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:40.539
 and the flag 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:43.549
 container this is just that step for him to fight 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.789
 your list of dukas so for that 

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:47.719
 to allow it let's say it is built 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:49.249
 will be 

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:51.400
 you mongolia bottle space 5 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.869
 so he 

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:54.539
 these are our mammoths 

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:56.429
 but I as told faxes mean 

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:58.189
 we will expand the device 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:00.539
 can quietly built here 

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:03.249
 can customize them 

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:05.249
 it's in Poland door 

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:07.849
 and liver allow 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.069
 it will be us 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.719
 and feeling also write to a friend 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:14.309
 there are two types of control and falls 

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:16.159
 a corpse is when you allow a falls 

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:17.699
 this is when you ban on data 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:21.099
 whose actions are highlighted here 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:22.860
 let's say pit now 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.289
 allowed from other things is possible only on 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.319
 we do not sleep at the end of this territory 

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:29.999
 we see messages faxes mean we 

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:32.289
 did everything right if you enter 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.330
 data team knight and hayloft flag 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.259
 in red letters to go whether some 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:37.020
 never 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.930
 and laying chichakli committed 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.930
 carrier lights exist 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:44.449
 she is 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:47.759
 but against all flags disassembled all the functions 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.800
 I repeat again 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.590
 the main array of cleaning torosyan 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.490
 remains taras save 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.689
 The main flags of the functions of the bow when the EU 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:58.659
 build 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:59.969
 trainer 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:01.989
 it's clear overhead gray-haired insist 

00:05:01.989 --> 00:05:02.939
 friend's spring 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:04.879
 it is enough for them to develop for 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:07.139
 living our territory 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.270
 that's allow him not to make a fire 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.539
 water is not so important but if you 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.379
 want to do it to a pain like that 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:14.330
 look at the form 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.509
 in Korea kisin 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:20.509
 taken from the forest fully function 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.789
 today it seems to be all 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.979
 if you do not understand something you can ask 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.990
 again 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.849
 so clearly explained everything in his blog 4 7 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:31.689
 failures 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:33.240
 there our stalls 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.940
 after borrow
