slide back and forth so you have some
adjustability<00:02:03.560> this<00:02:04.560> loop<00:02:04.890> here<00:02:05.070> will<00:02:05.280> let

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
adjustability this loop here will let

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.240 
adjustability this loop here will let
the<00:02:05.490> seats<00:02:05.730> fold<00:02:06.000> flat<00:02:06.410> and<00:02:07.410> this<00:02:07.590> hard<00:02:07.890> handle

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
the seats fold flat and this hard handle

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.790 
the seats fold flat and this hard handle
will<00:02:08.399> allow<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:09.200> accordion<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.320> seat<00:02:10.560> up

will allow you to accordion the seat up
so<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.280> have<00:02:11.430> better<00:02:11.610> access<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.300> rear

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
so you have better access to the rear

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.710 
so you have better access to the rear
seat<00:02:13.070> this<00:02:14.070> is<00:02:14.340> your<00:02:14.490> rear<00:02:14.700> seat<00:02:15.060> compartment
