00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
gauntlet a little bit silly because

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.750 
gauntlet a little bit silly because
obviously<00:02:42.049> never<00:02:42.590> seen<00:02:42.830> wield<00:02:43.100> it<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.519> it's<00:02:43.640> a

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
obviously never seen wield it and it's a

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.699 
obviously never seen wield it and it's a
bit<00:02:43.880> overkill<00:02:44.330> but<00:02:45.110> it's<00:02:45.440> something

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
bit overkill but it's something

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.050 
bit overkill but it's something
different<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:48.620> weapon<00:02:48.890> itself<00:02:48.980> has<00:02:49.730> two
