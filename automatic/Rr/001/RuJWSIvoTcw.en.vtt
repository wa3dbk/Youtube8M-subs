00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.039 

okay<00:00:02.220> I'm<00:00:02.310> testing<00:00:02.820> the<00:00:03.030> sound<00:00:03.419> differences

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
okay I'm testing the sound differences

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.890 
okay I'm testing the sound differences
for<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:05.420> SP<00:00:06.420> 120<00:00:07.140> high-performance<00:00:08.099> addition

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900 
for the SP 120 high-performance addition

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.560 
for the SP 120 high-performance addition
they<00:00:09.900> also<00:00:09.929> come<00:00:10.320> with<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:11.059> little<00:00:12.059> connector

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
they also come with the little connector

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.010 
they also come with the little connector
here<00:00:12.780> that<00:00:13.259> downs<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.830> voltage<00:00:14.219> then<00:00:15.020> makes

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
here that downs the voltage then makes

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.550 
here that downs the voltage then makes
it<00:00:16.170> spin<00:00:16.350> in<00:00:16.470> about<00:00:16.650> half<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.859> RPM<00:00:18.470> here's<00:00:19.470> a

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
it spin in about half the RPM here's a

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.189 
it spin in about half the RPM here's a
sound<00:00:19.949> test<00:00:20.279> for<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.960> ambient

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
sound test for it this is the ambient

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.710 
sound test for it this is the ambient
noise<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.710> my<00:00:22.800> system<00:00:23.130> right<00:00:23.279> now<00:00:23.510> I'm<00:00:24.510> just

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
noise of my system right now I'm just

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.470 
noise of my system right now I'm just
setting<00:00:24.840> up<00:00:25.050> for<00:00:25.080> my<00:00:25.260> water<00:00:25.500> coin<00:00:29.150> so<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.330> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
setting up for my water coin so it's the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.860 
setting up for my water coin so it's the
ambient<00:00:30.779> sound<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.740> room<00:00:32.630> let's<00:00:33.630> go<00:00:33.780> ahead

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
ambient sound in the room let's go ahead

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.049 
ambient sound in the room let's go ahead
and<00:00:34.050> connect<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:35.190> first<00:00:35.460> one<00:00:35.700> here<00:00:35.940> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
and connect this this first one here the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.610 
and connect this this first one here the
blue<00:00:36.270> one<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:37.040> with<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.370> voltage<00:00:38.910> reducer<00:00:39.390> on

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
blue one is with the voltage reducer on

00:00:39.620 --> 00:01:03.110 
blue one is with the voltage reducer on
let's<00:00:40.620> go<00:00:40.770> ahead<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.040> hook<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.309> up

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.789 

I<00:01:03.180> don't<00:01:03.930> know<00:01:04.019> how<00:01:04.140> well<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.409> comes<00:01:04.650> across

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
I don't know how well this comes across

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.570 
I don't know how well this comes across
in<00:01:05.129> video<00:01:05.369> but<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.670> actually<00:01:05.970> really<00:01:06.000> quiet

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
in video but it's actually really quiet

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.190 
in video but it's actually really quiet
-<00:01:08.580> it's<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.030> great<00:01:09.240> speed<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.630> think<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:10.110> about

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
- it's a great speed I think it's about

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:26.679 
- it's a great speed I think it's about
1,200<00:01:10.860> rpms<00:01:11.759> maybe<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.119> touch<00:01:12.299> less

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.120 

trying<00:01:27.290> to<00:01:27.350> get<00:01:27.439> the<00:01:27.560> microphone<00:01:27.710> at

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
trying to get the microphone at

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:40.440 
trying to get the microphone at
different<00:01:28.430> points<00:01:28.759> around<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.060> fan

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.140 

okay<00:01:41.350> I'm<00:01:41.560> going<00:01:41.710> to<00:01:41.799> connect<00:01:42.040> this<00:01:42.189> one<00:01:45.150> and

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
okay I'm going to connect this one and

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.210 
okay I'm going to connect this one and
now<00:01:46.540> I'm<00:01:46.960> going<00:01:47.320> to<00:01:47.439> connect<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:47.799> red<00:01:47.979> one

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
now I'm going to connect the red one

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.039 
now I'm going to connect the red one
which<00:01:49.180> I've<00:01:49.450> taken<00:01:49.689> the<00:01:50.080> voltage<00:01:50.470> reducer<00:01:52.049> off

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
which I've taken the voltage reducer off

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.870 
which I've taken the voltage reducer off
of

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
of

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:02.789

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:37.820 

and<00:02:03.399> this<00:02:03.579> is<00:02:03.729> without<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.149> voltage<00:02:04.450> reducer

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.310 

okay<00:02:39.170> that's<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.350> thanks<00:02:40.950> for<00:02:40.980> watching
