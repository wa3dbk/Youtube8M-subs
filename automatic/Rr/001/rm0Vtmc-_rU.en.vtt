 you have a new video of vÃ©lez in a 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.110
 tutorial on how to put the percentage of 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.670
 the battery in your ipod touch and good as 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.560
 you know the iphone and the ipad 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.150
 always determined that function without 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.039
 However in the case of ipod touch it is 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.439
 different since the operating system does not 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.210
 it allows and well this tutorial serves 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.890
 with any ipod touch of any 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.390
 generation whether you have a 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.820
 hypothesis of the first second third 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.040
 generation or have the fourth or the 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.990
 fifth generation is going to serve you 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.600
 only you need is jailbreak if you 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.329
 you still do not know how to do it I'm going to leave a 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.620
 link here below in the description and if not 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.270
 will also be showing up here in 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.760
 the screen 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.040
 how to do the jailbreak good friends 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.090
 what we have to do is go to 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.710
 Syria 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.290
 good friends we are going to look for the 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.630
 tube dsb this link is a free tour 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.570
 so you do not need any repo anything 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.700
 more they look for it already in Syria and good and 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.070
 once they have installed it if 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.560
 we put our finger here is going to 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.390
 appear this box which is useful 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.460
 for example, to turn off or turn on the 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.560
 wifi and bluetooth or I do not know without the 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.290
 need some adjustments but good 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.690
 going back to the subject of the battery we are going to 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.980
 this box where moore says here this 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.440
 small 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.000
 and good if this menu will appear 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.659
 of options already once we have 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.969
 tight on more 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.979
 and good to change the percentage of the 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:31.770
 battery or rather putting it is where 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.259
 there are options and as you see I have 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.780
 enabled this option which if you 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.420
 enabled already the percentage disappears 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.280
 well there are also some options but 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.159
 I recommend that you leave them as they are 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.829
 that's how easy it really is 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.719
 simple as they come appears and disappears and 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.849
 well that's the first good method 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:54.270
 friends is the second method is more this 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:55.770
 a little simpler and we're going to 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.879
 go to the application of that of this links 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.459
 which is installed at the moment of 

00:01:56.879 --> 00:02:01.679
 install this tweet neglect and good if the 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:03.679
 we can take us directly to the 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:05.700
 menu that took us on this ipod touch 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.619
 we're going to the bottom and 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.690
 we locate where it says there are options 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.069
 same since the system options 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.930
 we can enable or 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.940
 disable the percentage of the battery 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.799
 It is equal to our equal taste 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.299
 I recommend that nothing move here 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.129
