then<00:00:36.170> the<00:00:37.170> trick<00:00:37.380> Express<00:00:37.770> trains<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.280> go

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
then the trick Express trains can go

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.150 
then the trick Express trains can go
straight<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.360> Express<00:00:39.690> track<00:00:40.129> then<00:00:41.129> the

straight on the Express track then the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.560 
straight on the Express track then the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
northbound track you see the Y switch

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.619 
northbound track you see the Y switch
with<00:00:52.559> T<00:00:52.739> switch<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.760> goes<00:00:53.820> into<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.329> yard

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.619 
with T switch that goes into the yard
which<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.500> have<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> bunch<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.039> translate<00:00:56.460> up

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
which I have a bunch of translate up

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.139 
which I have a bunch of translate up
goes<00:00:57.629> around<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.050> loop<00:00:58.940> there's<00:00:59.940> another

goes around the loop there's another

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.180 
goes around the loop there's another
yard<00:01:00.510> another<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:01.260> our<00:01:01.559> track<00:01:01.800> there<00:01:02.070> with
