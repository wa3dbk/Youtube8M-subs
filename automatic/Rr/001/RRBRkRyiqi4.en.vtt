00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:22.610
 now both personally I'm already here 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:26.869
 my cat i am today I'll write will 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:30.740
 be about how to protect the training here 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:35.390
 on the jbb server since it has been 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:38.150
 generate too much confusion with the new 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.650
 drains that the neighborhood of residence 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.199
 so I'm going to make a small 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:49.280
 tutorial on how to do it 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:51.770
 much goes first ready this is is the 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.739
 plugin in which we have here all 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:58.609
 good barrese afghan commands of education 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.649
 we have all the commands that the 2/3 point 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.690
 to be a space 2 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.990
 let's see is the second page of commands 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.860
 and so on up to 6 with you 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:18.349
 can see here ready is needed just 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:20.780
 So a gold shovel is and let's go. 

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:23.630
 Then start to do this is my 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.910
 shop and as you can see she is not 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.160
 protected anyone can come here 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:33.110
 to take anything has already been spelled 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:36.170
 and tupã and this brings so come on I 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.330
 I want to enjoy this store, but suddenly 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.640
 the first will be one of the protections 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.280
 old houses 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.500
 make 23 21 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.649
 What is not now possible is now 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:55.610
 possible ten months testing that the best 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:57.560
 10 blocks blocks ready so much and r was 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.759
 visited because there was a bank with the 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.700
 other protections at 23 20 we have to 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.720
 buy a coal ranking or above 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.509
 as you wish 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:13.920
 It's not like that, I'm going to go at the expense of two 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:17.400

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.120
 and things came vim province which is enough 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.950
 good 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.430
 can also use these plates that 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.319
 with these cards for example when we 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:31.920
 we do not have a sign as you can see 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:34.530
 hereditary blood a plaque 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.690
 we can see that I created a project 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.450
 design or who comes here does not 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:44.250
 can have this crazy because he is 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:46.800
 automatically thing by this then we 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.130
 we solve then take our home then 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.860
