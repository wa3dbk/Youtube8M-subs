00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.850
 when we go on vacation put the 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.950
 unnecessary fair amount of clothing 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.200
 accessories and products can reach 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.640
 be very challenging for that in this video 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.230
 I'm going to show you what the 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.220
 essentials of my suitcase for my 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.220
 Summer Vacation 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.330
 even though it's hot, it can not 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.800
 missing a sweater in my suitcase and in 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.930
 Sometimes also a jacket 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.040
 denning one never knows if he's going to make a 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.040
 little cold in the night 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.480
 another thinkable interest is a black leader 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.960
 dress' that goes with everything and for all types 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.960
 used 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.609
 benin tours go with everything and are 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.289
 super comfortable and a black skirt is a 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:49.949
 Basic to create casual looks 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:49.949
 informal 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.040
 jeans for a cloudy morning or 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.059
 just how many is so much to be 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.059
 a little more covered 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.070
 As for the tops I always carry 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.490
 four types one of bright color one 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.490
 black 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.080
 one white and one stamped 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.670
 If I go to the beach I always take a couple 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.800
 of georges stamped to assemble the 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.800
 fun and of course a bikini 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.909
 then I bring a moisturizer and this 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.000
 I like it because it has a satin effect 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.010
 golden ideal for summer 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.710
 I also carry my basics for a 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.730
 natural and fresh makeup and especially 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.730
 waterproof 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.370
 hat and glasses to protect the sun 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.370
 and a perfume 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.460
 I like colorful shoes 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.439
 neutral as nut and black and for 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.119
 save space but more fifth ip in 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.119
 the soles instead of putting them in bags 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.980
 I also take the iron to go, which is 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.840
 the perfect size to travel and comes 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.550
 with a special case to store it 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.010
 although it is very hot 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.160
 and finally my camera for 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.690
 have memories of everything all this I entered 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.790
 no problems in the take away bag 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.760
 that apart from being very tender has 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.890
 wheels to bring a wish one of 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.600
 my priorities is to travel comfortably so 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.060
 I like to dress in layers of clothes 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.710
 soft and light laws and a cardigan 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.180
 cozy I find the best 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.490
 expressions for long trips 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.300
 in this way we will arrive as new to 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.300
 our destiny
