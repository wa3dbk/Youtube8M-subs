we decided to kind of change this game
up<00:00:46.040> a<00:00:46.160> little<00:00:46.370> bit<00:00:46.520> called<00:00:46.790> hope<00:00:48.820> by<00:00:49.820> given<00:00:50.210> by

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
up a little bit called hope by given by

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.530 
up a little bit called hope by given by
guys<00:00:50.480> shield<00:00:50.870> so<00:00:51.110> I<00:00:51.140> can't<00:00:51.410> do<00:00:51.620> that<00:00:51.800> but<00:00:52.540> I've

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
guys shield so I can't do that but I've

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.029 
guys shield so I can't do that but I've
already<00:00:53.750> thought<00:00:53.870> about<00:00:54.020> some<00:00:55.010> new

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
already thought about some new

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.270 
already thought about some new
strategies<00:00:56.050> on<00:00:57.050> top<00:00:57.320> of<00:00:57.350> which<00:00:57.530> were<00:00:57.770> playing

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
strategies on top of which were playing

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.549 
strategies on top of which were playing
just<00:00:58.610> with<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:58.850> starter<00:00:59.180> set<00:00:59.450> so<00:01:00.140> I<00:01:00.170> got<00:01:00.350> nine

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
just with the starter set so I got nine

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.020 
just with the starter set so I got nine
frigates<00:01:01.010> over<00:01:01.160> here<00:01:01.280> these<00:01:01.460> this<00:01:01.730> is<00:01:01.850> not

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
frigates over here these this is not

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.660 
frigates over here these this is not
deployment<00:01:03.159> this<00:01:04.159> would<00:01:04.309> be<00:01:04.430> a<00:01:04.460> horrible

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
deployment this would be a horrible

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.510 
deployment this would be a horrible
deployment<00:01:05.509> of<00:01:05.630> frigates<00:01:08.259> and<00:01:09.259> the<00:01:10.219> ground

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
deployment of frigates and the ground

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.819 
deployment of frigates and the ground
you're<00:01:10.729> like<00:01:10.850> oh<00:01:11.029> man<00:01:11.420> you're<00:01:11.869> in<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.200> green

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:16.069 
polluted it's a different timeline and

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:18.099 
polluted it's a different timeline and
if<00:01:16.249> you<00:01:16.340> don't<00:01:16.609> like<00:01:16.700> it<00:01:17.090> then<00:01:17.119> you<00:01:17.389> stop

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
wouldn't be able to do this there's a

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.010 
wouldn't be able to do this there's a
lot<00:01:22.069> of<00:01:22.099> you<00:01:22.579> know<00:01:22.639> nasty<00:01:23.209> nasty<00:01:23.719> the<00:01:24.590> kelp

lot of you know nasty nasty the kelp

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.959 
lot of you know nasty nasty the kelp
slowed<00:01:27.020> noises<00:01:27.499> a<00:01:27.529> lot<00:01:27.740> of<00:01:27.859> solutions<00:01:28.399> natural

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
slowed noises a lot of solutions natural

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:31.480 
slowed noises a lot of solutions natural
growth<00:01:29.240> yeah<00:01:29.659> well<00:01:30.200> it's<00:01:30.740> a<00:01:30.770> kelp<00:01:31.039> ocean

growth yeah well it's a kelp ocean
anyways<00:01:32.060> we're<00:01:32.869> using<00:01:33.049> the<00:01:33.259> pieces<00:01:34.159> from

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
anyways we're using the pieces from

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.249 
anyways we're using the pieces from
mainly<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:36.919> pieces<00:01:37.279> from<00:01:37.719> epic<00:01:38.719> train<00:01:38.959> as

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
mainly the pieces from epic train as

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.339 
mainly the pieces from epic train as
islands<00:01:40.179> and<00:01:41.179> tony<00:01:41.749> is<00:01:41.929> actually<00:01:42.169> going<00:01:42.259> to

00:01:42.339 --> 00:01:42.349 
islands and tony is actually going to

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:44.620 
islands and tony is actually going to
introduce<00:01:42.529> cards<00:01:43.310> that<00:01:43.579> do<00:01:43.969> some<00:01:44.450> more

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
introduce cards that do some more

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.679 
introduce cards that do some more
weirdness<00:01:45.049> regarding<00:01:45.770> fog<00:01:46.009> of<00:01:46.189> war

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
weirdness regarding fog of war

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.569 
weirdness regarding fog of war
deployment<00:01:47.689> on<00:01:47.749> this<00:01:47.929> game<00:01:48.109> we<00:01:48.859> believe<00:01:49.189> is<00:01:49.369> 10

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
deployment on this game we believe is 10

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.729 
deployment on this game we believe is 10
inches<00:01:49.609> I<00:01:50.179> believe<00:01:50.899> it's<00:01:51.079> ten<00:01:51.289> it<00:01:51.469> can't<00:01:51.679> be

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:51.739 
inches I believe it's ten it can't be

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:54.069 
inches I believe it's ten it can't be
more<00:01:51.919> than<00:01:51.950> 12<00:01:52.340> so<00:01:53.029> patata<00:01:53.479> so<00:01:53.929> we're<00:01:54.049> just

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
more than 12 so patata so we're just

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.959 
more than 12 so patata so we're just
going<00:01:54.319> to<00:01:54.349> force<00:01:54.919> ourselves<00:01:55.069> to<00:01:55.399> accept<00:01:55.759> 10

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
going to force ourselves to accept 10

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.679 
going to force ourselves to accept 10
inches<00:01:56.299> as<00:01:56.509> our<00:01:56.659> deployment<00:01:57.139> zone<00:01:58.689> and

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
inches as our deployment zone and

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.699 
inches as our deployment zone and
dystopian<00:02:00.499> wars<00:02:00.770> you<00:02:01.340> pretty<00:02:01.909> much<00:02:01.999> have

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:02.709 
dystopian wars you pretty much have

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:06.569 
dystopian wars you pretty much have
series<00:02:03.709> of<00:02:03.859> units<00:02:04.159> so<00:02:04.369> all<00:02:04.669> of<00:02:04.700> my<00:02:05.029> cruisers

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.580 
activates as in it the frigates over
here<00:02:13.849> can<00:02:14.090> be<00:02:14.120> broken<00:02:14.390> up<00:02:14.540> into<00:02:14.780> two<00:02:15.019> three<00:02:15.439> or

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
here can be broken up into two three or

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.890 
here can be broken up into two three or
four

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
four

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.360 
four
since<00:02:16.349> I<00:02:16.439> have<00:02:16.470> nine<00:02:16.739> I<00:02:16.769> could<00:02:17.010> do<00:02:17.099> it<00:02:17.250> two

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
since I have nine I could do it two

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.069 
since I have nine I could do it two
three<00:02:17.610> four<00:02:17.849> that's<00:02:18.090> what<00:02:18.239> Tony's<00:02:18.569> doing<00:02:18.599> over

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
three four that's what Tony's doing over

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.140 
three four that's what Tony's doing over
I'm<00:02:19.170> foreign<00:02:19.590> but<00:02:20.549> I<00:02:20.579> think<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:20.790> want<00:02:20.909> to<00:02:20.970> just

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
I'm foreign but I think I want to just

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.000 
I'm foreign but I think I want to just
keep<00:02:21.299> with<00:02:21.510> my<00:02:21.659> usual<00:02:21.989> strategy<00:02:22.409> which<00:02:22.590> is<00:02:22.620> go

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
keep with my usual strategy which is go

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.300 
keep with my usual strategy which is go
333<00:02:24.379> just<00:02:25.379> to<00:02:25.470> mix<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.709> up<00:02:25.829> make<00:02:26.069> it<00:02:26.099> a<00:02:26.220> little

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
333 just to mix it up make it a little

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.699 
333 just to mix it up make it a little
bit<00:02:26.459> different<00:02:26.790> too<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.239> you<00:02:27.900> activate<00:02:28.470> each

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
bit different too and you activate each

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.880 
bit different too and you activate each
one<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.010> these<00:02:29.159> one<00:02:29.579> at<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.849> time<00:02:30.110> so<00:02:31.110> we're

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
one of these one at a time so we're

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.869 
one of these one at a time so we're
about<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.370> see<00:02:32.609> what's<00:02:32.819> going<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.180> happen<00:02:33.569> here

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
about to see what's going to happen here

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
movement but uh Tony's now not using the

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.920 
movement but uh Tony's now not using the
British<00:02:41.099> anymore<00:02:41.579> he's<00:02:41.849> using<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.299> Rising

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
British anymore he's using the Rising

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.000 
British anymore he's using the Rising
Sun<00:02:43.170> which<00:02:43.650> is<00:02:43.799> Japan<00:02:44.659> and<00:02:45.659> I've<00:02:46.409> never<00:02:46.680> faced

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
Sun which is Japan and I've never faced

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
looking up rules that he will not have

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.300 
looking up rules that he will not have
to<00:02:53.849> endure<00:02:53.940> which<00:02:54.389> you<00:02:54.540> won't<00:02:54.690> have<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.049> endure

okay so this is my deployment the end of
deployment<00:03:18.489> this<00:03:19.060> is<00:03:19.239> Tony's<00:03:19.599> deployment

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
deployment this is Tony's deployment

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.190 
deployment this is Tony's deployment
we've<00:03:21.160> kind<00:03:21.430> of<00:03:21.520> said<00:03:21.760> that<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.780> edge<00:03:22.959> of<00:03:23.110> the

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
we've kind of said that the edge of the

world does not extend all the way to the

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.460 
world does not extend all the way to the
end<00:03:24.700> of<00:03:24.790> this<00:03:24.880> board<00:03:25.300> so<00:03:25.750> that<00:03:25.780> we<00:03:25.959> can<00:03:26.140> enjoy

that area for our cards and whatnot so
let's<00:03:29.769> take<00:03:29.920> a<00:03:29.980> look<00:03:30.600> as<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:32.380> game<00:03:32.560> progresses

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
let's take a look as the game progresses

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.809 
let's take a look as the game progresses
do<00:03:33.940> we<00:03:34.060> roll<00:03:34.269> even<00:03:34.810> after<00:03:35.080> deployment<00:03:35.760> no<00:03:36.760> you

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
do we roll even after deployment no you

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.520 
do we roll even after deployment no you
will<00:03:37.209> get<00:03:37.330> first<00:03:37.540> enacted<00:03:37.780> it<00:03:38.050> okay<00:03:38.260> so<00:03:38.319> I'll

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
will get first enacted it okay so I'll

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.530 
will get first enacted it okay so I'll
get<00:03:38.650> first<00:03:38.920> activation<00:03:39.489> because<00:03:39.670> I<00:03:39.730> roll<00:03:40.000> one

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
get first activation because I roll one

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.870 
get first activation because I roll one
to<00:03:40.660> roll<00:03:40.840> off<00:03:41.050> again<00:03:42.010> there's<00:03:42.220> where<00:03:42.370> my<00:03:42.489> cards

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
to roll off again there's where my cards

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.300 
to roll off again there's where my cards
are<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:45.959> I'll<00:03:46.959> activate<00:03:47.590> one<00:03:47.860> at<00:03:47.980> a<00:03:48.069> time

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
are and I'll activate one at a time

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.550 
are and I'll activate one at a time
after<00:03:48.850> activating<00:03:49.209> one<00:03:49.630> Tony<00:03:50.200> gets<00:03:50.440> an

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
after activating one Tony gets an

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.259 
after activating one Tony gets an
activate<00:03:50.890> one<00:03:51.100> and<00:03:51.340> at<00:03:51.610> the<00:03:51.730> start<00:03:52.000> of<00:03:52.120> the

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
activate one and at the start of the

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.750 
activate one and at the start of the
second<00:03:52.720> term<00:03:52.840> we<00:03:53.049> roll<00:03:53.290> off<00:03:53.500> again<00:03:53.830> to<00:03:54.370> see<00:03:54.549> who

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
second term we roll off again to see who

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.710 
second term we roll off again to see who
activates<00:03:55.330> units<00:03:55.690> first<00:03:56.190> so<00:03:57.190> here<00:03:58.120> we<00:03:58.209> go<00:03:58.239> and

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
activates units first so here we go and

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.050 
activates units first so here we go and
uh<00:03:58.750> I<00:03:59.470> guess<00:04:00.130> we'll<00:04:00.340> get<00:04:00.459> tea<00:04:00.640> at<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:00.850> end<00:04:00.970> of

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
uh I guess we'll get tea at the end of

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.350 
uh I guess we'll get tea at the end of
every<00:04:01.299> turn<00:04:01.660> yeah

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.470
