through<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.090> app<00:03:30.329> the<00:03:30.690> sound<00:03:30.959> flows<00:03:31.290> through

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
through the app the sound flows through

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.990 
through the app the sound flows through
the<00:03:31.650> speaker<00:03:31.920> so<00:03:32.190> you<00:03:32.220> can<00:03:32.400> hear<00:03:32.549> what's

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
the speaker so you can hear what's

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.059

addition if you need it and then the

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.960 
addition if you need it and then the

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
camera setting has a few options there

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.330 
camera setting has a few options there
so<00:03:54.150> it<00:03:54.720> records<00:03:55.410> it<00:03:55.530> notifies<00:03:55.799> you<00:03:56.310> when

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
so it records it notifies you when

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.460 
so it records it notifies you when
there's<00:03:56.880> movement<00:03:57.180> in<00:03:57.569> the<00:03:57.630> house<00:03:57.900> or<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.260> air

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
there's movement in the house or the air

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.979 
there's movement in the house or the air
quality<00:03:58.980> changes<00:03:59.579> now<00:04:00.150> in<00:04:00.359> this<00:04:00.569> thing<00:04:00.810> that

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
quality changes now in this thing that

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.990 
quality changes now in this thing that
was<00:04:01.169> just<00:04:01.380> testing<00:04:01.859> the<00:04:02.010> echo<00:04:02.400> because<00:04:02.609> the

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
was just testing the echo because the

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.970 
was just testing the echo because the
devices<00:04:03.540> are<00:04:03.690> so<00:04:03.930> close<00:04:04.200> to<00:04:04.380> each<00:04:04.500> other<00:04:04.650> but

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
devices are so close to each other but

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.490 
devices are so close to each other but
if<00:04:05.099> you<00:04:05.190> notice<00:04:05.549> the<00:04:05.730> app<00:04:05.910> actually<00:04:06.500> exited

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
if you notice the app actually exited

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.949 
if you notice the app actually exited
out<00:04:07.709> on<00:04:08.010> its<00:04:08.250> own<00:04:08.519> it's<00:04:08.819> like<00:04:09.180> a<00:04:09.209> force<00:04:09.569> closed

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
out on its own it's like a force closed

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.780 
out on its own it's like a force closed
that<00:04:10.230> it<00:04:10.319> did<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:10.769> actually<00:04:11.340> happen<00:04:11.669> a<00:04:11.760> couple

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
that it did and actually happen a couple

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.490 
that it did and actually happen a couple
of<00:04:12.060> times<00:04:12.329> while<00:04:12.780> I<00:04:12.840> was<00:04:12.959> using<00:04:13.410> this

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
of times while I was using this

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.259 
of times while I was using this
application<00:04:13.709> what's<00:04:14.370> kind<00:04:14.579> of<00:04:14.669> random<00:04:15.060> but

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
application what's kind of random but

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.550 
application what's kind of random but
that's<00:04:15.419> something<00:04:15.750> that<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:15.959> app<00:04:16.079> can<00:04:16.349> update

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
that's something that the app can update

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.770 
that's something that the app can update
or<00:04:16.979> maybe<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.549> iPhone<00:04:17.849> plus<00:04:18.090> was<00:04:18.419> running<00:04:18.690> too

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
or maybe the iPhone plus was running too

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.180 
or maybe the iPhone plus was running too
many<00:04:18.959> apps<00:04:19.169> that<00:04:19.410> it<00:04:19.530> could<00:04:19.650> have<00:04:19.769> handled<00:04:20.099> it

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
many apps that it could have handled it
