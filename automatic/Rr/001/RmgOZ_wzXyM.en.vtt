and it starts to go into the history of
jiu-jitsu<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.710> little<00:01:01.710> bit<00:01:01.829> about<00:01:02.010> training

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
and also about the belt ranking system a

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.060 
and also about the belt ranking system a
little<00:01:06.180> bit<00:01:06.450> right<00:01:07.260> here<00:01:07.500> as<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.680> can<00:01:07.799> see<00:01:07.920> and

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
little bit right here as you can see and

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.250 
little bit right here as you can see and
then<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.189> goes<00:01:11.369> into<00:01:11.670> part<00:01:12.630> two<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
then it goes into part two the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.550 
then it goes into part two the
techniques<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.750> as<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:16.020> see<00:01:16.290> right<00:01:16.500> here

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
techniques and as you can see right here

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.700 
techniques and as you can see right here
it<00:01:17.159> starts<00:01:17.340> off<00:01:17.790> with<00:01:18.090> blue<00:01:18.750> belt<00:01:19.080> right<00:01:19.320> here

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
it starts off with blue belt right here

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.499 
it starts off with blue belt right here
now<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.460> find<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.030> kind<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.360> interesting

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
now I find this kind of interesting

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.330 
now I find this kind of interesting
because<00:01:22.049> when<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.560> go<00:01:22.680> further<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.189> further

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
because when you go further and further

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.880 
because when you go further and further
through<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.180> book<00:01:24.450> you'll<00:01:25.229> actually<00:01:25.409> be<00:01:25.650> able

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
through the book you'll actually be able

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.120 
through the book you'll actually be able
to<00:01:25.979> see<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.369> not<00:01:26.759> only<00:01:26.820> does<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.360> go<00:01:27.630> from

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
to see that not only does it go from

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.999 
to see that not only does it go from
blue<00:01:29.130> belt<00:01:29.460> right<00:01:29.640> here<00:01:29.720> it<00:01:30.720> goes<00:01:30.960> into<00:01:31.229> purple

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
blue belt right here it goes into purple

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.679 
blue belt right here it goes into purple
belt<00:01:32.780> then<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.869> goes<00:01:34.020> into<00:01:34.229> brown<00:01:34.710> belt<00:01:35.689> then

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
belt then it goes into brown belt then

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.990 
belt then it goes into brown belt then
it<00:01:36.900> goes<00:01:37.110> into<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.740> course<00:01:38.509> the<00:01:39.509> black<00:01:39.810> belt

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
it goes into of course the black belt

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.440 
it goes into of course the black belt
right<00:01:42.000> like<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.829> so<00:01:43.829> um<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.119> really

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
right like that so um this is really

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.340 
right like that so um this is really
nice<00:01:45.600> because<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:46.229> can<00:01:46.259> see<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.710> they<00:01:47.520> match

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
nice because I can see that they match

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.319 
nice because I can see that they match
some<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.530> more<00:01:49.710> basic<00:01:50.030> techniques<00:01:51.030> with

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
some of the more basic techniques with

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.870 
some of the more basic techniques with
the<00:01:51.360> blue<00:01:51.899> belt<00:01:52.200> level<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.399> lower<00:01:53.610> belt

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
the blue belt level and the lower belt

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.819 
the blue belt level and the lower belt
level<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.390> then<00:01:54.570> some<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.049> more<00:01:55.259> advanced

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
level and then some of the more advanced

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.560 
level and then some of the more advanced
techniques<00:01:56.189> with<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.579> higher<00:01:56.880> belt<00:01:57.210> level

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
techniques with the higher belt level

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.749 
techniques with the higher belt level
which<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.320> very<00:01:58.380> very<00:01:58.799> nice<00:01:59.070> I've<00:01:59.310> never<00:01:59.520> seen

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
which is very very nice I've never seen

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.280 
which is very very nice I've never seen
that<00:01:59.969> before<00:02:00.119> in<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.450> book<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.869> think<00:02:00.960> it's

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
that before in a book I think it's

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.920 
that before in a book I think it's
really<00:02:01.439> cool<00:02:02.180> alright<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.509> very<00:02:03.540> first

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
really cool alright so the very first

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.359 
really cool alright so the very first
technique<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.380> shown<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.920> book<00:02:05.130> is

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
technique that shown the book is

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.809 
technique that shown the book is
actually<00:02:05.579> how<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.149> tie<00:02:06.659> your<00:02:06.869> belt<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.819> really

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
actually how to tie your belt I really

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.490

out in street fights which is really
really<00:03:06.849> cool<00:03:07.239> because<00:03:07.480> you<00:03:07.780> don't<00:03:07.989> see<00:03:08.200> a<00:03:08.230> lot

get taught you so you don't know a

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.160 
get taught you so you don't know a
lot<00:03:12.879> of<00:03:13.000> techniques<00:03:13.359> that<00:03:13.569> can<00:03:13.660> be<00:03:13.720> used<00:03:13.870> in

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170
