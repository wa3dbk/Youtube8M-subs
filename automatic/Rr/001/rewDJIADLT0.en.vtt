00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.880
 can see in the ninth title of the video was the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.920
 best test of my life for several 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.310
 factors then pick up the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.010
 dote glue there sits on the couch or table 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.660
 I do not know anything, and check the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.989
 The best of my life I'm going to start. 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.860
 explaining here what happened in that 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.890
 That's it, right? 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.079
 how can you see israel and what is happening here? 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.360
 better known as automatic boy 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.770
 rodrigues to 1947 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.989
 ok I just want to show that I am 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.300
 smart now I know how to speak in progress 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.170
 joking now let's talk right there 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.680
 was the iof already a first factor that 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.780
 who left who is 16 was an echo more 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.670
 The beauty of my life was Fred 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.000
 I made it, I'm not going to talk here. 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.840
 wait for you all my video of course is 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.670
 but it was a lot of my God you already 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.560
 must have made was delivered larger than 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.619
 all clear you a good as hell but 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.500
 For me it was my record and as some 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.380
 I do not know if everyone knows 47 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.090
 My favorite weapon is she's simply 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.830
 because she kills it is not a weapon of 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.950
 freshness is a weapon that if it is well 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.520
 used it is better than any other 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.200
 in fact every gun well side is better 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.579
 than any other actually, right? 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.070
 but this is a subject for another video 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.650
 not for him but anyway that's where it was 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.750
 west dh-west from number 8 I picked it up 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.240
 map black widow how are you checking 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.890
 from it a 12 minute in the 9th 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.720
 each one by itself 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.659
 how can you see a job 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.850
 really this information and face and a 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.130
 another another topic that made 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.310
 this one and it was wonderfully 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.619
 Wonderful is that I played with you. 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.399
 so you have no idea how to 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.840
 It's good to play with you and it's cool. 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.439
 also because there is one more thing 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.509
 I thought it was going to be more challenging. 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.819
 easy just by making another name with 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.740
 you and I thought you were going to give 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.180
 a net force leaps 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.130
 if I catch you and I 'll never let you 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.190
 not you not if you are very 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.680
 carnivore playing with me is inclusive 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.030
 This one from 47 I think was the third 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.780
 time to the third try I got 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.550
 catch him 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.080
 The first one did not succeed, it was another guy. 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.300
 who took this pardon I will not remember the 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.370
 name now in the second also another 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.200
 person caught and if I can not but 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.590
 in the third I was very angry and 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.550
 that's why it catches up spectacularly 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.580
 time, right? 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.770
 but anyway its very nice to play with you 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.410

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.180
