 things that destroy relationship by

 example jealousy and destroys relationship 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.090
 which ends with jealousy the confidence in itself 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.090
 same and how is that being single 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.340

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.950

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:41.310

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:47.510

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.170
 the goal of victory, but now we 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.540
 will do things we do not like 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.100
 to do and will buy clothes with you 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.110

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.810
 It was but I 'm here what went or not 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.990

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.940
 be here but I'm not here with this 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:14.290
 what matters 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.209
 I want you to want to be here is a 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.350
 awesome thing 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.580
 this is because there is a lot of 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.380
 difference between men and women by 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.970
 example women like to dance 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.830
 men not men do not like 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.150
 dance to live a Monday 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.010

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.440
 parties a guy comes ready said so 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.400
 It was the party yesterday. Yes, I was, and then I got it. 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:37.360
 a lot of women could not stop thinking and 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:41.100
 I ended my foot it hurts and sung 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.100
 man passes a woman like that 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.470
 5 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:04:04.050
 that's what he expects her to answer 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:06.000
 old a fan that will not happen no 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.040
 I'll think you were very sick. 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.540
 in men the patients had a face 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.890

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.470

 with these things a guy drinking ice cream 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:31.160
 if you do not have a bin you can borrow 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.160
 attention sings because it will stay this way 

00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:46.159
