00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.300 
so we go so almost at the same point ah
let's<00:02:20.000> see<00:02:20.650> we<00:02:21.650> do<00:02:21.890> have<00:02:22.280> here<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.970> context

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
let's see we do have here the context

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.869 
let's see we do have here the context
versus<00:02:25.310> of<00:02:25.489> context<00:02:26.680> you<00:02:27.680> can<00:02:27.769> see<00:02:28.010> again<00:02:28.670> the

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
versus of context you can see again the

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.940 
versus of context you can see again the
sounds<00:02:29.120> of<00:02:29.180> galaxies<00:02:29.569> it's<00:02:29.750> both<00:02:29.900> quicker<00:02:30.170> so

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
sounds of galaxies it's both quicker so

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.420 
sounds of galaxies it's both quicker so
about<00:02:31.129> the<00:02:31.250> messaging<00:02:32.349> and<00:02:33.349> again<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:33.920> s6<00:02:34.250> was

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
about the messaging and again the s6 was

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.670 
about the messaging and again the s6 was
quicker<00:02:34.819> so<00:02:34.970> galaxy<00:02:35.420> 6<00:02:35.629> is<00:02:35.750> really<00:02:35.930> showing<00:02:36.410> up

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
quicker so galaxy 6 is really showing up

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.339 
quicker so galaxy 6 is really showing up
your<00:02:36.830> speed<00:02:37.160> and<00:02:37.340> all<00:02:37.459> that<00:02:37.959> let's<00:02:38.959> see<00:02:39.110> if<00:02:39.230> we

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
your speed and all that let's see if we

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.569 
your speed and all that let's see if we
can<00:02:39.560> mash<00:02:40.340> up<00:02:40.579> the<00:02:40.610> music<00:02:41.799> Wow<00:02:42.799> pretty<00:02:43.129> equal

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
can mash up the music Wow pretty equal

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.580 
can mash up the music Wow pretty equal
there<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:43.970> don't<00:02:44.150> have<00:02:44.420> any<00:02:44.569> music<00:02:44.720> here<00:02:45.140> on<00:02:45.349> my

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
there I don't have any music here on my

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.400 
there I don't have any music here on my
on<00:02:45.950> my<00:02:46.010> wall<00:02:46.610> EP<00:02:46.910> 8<00:02:47.090> but<00:02:47.810> definitely<00:02:48.200> you<00:02:48.260> can

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
on my wall EP 8 but definitely you can

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.339 
on my wall EP 8 but definitely you can
see<00:02:48.560> it<00:02:48.739> is<00:02:48.860> really<00:02:49.239> good<00:02:50.239> in<00:02:50.569> terms<00:02:50.989> of<00:02:51.200> the

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
see it is really good in terms of the

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:52.930 
see it is really good in terms of the
speed<00:02:51.590> overall<00:02:52.010> even<00:02:52.400> though<00:02:52.430> I<00:02:52.519> have<00:02:52.730> no

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
speed overall even though I have no

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.930 
speed overall even though I have no
music<00:02:53.299> here<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:53.690> I<00:02:54.440> had<00:02:54.980> no<00:02:55.010> music<00:02:55.459> here<00:02:55.670> so

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
music here and I had no music here so

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.750 
music here and I had no music here so
let's<00:02:56.810> open<00:02:56.959> up<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.739> gallery<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:59.660> let's<00:03:00.500> see

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
let's open up the gallery and let's see

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.670 
let's open up the gallery and let's see
let's<00:03:02.230> do<00:03:03.230> it<00:03:03.379> again

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
let's do it again

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.020 
let's do it again
1<00:03:04.129> 2<00:03:04.370> 3<00:03:04.400> go<00:03:06.010> wow<00:03:07.180> that<00:03:08.180> was<00:03:08.510> pretty<00:03:08.739> equal<00:03:10.030> that

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
1 2 3 go wow that was pretty equal that

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.599 
1 2 3 go wow that was pretty equal that
was<00:03:11.180> pretty<00:03:11.359> equal<00:03:11.840> let's<00:03:12.319> finally<00:03:13.099> let's<00:03:13.310> do

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
was pretty equal let's finally let's do

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.470 
was pretty equal let's finally let's do
the<00:03:14.739> studio<00:03:15.739> file<00:03:16.160> manager<00:03:16.760> versus<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.299> my

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
the studio file manager versus the my

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.120 
the studio file manager versus the my
file<00:03:17.780> here<00:03:18.109> 1<00:03:18.620> 2<00:03:18.799> 3<00:03:18.829> go<00:03:20.680> again<00:03:21.680> it<00:03:21.829> seems<00:03:22.040> like

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
file here 1 2 3 go again it seems like

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.729 
file here 1 2 3 go again it seems like
the<00:03:22.549> galaxy<00:03:23.269> 6<00:03:23.480> was<00:03:23.660> a<00:03:23.690> little<00:03:24.049> bit<00:03:24.169> quicker

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
the galaxy 6 was a little bit quicker

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.530 
the galaxy 6 was a little bit quicker
let's<00:03:25.579> open<00:03:25.760> up<00:03:26.150> D<00:03:26.980> see<00:03:27.980> if<00:03:28.130> I<00:03:28.250> do<00:03:28.310> have<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:28.970> n22

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
let's open up D see if I do have the n22

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.979 
let's open up D see if I do have the n22
app<00:03:29.750> 1<00:03:30.200> 2<00:03:30.380> 3<00:03:30.560> go

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.520 

wow<00:03:36.160> that<00:03:37.160> was<00:03:37.310> only<00:03:37.519> point<00:03:37.940> where<00:03:38.840> this<00:03:39.290> one

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
wow that was only point where this one

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.680 
wow that was only point where this one
was<00:03:39.739> quicker<00:03:40.069> most<00:03:40.310> of<00:03:40.400> Dynamo<00:03:40.639> DSPs<00:03:41.239> 6<00:03:41.450> volts

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
was quicker most of Dynamo DSPs 6 volts

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.920 
was quicker most of Dynamo DSPs 6 volts
a<00:03:41.780> quicker<00:03:41.989> phone<00:03:42.319> overall<00:03:43.299> let's<00:03:44.299> see<00:03:44.510> if<00:03:44.720> we

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
a quicker phone overall let's see if we

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.920 
a quicker phone overall let's see if we
can<00:03:45.139> open<00:03:45.380> up<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.739> camera<00:03:46.540> here<00:03:47.540> we<00:03:47.720> go<00:03:49.930> seems

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
can open up the camera here we go seems

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.379 
can open up the camera here we go seems
like<00:03:51.169> the<00:03:51.319> galaxy<00:03:51.769> s6<00:03:51.950> was<00:03:52.160> quicker<00:03:52.459> I'm<00:03:53.090> gonna

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
like the galaxy s6 was quicker I'm gonna

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:58.030 
like the galaxy s6 was quicker I'm gonna
do<00:03:53.540> that<00:03:53.810> again<00:03:54.530> if<00:03:55.519> you<00:03:55.700> guys<00:03:55.849> don't<00:03:56.209> mind<00:03:57.040> ok

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
let's do it again through the gate 1 2 3

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.580 
let's do it again through the gate 1 2 3
go

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
go

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.909 
go
yeah<00:04:03.590> the<00:04:04.010> galaxy<00:04:04.370> s6<00:04:04.549> is<00:04:04.790> quicker<00:04:05.440> so<00:04:06.440> yeah

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:06.919 
yeah the galaxy s6 is quicker so yeah
