the<00:01:24.220> chords<00:01:24.610> and<00:01:25.210> then<00:01:25.510> I'm<00:01:25.630> finding<00:01:26.020> a<00:01:26.080> spot

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
the chords and then I'm finding a spot

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.960 
the chords and then I'm finding a spot
to<00:01:26.350> bring<00:01:26.710> in<00:01:26.860> another<00:01:27.130> chord<00:01:27.550> and<00:01:27.730> I'm<00:01:27.820> just

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
to bring in another chord and I'm just

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.910 
to bring in another chord and I'm just
kind<00:01:28.090> of<00:01:28.210> scratching<00:01:28.630> over<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.110> chords<00:01:29.470> it

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
kind of scratching over the chords it

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.620 
kind of scratching over the chords it
just<00:01:30.160> feels<00:01:30.340> kind<00:01:30.730> of<00:01:30.790> good<00:01:30.850> with<00:01:31.180> this<00:01:31.330> groove

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
just feels kind of good with this groove

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.630 
just feels kind of good with this groove
that<00:01:31.840> I've<00:01:31.930> put<00:01:32.290> together<00:01:32.380> so<00:01:33.130> let's<00:01:33.220> try<00:01:33.580> it

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
that I've put together so let's try it

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.630 
that I've put together so let's try it
now<00:01:33.910> once<00:01:34.870> again<00:01:34.960> if<00:01:35.140> it's<00:01:35.260> too<00:01:35.410> fast<00:01:35.460> slow<00:01:36.460> it

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
now once again if it's too fast slow it

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.430 
now once again if it's too fast slow it
down<00:01:36.670> with<00:01:37.600> a<00:01:37.630> metronome<00:01:37.840> at<00:01:38.140> home<00:01:38.290> and

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
down with a metronome at home and

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.720 
down with a metronome at home and
practice<00:01:38.770> it<00:01:38.860> but<00:01:39.010> just<00:01:39.250> try<00:01:39.370> to<00:01:39.400> put<00:01:39.520> this

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
practice it but just try to put this

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.780 
practice it but just try to put this
this<00:01:40.330> kind<00:01:40.600> of<00:01:40.690> funky<00:01:41.200> fun<00:01:41.860> strong<00:01:42.490> to<00:01:42.670> it<00:01:42.730> and

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
this kind of funky fun strong to it and

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:43.980 
this kind of funky fun strong to it and
you'll<00:01:42.910> have<00:01:43.030> a<00:01:43.090> good<00:01:43.270> time<00:01:43.390> with<00:01:43.570> it<00:01:43.600> here<00:01:43.900> we

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
you'll have a good time with it here we

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:55.580 
you'll have a good time with it here we
go<00:01:44.220> here<00:01:45.220> we<00:01:45.250> go<00:01:45.370> one<00:01:45.700> two<00:01:45.930> three<00:01:46.930> four

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.960 

you

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.340 

you

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:10.690 

a<00:02:02.409> minor

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.360 

C<00:02:11.700> major<00:02:12.050> in<00:02:13.050> addition<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.740> court<00:02:14.070> right

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
C major in addition to the court right

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.580 
C major in addition to the court right
so<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.030> can<00:02:15.270> take<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.810> chord<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.380> I<00:02:16.440> like

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
so you can take this a chord and I like

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.810 
so you can take this a chord and I like
to<00:02:16.710> do<00:02:16.800> this<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:17.040> lot<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:18.620> add<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:20.310> 4th<00:02:20.610> degree

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
to do this a lot and add the 4th degree

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.260 
to do this a lot and add the 4th degree
of<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.240> scale<00:02:21.440> right<00:02:22.670> in<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:23.760> case<00:02:24.030> it's

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270
