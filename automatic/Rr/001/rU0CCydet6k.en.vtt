minutes<00:01:16.080> let's<00:01:16.799> jump<00:01:17.070> right<00:01:17.159> into<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.790> I

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
minutes let's jump right into this I

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.070 
minutes let's jump right into this I
think<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.360> could<00:01:18.479> probably<00:01:18.659> get<00:01:18.840> away<00:01:18.960> with

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
think I could probably get away with

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.469 
think I could probably get away with
using<00:01:19.229> highlights<00:01:20.070> since<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.700> fool<00:01:20.939> matches

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
using highlights since the fool matches

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.179 
using highlights since the fool matches
are<00:01:21.630> already<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.080> YouTube<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.680> other<00:01:22.770> people

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.020 

now<00:03:29.110> of<00:03:29.290> course<00:03:29.319> not<00:03:29.890> all<00:03:30.159> matches<00:03:30.879> are

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349
