00:00:00.118 --> 00:00:04.721
 ... 

00:00:04.721 --> 00:00:06.307
 We are at the Metropolitan Museum of Art 

00:00:06.307 --> 00:00:07.780
 and we look at Thomas Cole's picture 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.057
 View from Mount Holyoke in Northampton, Massachusets 

00:00:11.057 --> 00:00:13.609
 after the storm-- Oxbow picture 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:14.304
 Correctly. 

00:00:14.304 --> 00:00:15.718
 But we know him as "The Oxbow". 

00:00:15.718 --> 00:00:17.802
 It's a Hudson River painting school 

00:00:17.802 --> 00:00:18.887
 Thomas Cole, 

00:00:18.887 --> 00:00:22.598
 which is attributed to the foundation of American landscape painting. 

00:00:22.598 --> 00:00:25.421
 Landscape painting was very underestimated 

00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:27.136
 European academies. 

00:00:27.136 --> 00:00:31.388
 And painting was greatly underestimated in American society. 

00:00:31.388 --> 00:00:32.724
 It is true. 

00:00:32.724 --> 00:00:34.196
 And when the Americans wanted paintings 

00:00:34.196 --> 00:00:36.887
 they were not interested in spectacular mythological scenes. 

00:00:36.887 --> 00:00:40.179
 They wanted portraits, landscapes or panoramas 

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:41.349
 like this picture. 

00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:45.136
 And this is a panorama of a famous unusual natural scene 

00:00:45.136 --> 00:00:46.408
 The Place Where The River Connecticut 

00:00:46.408 --> 00:00:48.120
 it forms its own meander. 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.309
 This is a really big painting. 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.469
 I think it's five or six feet wide 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.143
 and five feet high. 

00:00:54.143 --> 00:00:58.883
 And this expresses the importance Thomas Cole wanted to insert 

00:00:58.883 --> 00:01:00.164
 to landscape painting 

00:01:00.164 --> 00:01:02.869
 landscape painting, which was a very underestimated industry, 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:05.596
 but it is not only a big dimension 

00:01:05.596 --> 00:01:09.210
 but Cole here, too 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.557
 is trying to communicate something more with this landscape. 

00:01:11.557 --> 00:01:12.776
 When you say Thomas Cole, 

00:01:12.776 --> 00:01:14.580
 come to mind "The Course of Empire" 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.922
 or "The Voyage of Life" 

00:01:15.922 --> 00:01:18.140
 Such moments are trying to use the landscape 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.304
 to say something great. 

00:01:19.304 --> 00:01:22.802
 But something big is also hidden here. 

00:01:22.802 --> 00:01:24.924
 This is really ambitious. 

00:01:24.924 --> 00:01:26.638
 It's not just about the landscape. 

00:01:26.638 --> 00:01:28.417
 It's about transformation. 

00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:29.661
 It's about time. 

00:01:29.661 --> 00:01:31.663
 About the type of metamorphosis. 

00:01:31.663 --> 00:01:32.804
 Yes, it's about America 

00:01:32.804 --> 00:01:35.635
 and what America will become. 

00:01:35.635 --> 00:01:37.307
 So on the left 

00:01:37.307 --> 00:01:40.108
 we see storm ravaged landscape. 

00:01:40.108 --> 00:01:41.560
 We see a broken tree. 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.879
 We see falling rain, 

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:45.804
 birds who seem to be restless 

00:01:45.804 --> 00:01:47.139
 as they fly across the sky. 

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:49.968
 We can also recognize the signs of lightning 

00:01:49.968 --> 00:01:51.516
 to the far left. 

00:01:51.516 --> 00:01:53.134
 So here we have what art historians do 

00:01:53.134 --> 00:01:54.561
 and contemporary critics 

00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:56.891
 they thought they were amazing 

00:01:56.891 --> 00:02:00.466
 a depiction of nature that is wild and untamed 

00:02:00.466 --> 00:02:02.184
 frightening yet amazing. 

00:02:02.184 --> 00:02:05.310
 This untouched nature and virgin forest 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.498
 they contrasted sharply 

00:02:07.498 --> 00:02:11.094
 with the built environment of old Europe. 

00:02:11.094 --> 00:02:13.597
 So this was a promise of something new. 

00:02:13.597 --> 00:02:15.889
 It was America as a new paradise. 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:18.380
 and that's what Cole presents to us 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.680
 on the other hand, 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.848
 where is the settlement of this virgin landscape, 

00:02:22.848 --> 00:02:26.637
 that transforms into a cultivated landscape 

00:02:26.637 --> 00:02:29.423
 the environment where they will feed their cattle 

00:02:29.423 --> 00:02:32.192
 where they settle down and build a home. 

00:02:32.192 --> 00:02:35.383
 So the storm falls and the sun comes. 

00:02:35.383 --> 00:02:38.392
 And it comes out here that this landscapes of the landscape 

00:02:38.392 --> 00:02:40.803
 is something that is controlled by God. 

00:02:40.803 --> 00:02:42.558
 Something approved by God. 

00:02:42.558 --> 00:02:44.717
 And that's really tied to the American concept 

00:02:44.717 --> 00:02:46.429
 the fate of the manifesto 

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:48.971
 that says Americans should tame this country 

00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:51.132
 that this is ours. 

00:02:51.132 --> 00:02:52.717
 In fact, with at least one art historian 

00:02:52.717 --> 00:02:54.811
 he looked at the mountain in the middle 

00:02:54.811 --> 00:02:56.004
 paintings 

00:02:56.004 --> 00:02:59.018
 and read in Hebrew letters. 

00:02:59.018 --> 00:03:00.524
 When we look at them from above 

00:03:00.524 --> 00:03:01.755
 and in the opposite direction 

00:03:01.755 --> 00:03:03.422
 from the perspective of God, 

00:03:03.422 --> 00:03:05.848
 it seems we read Hebrew 

00:03:05.848 --> 00:03:08.583
 the word "Shaddai", which means "omnipotent" 

00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:09.629
 referring to God. 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.720
 So this is the idea that it is God's purpose 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.304
 and God blessed America. 

00:03:14.304 --> 00:03:16.334
 Now from an artistic-historical perspective 

00:03:16.334 --> 00:03:19.058
 it is a transformation from noble to pastoral. 

00:03:19.058 --> 00:03:22.043
 Pastoral existence of a peaceful concept of landscape 

00:03:22.043 --> 00:03:25.304
 a man inhabiting a landscape with a sense of peace 

00:03:25.304 --> 00:03:26.334
 and peacefulness. 

00:03:26.334 --> 00:03:27.681
 We can observe this 

00:03:27.681 --> 00:03:30.617
 in all the unofficial vignettes that Cole presents to us. 

00:03:30.617 --> 00:03:32.351
 When you look at the lower right corner 

00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:33.642
 this painting, for example, 

00:03:33.642 --> 00:03:36.023
 you can see a carefully painted figure. 

00:03:36.023 --> 00:03:38.392
 You can see people who have been unloaded on one bank 

00:03:38.392 --> 00:03:41.027
 and people who are now crossing the other side. 

00:03:41.027 --> 00:03:44.265
 And a path that leads down to some field 

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:46.471
 and places where sheep graze. 

00:03:46.471 --> 00:03:48.869
 We can look in all directions, 

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:51.720
 from the chimneys of the few houses 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.225
 here and there 

00:03:53.225 --> 00:03:56.933
 the valley where the sun shines 

00:03:56.933 --> 00:03:58.678
 between two hills 

00:03:58.678 --> 00:04:01.213
 to light clouds with sunlight 

00:04:01.213 --> 00:04:02.703
 and with a sense of promise. 

00:04:02.703 --> 00:04:04.252
 Furthermore, there is amazing certainty, 

00:04:04.252 --> 00:04:06.308
 which has, in my opinion, amused 

00:04:06.308 --> 00:04:09.554
 and point to the specificity of nature. 

00:04:09.554 --> 00:04:10.720
 When you look to the left 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.027
 you can see that there is a growing mushroom 

00:04:13.027 --> 00:04:14.659
 from a split tree trunk. 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.997
 You can make out a bird on one of the branches, 

00:04:17.997 --> 00:04:21.092
 but probably the most fun is the middle part underneath 

00:04:21.092 --> 00:04:22.103
 canvases 

00:04:22.103 --> 00:04:24.272
 the artist himself who looks at us. 

00:04:24.272 --> 00:04:26.560
 Next to him, a little higher to the hill, 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.726
 we see his supplies 

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:29.309
 A fellow who hides him 

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:31.391
 bag and chair. 

00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:33.347
 But the chair is also a cross. 

00:04:33.347 --> 00:04:36.351
 So we understand not only the course of time, 

00:04:36.351 --> 00:04:39.120
 transition from wilderness to paradise 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.475
 which man forms 

00:04:40.475 --> 00:04:43.893
 but all this can also be understood in the context of Christianity. 

00:04:43.893 --> 00:04:45.635
 A bag carrying his name, 

00:04:45.635 --> 00:04:47.639
 is understood as a signature of a drawing 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.964
 but also as an artist's tombstone. 

00:04:50.964 --> 00:04:53.216
 So there is the time that flows. 

00:04:53.216 --> 00:04:54.721
 However, I would like to return to the word you used 

00:04:54.721 --> 00:04:55.470
 a little while ago 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.052
 and it was "fun" 

00:04:57.052 --> 00:05:00.373
 because we are here, in the first half of the 19th century, 

00:05:00.373 --> 00:05:02.550
 in the middle class audience. 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.266
 Newly formed merchant class 

00:05:04.266 --> 00:05:07.054
 from which Cole draws his patrons 

00:05:07.054 --> 00:05:10.170
 but there is also a real need to attract 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.519
 show these drawings and make them fun, 

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:13.923
 to look at them. 

00:05:13.923 --> 00:05:15.521
 It's not complicated-- 

00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:16.558
 It's not mythology. 

00:05:16.558 --> 00:05:17.642
 No. 

00:05:17.642 --> 00:05:19.250
 It's something ordinary Americans do with 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.295
 they can identify and fall in love. 

00:05:21.295 --> 00:05:25.424
 ...
