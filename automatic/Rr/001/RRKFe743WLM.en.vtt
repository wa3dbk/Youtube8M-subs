00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.900
I have to get a job, so please take a good photo

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.920
Then, here we go

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.980
Smile!

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.520
1, 2, 3!

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.740
Hello everyone, this is Yoon Charmi of Charming Diary!

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.860
Today's makeup is a request from you

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.600
It's great for graduation or resume photos

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.840
and it's not too bold but it's defined!

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.980
For those who are getting ready for graduation,
those who are on job hunts

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.100
and for those who will have many chances to take such photos

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.180
I hope this is helpful to you all!

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.380
Then let's get started!

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.000
I'll start with the base makeup today!

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.420
I'll first start off with a sunscreen

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.820
I put on sunscreen all around the year

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.040
but my skin is still this dark

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.800
And now, I'll brighten my face using a foundation

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.820
Start from the center and work on outwards,
this way you can get natural definition

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.980
and finish off by patting it in with a sponge

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.680
Next up, concealer!

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.740
Use it along your nose bridge for a higher-looking nose!

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.880
I'll apply a thin layer underneath the eyes to cover my dark circles

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.540
and I'll apply some on the cheeks to make it slimmer

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.080
I'll apply a bit on the cupid's bow and chin
for more definition!

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.280
I'll apply a bit of finish powder to reduce the oiliness

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.500
Now I'll get into the eye makeup!

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.360
Apply a brown eyeshadow slightly wider than the folds
and blend out the edges

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.840
Also get the same eyeshadow on the lower lashes
focusing on the center to make the eyes look bigger

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.780
I'll create aegyosal using a bright shimmery eyeshadow!

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.780
I'll get this on the center of my upper eyelids
so that I don't look swollen, and for a brighter look

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.860
Now I'll draw the base for eyeliner

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.780
Starting from the center, draw along your eye shape
and make sure the tail doesn't get too long

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.560
I'll use the remainder to touch the bottom outer corners

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.900
This brown eyeshadow is so efficient today!

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.600
Making sure that it doesn't darken the eyes,
I'll draw the shadows for aegyosal

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.820
Now onto eyeliner

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.480
Fill in the basework, and be meticulous

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.300
Tightly curl the lashes using an eyelash curler

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.800
Now, time to gain confidence with some mascara!

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.220
Apply it so that the lashes spike up!

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.080
Gently press in the roots as you apply,
this way the lashes point even higher!

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.220
Slightly go over the lower lashes, too

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.860
Now time for the brows

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.380
I used a brown pencil but it looks quite bright on camera

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.800
Use a shade that matches your hair color!

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.620
The key to today's makeup!

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.600
Contour for a defined look!

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.040
Make your nose look higher by creating shadows
from the start of the brows and down the nose

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.060
Use a light hand so that it doesn't get too dark

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.780
Contour the face to look more dimensional

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.920
I'll bring some color to my faceusing a blusher

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Apply on the high points of your cheeks when you smile
and go diagonal and upwards for a lifted face!

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.160
Now, highlighter!

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.320
I applied this on the nose bridge, forehead, below the eyes, cupid's bow, and chin

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.520
Applying the highlighter on the high will give more dimension

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.000
Now onto lipstick!

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.500
Choose a shade that you feel most confident in!

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.160
Today, I used my fingers to line the edges
so that it doesn't get too bold

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.720
Also, use a lip gloss for thicker and plumper lips!

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.040
I chose an affordable product as today's falsies

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.760
Charlie Chaplin?!

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.760
I'll be only applying falsies on the ends
to elongate the eyes

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.440
For that effect,
I'll apply falsies from the center to the outer ends

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.680
What do you think? Do they look more voluminous?

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.660
Is it that I've gotten older? My forehead seems sparse

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.580
Ma'am, don't worry!

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.500
You can fill in your sparse forehead!

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.200
Draw along your forehead using a pencil

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.480
Blend it out with your fingers to make it look natural,
and you're good to go!

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.360
If I get this position

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.760
I will use my bright smile

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.440
wide awake brain

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.900
and my vitality

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.520
to work my best!

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.860
I enjoyed doing today's makeup

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.180
What do you think? Do I look picture perfect?

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:51.060
Nowadays, studios create new faces through photoshop
so it turns out awkward and strange

00:05:51.940 --> 00:06:00.700
So I think it's better to correct your face with makeup
rather than relying on photoshop

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.380
Change with makeup, not photoshop!

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.860
Then that's all for today!

Bye!
