00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:42.189 
everywhere and those fireballs if they

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:46.170 
everywhere and those fireballs if they
hit<00:02:42.370> you<00:02:42.609> will<00:02:42.969> catch<00:02:43.299> you<00:02:43.450> on<00:02:43.599> fire<00:02:45.120> now<00:02:46.120> the

tell he can also hit you and the goal is
you<00:02:58.870> jump<00:02:59.200> up<00:02:59.409> and<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:02.260> broke<00:03:02.590> so

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
you jump up and it broke so

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.990 
you jump up and it broke so
jump<00:03:05.650> up<00:03:05.800> and<00:03:06.010> you<00:03:06.130> have<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.490> hit<00:03:06.580> it<00:03:06.640> it's

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
jump up and you have to hit it it's

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.140 
jump up and you have to hit it it's
pretty<00:03:07.780> hard<00:03:07.960> and<00:03:08.230> i'll<00:03:08.380> be<00:03:08.530> using<00:03:08.940> lime<00:03:09.940> out

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
pretty hard and i'll be using lime out

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.510 
pretty hard and i'll be using lime out
here<00:03:10.510> so<00:03:11.230> i<00:03:11.260> can<00:03:11.670> picking<00:03:12.670> it<00:03:12.790> up<00:03:12.910> again<00:03:14.520> so

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
here so i can picking it up again so

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.070 
here so i can picking it up again so
let's<00:03:15.730> see<00:03:16.170> if<00:03:17.170> I<00:03:17.380> didn't<00:03:17.680> hit<00:03:17.800> him<00:03:17.920> one<00:03:18.100> time

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
let's see if I didn't hit him one time

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.500 
let's see if I didn't hit him one time
so<00:03:20.080> this<00:03:21.070> is<00:03:21.220> what<00:03:21.610> happens<00:03:21.640> when<00:03:22.060> you<00:03:22.240> hit<00:03:22.390> him

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
so this is what happens when you hit him

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.309 
so this is what happens when you hit him
I'm<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.470> bit<00:03:23.740> high<00:03:23.890> I<00:03:24.300> would

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.759 

and<00:03:27.439> you<00:03:28.400> have<00:03:28.549> to<00:03:28.700> be<00:03:28.870> relatively<00:03:29.870> close<00:03:30.409> to

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
and you have to be relatively close to

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.520 
and you have to be relatively close to
it<00:03:30.920> for<00:03:31.340> it<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.879> hit<00:03:32.030> him<00:03:32.150> but<00:03:32.989> that's<00:03:33.049> what

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
it for it to hit him but that's what

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.199 
it for it to hit him but that's what
happens<00:03:33.859> when<00:03:34.069> you<00:03:34.219> need<00:03:34.400> it<00:03:34.579> when<00:03:35.120> that

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
happens when you need it when that

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.209 
happens when you need it when that
happens<00:03:35.739> one<00:03:36.739> of<00:03:36.859> these<00:03:36.980> guys<00:03:37.249> show<00:03:37.519> up<00:03:37.700> and

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:39.219 
happens one of these guys show up and

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.500 
happens one of these guys show up and
pretty<00:03:40.219> much<00:03:40.310> just<00:03:40.579> sittin<00:03:40.999> with<00:03:41.150> anything

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
pretty much just sittin with anything

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.729 
pretty much just sittin with anything
you<00:03:41.659> got<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:42.319> they'll<00:03:42.829> die<00:03:43.930> he<00:03:44.930> can<00:03:45.079> also<00:03:45.260> fly

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
you got and they'll die he can also fly

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.470 
you got and they'll die he can also fly
through<00:03:46.159> the<00:03:46.489> ice<00:03:47.680> oops<00:03:48.700> and<00:03:49.700> now<00:03:50.150> you<00:03:50.209> can<00:03:50.450> see

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
through the ice oops and now you can see

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.929 
through the ice oops and now you can see
what<00:03:50.719> happens<00:03:51.109> when<00:03:51.379> you<00:03:52.250> don't<00:03:52.579> shoot<00:03:52.790> the

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:52.939 
what happens when you don't shoot the

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:55.720 
what happens when you don't shoot the
ice<00:03:53.060> cream<00:03:53.469> but<00:03:54.469> though<00:03:54.709> he<00:03:54.739> will<00:03:55.250> fly<00:03:55.519> through

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
ice cream but though he will fly through

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.209 
ice cream but though he will fly through
the<00:03:55.760> ice<00:03:55.969> and<00:03:56.000> he<00:03:56.299> will<00:03:56.450> not<00:03:56.599> get<00:03:56.749> hurt<00:03:56.930> by<00:03:57.169> it

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:57.219 
the ice and he will not get hurt by it

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:01.750 
the ice and he will not get hurt by it
unless<00:03:58.219> some<00:03:58.659> you<00:03:59.659> throw<00:04:00.019> it<00:04:00.200> which<00:04:00.760> is

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
unless some you throw it which is

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.009 
unless some you throw it which is
illogical<00:04:02.889> but<00:04:03.909> makes<00:04:04.909> more<00:04:05.209> sense<00:04:05.510> makes<00:04:05.870> it

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
illogical but makes more sense makes it

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.330 
illogical but makes more sense makes it
harder<00:04:06.409> so<00:04:06.859> I'm<00:04:07.219> all<00:04:07.430> for<00:04:07.669> it<00:04:08.650> so<00:04:09.650> if<00:04:09.980> I<00:04:10.069> can<00:04:10.219> get

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
harder so I'm all for it so if I can get

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.890 
harder so I'm all for it so if I can get
him<00:04:10.489> hit<00:04:10.699> one<00:04:10.909> more<00:04:11.060> time<00:04:11.299> I<00:04:11.329> go<00:04:11.659> ahead<00:04:11.810> and

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
him hit one more time I go ahead and

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:21.879 
him hit one more time I go ahead and
skip<00:04:12.739> forward<00:04:13.099> to<00:04:14.439> when<00:04:15.439> he<00:04:15.829> dies<00:04:16.570> so<00:04:20.709> there<00:04:21.709> we

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
skip forward to when he dies so there we

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:27.730 
skip forward to when he dies so there we
go<00:04:21.919> again<00:04:24.310> actually<00:04:25.310> let's<00:04:25.490> see<00:04:25.729> if<00:04:26.150> I<00:04:27.110> can

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
go again actually let's see if I can

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.490 
go again actually let's see if I can
defeat<00:04:28.580> him<00:04:28.789> on<00:04:29.030> cam<00:04:29.389> film<00:04:29.930> see<00:04:30.259> if<00:04:30.349> there's

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
defeat him on cam film see if there's

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.730 
defeat him on cam film see if there's
enough<00:04:30.710> time<00:04:30.740> if<00:04:31.610> there<00:04:31.909> is<00:04:32.060> I<00:04:32.389> will<00:04:32.810> not<00:04:33.440> cut

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
enough time if there is I will not cut

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:41.130 
enough time if there is I will not cut
the<00:04:33.770> video

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.860 

so<00:04:42.140> he<00:04:42.650> doesn't<00:04:42.860> fly<00:04:43.130> around<00:04:43.310> a<00:04:44.030> bunch<00:04:44.630> and

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
so he doesn't fly around a bunch and

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.410 
so he doesn't fly around a bunch and
it's<00:04:45.050> very<00:04:45.620> hard<00:04:45.860> to<00:04:45.920> hit<00:04:46.010> him<00:04:46.340> again<00:04:46.490> he<00:04:47.120> flies

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
it's very hard to hit him again he flies

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:53.820 
it's very hard to hit him again he flies
a<00:04:48.400> little<00:04:49.400> bit<00:04:49.490> faster<00:04:49.730> than<00:04:50.210> this<00:04:50.360> so<00:04:51.910> yeah

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
a little bit faster than this so yeah

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.310 
a little bit faster than this so yeah
and<00:04:54.830> you<00:04:55.550> finally<00:04:56.060> gave<00:04:56.330> me<00:04:56.570> something<00:04:56.930> to<00:04:57.140> hit

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
and you finally gave me something to hit

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.130 
and you finally gave me something to hit
him<00:04:57.470> with<00:04:57.620> as<00:04:58.280> you<00:04:59.120> can<00:04:59.270> see<00:04:59.450> earlier<00:04:59.870> this

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
him with as you can see earlier this

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.200 
him with as you can see earlier this
thing<00:05:00.410> will<00:05:00.650> bounce<00:05:00.920> off<00:05:01.190> walls<00:05:01.520> but<00:05:01.970> if<00:05:02.120> it

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
thing will bounce off walls but if it

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.420 
thing will bounce off walls but if it
hits<00:05:02.390> you<00:05:02.570> it'll<00:05:02.780> automatically<00:05:03.380> break<00:05:03.740> if

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
hits you it'll automatically break if

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:32.999 
hits you it'll automatically break if
you<00:05:05.420> don't<00:05:05.600> throw<00:05:05.870> it<00:05:06.020> of<00:05:06.110> course

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:40.719 

and<00:05:34.009> here's<00:05:34.669> him<00:05:34.969> dying<00:05:38.499> so<00:05:39.499> that<00:05:39.949> was<00:05:40.459> a<00:05:40.489> goal

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
and here's him dying so that was a goal
