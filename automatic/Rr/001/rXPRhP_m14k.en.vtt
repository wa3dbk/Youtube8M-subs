00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.240
 young and so friends today we are going to 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:10.309
 Learn how to make this florerito ornament 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.040
 I could make a pot if you want 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.480
 sweetie the truth is that it is very versatile 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.000
 now so it depends on you what you 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.920
 you want to put in good what is it 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.550
 what are we going to need? 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.000
 recycle bottles we're even going to 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.160
 need bottles of soda and 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.900
 It could also be from some pine 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.390
 cleaner of what you have 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.980
 we're going to need a civilian me 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.980
 example these from when I burn 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.750
 when we want then there are times that the 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:45.360
 disk gets damaged and does not burn anything 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.789
 then I am precisely saved 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.399
 to do these crafts I'm going to 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.050
 occupy spray paint if you do not 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.930
 you have the spray could be from the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.359
 normal little boat or could do 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.510
 acrylic paint but I prefer these 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:02.210
 because they are metallic 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.250
 our scissors and our cutter and 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.439
 hot silicone 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.350
 well that's the first thing we're going to 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.790
 doing good first thing we're going to do 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.850
 What is it 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.780
 take your soda bottle of what 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.420
 be with the cutter you will give a cut 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.780
 deep well about two centimeters 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.540
 You are going to put the scissors and then you go 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.220
 to cut everything around so that 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.320
 you separate the bottom part of the from 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.120
 up and here I already have the part of 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.070
 above 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.010
 to give this rounded shape what 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.420
 only thing you need to do is that you're going to 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.670
 put this part on your iron until 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.979
 you if my iron and then putting like that and 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.020
 It gives you this nice rounded finish 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.210
 anyway I made a video 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.320
 to explain how to achieve a finish 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.360
 so tidy and to take this 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.700
 part of here that looks so tight what 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.509
 The only thing you do is put your cutter 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.190
 Do not be strong, do not try to be 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.560
 violent and that you can tear the 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.270
 Routine sheet simply let the 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.480
 political edge cut it and ready 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:17.200
 and what we're going to do is with your gun 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:21.370
 of silicon we are going to put a lot 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.560
 here and let's put my bottle on top 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.570
 in this case this is one of the 3 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.560
 liters so that it is precisely 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:32.440
 big and be comparable to this part 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.790
 down here already having the stuck what 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.570
 what we are going to do is that we are going to give 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.360
 a very good breeze to paint it 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.620
 perfectly on the outside and inside with 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.280
 spray paint 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.330
 painted with spray paint 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.260
 obviously inside we can not 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.180
 put for example candy without packaging or 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.400
 things like that nothing else could do things 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.750
 like sweets but from those who come very 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.170
 well wrapped or could be as he has 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.510
 said flower pot for artificial flowers 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.480
 etcetera because I tell you this because if 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.370
 you decide as soon as you paint it outside 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.739
 this would suit you very well and then if 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.290
 you could not occupy inside with 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.319
 sweets like gummies 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.269
 you could put him in even ice cream and 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.640
 you could make a little dish for the side 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:27.470
 very original because obviously this 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.030
 Plastic fuel if it is to put 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.280
 that a soft drink was inside 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.239
 obviously you can not do this if 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.180
 the package you occupy is pine him from 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.790
 any chlorine or cleaner is good 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.030
 then let me paste it and paint it and 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.490
 Hi, I'll see you so we can put more 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.160
 details if you want 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.470
 or leave it like that I think if we go 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.540
 to put some little stars or some other 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.590
 detail that makes it look even more 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.900
 colorful 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.700
 Well now I see you and you also know that 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.080
 it was happening to me that we could 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:04.090
 put inside quartz or gems of the 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.940
 saccharine are very nice also from 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.690
 adornment and apart harmonize same right now 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.910
 I'm going to paint it 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.910
 and now paint as I said friends 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:21.260
 that's how I can and in the bottom 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.180
 I painted it inside and out in the 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.669
 part of below I was hitting with my 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.610
 hot silicone watercolors like them 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.740
 I had said you just put a 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.600
 droplet obviously already after you with 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.090
 calm as you finish pasting everything 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.669
 you are removing these little threads that 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.280
 undesirable that the truth remains 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:41.810
 look like this is how the cup looks 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.940
 the truth is very nice as I told you 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.830
 Here you can put flowers 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.010
 You can put some artificial 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:52.610
 quartz you can put even more this 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.250
 watercolors of these and fill it and they look 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.760
 very nice the gems you can put 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.950
 sweet you can put what you want 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.200
 good here nothing more two comments you 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.600
 I will obviously do when putting it in the 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.030
 center that is the hole there low 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.000
 then if you are going to occupy it to put it 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.790
 little things because obviously it 's 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.080
 for not please maybe even what 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:20.060
 You could stick with your screw cap on and 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.490
 I would not accept anything, you would not be seen 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.250
 these little things right now what I am 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.850
 thinking about putting him probably 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:32.020
 it is you do think that we put here 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.020
 these that you are yes 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:41.230
 we could have been more there 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.230
 placing more to 40 here 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.860
 or I could also place you here too 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.340
 of jacko flours you could place 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.350
 artificial flowers of the little ones 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.170
 ribbon or organza that look very 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.510
 cute then the truth this is super 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:58.940
 multifaceted you can do it many 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.920
 Many ways are very beautiful 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.390
 I really do not like it very much and with 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.880
 finished that we gave him in the part of 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:07.490
 up close where you live it looks 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.020
 spectacularly good I love it and the 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.480
 I really think it's one of those crafts 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.250
 what can you do from memories? 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.160
 You can make a gift for some 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.530
 party centerpieces party and do not look 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.450
 well as the typical well recycles and looks 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.940
 current the truth is that it looks 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:25.430
 pretty nice you're saving a 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.530
 lots of good silver I hope this 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.050
