you<00:00:31.920> can<00:00:31.980> see<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.189> i<00:00:32.340> was<00:00:32.550> i<00:00:32.730> was<00:00:32.850> using<00:00:33.059> only

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
you can see that i was i was using only

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.580 
you can see that i was i was using only
two<00:00:33.360> hockey's<00:00:33.780> i'm<00:00:33.930> not<00:00:34.050> too<00:00:34.200> sure<00:00:34.230> if<00:00:34.410> i

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
two hockey's i'm not too sure if i

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.889 
two hockey's i'm not too sure if i
talked<00:00:34.800> about<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.160> talk<00:00:35.640> about<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.940> but<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.239> I

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
talked about it talk about it but I I

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.560 
talked about it talk about it but I I
was<00:00:37.230> hiking<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.680> entire<00:00:37.950> shop<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.430> was<00:00:39.270> talking

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
was hiking the entire shop I was talking

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.799 
was hiking the entire shop I was talking
7<00:00:39.899> shops<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.290> total<00:00:40.590> with<00:00:40.739> two<00:00:41.190> hot<00:00:41.340> keys<00:00:41.550> and

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
7 shops in total with two hot keys and

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.660 
7 shops in total with two hot keys and
just<00:00:42.809> watch<00:00:42.930> DC<00:00:43.320> tht<00:00:43.649> number<00:00:43.829> two<00:00:43.950> if<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.219> want

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
just watch DC tht number two if you want

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.940 
just watch DC tht number two if you want
to<00:00:44.730> know<00:00:44.820> how<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.969> do<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.710> so<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.739> mean

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
to know how to do that and so I mean

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.760 
to know how to do that and so I mean
again<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:48.030> math<00:00:48.960> when<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> casual<00:00:49.590> player

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
again this is math when a casual player

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.080 
again this is math when a casual player
definitely<00:00:50.129> not<00:00:50.250> for<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.430> casual<00:00:50.700> player<00:00:50.910> but

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
definitely not for the casual player but

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.110 
definitely not for the casual player but
for<00:00:51.270> player<00:00:52.070> you<00:00:53.070> know<00:00:53.160> wanting<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.610> improve<00:00:53.850> I

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
for player you know wanting to improve I

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.270 
for player you know wanting to improve I
keep<00:00:55.050> repeating<00:00:55.199> myself<00:00:55.530> but<00:00:55.800> I'm<00:00:56.070> going<00:00:56.219> to

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
keep repeating myself but I'm going to

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.250 
keep repeating myself but I'm going to
say<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.399> one<00:00:56.699> more<00:00:56.760> time<00:00:57.140> everything<00:00:58.140> in

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
say this one more time everything in

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.860 
say this one more time everything in
life<00:00:58.289> we<00:00:59.010> get<00:00:59.280> better<00:00:59.520> by<00:00:59.820> Gene<00:01:00.149> repetitive

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
life we get better by Gene repetitive

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.490 
life we get better by Gene repetitive
repetitively<00:01:01.800> like<00:01:02.100> if<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.969> if<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:04.320> shoot

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500

100<00:01:07.710> free<00:01:08.040> throws<00:01:08.310> you'll<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.299> good<00:01:09.540> at

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
100 free throws you'll be good at

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.039 
100 free throws you'll be good at
shooting<00:01:10.110> shooting<00:01:10.860> free<00:01:11.130> throws<00:01:11.330> but<00:01:12.330> but

to<00:01:29.850> like<00:01:30.150> practice<00:01:30.420> wrongly<00:01:31.020> which<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.619> have

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
to like practice wrongly which I have

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.460 
to like practice wrongly which I have
showcased<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:33.119> video's<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.780> sometimes

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
showcased in this video's that sometimes

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.920 
showcased in this video's that sometimes
I<00:01:34.619> would<00:01:34.799> move<00:01:34.950> QWOP<00:01:35.310> like<00:01:36.030> across<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.360> mini<00:01:36.689> map

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
I would move QWOP like across a mini map

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.810 
I would move QWOP like across a mini map
for<00:01:37.140> too<00:01:37.439> long<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.829> distance<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.310> she<00:01:38.400> was<00:01:38.640> just

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
for too long of distance so she was just

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.030 
for too long of distance so she was just
move<00:01:39.030> not<00:01:39.869> because<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.290> keep<00:01:40.470> clicking<00:01:40.829> on<00:01:40.920> her

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
move not because I keep clicking on her

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.950 
move not because I keep clicking on her
