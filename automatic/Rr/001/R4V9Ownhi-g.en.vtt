00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.560 

this<00:00:08.320> is<00:00:08.500> a<00:00:08.530> stage<00:00:08.920> of<00:00:09.220> the<00:00:09.940> rigid<00:00:10.300> Hetal

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:10.570 
this is a stage of the rigid Hetal

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.750 
this is a stage of the rigid Hetal
weaving<00:00:10.960> that<00:00:11.260> I<00:00:11.559> think<00:00:11.920> I<00:00:12.040> need<00:00:12.190> to<00:00:12.250> explain

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:12.760 
weaving that I think I need to explain

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.840 
weaving that I think I need to explain
because<00:00:13.090> it<00:00:13.660> seems<00:00:14.670> sort<00:00:15.670> of

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:15.850 
because it seems sort of

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.080 
because it seems sort of
counterintuitive<00:00:16.240> and<00:00:17.110> busy<00:00:17.650> and<00:00:17.949> you<00:00:18.910> need

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
counterintuitive and busy and you need

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.920 
counterintuitive and busy and you need
to<00:00:19.180> understand<00:00:19.630> now<00:00:20.039> when<00:00:21.039> you<00:00:21.160> first<00:00:21.930> put

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 
to understand now when you first put

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.250 
to understand now when you first put
your<00:00:23.170> yarns<00:00:23.620> on<00:00:23.830> your<00:00:24.430> loom<00:00:24.670> okay<00:00:25.180> all<00:00:25.510> of<00:00:26.110> the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260 
your yarns on your loom okay all of the

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.580 
your yarns on your loom okay all of the
yarn<00:00:26.500> remember<00:00:27.280> is<00:00:27.490> in<00:00:27.820> the<00:00:27.970> back<00:00:28.210> and<00:00:28.600> you're

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
yarn remember is in the back and you're

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.240 
yarn remember is in the back and you're
taking<00:00:29.980> the<00:00:30.100> looped<00:00:30.340> ends<00:00:30.940> through<00:00:31.750> the<00:00:32.250> slots

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
taking the looped ends through the slots

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.319 
taking the looped ends through the slots
remember<00:00:34.239> we're<00:00:34.420> doing<00:00:34.660> that<00:00:35.160> after<00:00:36.160> that<00:00:36.370> you

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
remember we're doing that after that you

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.050 
remember we're doing that after that you
cut<00:00:37.629> those<00:00:37.840> ends<00:00:38.140> and<00:00:38.469> you<00:00:39.190> put<00:00:39.430> one<00:00:39.700> of<00:00:39.880> them

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.060 
cut those ends and you put one of them

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.900 
cut those ends and you put one of them
through<00:00:40.780> the<00:00:40.930> hole<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:42.190> you're<00:00:42.370> doing<00:00:42.640> slot

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
through the hole so you're doing slot

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.510 
through the hole so you're doing slot
hole<00:00:43.180> slot<00:00:43.540> hole<00:00:43.780> slot<00:00:44.110> falafels<00:00:44.860> and<00:00:45.070> the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
hole slot hole slot falafels and the

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.490 
hole slot hole slot falafels and the
purpose<00:00:45.910> of<00:00:46.060> that<00:00:46.120> remember<00:00:46.870> this<00:00:46.989> is<00:00:47.170> a<00:00:47.200> rigid

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
purpose of that remember this is a rigid

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.889 
purpose of that remember this is a rigid
petal<00:00:48.070> loom<00:00:48.399> so<00:00:48.790> you<00:00:48.880> don't<00:00:49.090> have<00:00:49.239> harnesses

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 
petal loom so you don't have harnesses

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:52.380 
petal loom so you don't have harnesses
going<00:00:50.230> up<00:00:50.410> and<00:00:50.620> down<00:00:50.739> like<00:00:51.040> you<00:00:51.220> do<00:00:51.430> when<00:00:52.180> you

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
going up and down like you do when you

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.110 
going up and down like you do when you
are<00:00:52.720> using<00:00:53.230> a<00:00:53.530> big<00:00:53.739> floor<00:00:54.160> loom<00:00:54.430> and<00:00:54.610> you'll

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
are using a big floor loom and you'll

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.569 
are using a big floor loom and you'll
see<00:00:55.420> later<00:00:55.630> when<00:00:55.989> I'm<00:00:56.110> leaving<00:00:56.410> how<00:00:57.130> it<00:00:57.309> works

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
see later when I'm leaving how it works

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.030 
see later when I'm leaving how it works
when<00:00:57.850> you<00:00:57.880> have<00:00:58.000> a<00:00:58.180> yarn<00:00:58.570> and<00:00:58.870> a<00:00:58.930> slot<00:00:59.230> and<00:00:59.530> a

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
when you have a yarn and a slot and a

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.520 
when you have a yarn and a slot and a
yarn<00:01:00.280> and<00:01:00.460> a<00:01:00.520> hole<00:01:00.730> okay<00:01:01.450> so<00:01:02.170> when<00:01:02.410> you're

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
yarn and a hole okay so when you're

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.109 
yarn and a hole okay so when you're
finished<00:01:02.890> pulling<00:01:03.640> them<00:01:03.790> through<00:01:03.820> their

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
finished pulling them through their

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.149 
finished pulling them through their
little<00:01:04.269> places<00:01:04.750> you've<00:01:04.899> got<00:01:05.079> loose<00:01:05.619> ends<00:01:05.950> here

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
little places you've got loose ends here

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.600 
little places you've got loose ends here
and<00:01:06.399> all<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.540> yarns<00:01:07.810> hanging<00:01:08.110> down<00:01:08.259> here<00:01:08.560> okay

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
and all the yarns hanging down here okay

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.440 
and all the yarns hanging down here okay
the<00:01:10.210> next<00:01:10.569> step<00:01:10.899> is<00:01:11.200> that<00:01:11.259> you<00:01:11.740> pull<00:01:12.280> all<00:01:12.639> the

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
the next step is that you pull all the

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.620 
the next step is that you pull all the
yarns<00:01:13.810> through<00:01:14.170> to<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.069> front<00:01:15.389> think<00:01:16.389> of<00:01:16.539> it

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
yarns through to the front think of it

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.699 
yarns through to the front think of it
is<00:01:16.780> using<00:01:17.170> your<00:01:17.319> Hetal<00:01:17.770> as<00:01:17.950> a<00:01:18.490> big<00:01:18.869> Calma<00:01:19.869> okay

00:01:20.699 --> 00:01:20.709 
is using your Hetal as a big Calma okay

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:22.340 
is using your Hetal as a big Calma okay
you're<00:01:21.009> going<00:01:21.100> to<00:01:21.189> pull<00:01:21.549> the<00:01:21.789> yarn<00:01:21.819> through

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
you're going to pull the yarn through

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.539 
you're going to pull the yarn through
get<00:01:23.350> them<00:01:23.499> all<00:01:24.539> untangled<00:01:25.539> ready<00:01:25.959> to<00:01:26.139> go

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
get them all untangled ready to go

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.489 
get them all untangled ready to go
they're<00:01:27.549> all<00:01:27.579> in<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:27.999> front<00:01:28.420> now<00:01:28.869> so<00:01:29.380> it's

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:29.499 
they're all in the front now so it's

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:32.010 
they're all in the front now so it's
like<00:01:29.529> a<00:01:29.619> combing<00:01:30.279> stage<00:01:30.899> when<00:01:31.899> you're

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
like a combing stage when you're

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.830 
like a combing stage when you're
actually<00:01:32.229> going<00:01:32.679> to<00:01:32.950> be<00:01:33.100> weaving<00:01:33.549> you<00:01:34.539> will<00:01:34.689> be

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
actually going to be weaving you will be

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.300 
actually going to be weaving you will be
moving<00:01:35.219> your<00:01:36.219> yarn<00:01:36.609> your<00:01:37.179> warp<00:01:37.630> from<00:01:38.469> the<00:01:38.979> back

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
moving your yarn your warp from the back

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.129 
moving your yarn your warp from the back
beam<00:01:41.069> through<00:01:42.069> your<00:01:42.729> Hetal<00:01:43.119> you're<00:01:43.779> going<00:01:44.020> to

00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:44.139
