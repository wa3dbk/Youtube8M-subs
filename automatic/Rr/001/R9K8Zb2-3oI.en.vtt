do<00:02:43.060> this<00:02:43.540> pocket<00:02:43.930> you<00:02:45.510> will<00:02:46.510> want<00:02:46.900> to<00:02:47.140> glue

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
do this pocket you will want to glue

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.720 
do this pocket you will want to glue
down<00:02:47.800> of<00:02:48.250> course

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
down of course

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.360 
down of course
these<00:02:49.239> pieces<00:02:49.959> that<00:02:50.350> just<00:02:50.590> kind<00:02:50.890> of<00:02:51.010> stick<00:02:51.250> up

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
these pieces that just kind of stick up

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.310 
these pieces that just kind of stick up
I<00:02:51.489> think<00:02:51.550> this<00:02:51.850> is<00:02:52.090> already<00:02:52.480> glued<00:02:52.690> down<00:02:52.930> here

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
I think this is already glued down here

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.490 
I think this is already glued down here
but<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:54.190> way<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.610> does<00:02:54.910> create<00:02:55.570> the<00:02:55.930> pocket

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
but that way it does create the pocket

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.380 
but that way it does create the pocket
and<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.930> bag<00:02:59.500> doesn't<00:02:59.890> get<00:03:00.220> in<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.400> way<00:03:00.580> so

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
and the bag doesn't get in the way so

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.800 
and the bag doesn't get in the way so
that's<00:03:02.260> what<00:03:02.530> you'll<00:03:02.739> have<00:03:02.769> to<00:03:03.010> do<00:03:03.310> is<00:03:03.489> simply

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
that's what you'll have to do is simply

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.930 
that's what you'll have to do is simply
adhere<00:03:04.810> that<00:03:04.840> down<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:06.220> keep<00:03:06.430> it<00:03:06.580> out<00:03:06.700> of<00:03:06.850> the

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
adhere that down to keep it out of the

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.380 
adhere that down to keep it out of the
way<00:03:07.320> okay<00:03:08.320> so<00:03:08.380> once<00:03:08.739> you've<00:03:08.890> done<00:03:09.070> that<00:03:09.390> fold

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
way okay so once you've done that fold

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.680 
way okay so once you've done that fold
it<00:03:10.600> over<00:03:11.880> take<00:03:12.880> another<00:03:13.180> bag<00:03:14.940> same<00:03:15.940> way<00:03:16.239> put

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
it over take another bag same way put

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.259 
it over take another bag same way put

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
your sticky strip on the three sides

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.390 
your sticky strip on the three sides
that<00:03:19.690> you<00:03:19.810> want<00:03:20.170> your<00:03:20.410> pocket<00:03:20.739> up<00:03:20.860> here<00:03:20.890> if<00:03:21.250> you

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
don't want to talk it then completely

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.890 
don't want to talk it then completely

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.699 
place it same way on that inertia pocket
and<00:03:36.870> then<00:03:37.870> this<00:03:38.200> one<00:03:40.019> you're<00:03:41.019> going<00:03:41.290> to<00:03:41.440> take

simply attaches this way so anyway this

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.759 
simply attaches this way so anyway this
is<00:03:58.180> what<00:03:58.690> it<00:03:58.810> kind<00:03:58.989> of<00:03:59.110> looks<00:03:59.170> like<00:03:59.440> and<00:03:59.680> you

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
is what it kind of looks like and you

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.800 
is what it kind of looks like and you
can<00:03:59.890> use<00:04:00.070> I<00:04:00.220> used<00:04:00.459> five<00:04:00.790> bags<00:04:01.120> that<00:04:01.450> you<00:04:01.510> can

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
can use I used five bags that you can

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.960 
can use I used five bags that you can
use<00:04:02.019> more<00:04:02.519> and<00:04:03.519> what<00:04:03.820> that<00:04:04.030> does<00:04:04.299> is<00:04:04.840> this<00:04:05.320> here

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
use more and what that does is this here

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.930 
use more and what that does is this here
it<00:04:06.970> just<00:04:07.510> eliminates<00:04:07.870> that<00:04:08.590> where<00:04:09.549> you've<00:04:09.700> got

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
it just eliminates that where you've got

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.840 
it just eliminates that where you've got
two<00:04:10.209> of<00:04:10.390> these<00:04:10.890> you<00:04:11.890> know<00:04:12.010> stuck<00:04:12.400> together<00:04:12.579> in

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
two of these you know stuck together in

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.690 
two of these you know stuck together in
the<00:04:13.120> center<00:04:13.590> sticking<00:04:14.590> out<00:04:14.799> it<00:04:15.040> kind<00:04:15.280> of<00:04:15.370> makes

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
the center sticking out it kind of makes

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.750 
the center sticking out it kind of makes
your<00:04:15.880> page<00:04:16.120> lay<00:04:16.419> flat<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:17.200> other<00:04:17.919> than<00:04:18.039> the

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
your page lay flat and other than the

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.270 
your page lay flat and other than the
first<00:04:19.239> two<00:04:19.750> here

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
first two here

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.890 
first two here
the<00:04:21.639> rest<00:04:21.850> of<00:04:22.030> them<00:04:22.210> will<00:04:22.330> be<00:04:22.510> alternating

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
the rest of them will be alternating

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.470 
the rest of them will be alternating
you'll<00:04:23.350> have<00:04:23.530> one<00:04:23.800> going<00:04:24.100> to<00:04:24.280> you<00:04:25.210> know<00:04:25.330> the

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
you'll have one going to you know the

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.860 
you'll have one going to you know the
lab<00:04:25.660> to<00:04:25.960> when<00:04:26.139> going<00:04:26.380> to<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:26.889> right<00:04:27.190> and<00:04:27.940> you

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
lab to when going to the right and you

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.870 
lab to when going to the right and you
know<00:04:28.990> back<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.740> lab<00:04:29.980> back<00:04:30.400> to<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.669> right

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
know back to the lab back to the right

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.240 
know back to the lab back to the right
so<00:04:31.180> they're<00:04:31.330> kind<00:04:32.139> of<00:04:32.200> alternating<00:04:32.889> they're

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
so they're kind of alternating they're

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.740 
so they're kind of alternating they're
not<00:04:33.460> always<00:04:33.730> on<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:34.240> same<00:04:36.240> going<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:37.480> same

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
not always on the same going the same

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.560 
not always on the same going the same
way<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:39.400> like<00:04:39.550> I<00:04:39.669> said<00:04:39.730> you<00:04:39.970> don't<00:04:40.120> have<00:04:40.240> no

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
way and like I said you don't have no

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.379 
way and like I said you don't have no
flap<00:04:40.870> sticking<00:04:41.350> up<00:04:41.500> in<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.710> middle<00:04:42.100> then<00:04:43.090> what
