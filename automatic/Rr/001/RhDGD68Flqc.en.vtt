00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.990
 I want to show you again our seedling 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.849
 which I have already shown or rather also 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.340
 Of course the bearing from my name 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:17.539
 he got the name and you are the heart of the mother 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.320
 here grow new flowers 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.109
 show for you to rate 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.539
 the size 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:29.609
 Well, firstly here is the oldest flower 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:34.710
 that's so loud everything keeps up 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:38.160
 he lost a bit of saturation 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.020
 became not drilling me to come here and a little 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.170
 so darker or less 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:49.890
 Contrast let's say here and new flowers 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:54.480
 here these now blossom down here 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.140
 such saturated large and still he 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.059
 a bunch of buds that is, he will still bring 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:04.619
 for comparison, I tore off already old 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.380
 flower on grade through and cream such 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:11.659
 common enough here so you 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.659
 estimated size and 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.830
 color that is, the flower will see already summed up 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.150
 even you old yourself you no longer grow 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.220
 there will be an old flower 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.980
 here it is compared to new colors 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.800
 who have not yet fully dissolved 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.030
 the building will grow here but in comparison 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.800
 oldest flower 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.530
 which reached its maximum 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.240
 of size that's the only thing of course if you 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.390
 see it a little while collected 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.700
 so if you expand it to size 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.200
 there will be more but nevertheless all 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.479
 anyway you need that’s the difference dacha risen 3 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.500
 so you understand what it’s about 10 you 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:54.479
 show through n cream yes here and 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:57.290
 match the usual well here somehow so here 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:03.540
 that is, a little bit more 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:06.420
 matches good luck gum here respectively 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:11.899
 if the size of the match is mentally what 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.899
 now I measure as 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.970
 Well , somewhere 43 43 centimeters then 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.040
 accordingly, the size of the flowers is also you 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:24.590
 can now evaluate these here 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.940
 I still have large flowers 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.060
 come down still grow up 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:33.260
 they are somewhere about but closer to 8 cm 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:41.000
 somewhere 70 half 7 and 8 so well and 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:45.980
 coin up to 5 rubles in a regular coin 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.170
 compared with flowers see deathly hallows 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.400
 compared with Stas and old 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:55.950
 a little flower like that and a bit 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.880
 assembled so he also 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.440
 so here's the size of the seedlings 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.920
 rather, the beans you always forget that 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:10.600
 already this sort of outlet is a compact outlet 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.500
 middle-sized is about to be compared with water here 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.430
 dimensional 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:21.160
 In principle, well, yes, you can do a little more of mine. 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:24.720
 palms on new colors are holding on 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:29.140
 not bad here white contrast 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:33.220
 well addressed here and new flower they 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.709
 bloom in size somewhere 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.770
 old flower through and cream completely 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:43.260
 dissolved and then growing needs of 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.260
 Well let's say so sizes 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.180
 here is such 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.180
 handsome do not like 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:01.460
 implementation will be somewhere probably not for 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:04.180
 I think within a month will go now 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:08.090
 the kids are growing up just hatch 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:10.340
 kids will grow up and actually 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.560
 implementations to watch I don't think that he 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.710
 will be sport because sport is here 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.410
 absolutely nothing flower solid 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:22.970
 border where can spoil just do not know 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:25.220
 the more his parents were both dark 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.640
 color that is, without any white there 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:32.260
 colors and other light so I think 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.260
 will be repeated without problems
