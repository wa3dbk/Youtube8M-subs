00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.630
 Hello dear viewers today 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:27.090
 there was a reason to make a small video 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:31.640
 hands holding parcel regular site 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.230
 ebay package is pretty handy 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.350
 such a bag is big impressive 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.199
 so I hope that there is something 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.739
 interesting so ok let's try it right away 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:46.970
 open immediately say that the parcel 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.700
 getting around 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:54.590
 in my 25 days short in principle I her 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:01:01.590
 I waited for such a standard, in principle, and 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:03.480
 it cost me somewhere in my way 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.070
 now would remember me in my about 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:14.670
 800 rubles in the package we have such 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:18.179
 interesting device es pi pi g5 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.220
 labeling and write this micro guitar amp 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:27.390
 Well, that is the idea of ​​an amplifier 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:28.979
 guitar so here so the form looks 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.950
 its front of this box 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:36.140
 the box is pretty straightforward 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:40.080
 still plain simple such white 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:43.170
 cardboard thin well let's hide right away 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.209
 immediately open let's see what we have 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.200
 inside 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:49.259
 natural from this thing is nothing 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.220
 do not really understand guitar 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.140
 800 rubles amplifiers are not worth it until I 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.130
 least good 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:01.849
 naturally and this amplifier with us and 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:06.030
 of by my hong kong bought it from 

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:07.800
 seller from hong kong therefore over 800 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.039
 rubles I don’t give anything from him 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.430
 I demand just like that even more 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.620
 business interest than any such sense from 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.660
 him 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.099
 repose on a bag of soup, let 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.340
 get in the bag lies also 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.819
 silica gel 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.380
 moisture well well at least it is 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.709
 so this is how it looks 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.709
 gizmo 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.580
 three krutilki and so I understand it is the entrance under 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.970
 jack from the guitar 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:45.550
 This is also a headphone output 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.350
 how much does it cost 9 volts for external 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.410
 power supply ie you can connect to the network 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.950
 Naturally power supply included 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:57.010
 No, but I naturally have in stock 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.910
 as always the power supply who here 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:04.390
 I will not do anything good 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:08.230
 so it means that we have the first twist 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:11.050
 this is our sound pretty tight by the way 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:16.600
 long rather hard and pretty twist 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:20.950
 but this garbage here we have tons shorter and these 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.269
 Krutilki with us and I understand this 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.819
 position we just have this thing 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:29.290
 off it is on 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.180
 This is an overload and also a display light. 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.579
 go 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.579
 supply which shows us that this 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:39.340
 the machine is turned on made of plastic 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:42.760
 plastic shit ladies can't argue 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.489
 nothing so special so mean 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.220
 plastic is a 5 -watt device 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:51.299
 capacity also had three cheaper but I 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.280
 I decided all the same to take on 5 I do not know why 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:58.600
 so in the back we have a battery compartment 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:04.090
 Included even have a battery since 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:06.340
 take you out we'll take out stalin 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.970
 upside down so that there is no contact 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:13.200
 in vain here such here krone usual on 9 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:17.140
 Volt as I understand it works interesting 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.320
 so I need to at least understand this plus where 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.320
 minus 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:26.500
 now take a second look not through the camera 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.570
 you can't see anything here 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.380
 we get it should be inserted 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.380
 like this 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:41.589
 so well, nothing works not come 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:42.800
 signs of life do not know whether the problem is 

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:46.400
 this 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.339
 oh I hurt my whole camera 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.229
 shorter than that if the problem is in the battery 

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:55.400
 sat down though i'm not really 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:57.949
 including whether this amplifier is simply not 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.839
 work I don't know let's see I think we 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:02.499
 check it out in the next video today 

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:05.360
 we'll just have a look at this thing a 

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:06.469
 there we will see you have his keys from 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.469
 external power supply 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:11.080
 I hope that everything will be gorgeous because 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:15.139
 I don't trust Chinese batteries 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.529
 so here we have by the way fasteners to 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.499
 hang 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:20.259
 train ride on train for belt and 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:24.499
 go by train 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:28.159
 sing plaintive songs to pay money 

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:31.009
 small things like that 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:32.960
 took a little thing purely to strum at home though 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:37.159
 you can take somewhere to the country 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.999
 on this remarkable mobile need 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:41.959
 only battery 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:43.310
 well or external power with this 

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:46.279
 also no problem he is a cat too 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:49.310
 woke up came here to me and also 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:51.199
 interesting to look at this miracle so 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.360
 like this but basically all external 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.520
 told I think we will try already in 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.439
 action this thing next video to everyone 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.449
