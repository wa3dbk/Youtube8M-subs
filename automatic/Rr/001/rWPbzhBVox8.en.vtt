hey guys this is my next tutorial it's
like<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.370> segmented<00:00:02.970> finger<00:00:03.330> type<00:00:03.540> thing<00:00:03.780> and<00:00:04.049> I

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
like a segmented finger type thing and I

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.980 
like a segmented finger type thing and I
took<00:00:04.319> some<00:00:04.890> bananas<00:00:05.400> and<00:00:05.430> scar<00:00:05.759> wax<00:00:05.790> and<00:00:06.330> I

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
took some bananas and scar wax and I

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.839 
took some bananas and scar wax and I
applied<00:00:07.319> this<00:00:07.589> on<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.099> side<00:00:08.309> of<00:00:08.340> my<00:00:08.490> finger

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
applied this on the side of my finger

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.940 
applied this on the side of my finger
and<00:00:08.880> I<00:00:09.179> blended<00:00:09.660> out<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.929> edges<00:00:10.200> into<00:00:10.500> my<00:00:10.590> skin

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
and I blended out the edges into my skin

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.009 
and I blended out the edges into my skin
to<00:00:11.370> make<00:00:11.519> sure<00:00:11.670> that<00:00:11.849> you<00:00:12.210> cannot<00:00:12.570> tell<00:00:12.840> it's

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
to make sure that you cannot tell it's

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.150 
to make sure that you cannot tell it's
there<00:00:13.200> except<00:00:13.530> for<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.830> discoloration

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
there except for the discoloration

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.890 
there except for the discoloration
obviously<00:00:15.059> but<00:00:15.210> we<00:00:15.299> want<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.509> fix<00:00:15.630> that<00:00:15.839> later

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
obviously but we want to fix that later

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.490 
obviously but we want to fix that later
on

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
on

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.230 
on
then<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.010> took<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.220> needle<00:00:17.430> tool<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:17.760> kind<00:00:18.060> of

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
then I took a needle tool and kind of

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.740 
then I took a needle tool and kind of
cut<00:00:18.600> off<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:19.050> edge<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.230> it's<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.830> more<00:00:20.010> sharp

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
cut off the edge so it's the more sharp

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.750 
cut off the edge so it's the more sharp
straight<00:00:21.750> line<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:22.800> really<00:00:23.250> helps<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
straight line and this really helps the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.609 
straight line and this really helps the
effect<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.269> also<00:00:24.390> apply<00:00:24.720> another<00:00:25.170> one<00:00:25.410> on

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
effect and I also apply another one on

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.620 
effect and I also apply another one on
the<00:00:25.859> bottom<00:00:26.160> segment<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.880> my<00:00:27.000> finger<00:00:27.420> and

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
the bottom segment of my finger and

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.660 
the bottom segment of my finger and
repeated<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.349> same<00:00:28.590> process<00:00:29.130> with<00:00:29.160> blending

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
repeated the same process with blending

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.519 
repeated the same process with blending
it<00:00:29.789> out<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.090> then<00:00:30.179> cutting<00:00:30.420> off<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.750> edge<00:00:30.900> and

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
it out and then cutting off the edge and

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.830 
it out and then cutting off the edge and
I<00:00:31.650> applied<00:00:31.920> another<00:00:32.070> one<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.300> middle

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
I applied another one in the middle

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.240 
I applied another one in the middle
segment<00:00:34.050> on<00:00:34.320> my<00:00:34.410> finger<00:00:34.680> but<00:00:34.829> on<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.100> other

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
segment on my finger but on the other

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.430 
segment on my finger but on the other
side<00:00:35.399> now<00:00:36.360> make<00:00:36.600> sure<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.930> match<00:00:37.140> these<00:00:37.380> up

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
side now make sure you match these up

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.260 
side now make sure you match these up
while<00:00:37.770> cutting<00:00:38.010> them<00:00:38.219> or<00:00:38.399> else<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:38.910> just<00:00:39.090> not

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
while cutting them or else it's just not

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.299 
while cutting them or else it's just not
gonna<00:00:39.510> look<00:00:40.230> right<00:00:40.440> actually<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.950> redo<00:00:41.190> it

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
gonna look right actually I to redo it

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.750 
gonna look right actually I to redo it
once<00:00:41.489> but<00:00:41.820> just<00:00:42.120> kind<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.430> follow<00:00:44.430> your

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
once but just kind of follow your

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.360 
once but just kind of follow your
natural<00:00:44.940> finger<00:00:45.570> alignment<00:00:46.469> then<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.100> used<00:00:47.250> a

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
natural finger alignment then I used a

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.979 
natural finger alignment then I used a
stippling<00:00:47.670> sponge<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.450> add<00:00:48.539> back<00:00:48.780> some

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
stippling sponge to add back some

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.330 
stippling sponge to add back some
texture<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.500> also<00:00:49.739> move<00:00:50.010> some<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.219> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
texture and also move some of the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.189 
texture and also move some of the
Vaseline<00:00:50.820> which<00:00:51.480> makes<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.840> difficult<00:00:51.960> for

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
Vaseline which makes it difficult for

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.439 
Vaseline which makes it difficult for
the<00:00:52.559> next<00:00:53.100> product<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.489> stick<00:00:53.699> which<00:00:54.210> by<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
the next product to stick which by the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.819 
the next product to stick which by the
way<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.780> asked<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.079> Illustrator<00:00:55.530> which<00:00:55.680> is

and then I um put a line across to

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.520 
and then I um put a line across to
connect<00:01:26.909> them<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:27.930> what<00:01:28.170> makes<00:01:28.380> it

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
connect them and this is what makes it

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.920 
connect them and this is what makes it
look<00:01:28.680> really<00:01:29.040> cool<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:30.240> looks<00:01:30.270> real<00:01:30.810> and
