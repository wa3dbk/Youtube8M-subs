00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 It was today I will talk about the knight of the 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.810
 seven kingdoms of george martin was 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:16.500
 director 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:20.220
 read this book if it passes the mark more or 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.300
 at least 90 years before the war of thrones 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.100
 so we follow the character 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.699
 different from what you're used to here 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:31.260
 ostagar on are still in charge yet 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:34.380
 They are the kings week and stop only in 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.020
 we follow a young knight and 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.840
 I choose the book has three bodies two 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.960
 and do not see in the tournament and one with this 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.149
 gentleman serving the Lord would be few 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.129
 importance in fact no sir not 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.510
 Speak, I will not speak more than this if 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.590
 I will deliver much of the story loses 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.270
 a lot of grace 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.030
 whoever has read the war of thrones knows the 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.180
 How much company do I have found this book? 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.550
 is much more enjoyable to read than 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.750
 chronicles of ice and fire he is very 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.199
 is much lighter but it is easier to 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.780
 read 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.630
 he has his secrets there is the suspense 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.530
 but the story like this is much more 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.210
 simple 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.610
 it is much easier to follow the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.400
 war of thrones for those who do not know 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.200
 has so many stories in the middle of what 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.360
 You end up confused here as 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.549
 You followed the character you have. 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.560
 the point of view of a character is 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.960
 much more enjoyable to see 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.020
 so if you're not looking for a 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.590
 very complicated thing very elaborate 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.259
 Of course, since you never know 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.259
 it will not be so light so easy as well 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.470
 but it is much more pleasant there 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.810
 some parts as you go along 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.960
 the much smaller knight 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.229
 that 's how important it is gentlemen like that 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.299
 different times have been 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.820
 I was reading a book that was going on 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.040
 mysteries is from time to time so kind 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.899
 they speak someone known type looks 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:09.660
 a cheap and a mention to the wall not to 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.879
 to be the same then there you 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.350
 accompanies some of them mainly in the 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:18.090
 first chapter 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.950
 my point is but overall this is a 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.760
 completely different story with 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.700
 other characters otto 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.450
 cool to see here that 'never everything 100% 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.600
 in the kingdom that has conspiracies in 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.200
 secrets you like to see and have 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.110
 pay good that you can for them and 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.200
 have not so good pay so are more 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.620
 look like the crazy king the fountain here 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:54.720
 is also much more pleasant said reads the 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:59.250
 I do not know if it is very much higher 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.430
 the greater margin is greater then it is also 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:09.270
 mega eyes in the eyes thank 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:11.460
 Thank you, this is really worth it. 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.380
 the pen read and had a lot of fun reading 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.130
 personally for the misses that I 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:22.200
 I was on vacation and all that link 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:24.890
 everybody loves and for today it's just 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.890
 bye
