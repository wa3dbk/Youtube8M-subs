backwards because it's too slow and it's

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.040 
backwards because it's too slow and it's
useless<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.430> only<00:02:16.610> way<00:02:17.090> or<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.630> only<00:02:17.840> time

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
useless the only way or the only time

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.650 
useless the only way or the only time
the<00:02:18.290> Hunter<00:02:18.530> has<00:02:18.769> to<00:02:18.800> do<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:19.160> is<00:02:19.370> when<00:02:20.209> they

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
the Hunter has to do that is when they

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.400 
the Hunter has to do that is when they
jump<00:02:21.320> back<00:02:21.680> shoot<00:02:22.269> so<00:02:23.269> you<00:02:23.750> still<00:02:23.989> get<00:02:24.110> some

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
jump back shoot so you still get some

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.680 
jump back shoot so you still get some
distance<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:25.040> you<00:02:25.310> quickly<00:02:25.519> get<00:02:26.360> off<00:02:26.420> an

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
distance and you quickly get off an

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.490 
distance and you quickly get off an
instant<00:02:27.080> cast<00:02:27.640> but<00:02:28.640> other<00:02:29.330> than<00:02:29.450> that<00:02:29.600> you

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
instant cast but other than that you

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.789 
instant cast but other than that you
should<00:02:30.530> just<00:02:31.519> strafe<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:32.329> shoot<00:02:33.079> if<00:02:33.230> you<00:02:33.590> have

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
should just strafe and shoot if you have

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.949 
should just strafe and shoot if you have
to<00:02:33.950> run<00:02:34.100> away<00:02:34.250> from<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.610> certain<00:02:34.790> enemy<00:02:35.480> or<00:02:35.690> mob

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
to run away from a certain enemy or mob

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.920 
to run away from a certain enemy or mob
or<00:02:36.260> let's<00:02:36.590> say<00:02:36.769> an<00:02:36.920> AoE

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.009 

and<00:02:40.140> so<00:02:40.950> it's<00:02:41.280> good<00:02:41.609> to<00:02:41.640> practice<00:02:41.939> this<00:02:42.420> good

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
and so it's good to practice this good

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.869 
and so it's good to practice this good
to<00:02:43.109> know<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.379> angle<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.129> need<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.489> be<00:02:44.609> in

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
to know the angle that you need to be in

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.690 
to know the angle that you need to be in
so<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.540> you're<00:02:45.810> not<00:02:45.840> getting<00:02:46.469> a<00:02:46.799> you<00:02:47.549> know

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
so that you're not getting a you know

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.880 
so that you're not getting a you know
your<00:02:47.939> back<00:02:48.150> face<00:02:48.450> towards<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.200> mob<00:02:49.709> that

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
your back face towards the mob that

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.610 
your back face towards the mob that
you're<00:02:50.010> shooting<00:02:50.159> at<00:02:52.459> now<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:55.140> next<00:02:55.290> one<00:02:55.439> I'm

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
you're shooting at now the next one I'm

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.759 
you're shooting at now the next one I'm
going<00:02:55.709> to<00:02:55.799> talk<00:02:55.890> about<00:02:56.040> is<00:02:56.599> misdirect

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
going to talk about is misdirect

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.190 
going to talk about is misdirect
misdirect<00:02:58.769> is<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.670> very<00:03:00.480> important<00:03:01.349> skill

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
misdirect is a very important skill

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.940 
misdirect is a very important skill
basically<00:03:04.200> it's<00:03:04.530> one<00:03:05.129> of<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.310> very<00:03:05.579> few

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
basically it's one of the very few

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.530 
basically it's one of the very few
benefits<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.489> having<00:03:08.639> a<00:03:08.879> hunter<00:03:09.180> in<00:03:09.299> the<00:03:09.329> group

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
benefits to having a hunter in the group

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.490 
benefits to having a hunter in the group
other<00:03:09.719> than<00:03:09.840> just<00:03:10.200> keep<00:03:10.500> yes<00:03:10.970> misdirect<00:03:12.500> takes

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
other than just keep yes misdirect takes

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.610 
other than just keep yes misdirect takes
the<00:03:13.859> threat<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:14.819> you<00:03:15.239> cast<00:03:15.870> from<00:03:16.290> your

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
the threat that you cast from your

attacks on to whatever person you're
misdirecting<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.650> so<00:03:20.099> what<00:03:20.220> you<00:03:20.280> should<00:03:20.310> do<00:03:20.579> is

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
misdirecting to so what you should do is

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.119 
misdirecting to so what you should do is
set<00:03:20.970> your<00:03:21.000> tank<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:23.060> autofocus<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:25.040> what<00:03:26.040> will

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
set your tank to autofocus and what will

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.309 
set your tank to autofocus and what will
happen<00:03:26.549> when<00:03:27.239> you<00:03:27.359> cast<00:03:27.540> misdirect<00:03:28.049> is<00:03:28.200> the

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
happen when you cast misdirect is the

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.909 
happen when you cast misdirect is the
next<00:03:28.590> three<00:03:28.919> shots<00:03:29.219> that<00:03:29.400> you<00:03:29.489> have<00:03:29.700> is

shot multi-shot shoots three arrows so

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.899 
shot multi-shot shoots three arrows so
it's<00:03:42.959> not<00:03:43.109> convenient<00:03:43.439> so<00:03:44.099> with<00:03:44.310> these<00:03:44.489> three

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:44.909 
it's not convenient so with these three

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.319 
it's not convenient so with these three
arrows<00:03:45.269> what<00:03:46.109> you<00:03:46.229> can<00:03:46.409> do<00:03:46.560> is<00:03:46.859> cast<00:03:47.760> misdirect

Thunder stomp that's a lot more damage
and<00:07:23.590> it<00:07:24.370> could<00:07:24.550> suddenly<00:07:24.759> hold<00:07:25.180> a<00:07:25.330> lot<00:07:25.570> more

00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:25.599
