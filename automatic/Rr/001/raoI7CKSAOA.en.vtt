so far headsets comfortable too let's
see<00:04:38.330> put<00:04:38.840> this<00:04:38.960> somewhere

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
see put this somewhere

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.409 
see put this somewhere
and<00:04:40.949> see<00:04:41.949> we<00:04:42.160> got<00:04:42.340> I<00:04:42.520> guess<00:04:42.699> this<00:04:42.820> is<00:04:42.970> a<00:04:43.000> control

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
and see we got I guess this is a control

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.280 
and see we got I guess this is a control
panel<00:04:43.600> I<00:04:43.930> guess<00:04:44.740> you<00:04:44.860> got<00:04:44.979> your<00:04:45.130> clip-on<00:04:45.970> mic

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290

you can just put it right there that's
pretty<00:04:56.860> cool<00:04:57.010> too<00:04:57.250> and<00:04:57.520> this<00:04:58.419> is<00:04:58.630> a<00:04:58.660> guess<00:04:59.110> it's

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
pretty cool too and this is a guess it's

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.469

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
like a control panel right here I guess

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:02.939 
like a control panel right here I guess

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
now and at the bottom looks like it

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.800 
now and at the bottom looks like it
looks<00:05:12.639> like<00:05:12.850> about<00:05:12.970> maybe<00:05:13.240> want<00:05:13.630> to<00:05:13.690> guess

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
looks like about maybe want to guess

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.010 
looks like about maybe want to guess
about<00:05:13.930> six<00:05:14.229> or<00:05:14.289> seven<00:05:14.440> feet<00:05:14.710> worth<00:05:15.400> of<00:05:16.020> cables
