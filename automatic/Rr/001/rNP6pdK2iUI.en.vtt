00:00:01.234 --> 00:00:06.404
 Naomi Schaefer Riley was editor of the Higher Education Weekly. 

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:13.969
 All this up to her article in which she criticizes Black American studies at American universities. 

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.131
 Some of the readers were angry with the article. 

00:00:16.132 --> 00:00:23.314
 And despite the weekly statement that it was mainly an attempt to initiate a discussion, it was eventually fired. 

00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:25.541
 Naomi is here with us today. 

00:00:26.718 --> 00:00:31.111
 So - what was the case of black studies? 

00:00:31.112 --> 00:00:39.281
 I wrote my blog in response to another, which dealt with several graduates of Black Studies and their dissertations. 

00:00:39.282 --> 00:00:44.884
 I looked at the topics of the work and it seemed to me that they were not exactly academically precise. 

00:00:44.885 --> 00:00:53.506
 They were mostly conceived in such a way that some negative phenomenon of the black community was tempted by white people and institutional racism. 

00:00:53.507 --> 00:01:00.301
 Then there were also a few works that dealt with completely nonsensical things. For example, the history of obstetrics. 

00:01:00.302 --> 00:01:08.936
 Is this really so crucial that people get doctorates for it? Will these graduates ever be able to teach humanities? 

00:01:08.937 --> 00:01:13.773
 One of them, as far as I know, dealt with Clarence Thomas (the US Supreme Court black judge) ... 

00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:19.571
 Yes. One of those works dealt with the blacks of right-wing beliefs who were accused of "attacking civil rights". 

00:01:19.572 --> 00:01:29.053
 According to some PhD students, a black man may not be a rightist. He was awarded a Ph.D. at Midwestern University. 

00:01:29.054 --> 00:01:35.162
 And that is what the author says in her that right-wing blacks are damaging the civil area because they are against positive discrimination. 

00:01:35.163 --> 00:01:46.250
 So you opened this topic and asked questions about whether "black studies" are academically legitimate. Some people got mad by that. 

00:01:46.285 --> 00:01:53.223
 And the employer first stood up for you saying that we might have the first amendment to the Constitution and we should discuss it. 

00:01:54.475 --> 00:02:01.210
 But there were hundreds of comments, whose authors cursed me into racists and demanded an article download. 

00:02:01.211 --> 00:02:08.402
 An online petition was created, bringing together 7000 signatures of academics who asked me to lose my job. 

00:02:08.403 --> 00:02:14.171
 On Thursday, the editor said that it is a provocative article, but at least it opens the debate. 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.385
 He passed the weekend and on Monday evening I was on the pavement. 

00:02:20.386 --> 00:02:26.926
 I don't know what exactly happened in the newsroom, but it gives me the impression that they have given way to public pressure. 

00:02:26.927 --> 00:02:34.005
 These readers, who cursed me and made me sick with remarks, seemed to put too much pressure on the editor. 

00:02:34.006 --> 00:02:43.266
 So, apparently, you have been swept away by the racism charges because you dared to open this topic. 

00:02:43.267 --> 00:02:51.542
 You did not mention it in the article, but I will tell the audience that you are married to a black man. 

00:02:51.543 --> 00:02:57.502
 Yet, people are swearing that you are racist towards the black. 

00:02:57.503 --> 00:03:06.220
 Racism is a general label for anyone who disagrees with left-wing orthodoxy in a race-related theme. 

00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:15.097
 Nowadays, black studies at universities are big politics, there are no academic rules or the right to doubt them. 

00:03:15.098 --> 00:03:20.615
 It's an area where all the answers are already known. Whoever dares to criticize is racist. 

00:03:20.616 --> 00:03:25.365
 They didn't even try to argue against me matter-of-factly. 

00:03:25.366 --> 00:03:33.485
 To say the least, of course, I have not made the slightest outrageous or offensive statements to the students. 

00:03:33.486 --> 00:03:37.189
 On my part, it was clearly a criticism of their academic work. 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.938
 And according to the nature of the answer that I have received, I think that these studios do not really have any legitimacy. 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:48.662
 If they do not formulate a substantive response to my arguments, why should I suddenly believe that the field is meaningful. 

00:03:48.663 --> 00:03:53.781
 Though their reaction was miserable, it was effective enough as your editorial staff did. 

00:03:53.782 --> 00:03:59.034
 Because today there are few worse curses than "racist." 

00:03:59.035 --> 00:04:03.121
 That word is being used all the time, so I think its original meaning is thinning, 

00:04:03.122 --> 00:04:08.249
 but you have nevertheless been labeled as a racist and you will remain. 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:15.142
 Do you think this should be a deterrent example for everyone else who would ever want to write a critical article? 

00:04:15.143 --> 00:04:23.780
 Yes. It seems to me that the academic community has shown everyone the boundaries of what is still acceptable and what will not pass. 

00:04:23.781 --> 00:04:29.380
 If you want to cross these limits with your criticism, everyone will throw on it, 

00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:34.832
 because universities seem to be allergic to any disagreement on these matters. 

00:04:34.833 --> 00:04:40.872
 So, a very clear warning was sent to anyone who would allow them to think freely and address these issues in the future.
