looking<00:00:38.300> to<00:00:38.420> prevent<00:00:38.780> fluid<00:00:39.770> from<00:00:40.130> boiling

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
looking to prevent fluid from boiling

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.550 
looking to prevent fluid from boiling
over<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:41.300> that's<00:00:41.450> really<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:41.780> benefit<00:00:42.170> of<00:00:42.200> an

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:42.560 
over and that's really the benefit of an

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.170 
over and that's really the benefit of an
upgraded<00:00:43.100> radiator<00:00:43.520> cap<00:00:43.700> is<00:00:43.880> the<00:00:44.000> higher

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
upgraded radiator cap is the higher

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.110 
upgraded radiator cap is the higher
pressure<00:00:44.570> of<00:00:44.810> it<00:00:45.370> will<00:00:46.370> not<00:00:46.550> allow<00:00:46.880> this

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
pressure of it will not allow this

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.600 
pressure of it will not allow this
screen<00:00:47.480> open<00:00:47.780> will<00:00:47.930> not<00:00:48.050> allow<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:48.610> radiator

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
screen open will not allow the radiator

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.930 
screen open will not allow the radiator
food<00:00:49.820> to<00:00:49.970> be<00:00:50.060> released<00:00:50.650> until<00:00:51.650> it<00:00:51.890> hits<00:00:52.040> 1.3

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940

food to be released until it hits 1.3
bar<00:00:53.150> now<00:00:53.780> a<00:00:54.260> lot<00:00:54.560> of<00:00:54.590> people<00:00:54.680> wonder<00:00:55.070> well<00:00:55.160> why

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
bar now a lot of people wonder well why

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.070 
bar now a lot of people wonder well why
do<00:00:55.430> you<00:00:55.550> want<00:00:55.730> a<00:00:55.760> higher<00:00:56.000> pressure<00:00:56.480> cap<00:00:56.840> what's

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
do you want a higher pressure cap what's

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.360 
do you want a higher pressure cap what's
the<00:00:57.200> difference<00:00:57.560> and<00:00:57.650> basically<00:00:58.070> what<00:00:58.280> you're

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
the difference and basically what you're

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.090 
the difference and basically what you're
doing<00:00:58.430> is<00:00:58.760> you're<00:00:58.820> increasing<00:00:59.540> the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
doing is you're increasing the

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.620 
doing is you're increasing the
temperature<00:01:01.100> which<00:01:01.520> your<00:01:01.670> fluid<00:01:02.000> boils<00:01:02.450> out

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
temperature which your fluid boils out

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.940 
temperature which your fluid boils out
under<00:01:02.930> a<00:01:02.960> higher<00:01:03.170> pressure<00:01:03.500> it's<00:01:03.740> actually

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
under a higher pressure it's actually

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.200 
under a higher pressure it's actually
going<00:01:04.040> to<00:01:04.129> take<00:01:04.220> more<00:01:04.430> temperature<00:01:04.910> in<00:01:05.000> order

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
going to take more temperature in order

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.540 
going to take more temperature in order
for<00:01:05.330> your<00:01:05.449> food<00:01:05.630> to<00:01:05.750> boil<00:01:06.160> with<00:01:07.160> a<00:01:07.190> lower

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
for your food to boil with a lower

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.250 
for your food to boil with a lower
pressure<00:01:07.820> radiator<00:01:08.300> capital<00:01:08.810> actually<00:01:09.050> boil

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
pressure radiator capital actually boil

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.370 
pressure radiator capital actually boil
over<00:01:09.440> sooner<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:10.220> so<00:01:10.820> not<00:01:11.450> really<00:01:11.660> increasing

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
over sooner and so not really increasing

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.050 
over sooner and so not really increasing
the<00:01:12.530> cooling<00:01:13.130> or<00:01:13.370> shock<00:01:13.670> cars<00:01:13.940> not

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
the cooling or shock cars not

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.020 
the cooling or shock cars not
necessarily<00:01:14.780> gonna<00:01:14.870> run<00:01:15.020> cooler<00:01:15.260> with<00:01:15.590> this

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
necessarily gonna run cooler with this

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.630 
necessarily gonna run cooler with this
but<00:01:17.350> you<00:01:18.350> know<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:18.710> foods<00:01:19.010> not<00:01:19.070> going<00:01:19.310> to<00:01:19.370> boil

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
but you know the foods not going to boil

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.430 
but you know the foods not going to boil
near<00:01:20.210> as<00:01:20.390> quickly<00:01:20.660> you're<00:01:20.870> going<00:01:20.990> to<00:01:21.050> retain

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
near as quickly you're going to retain

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.530 
near as quickly you're going to retain
the<00:01:21.620> fluid<00:01:21.920> which<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:22.280> know<00:01:22.400> on<00:01:22.520> a<00:01:22.550> heavy<00:01:23.120> hop

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
the fluid which you know on a heavy hop

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.070 
the fluid which you know on a heavy hop
track<00:01:23.870> day<00:01:24.110> that<00:01:25.070> could<00:01:25.190> definitely<00:01:26.080> help

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
track day that could definitely help

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.020 
track day that could definitely help
keep<00:01:27.380> cooing<00:01:27.710> under<00:01:27.920> control<00:01:28.370> because

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
keep cooing under control because

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.660 
keep cooing under control because
anytime<00:01:29.210> you're<00:01:29.450> losing<00:01:29.780> food<00:01:29.960> obviously

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
anytime you're losing food obviously

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.730 
anytime you're losing food obviously
that<00:01:31.670> foods<00:01:31.909> not<00:01:32.180> doing<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:32.930> engine<00:01:33.200> and<00:01:33.380> so

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
that foods not doing the engine and so

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.680 
that foods not doing the engine and so
anything<00:01:34.310> you<00:01:34.460> can<00:01:34.670> do<00:01:34.760> to<00:01:34.790> keep<00:01:35.000> it<00:01:35.180> in<00:01:35.420> the

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
anything you can do to keep it in the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.200 
anything you can do to keep it in the
radiator<00:01:35.990> or<00:01:36.350> you<00:01:37.310> know<00:01:37.400> off<00:01:37.580> the<00:01:37.610> track<00:01:38.030> is

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
radiator or you know off the track is

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.820 
radiator or you know off the track is
definitely<00:01:38.630> going<00:01:38.720> to<00:01:38.780> be<00:01:38.900> beneficial<00:01:39.320> I<00:01:39.590> just

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
definitely going to be beneficial I just

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
of the few that actually has a cream

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.040 
of the few that actually has a cream
color<00:01:49.520> on<00:01:50.060> this<00:01:50.300> bottom<00:01:50.479> side<00:01:50.780> I<00:01:50.810> know<00:01:50.930> you're

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
color on this bottom side I know you're

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.360 
color on this bottom side I know you're
never<00:01:51.200> going<00:01:51.350> to<00:01:51.380> see<00:01:51.440> it<00:01:51.710> but<00:01:51.890> I<00:01:51.950> just<00:01:52.070> kind<00:01:52.340> of

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
never going to see it but I just kind of

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.790 
never going to see it but I just kind of
like<00:01:52.520> it<00:01:52.700> it's<00:01:52.820> a<00:01:52.909> really<00:01:53.120> cool<00:01:53.360> design<00:01:53.800> the

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800
