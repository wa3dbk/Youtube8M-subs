hours<00:07:25.800> one<00:07:26.370> trend<00:07:26.729> that<00:07:26.849> I<00:07:26.939> noticed<00:07:27.360> was<00:07:27.539> that

00:07:27.559 --> 00:07:27.569 
hours one trend that I noticed was that

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:29.629 
hours one trend that I noticed was that
the<00:07:28.169> players<00:07:28.439> at<00:07:28.620> the<00:07:28.710> table<00:07:28.889> all<00:07:29.310> played<00:07:29.580> a

00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:29.639 
the players at the table all played a

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:32.390 
the players at the table all played a
very<00:07:29.819> similar<00:07:30.000> style<00:07:30.330> to<00:07:30.509> mine<00:07:30.659> they<00:07:31.199> all<00:07:31.400> have

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 
very similar style to mine they all have

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.089 
very similar style to mine they all have
a<00:07:32.430> very<00:07:32.719> small<00:07:33.719> ball<00:07:34.020> approach<00:07:34.379> and<00:07:34.800> and

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:35.099 
a very small ball approach and and

00:07:35.099 --> 00:07:36.529 
a very small ball approach and and
that's<00:07:35.250> just<00:07:35.460> the<00:07:35.550> way<00:07:35.639> I<00:07:35.669> think<00:07:35.789> is<00:07:36.000> optimum

00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:36.539 
that's just the way I think is optimum

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:38.959 
that's just the way I think is optimum
to<00:07:36.689> play<00:07:36.870> tournament<00:07:37.229> poker<00:07:37.349> so<00:07:37.819> because<00:07:38.819> I

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:38.969 
to play tournament poker so because I

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:40.490 
to play tournament poker so because I
sort<00:07:39.210> of<00:07:39.270> feel<00:07:39.360> like<00:07:39.419> I've<00:07:39.599> invented<00:07:39.900> it<00:07:40.139> to

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:40.500 
sort of feel like I've invented it to

something degree I know how to exploit
it<00:07:42.090> and<00:07:42.210> that's<00:07:42.330> what<00:07:42.479> I'm<00:07:42.569> I<00:07:42.629> look<00:07:42.750> to<00:07:42.870> do<00:07:42.990> here
