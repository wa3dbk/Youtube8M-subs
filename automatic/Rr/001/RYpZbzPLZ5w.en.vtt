00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
hi guys I'm filming a little DIY video

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.030 
hi guys I'm filming a little DIY video
is<00:00:04.980> nothing<00:00:05.759> too<00:00:06.089> complex<00:00:06.899> but<00:00:07.290> I<00:00:07.560> basically

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
is nothing too complex but I basically

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.740 
is nothing too complex but I basically
decided<00:00:08.370> that<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:10.790> black<00:00:11.790> jeans<00:00:12.059> that<00:00:12.269> I<00:00:12.300> used

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
decided that the black jeans that I used

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.169 
decided that the black jeans that I used
to<00:00:12.840> wear<00:00:13.110> before<00:00:13.620> i<00:00:13.860> got<00:00:14.009> my<00:00:14.160> tube<00:00:14.460> my<00:00:14.670> estas<00:00:14.969> tu

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
to wear before i got my tube my estas tu

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.000 
to wear before i got my tube my estas tu
pants<00:00:15.540> because<00:00:16.139> they've<00:00:16.320> faded<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.830> bit<00:00:16.859> i

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
pants because they've faded a bit i

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.410 
pants because they've faded a bit i
thought<00:00:17.369> i<00:00:17.550> might<00:00:17.699> as<00:00:17.850> well<00:00:18.029> rip<00:00:18.240> them<00:00:18.359> up

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
thought i might as well rip them up

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.080 
thought i might as well rip them up
because<00:00:18.539> i<00:00:18.690> do<00:00:18.750> want<00:00:19.050> some<00:00:19.230> ripped<00:00:19.439> jeans<00:00:19.680> and

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
because i do want some ripped jeans and

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.000 
because i do want some ripped jeans and
I<00:00:21.090> thought<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.930> would<00:00:22.020> just<00:00:22.109> be<00:00:22.320> easier<00:00:22.350> if<00:00:22.740> I

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
I thought it would just be easier if I

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.710 
I thought it would just be easier if I
broke<00:00:23.220> up<00:00:23.400> these<00:00:23.640> ones<00:00:23.939> because<00:00:24.420> they<00:00:24.570> already

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
broke up these ones because they already

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.820 
broke up these ones because they already

like I like the fact that I have ripped
jeans<00:03:57.260> now<00:03:57.700> obviously<00:03:58.700> i'll<00:03:58.850> still<00:03:59.060> be<00:03:59.240> mostly

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
jeans now obviously i'll still be mostly

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.570

wearing<00:04:00.260> just<00:04:00.440> my<00:04:00.470> plain<00:04:00.740> black<00:04:00.980> skinny<00:04:01.310> ones
