something that simulates leather this
here<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.870> plastic<00:00:14.509> and<00:00:15.509> while<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:15.870> like<00:00:16.139> to

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
here is plastic and while I like to

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.890 
here is plastic and while I like to

finding<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.770> working<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.430> lot

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
finding that this is working a lot

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.790 
finding that this is working a lot
better<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:21.090> use<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.390> plastic<00:00:21.600> especially<00:00:22.529> if

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
better to use the plastic especially if

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.670 
better to use the plastic especially if
you<00:00:23.369> want<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:24.480> do<00:00:24.720> some<00:00:24.930> kind<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.170> an<00:00:25.260> opening

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
out after a while plastic is holding up

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.549 
out after a while plastic is holding up
real<00:00:37.829> well<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:39.239> cord<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.840> my<00:00:40.110> favorite

real well so this cord is my favorite
right<00:00:40.739> now<00:00:41.270> when<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.390> comes<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.719> cord<00:00:43.050> work

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
right now when it comes to cord work

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
right now when it comes to cord work
there<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.370> cord<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.850> usually<00:00:45.620> thick<00:00:46.620> as<00:00:47.100> far

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
there the cord is usually thick as far

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.029 
there the cord is usually thick as far
as<00:00:47.430> beads<00:00:47.640> go<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.239> you'll<00:00:48.899> have<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.200> have<00:00:49.230> very

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
as beads go so you'll have to have very

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.369 
as beads go so you'll have to have very
large<00:00:50.250> beads<00:00:50.670> or<00:00:51.329> else<00:00:51.480> just<00:00:51.750> hang<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.170> piece

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
large beads or else just hang a piece

large beads or else just hang a piece
down<00:00:53.010> from<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.430> cord<00:00:53.699> what<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.690> did<00:00:54.930> do<00:00:55.110> on<00:00:55.260> this

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
down from the cord what I did do on this

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.540 
down from the cord what I did do on this
piece<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:57.230> braided<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.350> cord<00:00:58.620> just<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.430> make

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
piece is braided the cord just to make

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.590 
piece is braided the cord just to make
it<00:00:59.579> look<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.820> little<00:00:59.940> different<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.510> then

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
it look a little different and then

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.180 
it look a little different and then
wrapped<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.930> around<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.649> piece<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.039> rose

necklaces and use a crimp and I used

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.649 
necklaces and use a crimp and I used
some<00:01:14.250> nodding<00:01:14.460> techniques<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.390> hold<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
beads in place here we have a clasp I

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.300 
beads in place here we have a clasp I
actually<00:01:20.460> made<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.439> just<00:01:22.650> took<00:01:22.950> copper

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
actually made and I just took copper

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.510 
actually made and I just took copper
wire<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.850> shaped<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:25.830> hook<00:01:26.009> clasp<00:01:26.390> and<00:01:27.390> used

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
wire and shaped the hook clasp and used

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.880 
wire and shaped the hook clasp and used
a<00:01:29.640> piece<00:01:30.539> like<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.810> that's<00:01:31.530> made<00:01:31.829> for

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890

opening what you need to do is squeeze
one<00:01:54.719> half<00:01:55.049> at<00:01:55.319> a<00:01:55.350> time<00:01:57.439> around<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.679> cord<00:01:59.009> just

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
one half at a time around the cord just

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.389 
one half at a time around the cord just
a<00:02:00.030> little<00:02:00.329> bit<00:02:00.479> not<00:02:00.630> all<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.079> way<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.829> then

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
a little bit not all the way and then

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.020 
a little bit not all the way and then
try<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.700> bring<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.209> other<00:02:03.390> side<00:02:04.579> around<00:02:05.579> the

outside of that half at that point

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.729 
outside of that half at that point
