mean<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.230> main<00:00:25.650> differences<00:00:26.220> are<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.670> it

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
mean the main differences are that it

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.750 
mean the main differences are that it
has<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.330> footprint<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.680> same<00:00:28.890> sizes<00:00:29.340> what<00:00:29.609> your

concept 5i potter that was out last
season<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.090> can<00:00:39.270> see<00:00:39.450> they're<00:00:39.600> very<00:00:39.780> very

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
season you can see they're very very

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.110 
season you can see they're very very
similar<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.350> terms<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.890> size<00:00:41.100> but<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
similar in terms of the size but the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.420 
similar in terms of the size but the
performance<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.750> very<00:00:42.930> very<00:00:43.079> different<00:00:43.590> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
performance is very very different the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.290 
performance is very very different the
method<00:00:44.730> concept<00:00:45.239> really<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.500> idea<00:00:46.649> is

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
method concept really and the idea is

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.880 
method concept really and the idea is
obviously<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.450> can<00:00:48.600> see<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.050> there's<00:00:49.590> two

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
obviously you can see that there's two

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.880 
obviously you can see that there's two
very<00:00:50.100> contrasting<00:00:50.340> pieces<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.360> head<00:00:51.539> and

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
very contrasting pieces to the head and

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.889 
very contrasting pieces to the head and
the<00:00:52.890> red<00:00:53.399> anodized<00:00:53.940> aluminium<00:00:53.969> part

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
the red anodized aluminium part

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.560 
the red anodized aluminium part
basically<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.860> very<00:00:56.340> very<00:00:56.460> light<00:00:56.730> which<00:00:57.149> you

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
basically is very very light which you

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.910 
basically is very very light which you
can<00:00:57.719> see<00:00:57.750> they're<00:00:58.079> grown<00:00:58.320> if<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.620> know<00:00:58.800> if<00:00:58.859> you

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
can see they're grown if you know if you

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.220 
can see they're grown if you know if you
hold<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.219> that's<00:00:59.940> about<00:01:00.149> 90<00:01:00.719> grams<00:01:00.930> worth

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
hold that that's about 90 grams worth

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.900 
hold that that's about 90 grams worth
the<00:01:01.469> head<00:01:01.620> weight<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.070> that's<00:01:02.370> that's<00:01:02.609> very

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
the head weight so that's that's very

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.660 
the head weight so that's that's very
very<00:01:03.059> light<00:01:04.070> contrasting<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.250> back<00:01:05.430> piece

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
very light contrasting to the back piece

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.250 
very light contrasting to the back piece
of<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.909> Potter<00:01:06.150> which<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:06.930> which<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.229> a

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
of the Potter which is this which is a

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.100 
of the Potter which is this which is a
very<00:01:07.500> heavy<00:01:08.159> dense<00:01:08.670> stainless<00:01:09.270> steel<00:01:09.479> portion

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
very heavy dense stainless steel portion

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.800 
very heavy dense stainless steel portion
those<00:01:10.740> together<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:12.060> added<00:01:12.360> way<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.570> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
those together and that added way to the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.929 
those together and that added way to the
back<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.200> putter<00:01:13.409> moves<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.220> MOI<00:01:14.490> very

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
back of the putter moves the MOI very

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.520 
back of the putter moves the MOI very
very<00:01:15.180> far<00:01:15.360> back<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.049> center<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.439> gravity

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
very far back and the center of gravity

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.039 
very far back and the center of gravity
as<00:01:17.040> well<00:01:17.250> what<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.030> does<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.630> keeps<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
as well what that does is it keeps the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.990 
as well what that does is it keeps the
head<00:01:19.200> very<00:01:19.439> very<00:01:19.680> stable<00:01:19.950> through<00:01:20.580> through

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
head very very stable through through

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.179 
head very very stable through through
the<00:01:21.119> pub<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.540> keeps<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> weight<00:01:22.710> very<00:01:22.950> very

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
the pub and keeps the weight very very

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.429 
the pub and keeps the weight very very
low<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.670> help<00:01:24.150> stop<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> head<00:01:24.810> from<00:01:24.900> twisting

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
low and help stop the head from twisting

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.580 
low and help stop the head from twisting

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.929 
technology in the face as well helps the
ball<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.750> roll<00:01:45.960> very<00:01:46.710> very<00:01:46.890> much<00:01:47.009> smoother<00:01:47.759> and

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
ball to roll very very much smoother and

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.850 
ball to roll very very much smoother and
get<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.180> ball<00:01:48.329> rolling<00:01:48.689> quicker<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.649> that

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
get the ball rolling quicker so that

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.520 
get the ball rolling quicker so that
with<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.579> added<00:01:50.970> technology<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.110> way

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
with the added technology of the way

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.410 
with the added technology of the way
further<00:01:52.920> back<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.430> lower<00:01:53.610> down<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.240> head

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
further back and lower down in the head

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.240 
further back and lower down in the head
as<00:01:54.600> well<00:01:54.810> he's<00:01:55.350> going<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.680> keep<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.920> head<00:01:56.070> very

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
as well he's going to keep the head very

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.679 
as well he's going to keep the head very
very<00:01:56.460> stable<00:01:57.409> so<00:01:58.409> i<00:01:58.439> recommend<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.340> know<00:01:59.850> not

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
very stable so i recommend you know not

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.520 
very stable so i recommend you know not
really<00:02:00.990> going<00:02:01.140> on<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.380> looks<00:02:01.560> at<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.770> poet

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
really going on the looks at the poet

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.670 
really going on the looks at the poet
get<00:02:02.920> up<00:02:03.010> there<00:02:03.159> try<00:02:03.400> it<00:02:03.460> for<00:02:03.610> yourself
