00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.620 
but I thought that was kind of cool I
like<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.369> little<00:01:05.549> bit<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.880> sassiness<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.540> my

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
face at the end of it and I thought it'd

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.359 
face at the end of it and I thought it'd
be<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:09.030> nice<00:01:09.210> little<00:01:09.450> like<00:01:09.720> outro<00:01:10.260> part<00:01:10.590> I

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
little bit in real life and I wanted to

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.190 
little bit in real life and I wanted to
reflect<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:26.240> next<00:01:27.240> up<00:01:27.360> we<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:27.509> some<00:01:27.750> demos<00:01:28.080> I

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
reflect it next up we have some demos I

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.690 
reflect it next up we have some demos I
did<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.500> one<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.710> my<00:01:28.829> classes<00:01:28.890> basically<00:01:29.640> i

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
did in one of my classes basically i

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
of these are representing a certain demo

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.060 
of these are representing a certain demo
within<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:38.970> week<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.650> first<00:01:40.770> ones

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
is her picking your nose the demo was to

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.510 
is her picking your nose the demo was to
kind<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.270> show<00:01:54.450> how<00:01:54.659> we<00:01:54.720> can<00:01:55.049> layer<00:01:55.799> animation

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
kind of show how we can layer animation

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.819 
kind of show how we can layer animation
and<00:01:56.759> not<00:01:57.000> have<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.479> animate<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.170> all<00:01:58.320> at<00:01:58.500> once

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
and not have to animate it all at once

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.679 
and not have to animate it all at once
and<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.790> can<00:01:59.909> kind<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.180> section<00:02:00.600> off

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
and you can kind of section off

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.770 
and you can kind of section off
different<00:02:01.020> things<00:02:01.200> like<00:02:01.409> arms<00:02:01.890> or<00:02:02.100> heads<00:02:02.369> and

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
different things like arms or heads and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.060 
different things like arms or heads and
facial<00:02:03.780> expressions<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.770> know<00:02:04.890> just

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
facial expressions and you know just

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.920 
facial expressions and you know just
layer<00:02:05.280> things<00:02:05.579> make<00:02:05.820> complicating<00:02:06.479> animation

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
layer things make complicating animation

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.960 
layer things make complicating animation
a<00:02:07.020> little<00:02:07.259> bit<00:02:07.350> more<00:02:07.500> simple<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.459> next<00:02:08.759> demo

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
a little bit more simple the next demo

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.150 
a little bit more simple the next demo
was<00:02:09.119> character<00:02:09.539> Riggs<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.379> we<00:02:10.679> use<00:02:10.830> flash

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
was character Riggs this is we use flash

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.530 
was character Riggs this is we use flash
because<00:02:11.430> it's<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.700> easiest<00:02:11.730> program<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.420> get

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
because it's the easiest program to get

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.250 
because it's the easiest program to get
a<00:02:12.569> hold<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.900> it

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
a hold of it

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.449 
a hold of it
cheap<00:02:13.379> is<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.680> most<00:02:13.860> affordable<00:02:14.069> for

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
cheap is the most affordable for

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.809 
cheap is the most affordable for
students<00:02:14.849> and<00:02:15.269> for<00:02:15.299> students<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:17.220> so<00:02:17.400> Haley

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
students and for students and so Haley

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.520 
students and for students and so Haley
was<00:02:18.000> our<00:02:18.180> character<00:02:18.750> rig<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.110> designed<00:02:19.439> a

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
was our character rig I designed a

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.309 
was our character rig I designed a
character<00:02:19.860> for<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:20.340> now<00:02:20.909> we<00:02:20.970> basically<00:02:21.900> it's

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
character for and now we basically it's

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.319 
character for and now we basically it's
making<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.129> bunch<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.430> different<00:02:23.670> pieces<00:02:23.849> that

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
making a bunch of different pieces that

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.390 
making a bunch of different pieces that
we<00:02:24.390> can<00:02:24.540> reuse<00:02:24.870> over<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.349> over<00:02:25.409> again<00:02:25.590> it's<00:02:26.220> a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
we can reuse over and over again it's a

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.039 
we can reuse over and over again it's a
lot<00:02:26.549> of<00:02:26.610> work<00:02:26.730> in<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.090> beginning<00:02:27.480> but<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.780> lot

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
lot of work in the beginning but a lot

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.990 
lot of work in the beginning but a lot
less<00:02:28.079> work<00:02:28.230> in<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.680> actual<00:02:28.920> animation<00:02:29.340> aspect

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
less work in the actual animation aspect

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.460 
less work in the actual animation aspect
a<00:02:30.180> lot<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:30.599> people<00:02:30.720> kind<00:02:30.959> of<00:02:30.989> see<00:02:31.140> this<00:02:31.319> is

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
a lot of people kind of see this is

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.830 
a lot of people kind of see this is
really<00:02:31.709> cheap<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.159> lazy<00:02:32.280> animation<00:02:33.000> but<00:02:33.569> when

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
really cheap and lazy animation but when

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.569 
really cheap and lazy animation but when
you<00:02:33.989> have<00:02:34.019> a<00:02:34.230> small<00:02:34.530> budget<00:02:34.709> sometimes<00:02:35.400> it

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
you have a small budget sometimes it

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.699 
you have a small budget sometimes it
just<00:02:35.700> works<00:02:35.909> out<00:02:36.060> this<00:02:36.750> one's<00:02:36.989> actually<00:02:37.379> for

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
just works out this one's actually for

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:38.839 
just works out this one's actually for
the<00:02:37.799> intro<00:02:38.129> class<00:02:38.340> those<00:02:38.579> are<00:02:38.700> for

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
the intro class those are for

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.399 
the intro class those are for
intermediate<00:02:39.390> where<00:02:39.540> we<00:02:39.629> mostly<00:02:39.930> focus<00:02:40.290> on

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
intermediate where we mostly focus on

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.679 
intermediate where we mostly focus on
flash<00:02:40.680> animation<00:02:41.190> versus<00:02:41.609> the<00:02:42.120> intro<00:02:42.510> where

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
flash animation versus the intro where

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:44.119 
flash animation versus the intro where
we<00:02:42.780> mostly<00:02:43.049> focus<00:02:43.379> on<00:02:43.500> traditional<00:02:43.920> animation

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
we mostly focus on traditional animation

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.610 
we mostly focus on traditional animation
and<00:02:44.579> learning<00:02:44.849> principles<00:02:45.109> this<00:02:46.109> one<00:02:46.349> we<00:02:46.500> were

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
and learning principles this one we were

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.410 
and learning principles this one we were
talking<00:02:46.650> about<00:02:47.040> it's<00:02:47.400> i<00:02:47.790> call<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.120> beauty

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
talking about it's i call it the beauty

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.569 
talking about it's i call it the beauty
and<00:02:48.569> beast<00:02:48.690> project<00:02:49.379> or<00:02:49.950> originally<00:02:50.430> was<00:02:50.549> a

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
and beast project or originally was a

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.819 
and beast project or originally was a
flour<00:02:50.849> sack<00:02:51.120> project<00:02:51.750> but<00:02:52.139> basically<00:02:52.319> the

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
flour sack project but basically the

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.559 
flour sack project but basically the
students<00:02:53.190> have<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.400> animate<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:54.000> inanimate

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
students have to animate a inanimate

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.839 
students have to animate a inanimate
object<00:02:55.049> but<00:02:55.409> give<00:02:55.769> it<00:02:55.889> life<00:02:56.099> give<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.549> a<00:02:56.609> want

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
object but give it life give it a want

was really proud of this animation

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.839 
was really proud of this animation
especially<00:03:01.709> since<00:03:01.889> I<00:03:02.010> only<00:03:02.190> have<00:03:02.370> an<00:03:02.549> hour<00:03:02.639> and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
a half to do it and while it's really

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.009 
a half to do it and while it's really
sketchy<00:03:05.340> I<00:03:05.639> was<00:03:06.000> really<00:03:06.150> happy<00:03:06.389> like<00:03:06.810> this

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019

came<00:03:07.200> out<00:03:07.319> really<00:03:07.530> good<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.829> was<00:03:08.069> like<00:03:08.159> this<00:03:08.280> is

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
came out really good I was like this is

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.399 
came out really good I was like this is
the<00:03:08.430> first<00:03:08.609> time<00:03:08.730> I'm<00:03:08.879> like<00:03:09.030> man<00:03:09.269> I<00:03:09.690> might

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
the first time I'm like man I might

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.410 
the first time I'm like man I might
actually<00:03:10.590> be<00:03:10.799> a<00:03:10.859> good<00:03:11.010> animator<00:03:11.430> finally<00:03:12.269> the

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
actually be a good animator finally the

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.780 
actually be a good animator finally the
last<00:03:12.450> demo<00:03:12.900> was<00:03:13.139> dialogue<00:03:13.859> or<00:03:14.129> lip<00:03:14.400> syncing

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
last demo was dialogue or lip syncing

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.460 
last demo was dialogue or lip syncing
and<00:03:14.879> phonemes<00:03:15.329> and<00:03:15.510> so<00:03:15.959> this<00:03:16.109> is<00:03:16.200> kind<00:03:16.409> of

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
and phonemes and so this is kind of

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.439 
and phonemes and so this is kind of
reusing<00:03:16.920> that<00:03:17.040> rig<00:03:17.280> idea<00:03:17.639> making<00:03:18.239> all<00:03:18.359> the

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
reusing that rig idea making all the

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:20.509 
reusing that rig idea making all the
phonemes<00:03:18.810> at<00:03:18.930> once<00:03:19.169> and<00:03:19.440> then<00:03:19.889> just<00:03:20.129> kind<00:03:20.310> of

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
phonemes at once and then just kind of

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.250 
phonemes at once and then just kind of
putting<00:03:20.849> them<00:03:21.030> when<00:03:21.629> you<00:03:21.750> need<00:03:21.780> them<00:03:21.959> whenever

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
putting them when you need them whenever

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.830 
putting them when you need them whenever
the<00:03:22.560> dialogue<00:03:22.980> needs<00:03:23.459> it<00:03:23.579> and<00:03:23.760> so<00:03:24.359> the<00:03:24.510> clip<00:03:24.720> we

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
the dialogue needs it and so the clip we

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.170 
the dialogue needs it and so the clip we
use<00:03:25.019> is<00:03:25.169> from<00:03:25.379> this<00:03:25.560> poky<00:03:26.220> bad<00:03:26.370> animation<00:03:26.970> I
