00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 It's already good how you choose your 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.279
 books 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.589
 it is clear that everyone chooses the 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.469
 books based on what you like, I do not know 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.049
 if one day I started to think we are 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.940
 Incredible opens to what does not 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.160
 is so much interested in what a 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.010
 bit of our liking for things that 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.439
 people like to read from the beginning you read 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.869
 only what you like will you finish 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.250
 self-feeding are a jeans to talk to 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.010
 people always talk the same 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.109
 subjects of the same things sometimes a 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.099
 couple that always fights for them 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.170
 reasons 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.320
 if you read only that you like you stay 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.440
 prescribed these subjects times world 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.140
 point of view this year will be that you already 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.300
 You know is that meets your taste you 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.239
 is in the environment joined protected 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.440
 so let's just take a risk and find out 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:56.280
 a new one in literature for me is a 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.199
 most liberating activity of existence 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.989
 You know because if you're going to play a 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.629
 for literature as books in general 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.220
 is an infection if you play a role of the 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:11.040
 Books surely roles is 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.200
 turn kind of transformation is 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.960
 just as a relationship can leave 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.270
 different people as well as 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.340
 each contact with another person can 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.740
 transform people every contact with 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.110
 art can transform people 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.229
 a book can transform people and this 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.590
 transformation can be much greater 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.140
 is not holy there is much more rewarding to 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.240
 people there stay if we say little 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.820
 of what Sunday of that universe that 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.130
 we are well acquainted with this habit of 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.960
 reading 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.490
 It has nothing to do with this already. 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.869
 happened several times with me actually 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.640
 it's almost a scope that I have sister 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.049
 formalize and I remember that when I was 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.509
 in college 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.020
 and I went to do some things like that 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.600
 and rodrigo posses with the calculation balance 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.820
 type of test in the field was not a 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.100
 enriching experience, and I 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.579
 I did not like the class I think, mnam Sunday . 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.369
 I'm not talking every time you open up. 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:09.560
 The bruno branches Marvel petals 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.840
 roses always the famous one person 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.580
 different is not this but a lot 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.810
 interesting may happen when the 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.599
 subject is the books already happened 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.150
 with me instead of actually when I'm in a 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.580
 bookstore and a library that I love 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.530
 after seeing the readings that matter 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.220
 it is not only after having a look at the 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.110
 subjects that already attracts normally 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.720
 likes to stick between books like this 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.910
 It has nothing to do with me sometimes to 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.640
 have little to do in the dunga canopy. 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.590
 house has another has more to see missing a 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.780
 Scale of things that interests me a lot 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.640
 of course, since almost everyone tried 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.660
 pick up more of what matters a lot 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.390
 that look at what interests me 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.859
 same excuses but in the middle know a 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.230
 a little more because it does not matter 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:53.150
 but it is not enough for you but it is 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.590
 possible can be nice, too. 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.359
 I'll finally enjoy this blog for 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.850
 indicate three book readings that are not 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:01.549
 beginning did not matter like that or even a 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.680
 and after entering the 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:07.730
 list of life favorites with 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.829
 first famed economic book 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.989
 several people including the engineer 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.720
 said uefa.com is not legal about us 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.730
 Economy is the maximum, I eat everything. 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.069
 world on a list of books a thread 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.019
 waiting and then I went with names or stayed 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.790
 at the end of the track not even with prizes the 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.389
 that by law this cast had nothing 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.459
 to do there however they had a 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:32.450
 law studio was economic 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.190
 expensive can not detach from get rid of 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.600
 economic is very cool 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.660
 philosophy mix 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.390
 My friend knows how I'm going to get out of the box. 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.400
 comes to analyze socioeconomic data an 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.650
 Different way with us is cool 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.680
 because if you agree that the 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.950
 authors lack but so I think the book 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.570
 sensational 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:56.150
 the other book was indicated by a friend 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:58.430
 my forbidden top who follows them forbidden 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.230
 ended with a weekend and the 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.360
 inflating because I could not do 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.670
 Anyway, I just got beyond the drug and 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.920
 book is very little when a friend of mine 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.870
 told me to read this book touches forbidden 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.230
 of the day of the site I have a third of what 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.660
 is 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.240
 think of the Japanese underworld I said is 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:19.970
 about the Japanese underworld is about the mafia 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:21.830
 Japanese yakuza knows so I know nothing 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.320
 about healing but now the model 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:27.230
 you have not cared I was traveling 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.780
 In Japan, come and pass this book. 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.430
 on the list in front of my 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.260
 queue you know where I told you 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.840
 happened and ended the famous theory 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.150
 very cool, this author is very tiring 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.240
 The day I dance in a delicious way 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.340
 wrote while the houses so under a 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.760
 culture so different from our time 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.500
 more globalized than the world is 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.570
 and oil from within which is the American 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.000
 for many years in japan works as 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:56.120
 journalist do dominate the Japanese for 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.640
 write Japanese and that's just his case 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.940
 I find it very inspiring is it anyway 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.790
 account case isolated inside so at the same time 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.550
 time so he does not go there with 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.130
 many details it even enters into 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.450
 cultural aspects that 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.130
 Always we know very well we 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.830
 read more about other aspects of the 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.240
 really this calm so 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.480
 So it ends up being a very 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.920
 enriching is very curious to see what 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.060
 he writes about the underworld of the pony 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.920
 it's well worth it 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.920
 the third book but head to end 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:35.600
 dos off analogia robert socolowski eu 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:38.540

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.470
 college and then the thing teacher 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:44.780
 Beautiful, I thought, future. 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:47.060
 today we are like this ours is not like 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.030

 technology is not too many people is 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.620
 clear but more interesting stone had 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.260
 because I already thought I would 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.020

 boring not those three lists that he 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:15.710
 Very fast acceleration is very easy and the 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.500
 author proposed writing a book of 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.590
 philosophy in footnote 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:24.350
 O has no footer emotion notes in 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.580
 reality that this is what you mean 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.590
 economical and runs the wheel only 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.169
 I 'm simply not going to put a source 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.300

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.990
 citing one sector or another that cited 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.650
 study of the other and it turns out that I saw something 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.360
 like this 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:46.720
