00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.000 
and she she's not really very caring and
not<00:02:21.000> very<00:02:21.240> interested<00:02:22.110> in<00:02:22.170> others<00:02:22.500> needs<00:02:22.740> her

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
not very interested in others needs her

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.720 
not very interested in others needs her
I<00:02:23.430> guess<00:02:24.350> we<00:02:25.350> wanted<00:02:25.710> to<00:02:25.800> come<00:02:25.950> before<00:02:26.340> anybody

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
I guess we wanted to come before anybody

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.680 
I guess we wanted to come before anybody
else's<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:29.610> girl<00:02:29.850> is<00:02:30.000> totally<00:02:30.150> different

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
else's and the girl is totally different

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.040 
else's and the girl is totally different
so<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:30.900> think<00:02:30.960> I<00:02:31.520> heard<00:02:32.520> that<00:02:32.550> it's<00:02:33.020> not<00:02:34.020> a

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
so I think I heard that it's not a

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.870 
so I think I heard that it's not a
problem<00:02:34.290> being<00:02:34.620> accepted<00:02:37.430> like<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.520> said<00:02:38.670> it's

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
performed with her as yet you see the

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.900 
performed with her as yet you see the
music<00:03:12.140> we<00:03:12.530> haven't<00:03:12.860> heard<00:03:13.160> all<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.580> numbers

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
music we haven't heard all the numbers

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.250 
music we haven't heard all the numbers
as<00:03:14.030> yet<00:03:14.240> because<00:03:14.390> they<00:03:14.660> are<00:03:14.690> still<00:03:14.780> not<00:03:15.080> being

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
as yet because they are still not being

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.610 
as yet because they are still not being
recorded<00:03:15.590> but<00:03:16.310> I<00:03:16.670> just<00:03:17.150> heard<00:03:17.330> one<00:03:17.570> and<00:03:17.930> that's

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
recorded but I just heard one and that's

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.449 
recorded but I just heard one and that's
very<00:03:18.920> haunting<00:03:19.370> melody<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:20.230> I<00:03:21.230> can<00:03:22.070> say<00:03:22.220> that

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
very haunting melody and I can say that

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.420 
very haunting melody and I can say that
that<00:03:22.640> is<00:03:22.820> a<00:03:23.000> very<00:03:23.840> meaningful<00:03:24.110> a<00:03:24.650> little<00:03:25.160> lyric

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
that is a very meaningful a little lyric

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.290 
that is a very meaningful a little lyric
lifts<00:03:26.240> are<00:03:26.390> very<00:03:27.610> haunting<00:03:28.610> they<00:03:28.730> probably<00:03:28.970> be

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
lifts are very haunting they probably be

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.970 
lifts are very haunting they probably be
with<00:03:29.450> you<00:03:29.600> long<00:03:29.900> after<00:03:30.110> you<00:03:30.380> were<00:03:30.560> in<00:03:30.830> his<00:03:30.920> car

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
with you long after you were in his car

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.940 
with you long after you were in his car
I<00:03:31.640> just<00:03:32.209> had<00:03:32.330> one<00:03:32.510> as<00:03:32.750> yet<00:03:32.990> so<00:03:33.440> I<00:03:33.470> can't<00:03:33.800> really

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
I just had one as yet so I can't really

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.060 
I just had one as yet so I can't really
comment<00:03:34.310> I<00:03:34.670> think<00:03:35.230> it's<00:03:36.489> got<00:03:37.489> no<00:03:37.730> violence<00:03:38.239> and

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
comment I think it's got no violence and

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.890 
comment I think it's got no violence and
it's<00:03:40.070> a<00:03:40.280> except<00:03:40.880> for<00:03:41.090> but<00:03:41.300> she<00:03:41.450> walked<00:03:41.630> the

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
it's a except for but she walked the

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.420 
it's a except for but she walked the
whole<00:03:42.050> family<00:03:42.590> Carnaby<00:03:43.280> which<00:03:44.120> I<00:03:44.420> think<00:03:45.430> would

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
whole family Carnaby which I think would

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.910 
whole family Carnaby which I think would
really<00:03:46.700> go<00:03:47.360> with<00:03:47.540> all<00:03:47.780> ages<00:03:48.350> it's<00:03:48.680> not

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
really go with all ages it's not

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.260 
really go with all ages it's not
something<00:03:49.220> which<00:03:49.310> only<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:49.700> youth<00:03:49.850> will<00:03:50.090> like

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
something which only the youth will like

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.600 
something which only the youth will like
to<00:03:50.300> watch<00:03:50.570> or<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:51.110> older<00:03:51.709> generation<00:03:52.280> I<00:03:52.459> think

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
to watch or the older generation I think

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.100 
to watch or the older generation I think
everyone<00:03:53.150> can<00:03:53.180> sit<00:03:53.450> and<00:03:53.540> watch<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.870> film<00:03:54.050> and

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
everyone can sit and watch the film and

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.080 
everyone can sit and watch the film and
have<00:03:54.290> a<00:03:54.320> real<00:03:54.590> nice<00:03:54.709> time<00:03:54.770> because<00:03:55.250> it<00:03:55.370> is<00:03:55.880> one

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
have a real nice time because it is one

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.930 
have a real nice time because it is one
of<00:03:56.180> those<00:03:56.830> romantic<00:03:57.830> classics<00:03:58.520> you<00:03:58.640> know<00:03:58.700> so

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940

everyone can just sit and enjoy the film

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.290 
everyone can just sit and enjoy the film
I<00:04:00.950> would<00:04:01.850> describe<00:04:02.120> it<00:04:02.300> as<00:04:02.360> a<00:04:02.480> film<00:04:02.780> which<00:04:03.080> is<00:04:03.110> I

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
I would describe it as a film which is I

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.479 
I would describe it as a film which is I
think<00:04:05.300> they<00:04:05.570> wanted<00:04:06.050> in<00:04:06.590> today's<00:04:06.890> world<00:04:07.220> and

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
think they wanted in today's world and

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.940 
think they wanted in today's world and
apparently<00:04:08.450> as<00:04:08.720> what<00:04:09.290> we<00:04:09.440> see<00:04:09.620> from<00:04:09.769> the

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
apparently as what we see from the

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.590 
apparently as what we see from the
audience's<00:04:10.430> they'd<00:04:10.610> like<00:04:10.790> to<00:04:10.820> see<00:04:11.209> films

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
audience's they'd like to see films

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.780 
audience's they'd like to see films
which<00:04:11.750> are<00:04:11.870> soft<00:04:12.080> and<00:04:12.440> which<00:04:13.160> have<00:04:13.310> meaning<00:04:13.700> in

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
which are soft and which have meaning in

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.909 
which are soft and which have meaning in
them<00:04:14.030> and<00:04:15.280> where<00:04:16.280> the<00:04:16.780> artist<00:04:17.780> is<00:04:17.930> not<00:04:17.959> seen<00:04:18.620> as

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
them and where the artist is not seen as

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.640 
them and where the artist is not seen as
an<00:04:19.160> artist<00:04:19.519> rather<00:04:19.850> as<00:04:20.150> a<00:04:20.180> performer<00:04:20.840> I<00:04:21.169> think

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
an artist rather as a performer I think

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:22.840 
an artist rather as a performer I think
you<00:04:21.709> have<00:04:21.859> something<00:04:22.220> to<00:04:22.310> look<00:04:22.430> forward<00:04:22.669> in

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
you have something to look forward in

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.450 
you have something to look forward in
the<00:04:22.880> film<00:04:23.120> it<00:04:23.300> is<00:04:23.390> a<00:04:23.510> very<00:04:23.660> light<00:04:23.930> film<00:04:24.229> and<00:04:24.530> yet

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
the film it is a very light film and yet

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.700 
the film it is a very light film and yet
it<00:04:25.700> brings<00:04:26.030> along<00:04:26.270> with<00:04:26.510> it<00:04:26.600> a<00:04:26.630> message<00:04:27.080> of

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710
