00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
personally I still feel as if it was

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.820 
personally I still feel as if it was
just<00:01:03.270> like<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.539> friendship<00:01:03.989> thing<00:01:04.170> because<00:01:04.559> I

just like a friendship thing because I

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.550 
just like a friendship thing because I
think<00:01:05.760> they<00:01:06.119> would<00:01:06.299> have<00:01:06.390> hinted<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.290> mean<00:01:07.470> they

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
think they would have hinted I mean they

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.170 
think they would have hinted I mean they
did<00:01:07.740> hanada<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.250> little<00:01:08.640> bit<00:01:08.820> because<00:01:09.000> of

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
did hanada a little bit because of

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.200 
did hanada a little bit because of
course<00:01:09.330> they<00:01:09.420> sent<00:01:09.689> up<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:10.200> psalm<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
course they sent up a psalm a the the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.020 
course they sent up a psalm a the the
what<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.260> hell<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:17.369> nose<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.820> stuff

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
what the hell the the the nose and stuff

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.580 
what the hell the the the nose and stuff
course<00:01:18.600> I'd<00:01:18.810> heard<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.020> notes<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.350> nobody

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
course I'd heard the notes of nobody

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.530 
course I'd heard the notes of nobody
else<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:20.189> was<00:01:20.400> kind<00:01:20.610> there<00:01:20.790> but<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.330> said

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
else that was kind there but like I said

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.490 
else that was kind there but like I said
I<00:01:21.570> think<00:01:21.659> it's<00:01:21.869> more<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.229> friendship

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
I think it's more like a friendship

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.440 
I think it's more like a friendship
thing<00:01:22.710> because<00:01:23.180> first<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.270> all<00:01:24.299> they<00:01:24.420> can

thing because first of all they can
really<00:01:24.780> show<00:01:25.049> stuff<00:01:25.560> like<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.860> on

Clun because it's only young 7 and it's

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.170 
Clun because it's only young 7 and it's
like<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> UH<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.810> censorship<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:38.009> issue<00:01:38.490> kind<00:01:39.060> of

like a UH a censorship is issue kind of

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.749 
like a UH a censorship is issue kind of
in<00:01:39.270> all<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.979> so<00:01:40.979> they<00:01:41.070> can't<00:01:41.250> really<00:01:41.340> show<00:01:41.610> it

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
in all that so they can't really show it

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.999 
in all that so they can't really show it
and<00:01:41.880> that's<00:01:42.030> why<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.869> many<00:01:42.960> people<00:01:43.079> are<00:01:43.320> like

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
and that's why so many people are like

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.859 
and that's why so many people are like
wondering<00:01:44.549> whether<00:01:44.970> or<00:01:45.149> not<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.630> actually

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
wondering whether or not this actually

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.380 
wondering whether or not this actually
is<00:01:46.680> happening<00:01:47.220> because<00:01:47.369> they<00:01:48.060> don't<00:01:48.270> actually

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
is happening because they don't actually

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.539 
is happening because they don't actually
show<00:01:48.720> them<00:01:48.869> kiss<00:01:49.170> they<00:01:49.380> show<00:01:49.860> them<00:01:50.130> holding

other's eyes like you met some people

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.709 
other's eyes like you met some people

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
they're kissed and all that and if you

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.770 
they're kissed and all that and if you
actually<00:01:59.729> saw<00:01:59.969> my<00:02:00.060> live<00:02:00.240> reaction<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.600> was<00:02:00.659> like

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
actually saw my live reaction I was like

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.719 
actually saw my live reaction I was like
kids<00:02:01.079> kiss<00:02:01.439> kiss<00:02:01.799> but<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.040> was<00:02:02.250> kind<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.490> joking

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
kids kiss kiss but I was kind of joking

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.980 
kids kiss kiss but I was kind of joking
I<00:02:02.880> didn't<00:02:03.119> think<00:02:03.299> they<00:02:03.390> were<00:02:03.479> actually<00:02:03.630> going

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
I didn't think they were actually going

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.249 
I didn't think they were actually going
to<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:05.659> even<00:02:06.659> though<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:06.840> might<00:02:06.960> have<00:02:07.079> looked

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
to and even though it might have looked

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.109 
to and even though it might have looked
that<00:02:07.469> way<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.920> don't<00:02:08.250> think<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.670> was<00:02:08.819> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
that way I don't think that was the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.309 
that way I don't think that was the
meaning<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.450> feel<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.929> was<00:02:10.020> more<00:02:10.140> like

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
meaning I feel like it was more like

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.600 
meaning I feel like it was more like
they<00:02:10.800> had<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> closest

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
they had the closest

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.400 
they had the closest
quote<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.629> about

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
quote that about

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.100 
quote that about
Asami<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.430> opposes<00:02:15.120> friend<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.510> Cora<00:02:15.810> has

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
Asami is opposes friend that Cora has

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.970 
Asami is opposes friend that Cora has
and<00:02:16.470> so<00:02:16.980> she<00:02:17.280> would<00:02:17.790> rather<00:02:18.000> just<00:02:18.810> spend<00:02:19.650> time

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
and so she would rather just spend time

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.950 
and so she would rather just spend time
with<00:02:20.160> her<00:02:20.310> than<00:02:20.490> really<00:02:20.730> anybody<00:02:21.060> else<00:02:21.240> I<00:02:21.480> mean

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
with her than really anybody else I mean

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.500 
with her than really anybody else I mean
they<00:02:22.080> may<00:02:22.290> say<00:02:22.830> oh<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:23.040> know<00:02:23.430> she<00:02:23.580> likes<00:02:23.940> her<00:02:24.150> she

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
they may say oh I know she likes her she

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.000 
they may say oh I know she likes her she
likes<00:02:24.660> ooh<00:02:24.870> they're<00:02:25.080> new

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
likes ooh they're new

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.920 
likes ooh they're new
they<00:02:26.310> love<00:02:26.520> each<00:02:26.640> other<00:02:26.730> but<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.210> think<00:02:27.450> that

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
they love each other but I think that

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.590 
they love each other but I think that
it's<00:02:28.110> more<00:02:28.380> along<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.830> lines<00:02:29.040> as<00:02:29.310> that's<00:02:30.270> the

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
it's more along the lines as that's the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.330 
it's more along the lines as that's the
person<00:02:30.960> that<00:02:30.990> she<00:02:31.260> trusts<00:02:31.620> more<00:02:31.800> than<00:02:32.010> anybody

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
person that she trusts more than anybody

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.360 
person that she trusts more than anybody
else<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:32.730> she<00:02:33.230> becomes<00:02:34.230> wicked<00:02:34.620> really<00:02:34.860> really

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
else so she becomes wicked really really

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.230 
else so she becomes wicked really really
close<00:02:35.610> with<00:02:35.880> her<00:02:36.420> as<00:02:36.570> friend<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.640> they<00:02:38.640> just<00:02:38.880> I

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
reaction I was like kiss but not really

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.410 
reaction I was like kiss but not really
seriously<00:02:55.950> but<00:02:56.160> still<00:02:56.460> it<00:02:56.640> almost<00:02:56.880> seemed<00:02:57.270> as

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
seriously but still it almost seemed as

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.080 
seriously but still it almost seemed as
if<00:02:57.450> they<00:02:57.840> were<00:02:58.170> going<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.650> an<00:02:59.010> ivory<00:02:59.640> washing

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
if they were going to an ivory washing

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.480 
if they were going to an ivory washing
it<00:03:00.240> does<00:03:00.570> look<00:03:00.870> literally<00:03:01.650> like<00:03:01.830> they<00:03:02.010> were<00:03:02.070> in

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
it does look literally like they were in

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.430 
it does look literally like they were in
love<00:03:02.730> with<00:03:02.940> each<00:03:03.030> other<00:03:03.270> but<00:03:03.990> were<00:03:04.230> they

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
love with each other but were they

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.890 
love with each other but were they
actually<00:03:04.680> I<00:03:06.980> see<00:03:07.980> I<00:03:08.280> had<00:03:09.210> all<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.420> things<00:03:09.480> so

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
actually I see I had all the things so

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.630 
actually I see I had all the things so
just<00:03:10.500> because<00:03:10.740> I<00:03:10.830> don't<00:03:11.010> think<00:03:11.040> that's<00:03:11.370> where

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
just because I don't think that's where

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.370 
just because I don't think that's where
they<00:03:11.730> really<00:03:11.760> want<00:03:12.270> people<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:13.020> mean<00:03:13.260> of

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
they really want people to I mean of

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.720 
they really want people to I mean of
course<00:03:13.440> that's<00:03:13.770> what<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.100> looked<00:03:14.310> like<00:03:14.430> I

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
course that's what it looked like I

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:15.800 
course that's what it looked like I
don't<00:03:15.060> think<00:03:15.210> that's<00:03:15.330> what<00:03:15.480> they're<00:03:15.630> really

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
don't think that's what they're really

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.340 
don't think that's what they're really
going<00:03:16.080> for<00:03:16.580> but<00:03:17.580> they<00:03:18.150> made<00:03:18.360> it<00:03:18.480> looks<00:03:18.660> look

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
going for but they made it looks look

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.650 
going for but they made it looks look
exactly<00:03:19.800> like<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.220> Sue's<00:03:20.610> like<00:03:20.850> since<00:03:21.480> they

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
exactly like that Sue's like since they

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.630 
exactly like that Sue's like since they
made<00:03:21.840> it<00:03:21.930> look<00:03:22.110> so<00:03:22.530> much<00:03:22.770> as<00:03:23.070> if<00:03:23.250> that's<00:03:23.370> what

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
made it look so much as if that's what

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.950 
made it look so much as if that's what
they<00:03:23.760> were<00:03:23.820> going<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.150> do<00:03:24.300> and<00:03:24.510> then<00:03:24.600> me<00:03:24.750> that

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
they were going to do and then me that

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.510 
they were going to do and then me that
is<00:03:25.200> what<00:03:25.440> they<00:03:25.560> were<00:03:25.620> going<00:03:25.920> to<00:03:26.010> do<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:26.370> maybe

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
is what they were going to do and maybe

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.570 
is what they were going to do and maybe
I<00:03:26.640> just<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:27.620> just<00:03:28.620> thinking<00:03:29.100> complete<00:03:29.520> it

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
I just and just thinking complete it

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.820 
I just and just thinking complete it
wrong<00:03:29.790> just<00:03:29.820> because<00:03:30.420> of<00:03:30.660> its<00:03:31.230> like<00:03:31.440> a<00:03:31.470> kids

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.729 
at one moment I just I feel as if that
they<00:04:14.940> aren't<00:04:15.120> I<00:04:15.420> do<00:04:16.200> not<00:04:16.440> believe<00:04:16.680> that

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
they aren't I do not believe that

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.039 
they aren't I do not believe that
they're<00:04:17.040> gay<00:04:17.220> but<00:04:17.489> I<00:04:18.000> do<00:04:18.209> understand<00:04:18.959> where

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
they're gay but I do understand where

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.449 
they're gay but I do understand where
people<00:04:19.109> are<00:04:19.320> coming<00:04:19.380> from<00:04:19.650> but<00:04:20.010> in<00:04:20.130> my<00:04:20.310> opinion

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
I don't think that they're gay just

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.560 
I don't think that they're gay just
because<00:04:22.130> things<00:04:23.130> happen<00:04:23.310> before<00:04:23.790> May<00:04:24.210> between

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
and coral actually being kind of

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.689 
and coral actually being kind of
heartbroken<00:04:29.169> when<00:04:29.470> they<00:04:29.800> do<00:04:29.860> break<00:04:30.190> up<00:04:30.430> I

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.240 
heartbroken when they do break up I
don't<00:04:31.090> think<00:04:31.419> if<00:04:31.690> she<00:04:31.930> was<00:04:32.139> didn't<00:04:33.070> really

like<00:04:33.520> him<00:04:33.759> that<00:04:34.000> much<00:04:34.060> like<00:04:34.570> she<00:04:34.780> seemed<00:04:34.990> like

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080

she was really showed up in love and

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.659 
she was really showed up in love and
when<00:04:37.750> she<00:04:38.139> dumped<00:04:38.530> Marco<00:04:38.949> she<00:04:39.009> was<00:04:39.370> really

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
when she dumped Marco she was really

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.379 
when she dumped Marco she was really
kind<00:04:40.570> of<00:04:40.600> heartbroken<00:04:41.050> and<00:04:41.530> if<00:04:42.190> she<00:04:43.030> wasn't

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
kind of heartbroken and if she wasn't

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.420 
kind of heartbroken and if she wasn't
really<00:04:43.690> into<00:04:44.020> him<00:04:44.169> then<00:04:44.830> I<00:04:44.860> don't<00:04:45.130> feel<00:04:45.280> she

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
really into him then I don't feel she

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.930 
really into him then I don't feel she
would<00:04:45.550> have<00:04:45.639> had<00:04:45.820> that<00:04:45.970> same<00:04:46.150> reaction<00:04:46.320> so<00:04:47.320> I

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
would have had that same reaction so I

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.610 
would have had that same reaction so I
just<00:04:48.940> feel<00:04:49.150> like<00:04:49.180> honestly<00:04:49.990> in<00:04:50.050> my<00:04:50.080> opinion<00:04:50.169> I

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
just feel like honestly in my opinion I

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.740 
just feel like honestly in my opinion I
don't<00:04:50.680> think<00:04:51.009> that<00:04:51.220> the<00:04:51.340> gay<00:04:51.520> but<00:04:51.699> if<00:04:51.820> you<00:04:52.000> do
