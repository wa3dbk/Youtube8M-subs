bandits<00:00:22.740> have<00:00:22.890> generally<00:00:23.310> been<00:00:23.340> on<00:00:23.670> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
bandits have generally been on the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.040 
bandits have generally been on the
relative<00:00:24.779> easier<00:00:25.199> side<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:26.599> again<00:00:27.599> this<00:00:27.869> is

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
relative easier side and again this is

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.610 
relative easier side and again this is
about<00:00:28.529> as<00:00:28.830> easy<00:00:28.859> as<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.550> can<00:00:29.730> find<00:00:33.500> when<00:00:34.500> you

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
about as easy as I can find when you

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.270 
about as easy as I can find when you
first<00:00:34.890> get<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.190> kit<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:36.059> will<00:00:36.329> typically<00:00:37.280> more

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
first get a kit it will typically more

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.790 
first get a kit it will typically more
or<00:00:38.370> less<00:00:38.489> look<00:00:38.730> like<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.300> just<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.410> bunch<00:00:40.590> of

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
or less look like this just a bunch of

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.090 
or less look like this just a bunch of
parts<00:00:41.100> on<00:00:41.340> runner<00:00:41.790> trees<00:00:42.410> now<00:00:44.750> for<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:45.870> I'm

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
parts on runner trees now for this I'm

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.850 
parts on runner trees now for this I'm
video<00:00:47.100> I'm<00:00:47.340> basically<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.860> basically

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
video I'm basically going to basically

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.400 
video I'm basically going to basically
build<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.730> kit<00:00:50.969> over<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.480> next<00:00:51.750> series<00:00:52.260> of

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
build this kit over the next series of

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.439 
build this kit over the next series of
videos<00:00:52.699> so<00:00:53.699> let's<00:00:54.059> get<00:00:54.210> started<00:00:55.370> alright<00:00:56.449> now

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
videos so let's get started alright now

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.760 
videos so let's get started alright now
the<00:00:57.510> first<00:00:57.960> thing<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.379> want<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.590> do

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
the first thing you want to do

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.939 
the first thing you want to do
regardless<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.850> what<00:01:00.239> you're<00:01:00.420> building<00:01:00.949> no

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
regardless of what you're building no

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.119 
regardless of what you're building no
matter<00:01:02.219> how<00:01:02.750> fancy<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.809> are<00:01:03.960> with<00:01:04.320> skill

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
matter how fancy you are with skill

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.600 
matter how fancy you are with skill
level<00:01:05.519> wise<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:06.240> always<00:01:06.840> always<00:01:07.170> always<00:01:07.920> want

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
level wise you always always always want

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.270 
level wise you always always always want
to<00:01:08.700> start<00:01:09.000> by<00:01:09.240> going<00:01:09.570> over<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.860> instructions

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
to start by going over the instructions

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.520 
to start by going over the instructions
to<00:01:11.640> any<00:01:11.790> kit<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.659> want<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.930> go<00:01:13.049> through<00:01:13.320> them

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
to any kit you want to go through them

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.940 
to any kit you want to go through them
front<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.979> back<00:01:14.330> now<00:01:15.330> get<00:01:16.170> an<00:01:16.290> idea<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.710> where

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
front to back now get an idea of where

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.679 
front to back now get an idea of where
any<00:01:17.220> potential<00:01:17.729> trouble<00:01:18.119> areas<00:01:18.450> might<00:01:18.659> be

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
any potential trouble areas might be

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.140 
any potential trouble areas might be
areas<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.650> need<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.040> do<00:01:20.400> build<00:01:20.820> things<00:01:21.030> a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
areas you need to do build things a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.550 
areas you need to do build things a
little<00:01:21.240> differently<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.460> so<00:01:23.460> forth

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
little differently and so forth

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.190 
little differently and so forth
now<00:01:26.549> I've<00:01:26.729> already<00:01:26.909> basically<00:01:27.509> done<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.900> so

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
now I've already basically done this so

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.300 
now I've already basically done this so
let's<00:01:28.500> get<00:01:29.340> right<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.909> then<00:01:30.950> now<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.009> usually

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
let's get right to it then now I usually

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.080 
let's get right to it then now I usually
start<00:01:32.970> these<00:01:33.450> types<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.290> kits<00:01:34.920> with<00:01:35.579> basically

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
start these types of kits with basically

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.960 
start these types of kits with basically
by<00:01:36.659> first<00:01:37.049> building<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.890> hit<00:01:38.040> or<00:01:38.250> more<00:01:38.729> like

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
by first building the hit or more like

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.190 
by first building the hit or more like
basically<00:01:39.540> just<00:01:39.840> going<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.350> order<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:42.200> when

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
basically just going in order so when

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.670 
basically just going in order so when
you<00:01:43.320> go<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.530> cut<00:01:44.159> any<00:01:44.369> part<00:01:44.640> off<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.090> tree

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
you go to cut any part off the tree

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.289 
you go to cut any part off the tree
depending<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.860> what<00:01:47.040> type<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.220> roof<00:01:48.030> cutters

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
depending on what type of roof cutters

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.840 
depending on what type of roof cutters
you<00:01:48.360> have<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.899> I'm<00:01:49.470> gonna<00:01:49.710> be<00:01:49.829> using<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.520> flat

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
you have I I'm gonna be using the flat

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.069 
you have I I'm gonna be using the flat
type<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.659> want<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:52.310> basically<00:01:53.310> try<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.329> judge

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
type you want to basically try and judge

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.950 
type you want to basically try and judge
where<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.740> can<00:01:55.920> cut<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.090> part<00:01:57.299> off<00:01:57.479> by

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
where you can cut the part off by

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.499 
where you can cut the part off by
causing<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.829> least<00:01:59.130> damage<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.180> actual

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
causing the least damage to the actual

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.020 
causing the least damage to the actual
kit<00:02:00.689> part<00:02:00.930> now<00:02:01.740> with<00:02:01.920> these<00:02:02.040> flat<00:02:02.399> heads<00:02:02.700> you

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
kit part now with these flat heads you

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.530 
kit part now with these flat heads you
can<00:02:03.149> get<00:02:03.360> in<00:02:03.540> really<00:02:04.079> nice<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.710> close<00:02:05.149> to<00:02:06.149> the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
can get in really nice and close to the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.279 
can get in really nice and close to the
part<00:02:07.259> you're<00:02:07.439> going<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.860> cut

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
part you're going to cut

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.759 
part you're going to cut
so<00:02:09.830> you<00:02:09.890> want<00:02:10.189> to<00:02:10.250> get<00:02:10.970> in<00:02:11.150> there<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:11.629> trim<00:02:12.530> it

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
so you want to get in there and trim it

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:18.910 
so you want to get in there and trim it
just<00:02:13.629> before<00:02:14.629> the<00:02:15.040> actual<00:02:16.040> part<00:02:17.439> I'm<00:02:18.439> hit

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
just before the actual part I'm hit

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.449 
just before the actual part I'm hit
now<00:02:19.879> I'm<00:02:20.659> doing<00:02:21.049> this<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.230> little<00:02:21.680> quick<00:02:22.129> just

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
now I'm doing this a little quick just

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.740 
now I'm doing this a little quick just
that's<00:02:23.329> because<00:02:25.329> I'm<00:02:26.329> a<00:02:26.450> little<00:02:26.629> more

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
that's because I'm a little more

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.750 
that's because I'm a little more
experienced<00:02:27.290> with<00:02:27.560> this<00:02:27.799> but<00:02:28.489> yeah

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
experienced with this but yeah

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.220 
experienced with this but yeah
definitely<00:02:29.049> try<00:02:30.049> to<00:02:30.079> get<00:02:30.290> in<00:02:30.530> there<00:02:30.799> and

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
definitely try to get in there and

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.960 
definitely try to get in there and
causes<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:33.260> little<00:02:33.409> damage<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.159> part<00:02:34.370> now

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
causes a little damage to the part now

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.509 
causes a little damage to the part now
if<00:02:35.209> you<00:02:35.329> can't<00:02:35.720> easily<00:02:36.170> get<00:02:36.650> your<00:02:36.769> clippers<00:02:37.489> in

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
if you can't easily get your clippers in

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.410 
if you can't easily get your clippers in
it<00:02:38.000> it's<00:02:38.720> probably<00:02:38.870> best<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.970> clip<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.150> part

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
it it's probably best to clip the part

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.399 
it it's probably best to clip the part
further<00:02:41.930> away<00:02:42.319> so<00:02:42.620> as<00:02:43.040> that<00:02:44.140> so<00:02:45.140> that<00:02:45.290> you're

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
further away so as that so that you're

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.360 
further away so as that so that you're
not<00:02:45.530> potentially<00:02:46.220> damaging<00:02:46.609> the<00:02:47.450> part<00:02:48.370> now

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
not potentially damaging the part now

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.860 
not potentially damaging the part now
one<00:02:49.790> nice<00:02:50.060> thing<00:02:50.120> about<00:02:50.620> Bandai<00:02:51.620> kits<00:02:52.010> is<00:02:52.220> that

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
one nice thing about Bandai kits is that

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.229 
one nice thing about Bandai kits is that
it's<00:02:53.870> pretty<00:02:54.489> obvious<00:02:55.489> how<00:02:55.639> they're<00:02:55.909> supposed

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
it's pretty obvious how they're supposed

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.780 
it's pretty obvious how they're supposed
to<00:02:56.420> fit<00:02:56.569> together<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.950> typically<00:02:58.549> you<00:02:58.639> want

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
to fit together and typically you want

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.349 
to fit together and typically you want
to<00:02:58.909> well<00:02:59.450> just<00:02:59.659> snug<00:03:00.139> together<00:03:00.470> now<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:02.180> may

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
to well just snug together now you may

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:07.390 
to well just snug together now you may
have<00:03:02.420> noticed<00:03:02.510> that<00:03:02.900> I<00:03:03.379> didn't<00:03:05.889> do<00:03:06.889> any<00:03:07.099> real

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
have noticed that I didn't do any real

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.309 
have noticed that I didn't do any real
cleanup<00:03:07.849> work<00:03:08.090> and<00:03:08.420> that's<00:03:08.930> because<00:03:09.200> I'm

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
cleanup work and that's because I'm

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.710 
cleanup work and that's because I'm
gonna<00:03:09.470> be<00:03:09.620> gluing<00:03:10.400> this<00:03:10.670> part<00:03:10.940> together<00:03:11.090> first

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
gonna be gluing this part together first

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.500 
gonna be gluing this part together first
so<00:03:12.280> it's<00:03:13.280> kind<00:03:13.790> of<00:03:13.819> pointless<00:03:14.090> to<00:03:14.209> do<00:03:14.359> any

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
so it's kind of pointless to do any

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.409 
so it's kind of pointless to do any
sanding<00:03:14.780> and<00:03:15.260> finishing<00:03:15.730> stuff<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:16.940> it<00:03:17.060> if<00:03:17.299> I'm

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:17.419 
sanding and finishing stuff to it if I'm

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.229 
sanding and finishing stuff to it if I'm
just<00:03:17.780> gonna<00:03:17.930> glue<00:03:18.199> it<00:03:18.290> be<00:03:19.040> gluing<00:03:19.310> now<00:03:19.760> what

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
just gonna glue it be gluing now what

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.830 
just gonna glue it be gluing now what
I'm<00:03:20.840> using<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.319> texture<00:03:21.829> is<00:03:21.889> glue<00:03:22.160> as<00:03:22.609> I

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
I'm using the texture is glue as I

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.809 
I'm using the texture is glue as I
talked<00:03:23.840> about<00:03:24.019> earlier<00:03:24.379> so<00:03:24.560> what<00:03:25.519> you<00:03:25.609> want<00:03:25.790> to

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
talked about earlier so what you want to

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.119 
talked about earlier so what you want to
do<00:03:25.940> with<00:03:26.120> this<00:03:26.239> glue<00:03:26.599> is<00:03:26.840> run<00:03:27.440> it<00:03:27.560> around<00:03:27.680> the

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
do with this glue is run it around the

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.180 
do with this glue is run it around the
edge<00:03:28.760> of<00:03:29.299> where<00:03:29.569> the<00:03:29.859> parts<00:03:30.859> are<00:03:30.980> going<00:03:31.099> to

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
edge of where the parts are going to

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.990 
edge of where the parts are going to
meet<00:03:31.519> up<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:32.319> you<00:03:33.319> want<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.650> get<00:03:33.829> it<00:03:33.949> on<00:03:34.160> both

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
meet up and you want to get it on both

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.110 
meet up and you want to get it on both
parts<00:03:35.480> as<00:03:36.079> it<00:03:36.379> will<00:03:36.650> essentially<00:03:37.120> start

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
parts as it will essentially start

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.520 
parts as it will essentially start
eating<00:03:38.449> away<00:03:38.569> at<00:03:39.109> the<00:03:40.569> plastic<00:03:41.569> a<00:03:41.599> little<00:03:41.900> make

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
eating away at the plastic a little make

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.750 
eating away at the plastic a little make
it<00:03:42.680> sort<00:03:42.949> of<00:03:43.040> mushy<00:03:43.250> and<00:03:44.019> so<00:03:45.489> after<00:03:46.489> you<00:03:46.549> and

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
it sort of mushy and so after you and

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.729 
it sort of mushy and so after you and
with<00:03:47.180> this<00:03:47.359> stuff<00:03:47.540> it's<00:03:47.690> about<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:47.930> 20<00:03:48.379> second

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
with this stuff it's about a 20 second

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:56.710 
with this stuff it's about a 20 second
weight<00:03:49.099> and<00:03:49.810> once<00:03:52.840> it's<00:03:53.840> good<00:03:54.709> and<00:03:55.120> third<00:03:56.120> set

he'll<00:03:58.480> want<00:03:59.200> to<00:03:59.230> just<00:03:59.409> squeeze<00:03:59.980> and<00:04:00.540> try<00:04:01.540> and

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:01.719 
he'll want to just squeeze and try and

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:05.539 
he'll want to just squeeze and try and
get<00:04:01.870> them<00:04:02.549> together<00:04:03.549> as<00:04:03.849> much<00:04:04.209> as<00:04:04.269> possible<00:04:04.480> as

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
get them together as much as possible as

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.309 
get them together as much as possible as
he<00:04:06.549> may<00:04:07.000> not<00:04:07.329> be<00:04:07.510> able<00:04:07.659> to<00:04:07.750> see<00:04:07.870> on<00:04:07.959> camera

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
he may not be able to see on camera

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.099 
he may not be able to see on camera
there's<00:04:09.090> usually<00:04:10.090> like<00:04:10.420> a<00:04:10.480> sticky<00:04:11.079> residue

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
there's usually like a sticky residue

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:15.569 
there's usually like a sticky residue
around<00:04:11.620> where<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.609> seam<00:04:12.849> is<00:04:13.150> and<00:04:14.370> that's<00:04:15.370> a

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
around where the seam is and that's a

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.890 
around where the seam is and that's a
good<00:04:15.730> sign<00:04:16.030> as<00:04:16.299> it<00:04:16.479> means<00:04:16.690> the<00:04:17.049> parts<00:04:17.799> are

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
good sign as it means the parts are

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.499 
good sign as it means the parts are
getting<00:04:19.900> together<00:04:20.759> you<00:04:21.759> also<00:04:21.940> want<00:04:22.180> to<00:04:22.210> make

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:22.509 
getting together you also want to make

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:25.620 
getting together you also want to make
sure<00:04:22.539> that<00:04:22.930> any<00:04:23.800> details<00:04:24.759> do<00:04:25.000> line<00:04:25.270> up<00:04:25.479> between

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
sure that any details do line up between

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.070 
sure that any details do line up between
the<00:04:25.960> two<00:04:26.110> parts<00:04:26.940> all<00:04:27.940> right<00:04:28.060> now<00:04:28.479> set<00:04:28.930> that

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
the two parts all right now set that

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:38.310 
the two parts all right now set that
aside<00:04:29.229> and<00:04:29.740> let<00:04:30.130> it<00:04:34.289> cheer<00:04:35.289> up<00:04:35.440> all<00:04:35.710> right<00:04:37.320> I'm

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
aside and let it cheer up all right I'm

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:53.140 
aside and let it cheer up all right I'm
gonna<00:04:38.470> go<00:04:38.970> buy<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.030> part<00:04:40.720> tree<00:04:41.110> listing

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:59.360 

 yeah<00:04:56.360> yeah<00:04:57.360> also<00:04:57.900> be<00:04:58.170> careful<00:04:58.380> not<00:04:58.800> that

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
 yeah yeah also be careful not that

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.860 
 yeah yeah also be careful not that
drop<00:04:59.940> stuff<00:05:00.900> as<00:05:01.610> stuff<00:05:02.610> can<00:05:03.060> and<00:05:03.360> will<00:05:03.600> easily

drop stuff as stuff can and will easily

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.850 
drop stuff as stuff can and will easily
get<00:05:04.290> lost<00:05:04.320> and<00:05:05.160> I<00:05:05.310> can<00:05:05.550> attest<00:05:06.150> to<00:05:06.300> that<00:05:06.590> want<00:05:07.590> a

too many times unfortunately don't care

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.330 
too many times unfortunately don't care
for<00:05:15.480> parts<00:05:15.840> that<00:05:15.960> you<00:05:16.260> know<00:05:16.560> you're<00:05:16.920> not<00:05:17.100> gonna

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.480 
slightly smaller sub assemblies you
generally<00:05:24.270> it's<00:05:24.750> a<00:05:24.780> good<00:05:24.900> idea<00:05:25.170> to<00:05:25.350> give<00:05:26.340> them

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
generally it's a good idea to give them

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.480 
generally it's a good idea to give them
a<00:05:26.760> little<00:05:27.480> run<00:05:27.690> over<00:05:28.050> with<00:05:28.410> the<00:05:28.950> exacto<00:05:29.460> blade

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
a little run over with the exacto blade

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.970 
a little run over with the exacto blade
and<00:05:30.680> generally<00:05:31.680> you<00:05:32.810> see<00:05:33.810> that<00:05:34.020> generally<00:05:34.950> you

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
and generally you see that generally you

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.270 
and generally you see that generally you
want<00:05:35.250> to<00:05:35.400> just<00:05:35.640> run<00:05:36.270> your<00:05:36.420> the<00:05:36.870> blade<00:05:37.080> along

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
want to just run your the blade along

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.450 
want to just run your the blade along
any<00:05:38.280> possible<00:05:39.000> seam<00:05:39.300> lines<00:05:39.630> or<00:05:40.250> where<00:05:41.250> the

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
any possible seam lines or where the

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.540 
any possible seam lines or where the
poor<00:05:41.700> stuff<00:05:41.970> is<00:05:42.290> and<00:05:43.290> this<00:05:43.470> will<00:05:43.710> just<00:05:44.100> slowly

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
poor stuff is and this will just slowly

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.610 
poor stuff is and this will just slowly
wear<00:05:45.000> it<00:05:45.120> down<00:05:45.620> now<00:05:46.620> you<00:05:46.710> can<00:05:46.860> also<00:05:47.010> sand<00:05:47.640> it

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
wear it down now you can also sand it

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:55.460 
wear it down now you can also sand it
but<00:05:51.440> any<00:05:52.440> on<00:05:52.650> the<00:05:52.800> size<00:05:53.010> of<00:05:53.190> the<00:05:53.250> part<00:05:53.720> that<00:05:54.720> can

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
but any on the size of the part that can

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.070 
but any on the size of the part that can
essentially<00:05:56.370> be<00:05:56.580> easier<00:05:57.000> said<00:05:57.300> and<00:05:57.450> done<00:05:57.690> and

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
essentially be easier said and done and

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.370 
essentially be easier said and done and
and<00:05:59.180> just<00:06:00.180> in<00:06:00.300> general<00:06:00.390> sometimes<00:06:00.990> it's<00:06:01.200> just

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
and just in general sometimes it's just

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.590 
and just in general sometimes it's just
quicker<00:06:01.890> and<00:06:02.010> easier<00:06:02.130> you<00:06:02.820> just<00:06:03.300> use<00:06:03.480> an

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
quicker and easier you just use an

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.700 
quicker and easier you just use an
exacto<00:06:03.960> blade<00:06:04.140> to<00:06:04.680> do<00:06:05.520> it

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
exacto blade to do it

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.320 
exacto blade to do it
now<00:06:07.710> since<00:06:08.250> I'm<00:06:08.400> gluing<00:06:08.670> these<00:06:08.970> parts<00:06:09.240> I'm

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
now since I'm gluing these parts I'm

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.090 
now since I'm gluing these parts I'm
gonna<00:06:11.240> sand<00:06:12.240> them<00:06:12.480> just<00:06:13.020> or<00:06:13.200> clean<00:06:13.860> them<00:06:13.980> up

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
gonna sand them just or clean them up

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.869 
gonna sand them just or clean them up
just<00:06:14.400> yet<00:06:14.670> so<00:06:16.370> again

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:19.879 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:27.459 

cymbal<00:06:21.050> and<00:06:22.050> then<00:06:22.259> get<00:06:23.069> your<00:06:23.340> glue<00:06:23.580> and<00:06:26.180> just

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:27.469 
cymbal and then get your glue and just

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:34.960 
cymbal and then get your glue and just
get<00:06:28.469> it<00:06:28.620> in

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:34.970 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.600 

now<00:06:35.480> sometimes<00:06:36.440> it<00:06:36.560> pays<00:06:36.920> to<00:06:36.980> be<00:06:37.280> a<00:06:37.310> little

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
now sometimes it pays to be a little

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.900 
now sometimes it pays to be a little
excessive<00:06:38.030> with<00:06:38.300> this<00:06:38.480> glue<00:06:39.110> just<00:06:39.380> because<00:06:39.650> it

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:39.910 
excessive with this glue just because it

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:50.920 
excessive with this glue just because it
ensures<00:06:40.910> it<00:06:41.390> gets<00:06:41.600> in<00:06:41.780> there<00:06:41.990> nice<00:06:42.650> and<00:06:42.920> well

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:50.930 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.890 

all<00:06:51.590> right

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.100 

now<00:06:56.900> one<00:06:57.590> nice<00:06:57.830> thing<00:06:58.520> about<00:06:58.550> these<00:06:58.970> SD<00:06:59.780> kits

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.110 
now one nice thing about these SD kits

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:05.250 
now one nice thing about these SD kits
is<00:07:00.350> that<00:07:00.650> they<00:07:00.830> are<00:07:02.140> fairly<00:07:03.140> quick<00:07:03.610> build<00:07:04.610> up

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.260 
is that they are fairly quick build up

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.830 
is that they are fairly quick build up
as<00:07:06.260> already<00:07:07.250> I'm<00:07:07.490> just<00:07:07.520> about<00:07:08.060> done<00:07:08.120> with<00:07:08.690> the

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 
as already I'm just about done with the

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.200 
as already I'm just about done with the
head<00:07:09.140> part<00:07:09.590> getting<00:07:09.890> on<00:07:10.130> all<00:07:10.340> the<00:07:10.520> head<00:07:10.790> pieces

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.210 
head part getting on all the head pieces

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:17.100 
head part getting on all the head pieces
off<00:07:14.590> yeah<00:07:15.590> there<00:07:16.190> we<00:07:16.250> go

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.110 
off yeah there we go

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.720 
off yeah there we go
passing<00:07:18.110> this<00:07:18.320> parts<00:07:18.770> pretty<00:07:18.890> much<00:07:19.280> stand

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:19.730 
passing this parts pretty much stand

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.470 
passing this parts pretty much stand
alone<00:07:20.060> I'm<00:07:20.600> gonna<00:07:20.780> do<00:07:21.320> a<00:07:21.350> little<00:07:21.650> sanding<00:07:22.480> on

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:23.480 
alone I'm gonna do a little sanding on

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:35.410 
alone I'm gonna do a little sanding on
it<00:07:23.750> or<00:07:29.470> another<00:07:30.470> thing<00:07:30.710> you<00:07:31.420> want<00:07:32.420> to<00:07:34.420> prepare

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:35.420 
it or another thing you want to prepare

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.960 
it or another thing you want to prepare
in<00:07:35.570> advance<00:07:35.600> is<00:07:36.470> make<00:07:37.010> sure<00:07:37.040> you<00:07:37.310> got<00:07:37.490> all<00:07:37.760> your

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:37.970 
in advance is make sure you got all your

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:46.940 
in advance is make sure you got all your
tools<00:07:38.300> ready<00:07:38.810> to<00:07:38.960> go<00:07:39.230> right<00:07:39.560> away

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:46.950 

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:50.280 

else<00:07:47.950> you'll<00:07:48.760> just<00:07:49.120> end<00:07:49.420> up<00:07:49.570> wasting<00:07:49.810> a<00:07:50.140> little

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:50.290 
else you'll just end up wasting a little

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.070 
else you'll just end up wasting a little
time<00:07:50.410> and<00:07:51.010> nectar<00:07:51.430> think<00:07:51.850> I'm<00:07:52.030> just<00:07:52.660> about<00:07:52.780> all

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.080 
time and nectar think I'm just about all

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:58.200 
time and nectar think I'm just about all
the<00:07:53.110> time<00:07:53.260> on<00:07:53.680> this<00:07:53.890> set<00:07:54.180> so<00:07:56.760> guess<00:07:57.760> I'll<00:07:57.970> end

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:58.210 
the time on this set so guess I'll end

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:02.340 
the time on this set so guess I'll end
it<00:07:58.330> here<00:07:58.540> for<00:07:58.750> now<00:07:58.900> come<00:07:59.560> back<00:07:59.590> for<00:07:59.920> part<00:08:00.130> two
