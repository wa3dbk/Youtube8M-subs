00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
state that I am NOT an audio file so I'm

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.199 
state that I am NOT an audio file so I'm
just<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.269> basic<00:04:00.540> listener<00:04:01.260> so<00:04:01.920> I'm<00:04:02.400> not<00:04:02.970> going

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
just a basic listener so I'm not going

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.220 
just a basic listener so I'm not going
to<00:04:03.269> give<00:04:03.420> you<00:04:03.570> the<00:04:03.720> most<00:04:03.750> accurate

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
information but this is just personal

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.440 
information but this is just personal
preference<00:04:07.079> and<00:04:07.560> I<00:04:08.250> think<00:04:08.730> for<00:04:08.940> the<00:04:09.150> price<00:04:09.209> of

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
preference and I think for the price of

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.710 
preference and I think for the price of
only<00:04:09.840> 24<00:04:10.470> 99<00:04:10.980> these<00:04:11.430> things<00:04:11.760> are<00:04:12.000> excellent

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
only 24 99 these things are excellent

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.670 
only 24 99 these things are excellent
and<00:04:12.920> it's<00:04:13.920> amazing<00:04:14.430> actually<00:04:15.169> it<00:04:16.169> comes<00:04:16.350> it's

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
and it's amazing actually it comes it's

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.590 
and it's amazing actually it comes it's
very<00:04:16.950> sturdy<00:04:17.310> it's<00:04:17.640> very<00:04:17.970> nice<00:04:18.299> and

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
very sturdy it's very nice and

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.420 
very sturdy it's very nice and
especially<00:04:19.290> for<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.829> price<00:04:19.979> this<00:04:20.370> is

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
especially for the price this is

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.540 
especially for the price this is
probably<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.329> best<00:04:21.810> you<00:04:22.140> can<00:04:22.320> find<00:04:22.680> out<00:04:23.370> in

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
probably the best you can find out in

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.250 
probably the best you can find out in
the<00:04:23.640> market<00:04:24.030> right<00:04:24.120> now<00:04:24.180> well<00:04:24.780> this<00:04:24.930> is<00:04:24.960> just

the market right now well this is just
my

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
my

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.700 
my
personal<00:04:26.340> opinion<00:04:27.060> but<00:04:27.810> that's<00:04:28.050> what<00:04:28.289> I<00:04:28.319> think

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
personal opinion but that's what I think

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.520 
personal opinion but that's what I think
this<00:04:29.639> thing<00:04:29.909> does<00:04:30.180> have<00:04:30.449> my<00:04:30.629> microphone<00:04:31.319> acts

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
this thing does have my microphone acts

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.649 
this thing does have my microphone acts
like<00:04:31.860> when<00:04:32.220> you<00:04:32.669> put<00:04:32.879> it<00:04:32.970> in<00:04:33.060> your<00:04:33.180> ears<00:04:33.449> and

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:33.659 
like when you put it in your ears and

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:37.879 
like when you put it in your ears and
the<00:04:34.409> D<00:04:34.860> wires<00:04:35.099> just<00:04:35.639> move<00:04:35.940> around<00:04:36.349> you<00:04:37.349> do<00:04:37.560> here

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
the D wires just move around you do here

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.770 
the D wires just move around you do here
in<00:04:38.099> your<00:04:38.220> ears<00:04:38.460> and<00:04:38.729> it<00:04:38.819> does<00:04:39.060> get<00:04:39.419> annoying

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
in your ears and it does get annoying

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.290 
in your ears and it does get annoying
what<00:04:40.680> I<00:04:40.710> actually<00:04:40.919> do<00:04:41.340> is<00:04:41.490> I<00:04:41.610> clip<00:04:41.909> the<00:04:42.120> clip

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
what I actually do is I clip the clip

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.990 
what I actually do is I clip the clip
onto<00:04:42.659> my<00:04:43.110> shirt<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:43.860> whatnot<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:44.610> it<00:04:44.759> does

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
onto my shirt and whatnot and it does

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.240 
onto my shirt and whatnot and it does
help<00:04:45.360> with<00:04:45.509> the<00:04:45.629> low<00:04:45.810> microphone<00:04:46.349> X<00:04:46.560> and<00:04:46.770> it's

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
help with the low microphone X and it's

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.480 
help with the low microphone X and it's
it's<00:04:47.610> a<00:04:47.819> lot<00:04:48.000> better<00:04:48.240> and<00:04:48.979> another<00:04:49.979> thing<00:04:50.250> is

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
it's a lot better and another thing is

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.210 
it's a lot better and another thing is
this<00:04:50.849> this<00:04:51.389> provides<00:04:51.840> very<00:04:52.199> nice<00:04:52.500> crisp<00:04:52.949> and

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
this this provides very nice crisp and

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.330 
this this provides very nice crisp and
clear<00:04:53.639> audio<00:04:54.150> quality<00:04:54.539> um<00:04:55.110> and<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:55.800> base<00:04:56.039> is

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
clear audio quality um and the base is

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.430 
clear audio quality um and the base is
very<00:04:56.430> decent<00:04:57.180> it's<00:04:57.330> not<00:04:57.960> going<00:04:58.110> to<00:04:58.199> give<00:04:58.349> you

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
the best bass up there I've actually

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.330 
the best bass up there I've actually
heard<00:05:00.569> better<00:05:00.960> once<00:05:01.349> of<00:05:01.860> course<00:05:02.129> especially

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
heard better once of course especially

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.029 
heard better once of course especially
for<00:05:02.909> the<00:05:03.000> price<00:05:03.180> um<00:05:03.599> that<00:05:04.229> it<00:05:04.349> does<00:05:04.590> give<00:05:04.889> you

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039

crisp and clear and rich sound so these

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.649 
crisp and clear and rich sound so these
are<00:05:09.539> just<00:05:09.599> um<00:05:10.050> i<00:05:10.199> would<00:05:10.440> say<00:05:10.680> for<00:05:10.879> basic<00:05:11.879> or<00:05:12.060> I

earphones<00:05:22.440> from<00:05:23.069> the<00:05:23.250> electronics<00:05:23.940> because

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
earphones from the electronics because

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.959 
earphones from the electronics because
another<00:05:24.569> thing<00:05:24.690> is<00:05:25.050> it<00:05:25.560> doesn't<00:05:25.830> just<00:05:26.039> focus

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:26.969 
another thing is it doesn't just focus

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:29.450 
another thing is it doesn't just focus
on<00:05:27.150> one<00:05:27.629> category<00:05:28.080> for<00:05:28.620> example<00:05:29.009> it<00:05:29.099> doesn't

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
on one category for example it doesn't

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.670 
on one category for example it doesn't
just<00:05:29.520> focus<00:05:30.029> on<00:05:30.210> base<00:05:30.539> it<00:05:30.900> focuses<00:05:31.440> on

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
just focus on base it focuses on

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.519 
just focus on base it focuses on
balancing<00:05:32.460> out<00:05:32.610> the<00:05:32.639> sound<00:05:33.120> it<00:05:33.319> balances<00:05:34.319> out

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:34.529 
balancing out the sound it balances out

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:37.730 
balancing out the sound it balances out
the<00:05:34.620> base<00:05:35.219> the<00:05:35.909> crispness<00:05:36.449> and<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:37.440> richness

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
the base the crispness and the richness

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.219 
the base the crispness and the richness
of<00:05:38.190> the<00:05:38.430> audio<00:05:38.789> quality<00:05:38.819> and<00:05:39.539> it<00:05:39.630> does<00:05:39.870> provide

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
of the audio quality and it does provide

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.200 
of the audio quality and it does provide
you<00:05:40.440> with<00:05:40.650> very<00:05:40.919> nice<00:05:41.190> and<00:05:41.430> clear<00:05:41.759> audio

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
you with very nice and clear audio

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.990 
you with very nice and clear audio
quality<00:05:42.479> another<00:05:42.900> thing<00:05:43.199> is<00:05:43.229> this<00:05:43.860> does<00:05:44.550> have

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
quality another thing is this does have

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.990 
quality another thing is this does have
a<00:05:45.029> little<00:05:45.930> static<00:05:46.800> noise<00:05:47.009> when<00:05:47.460> you<00:05:47.490> put<00:05:47.849> them

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
a little static noise when you put them

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.100 
a little static noise when you put them
on<00:05:48.620> it<00:05:49.620> does<00:05:49.889> provide<00:05:50.340> noise<00:05:50.759> isolation<00:05:51.360> but

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
on it does provide noise isolation but

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.870 
on it does provide noise isolation but
when<00:05:52.259> there<00:05:52.469> is<00:05:52.560> no<00:05:52.740> music<00:05:53.159> going<00:05:53.490> on<00:05:53.610> in<00:05:53.789> the

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
when there is no music going on in the

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.459
