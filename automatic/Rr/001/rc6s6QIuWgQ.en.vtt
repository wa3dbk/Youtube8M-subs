so I went eek when he came back to Anna
came<00:01:37.250> wait<00:01:38.030> what<00:01:38.539> the<00:01:38.659> hell<00:01:38.750> says<00:01:38.960> it's<00:01:39.439> a

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
came wait what the hell says it's a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.460 
came wait what the hell says it's a
mountain<00:01:40.009> one<00:01:40.509> what<00:01:41.509> if<00:01:41.659> he<00:01:41.930> was<00:01:42.110> there<00:01:42.320> when

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
mountain one what if he was there when

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.800 
mountain one what if he was there when
he<00:01:42.590> was<00:01:42.680> not<00:01:42.890> dead<00:01:43.250> and<00:01:43.670> he<00:01:44.149> was<00:01:44.299> super

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
he was not dead and he was super

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.380 
he was not dead and he was super
scientifically<00:01:45.649> can<00:01:46.520> he<00:01:46.640> fight<00:01:46.939> one<00:01:47.210> on<00:01:47.240> one

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
scientifically can he fight one on one

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.700 
scientifically can he fight one on one
by<00:01:50.770> then<00:01:51.770> five<00:01:52.450> probably<00:01:53.450> one<00:01:53.630> on<00:01:53.780> one<00:01:53.960> and<00:01:54.259> the

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
by then five probably one on one and the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:02.730 
by then five probably one on one and the
fine<00:01:54.920> i<00:01:57.340> guess<00:01:58.340> we<00:01:58.490> will<00:01:58.579> have<00:01:58.640> to<00:01:58.880> find<00:01:59.240> out

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.340 

broadly<00:02:03.740> is<00:02:03.920> actually<00:02:04.310> stronger<00:02:04.580> than<00:02:04.990> ssha<00:02:05.990> I

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
broadly is actually stronger than ssha I

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.400 
broadly is actually stronger than ssha I
think<00:02:06.830> it's<00:02:06.920> like<00:02:07.189> 1.5<00:02:10.090> well<00:02:11.170> because<00:02:12.170> the

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
think it's like 1.5 well because the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.240 
think it's like 1.5 well because the
move<00:02:13.340> is<00:02:13.519> really<00:02:13.849> short<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.390> just<00:02:14.780> showed

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
move is really short and just showed

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.170 
move is really short and just showed
