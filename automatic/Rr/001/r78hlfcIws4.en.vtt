00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.529
 we are here in the maxi twelve hundred 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.949
 the first maxi model that was built around 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.399
 the auspices of belgium coat those two 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.290
 years back 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.540
 The brand has taken over from Sweden 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.850
 and in that regard, of course, was a moment 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.920
 wait and see what they would make of it and we 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.659
 are positively surprised because Belgium has 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.250
 certainly done justice to the name and the 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:45.250
 qualities of maxi are used to 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.410
 we said from marina port 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.600
 zelande 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.160
 with 15 to 20 knots of wind late in the day 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.480
 pulled it on 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.610
 first we have set a target late too 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.680
 still double pointing what I noticed was that 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.020
 the boat actually in 90% of the cases 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.460
 good at keeping the hand that is 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.480
 that it can be controlled with two fingers 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.820
 also high in the wind 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.820
 also as the 2022 node over dexta 

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:19.640
 below deck the boats are tightly finished 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.350
 with taste finished to us 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.819
 walk from the front to the back through the 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.859
 boat for 

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:27.500
 double cabin in the middle of the fire salon 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:29.479
 and space to sit with all and 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.539
 navigation angle comes off 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.920
 it is actually not present 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.929
 that may be due to the choice of 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.469
 owner to have a 3rd party here 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.119
 to make 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:42.009
 that is, starboard approach 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.009
 Also back is a 2 bed 

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:47.479
 if we look at the price of 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.129
 starting price of crab 200,000 euros 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.289
 we look at the result what wants through 

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:53.149
 Jansen really made this one 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.560
 The Scandinavian quality than can 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.860
 say that they are with flying colors 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.860
 successful
