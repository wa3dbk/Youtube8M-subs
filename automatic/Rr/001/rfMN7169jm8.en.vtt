00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.640
 new video today fifteenth 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.490
 2012 star band calendar day 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.650
 wars and well it's the fifteenth is coming 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.529
 to have 2012 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:22.140
 it was very useless and so yes at 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.580
 fifteenth day which is located here and so 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.390
 we will open immediately the 15th day 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.410
 it's gone for the adventurous with a 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:36.930
 bolt was waiting because it takes when 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:42.899
 same as I show what I put in 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:45.960
 a china corner it was so bad that 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.670
 so we have the double Serbian reserve which 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.190
 will belong to Darth Maul and the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:56.250
 two guns here so we said 15th 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.120
 kind and so a new figurine 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:12.990
 pretty cute had not had enough 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:16.049
 I think if I'm pretty cool 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.030
 to keep your head print the 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.460
 second had not been a very helpful in 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.979
 but they still did 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.820
 wait i'll put differently hop 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.820
 hop 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.450
 of course that did not want to focus 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.040
 thank you a head that is rather nice l 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.509
 type device in front there indeed 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.700
 a camera a little darker to the cam 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.400
 that it is really safe - because of 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.450
 lighting but it's pretty cool so 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.439
 you can either and make your eyes a 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.750
 little weird is simply 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.170
 turn your head and make eyes 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.399
 blacks but have rather well I would have 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.710
 loved making a clown 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.060
 the commanders I cross and baccarat 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.970

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.530

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.980
 people who were finally made 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.090

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.709
