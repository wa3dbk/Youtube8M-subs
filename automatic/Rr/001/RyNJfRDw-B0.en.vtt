should just be that kind of next step of

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.929 
should just be that kind of next step of
the<00:01:23.259> evolution<00:01:23.950> of<00:01:24.040> the<00:01:24.189> action<00:01:24.579> with

the evolution of the action with
conviction<00:01:25.810> we've<00:01:26.439> brought<00:01:26.770> this<00:01:27.340> new<00:01:27.670> layer

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
conviction we've brought this new layer

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.800 
conviction we've brought this new layer
of<00:01:27.909> action<00:01:30.030> stealth<00:01:31.030> games<00:01:31.270> they<00:01:31.479> can<00:01:31.659> be

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
of action stealth games they can be

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.020 
of action stealth games they can be
permissive<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:32.860> they<00:01:33.040> can<00:01:33.190> be<00:01:33.220> spectacular

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
permissive and they can be spectacular

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.330 
permissive and they can be spectacular
and<00:01:34.180> how<00:01:34.720> we<00:01:34.780> do<00:01:35.020> that<00:01:35.200> it's<00:01:35.470> by<00:01:36.070> allowing

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
and how we do that it's by allowing

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.820 
and how we do that it's by allowing
players<00:01:36.760> to<00:01:37.150> go<00:01:37.720> into<00:01:37.900> an<00:01:38.110> action<00:01:38.470> loop<00:01:38.650> and

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
players to go into an action loop and

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.590 
players to go into an action loop and
then<00:01:38.920> come<00:01:39.100> back<00:01:39.130> into<00:01:39.490> stealth<00:01:39.909> the<00:01:40.240> gameplay

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
then come back into stealth the gameplay

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.170 
then come back into stealth the gameplay
loop<00:01:40.810> that<00:01:41.380> we<00:01:41.500> have<00:01:41.650> in<00:01:41.909> spinner<00:01:42.909> cell

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180
