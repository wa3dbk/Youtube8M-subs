outdoor park flying they don't have

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.699 
outdoor park flying they don't have
autopilot<00:03:50.650> or<00:03:51.010> anything<00:03:51.370> there<00:03:51.640> you<00:03:52.480> know

you're<00:03:53.709> going<00:03:53.830> to<00:03:53.920> have<00:03:54.010> to<00:03:54.160> fly<00:03:54.400> them<00:03:54.630> but

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
you're going to have to fly them but

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.210 
you're going to have to fly them but
they're<00:03:55.780> very<00:03:55.810> very<00:03:56.290> nice<00:03:56.440> helicopters

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
they're very very nice helicopters

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.610 
they're very very nice helicopters
they're<00:03:57.400> extremely<00:03:57.910> easy<00:03:58.269> to<00:03:58.360> fly<00:03:58.660> I

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
they're extremely easy to fly I

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.009 
they're extremely easy to fly I
terrorized<00:04:00.459> everybody<00:04:01.299> in<00:04:01.600> the<00:04:01.660> warehouse

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
terrorized everybody in the warehouse

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.770 
terrorized everybody in the warehouse
with<00:04:02.320> the<00:04:02.410> coaxial<00:04:03.070> I<00:04:03.340> can<00:04:03.970> fly<00:04:04.180> it<00:04:04.239> down<00:04:04.570> the

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
with the coaxial I can fly it down the

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.630 
with the coaxial I can fly it down the
aisles<00:04:05.200> and<00:04:05.470> peer<00:04:05.709> around<00:04:05.829> the<00:04:06.100> corners<00:04:06.459> and

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
aisles and peer around the corners and

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.390 
aisles and peer around the corners and
out<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:06.910> people<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:08.470> camera<00:04:08.860> on<00:04:08.890> the<00:04:09.070> bottom

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
out the people the camera on the bottom

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.920 
out the people the camera on the bottom
you<00:04:09.459> can<00:04:09.519> angle<00:04:09.790> it<00:04:10.030> so<00:04:10.329> you<00:04:10.420> can<00:04:10.660> look<00:04:10.780> a

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
you can angle it so you can look a

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.720 
you can angle it so you can look a
little<00:04:11.049> bit<00:04:11.230> more<00:04:11.380> down<00:04:11.530> or<00:04:11.860> less<00:04:12.010> downs<00:04:12.340> okay

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
little bit more down or less downs okay

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.819 
little bit more down or less downs okay
it<00:04:12.880> really<00:04:13.150> works<00:04:13.630> very<00:04:13.930> very<00:04:14.049> well<00:04:14.320> and<00:04:14.739> this

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
it really works very very well and this

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.099 
it really works very very well and this
is<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.160> same<00:04:15.400> 5.8<00:04:16.120> back<00:04:16.329> for<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:16.660> cam<00:04:16.840> right

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
is the same 5.8 back for the cam right

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.880 
is the same 5.8 back for the cam right
right<00:04:18.419> these<00:04:19.419> are<00:04:19.780> less<00:04:19.989> expensive<00:04:20.169> because

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
right these are less expensive because

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.620 
right these are less expensive because
they<00:04:21.130> don't<00:04:21.340> have<00:04:21.430> autopilot<00:04:21.970> and<00:04:22.300> they<00:04:22.390> don't

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
they don't have autopilot and they don't

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.560 
they don't have autopilot and they don't
do<00:04:22.780> recording<00:04:23.410> right<00:04:23.800> so<00:04:24.640> these<00:04:24.910> are<00:04:25.300> about<00:04:25.450> a

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
do recording right so these are about a

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.630 
do recording right so these are about a
hundred<00:04:25.750> dollars<00:04:26.140> less<00:04:26.410> than<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:27.010> full<00:04:27.039> blown

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
hundred dollars less than the full blown

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.550 
hundred dollars less than the full blown
version<00:04:28.150> okay<00:04:28.360> and<00:04:28.690> what<00:04:28.870> kind<00:04:29.080> of<00:04:29.140> pricing

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
version okay and what kind of pricing

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.320 
version okay and what kind of pricing

the screen on the tracks right you don't
need<00:04:46.330> the<00:04:46.539> goggles<00:04:46.990> to<00:04:47.320> experience<00:04:47.800> fpv<00:04:48.340> right

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789

you can look right at the screen which

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.190 
you can look right at the screen which
is<00:04:50.530> how<00:04:50.830> I<00:04:50.860> use<00:04:51.130> it<00:04:51.280> most<00:04:51.460> of<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.669> time

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
is how I use it most of the time

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.560 
is how I use it most of the time
okay<00:04:52.500> and<00:04:52.740> it's<00:04:52.920> quite<00:04:53.130> a<00:04:53.160> challenge<00:04:53.250> you<00:04:54.090> will

even if you're an experienced pilot you

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.120 
even if you're an experienced pilot you
will<00:04:57.210> have<00:04:57.360> some<00:04:57.600> fun<00:04:57.840> kind<00:04:58.290> of<00:04:58.410> learning<00:04:58.740> how

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
will have some fun kind of learning how

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.000 
will have some fun kind of learning how
fpv<00:04:59.730> works<00:05:00.030> but<00:05:00.870> instead<00:05:01.200> of<00:05:01.350> crashing<00:05:01.920> a

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
fpv works but instead of crashing a

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.980 
fpv works but instead of crashing a
two-thousand-dollar<00:05:02.640> system<00:05:03.240> you're<00:05:03.960> going

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
two-thousand-dollar system you're going

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.060 
two-thousand-dollar system you're going
to<00:05:04.260> experiment<00:05:04.920> with<00:05:04.950> a

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
to experiment with a

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.620 
to experiment with a
three-hundred-dollar<00:05:05.760> system<00:05:06.240> which<00:05:06.420> we

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
three-hundred-dollar system which we

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.330 
three-hundred-dollar system which we
carry<00:05:06.900> all<00:05:07.080> the<00:05:07.230> parts<00:05:07.260> for<00:05:07.710> it<00:05:07.740> okay<00:05:08.070> and

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
carry all the parts for it okay and

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.610 
carry all the parts for it okay and
these<00:05:08.490> are<00:05:08.550> Park<00:05:09.360> Flyers<00:05:09.750> so<00:05:10.110> if<00:05:10.230> you<00:05:10.350> kind<00:05:10.500> of

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
these are Park Flyers so if you kind of

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.750 
these are Park Flyers so if you kind of
get<00:05:10.710> disordered<00:05:11.130> on<00:05:11.250> the<00:05:11.340> screen<00:05:11.610> you<00:05:11.640> should

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
get disordered on the screen you should

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.610 
get disordered on the screen you should
be<00:05:12.150> able<00:05:12.240> to<00:05:12.360> look<00:05:12.450> up<00:05:12.600> to<00:05:12.720> see<00:05:12.870> why<00:05:13.110> if<00:05:13.500> you're

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
be able to look up to see why if you're

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.900 
be able to look up to see why if you're
using<00:05:13.830> the<00:05:14.010> goggles<00:05:14.400> you<00:05:14.520> should<00:05:14.670> always<00:05:14.790> use

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
using the goggles you should always use

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.600 
using the goggles you should always use
spotter<00:05:15.330> of<00:05:15.510> course<00:05:15.750> right<00:05:16.080> a<00:05:16.410> nice<00:05:17.190> thing<00:05:17.490> I'd

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
spotter of course right a nice thing I'd

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.190 
spotter of course right a nice thing I'd
like<00:05:17.640> to<00:05:17.820> point<00:05:17.940> out<00:05:18.300> on<00:05:18.510> the<00:05:18.630> helicopters

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
like to point out on the helicopters

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.350 
like to point out on the helicopters
they're<00:05:19.440> very<00:05:19.770> very<00:05:20.010> well-made<00:05:20.580> forget<00:05:21.180> that

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
they're very very well-made forget that

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.090 
they're very very well-made forget that
they're<00:05:21.480> fpv<00:05:21.990> for<00:05:22.260> a<00:05:22.290> moment<00:05:22.470> they<00:05:22.950> have

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
they're fpv for a moment they have

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.150 
they're fpv for a moment they have
machine<00:05:23.910> swashplate<00:05:24.360> machined<00:05:25.320> rotor<00:05:25.710> head
