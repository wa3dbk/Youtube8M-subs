00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.510
 your recipe for something amazing i 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:18.730
 already tried it on many of my friends 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.980
 not raw foodists their parents and they were all 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.810
 delighted but how can you not be delighted 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.599
 I cooked a cheesecake from the area 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.490
 resist is simply impossible but not necessary 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.470
 because this dessert is not enough 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.720
 contains sugar he made from living 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.020
 products therefore in addition to taste 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.520
 also useful and the taste he think for yourself 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.520
 cranberry mix 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.110
 lemon honey and coconut it is so 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.450
 amazing combination of what he wants 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:48.450
 roll tongue again and again for 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:54.150
 preparations we need dates honey 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:57.660
 cranberries I bought frozen cashew lemon 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:00.850
 coconut chips and vanilla pod 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.820
 He looks like an extremely ordinary one, but 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:07.149
 its fragrance will determine our appearance 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.000
 cheesecake so every decent cheesecake 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:10.570
 the seams are not made of shortcake and filling for 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.850
 shortcake 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.850
 we take a blender and load nuts into it 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.380
 peeled finely chopped lemon 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.380
 vanilla pod 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:39.770
 coconut chips and of course honey 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:02:06.250
 Now let's try to beat it by the way in 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.410
 the resulting dough can be added finely 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.050
 sliced â€‹â€‹seem like lemon for more 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.760
 pronounced lemon flavor 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.320
 but after everything is ready we must 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.980
 decide what our cheesecake will be 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.420
 big round or portioned as 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.420
 I have awesome 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:27.160
 molds will that my cheesecake 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:31.000
 Small and our task lay out now 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:35.980
 dough and leave a little space for 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.190
 future cream as the cream is planned 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.060
 I purchased a lot of cranberries with a bang and then 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.060
 leave more 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.660
 now proceed to the cream blender by the way 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.260
 you can not wash after the test a little bit 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.740
 lemon in the cream does not hurt us 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.740
 laying the crook 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.380
 dates 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:25.810
 and honey since cranberries are sour I think to us 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:36.370
 need a spoon 3 not less now 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:40.800
 already known scheme whip and after 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.800
 finishing the cream in molds 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.320
 well or if you make one big 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.680
 cheesecake then pour on top of the cake with 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.680
 dough 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:06.810
 Well, according to the good old tradition 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.810
 decorate i use coconut chips and 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.109
 Malinku seems to me a great combination with 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.109
 cranberry sauce 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:26.460
 but you can of course choose your 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:27.990
 decoration is very important after 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.790
 cooking supplies 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.889
 the fridge then it freezes 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.610
 it can be removed from the form without 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:37.410
 fears that it will spread after that 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.000
 You could be visiting friends and amaze 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.760
