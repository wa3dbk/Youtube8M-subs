00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.070 
to to set your makeup so it just made me
look<00:02:48.269> just<00:02:48.690> way<00:02:49.140> more<00:02:49.170> matte<00:02:49.790> which<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:50.970> like

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.650 

I found<00:02:54.470> it<00:02:54.740> to<00:02:54.920> be<00:02:55.130> a<00:02:55.340> great<00:02:55.790> powder<00:02:56.180> it<00:02:56.630> does

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
I found it to be a great powder it does

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.880 
I found it to be a great powder it does
what<00:02:57.080> it<00:02:57.230> says

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
what it says

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.560 
what it says
and<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.460> think<00:02:58.700> it's<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:58.910> great<00:02:59.150> combination

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
and I think it's a great combination

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.430 
and I think it's a great combination
with<00:03:00.140> my<00:03:00.410> HD<00:03:01.160> foundation<00:03:01.520> I<00:03:02.300> also<00:03:02.870> like<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.290> use

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
with my HD foundation I also like to use

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.100 
with my HD foundation I also like to use
it<00:03:03.650> with<00:03:03.980> without<00:03:04.280> any<00:03:04.730> makeup<00:03:04.970> on<00:03:05.330> as<00:03:05.510> well<00:03:05.780> I

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
it with without any makeup on as well I

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.860 
it with without any makeup on as well I
feel<00:03:06.710> like<00:03:06.770> it<00:03:07.190> really<00:03:07.520> relaxes<00:03:08.270> any<00:03:08.540> lines

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
feel like it really relaxes any lines

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.020 
feel like it really relaxes any lines
that<00:03:09.020> you<00:03:09.230> have<00:03:09.260> on<00:03:09.590> your<00:03:09.710> face<00:03:09.920> it<00:03:10.610> gives<00:03:10.880> you

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
that you have on your face it gives you

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.990 
that you have on your face it gives you
more<00:03:11.240> of<00:03:11.390> a<00:03:11.480> relaxed<00:03:11.950> look<00:03:12.950> it's<00:03:13.700> also

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
more of a relaxed look it's also

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.630 
more of a relaxed look it's also
enriched<00:03:14.840> with<00:03:16.240> collagen<00:03:17.240> and<00:03:17.840> all<00:03:18.290> these

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
enriched with collagen and all these

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.460 
enriched with collagen and all these
antioxidant<00:03:19.640> vitamins<00:03:20.270> that<00:03:20.870> you<00:03:21.020> would<00:03:21.230> get

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
antioxidant vitamins that you would get

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.150 
antioxidant vitamins that you would get
from<00:03:22.090> say<00:03:23.090> a<00:03:23.360> night<00:03:23.660> cream<00:03:23.990> so<00:03:24.320> I<00:03:24.350> really<00:03:24.980> like

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
from say a night cream so I really like

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.240 
from say a night cream so I really like
the<00:03:25.340> oil<00:03:25.370> control<00:03:26.000> on<00:03:26.330> this<00:03:26.570> product<00:03:27.220> you<00:03:28.220> I

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
the oil control on this product you I

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.550 
the oil control on this product you I
feel<00:03:28.700> like<00:03:28.850> you<00:03:29.000> have<00:03:29.240> to<00:03:29.270> retouch<00:03:29.990> throughout

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
feel like you have to retouch throughout

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.380 
feel like you have to retouch throughout
the<00:03:30.800> middle<00:03:31.040> of<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.280> day<00:03:31.460> or<00:03:31.700> towards<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.209> end

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
the middle of the day or towards the end

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.470 
the middle of the day or towards the end
of<00:03:32.660> your<00:03:32.810> day<00:03:33.080> but<00:03:33.650> that's<00:03:33.860> great<00:03:34.130> and<00:03:34.490> it

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
of your day but that's great and it

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.630 
of your day but that's great and it
absorbs<00:03:36.100> the<00:03:37.100> oil<00:03:37.420> so<00:03:38.420> I<00:03:38.450> like<00:03:38.810> it<00:03:39.250> alone<00:03:40.250> as

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
absorbs the oil so I like it alone as

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.730 
absorbs the oil so I like it alone as
well<00:03:40.880> without<00:03:41.209> any<00:03:41.420> foundation<00:03:41.660> I<00:03:42.410> think<00:03:42.440> the

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
well without any foundation I think the

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.370 
well without any foundation I think the
best<00:03:42.950> part<00:03:43.310> of<00:03:43.430> all<00:03:43.610> is<00:03:44.030> it<00:03:44.450> does<00:03:44.660> it<00:03:44.690> shrinks

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
best part of all is it does it shrinks

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.520 
best part of all is it does it shrinks
your<00:03:45.980> pores<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:46.640> minimizes<00:03:47.270> them<00:03:47.510> they<00:03:48.260> look

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
your pores and minimizes them they look

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.240 
your pores and minimizes them they look
way<00:03:49.040> smaller<00:03:49.459> it<00:03:49.910> gives<00:03:50.150> you<00:03:51.010> basically<00:03:52.010> an

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
way smaller it gives you basically an

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.910 
way smaller it gives you basically an
airbrush<00:03:52.910> finish<00:03:53.450> which<00:03:53.810> I<00:03:54.020> like<00:03:54.320> a<00:03:54.560> main

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
airbrush finish which I like a main

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.060 
airbrush finish which I like a main
reason<00:03:55.160> why<00:03:55.640> I<00:03:55.670> never<00:03:56.450> liked<00:03:56.780> loose<00:03:57.440> powders

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
reason why I never liked loose powders

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.000 
reason why I never liked loose powders
is<00:03:58.340> because<00:03:58.700> they're<00:03:58.880> loose<00:03:59.150> and<00:03:59.800> they<00:04:00.800> get

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
is because they're loose and they get

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.949 
is because they're loose and they get
all<00:04:01.100> over<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:01.400> place<00:04:01.519> but<00:04:02.120> this<00:04:02.330> powder<00:04:02.630> is

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
all over the place but this powder is

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.710 
all over the place but this powder is
just<00:04:03.769> so<00:04:04.070> much<00:04:04.310> worth<00:04:04.730> it<00:04:05.000> because<00:04:05.330> it's

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
just so much worth it because it's

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.590 
just so much worth it because it's
illuminating<00:04:06.410> me<00:04:06.560> putting<00:04:07.130> any<00:04:07.940> additional

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
illuminating me putting any additional

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.350 
illuminating me putting any additional
products<00:04:09.050> on<00:04:09.260> my<00:04:09.470> face<00:04:09.739> like<00:04:10.360> pore

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
products on my face like pore

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.420 
products on my face like pore
minimizer's<00:04:12.050> if<00:04:12.260> I<00:04:12.350> don't<00:04:12.530> have<00:04:12.650> it<00:04:12.800> if<00:04:13.100> I

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
minimizer's if I don't have it if I

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.400 
minimizer's if I don't have it if I
don't<00:04:13.580> have<00:04:13.670> time<00:04:13.910> to<00:04:14.239> and<00:04:14.600> it's<00:04:15.140> also

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
don't have time to and it's also

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.530 
don't have time to and it's also
eliminating<00:04:16.250> me<00:04:16.489> from<00:04:16.790> putting<00:04:16.940> any<00:04:17.150> creams

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
eliminating me from putting any creams

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.930 
eliminating me from putting any creams
or<00:04:18.080> anything<00:04:18.560> additional<00:04:19.489> that<00:04:19.760> will

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
or anything additional that will

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.480 
or anything additional that will
minimize<00:04:20.180> my<00:04:20.720> pores<00:04:21.080> the<00:04:21.650> only<00:04:21.950> thing<00:04:22.160> I<00:04:22.280> can

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
minimize my pores the only thing I can

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.190 
minimize my pores the only thing I can
say<00:04:22.850> that<00:04:23.330> my<00:04:24.340> books<00:04:25.340> on<00:04:25.580> people<00:04:25.940> about<00:04:26.450> it<00:04:26.750> is

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
say that my books on people about it is

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.670 
say that my books on people about it is
it<00:04:27.680> has<00:04:27.919> a<00:04:27.950> strong<00:04:28.150> matte<00:04:29.150> finish<00:04:29.870> so<00:04:30.560> you

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
it has a strong matte finish so you

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.740 
it has a strong matte finish so you
don't<00:04:30.830> want<00:04:30.950> to<00:04:31.040> look<00:04:31.190> too<00:04:31.520> dull<00:04:32.210> so<00:04:32.570> that's

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
don't want to look too dull so that's

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.300 
don't want to look too dull so that's
why<00:04:32.870> I<00:04:32.930> like<00:04:33.050> applying<00:04:33.410> it<00:04:33.620> on<00:04:33.800> my<00:04:33.830> t-zone

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
why I like applying it on my t-zone

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.340 
why I like applying it on my t-zone
sometimes<00:04:35.090> I'll<00:04:35.240> apply<00:04:35.540> it<00:04:35.570> everywhere<00:04:35.930> and

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
sometimes I'll apply it everywhere and

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.230 
sometimes I'll apply it everywhere and
then<00:04:37.010> just<00:04:37.430> add<00:04:37.820> a<00:04:37.880> highlighter<00:04:39.040> or<00:04:40.240> a

shimmery glowy blush to live in my look
out<00:04:46.970> a<00:04:47.030> little<00:04:47.390> bit<00:04:47.630> it's<00:04:47.990> also<00:04:48.140> ideal<00:04:48.470> for<00:04:48.770> all

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
out a little bit it's also ideal for all

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.900 
out a little bit it's also ideal for all

skin types and even sensitive skin and

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.880 
skin types and even sensitive skin and
the<00:04:52.910> great<00:04:53.150> thing<00:04:53.419> is<00:04:53.450> if<00:04:53.990> you<00:04:54.140> have<00:04:54.380> more

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
the great thing is if you have more

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.250 
the great thing is if you have more
mature<00:04:55.010> skin<00:04:55.550> you<00:04:56.270> can<00:04:56.419> benefit<00:04:56.870> from<00:04:56.930> it

mature skin you can benefit from it

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.180 
mature skin you can benefit from it
