00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.890 
the revolutions for a minute
and<00:02:09.360> we<00:02:09.929> have<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.940> Fahrenheit<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.239> can't

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
and we have this in Fahrenheit you can't

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.149 
and we have this in Fahrenheit you can't
see<00:02:13.110> it's<00:02:13.290> right<00:02:13.500> there

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:19.159 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:21.559 

as<00:02:20.159> you<00:02:20.370> can<00:02:20.459> see<00:02:20.639> I've<00:02:20.790> cleared<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.180> memory

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
as you can see I've cleared the memory

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.800 
as you can see I've cleared the memory
so<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:22.019> has<00:02:22.200> no<00:02:22.499> running<00:02:22.950> memory<00:02:23.310> on<00:02:23.489> it<00:02:23.810> it's

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
so it has no running memory on it it's

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.119 
so it has no running memory on it it's
had<00:02:25.340> 293<00:02:26.340> miles<00:02:26.549> on<00:02:26.879> it<00:02:28.939> I'm<00:02:29.939> not<00:02:29.999> sure<00:02:30.239> if<00:02:30.840> that

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
had 293 miles on it I'm not sure if that

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.309 
had 293 miles on it I'm not sure if that
you<00:02:32.129> know<00:02:32.280> I'm<00:02:33.239> not<00:02:33.450> sure<00:02:33.750> if<00:02:33.900> that's<00:02:34.109> actually

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
you know I'm not sure if that's actually

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.240 
you know I'm not sure if that's actually
mouth

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250

I<00:02:35.280> couldn't<00:02:36.290> kind<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:37.379> hard<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.739> believe<00:02:37.939> that

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
I couldn't kind of hard to believe that

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:41.690 
I couldn't kind of hard to believe that
this<00:02:39.180> thing<00:02:39.239> has<00:02:39.620> 293<00:02:40.620> miles<00:02:40.859> on<00:02:41.129> it<00:02:41.159> but<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.549> is

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
this thing has 293 miles on it but it is

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.789 
this thing has 293 miles on it but it is
a<00:02:41.730> little<00:02:42.000> old<00:02:42.299> so<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.810> just<00:02:43.200> believe<00:02:43.499> it<00:02:43.620> for

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
a little old so I just believe it for

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:44.119 
a little old so I just believe it for
now

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
now

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.319 
now
as<00:02:44.209> a<00:02:45.209> gear<00:02:45.510> collaboration<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:47.459> alarm<00:02:47.790> system

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
as a gear collaboration the alarm system

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.929 
as a gear collaboration the alarm system
as<00:02:49.189> the<00:02:50.189> shift<00:02:50.489> light<00:02:50.819> up<00:02:51.150> here<00:02:51.629> green<00:02:52.169> Delta

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:52.939 
as the shift light up here green Delta

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:57.970 
as the shift light up here green Delta
played<00:02:53.939> a<00:02:53.969> shift<00:02:54.359> at<00:02:54.569> 7,000<00:02:55.349> rpms<00:02:55.769> and<00:02:56.129> so<00:02:57.120> on

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
played a shift at 7,000 rpms and so on

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.339 
played a shift at 7,000 rpms and so on
and<00:02:58.980> then<00:02:59.129> once<00:02:59.489> you<00:02:59.669> get<00:02:59.819> going<00:03:00.359> the<00:03:01.109> lights

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
and then once you get going the lights

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.920 
and then once you get going the lights
change<00:03:01.769> from<00:03:02.129> green<00:03:02.189> to<00:03:02.430> orange<00:03:02.549> and<00:03:03.090> then<00:03:03.629> to

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
change from green to orange and then to

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.740 
change from green to orange and then to
red<00:03:04.199> as<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:05.250> get<00:03:05.430> hiring<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.389> RPM<00:03:07.129> and<00:03:08.389> as<00:03:09.389> you

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
red as you get hiring the RPM and as you

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.300 
red as you get hiring the RPM and as you
can<00:03:09.870> see<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.980> very<00:03:11.219> highest<00:03:11.819> rpm<00:03:12.980> to<00:03:13.980> shift

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
can see the very highest rpm to shift

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.439 
can see the very highest rpm to shift
and<00:03:14.699> the<00:03:15.090> sixth<00:03:15.480> gear<00:03:15.689> is<00:03:15.930> 12,000<00:03:16.879> the<00:03:17.879> actual

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
and the sixth gear is 12,000 the actual

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:30.349 
and the sixth gear is 12,000 the actual
rpm<00:03:18.750> on<00:03:19.739> this<00:03:23.959> goes<00:03:24.959> up<00:03:25.259> to<00:03:25.560> 16<00:03:28.549> which<00:03:29.549> is<00:03:29.579> 16

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
rpm on this goes up to 16 which is 16

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.360 
rpm on this goes up to 16 which is 16
thousand<00:03:30.810> rpm<00:03:31.229> and<00:03:31.470> that<00:03:31.889> can<00:03:32.129> actually

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
thousand rpm and that can actually

which<00:03:37.439> is<00:03:37.560> pretty<00:03:37.829> fast<00:03:38.129> it's<00:03:39.090> got<00:03:39.269> a<00:03:39.299> top

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
which is pretty fast it's got a top

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.069 
which is pretty fast it's got a top
speed<00:03:39.900> of<00:03:39.930> 130<00:03:40.470> if<00:03:40.919> I<00:03:41.040> geared<00:03:41.340> it<00:03:41.489> forth<00:03:42.079> here's

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079

that's<00:05:08.820> actually<00:05:09.690> two<00:05:10.650> and<00:05:11.580> a<00:05:11.700> half<00:05:11.880> gallons

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
that's actually two and a half gallons

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.750 
that's actually two and a half gallons
of<00:05:12.450> fuel<00:05:12.630> which<00:05:13.590> you<00:05:13.740> can<00:05:13.890> see<00:05:14.100> it<00:05:14.220> barely<00:05:14.700> even

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
of fuel which you can see it barely even

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.140 
of fuel which you can see it barely even
fills<00:05:15.150> the<00:05:15.330> bottom<00:05:15.920> because<00:05:16.920> up<00:05:17.250> here<00:05:17.760> is<00:05:17.940> the

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
fills the bottom because up here is the

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.390 
fills the bottom because up here is the
very<00:05:18.360> top<00:05:18.630> and<00:05:19.110> then<00:05:19.320> you<00:05:19.470> can<00:05:19.650> just<00:05:19.860> see<00:05:20.100> over

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
very top and then you can just see over

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.260 
very top and then you can just see over
white<00:05:20.610> is<00:05:20.910> the<00:05:21.570> empty<00:05:22.260> space<00:05:22.730> so<00:05:23.730> I'm<00:05:23.820> guessing

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
white is the empty space so I'm guessing

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.750 
white is the empty space so I'm guessing
this<00:05:24.450> could<00:05:24.840> hold<00:05:25.080> up<00:05:25.260> to<00:05:25.290> anywhere<00:05:26.130> from<00:05:26.340> 10

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
this could hold up to anywhere from 10

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:35.270 
this could hold up to anywhere from 10
to<00:05:27.060> 12<00:05:27.330> gallons<00:05:27.870> of<00:05:27.990> gas<00:05:30.050> I'm<00:05:32.930> five-eleven<00:05:34.280> 6

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
to 12 gallons of gas I'm five-eleven 6

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.340 
to 12 gallons of gas I'm five-eleven 6
feet<00:05:35.520> somewhere<00:05:35.970> around<00:05:36.030> there<00:05:36.360> so<00:05:37.170> as<00:05:37.230> you

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
feet somewhere around there so as you

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.700 
feet somewhere around there so as you
can<00:05:37.470> see<00:05:37.820> it<00:05:38.820> fits<00:05:39.330> me<00:05:39.690> pretty<00:05:40.050> well<00:05:40.290> with

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
can see it fits me pretty well with

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.550 
can see it fits me pretty well with
extended<00:05:41.400> porch<00:05:41.700> to<00:05:42.360> actually<00:05:42.750> 80<00:05:43.020> inches

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
extended porch to actually 80 inches

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.390 
extended porch to actually 80 inches
just<00:05:44.280> for<00:05:44.520> extra<00:05:44.730> legroom<00:05:45.110> as<00:05:46.110> you<00:05:46.980> can<00:05:47.160> see

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
just for extra legroom as you can see

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.500 
just for extra legroom as you can see
there<00:05:48.000> is<00:05:48.120> my<00:05:48.330> better<00:05:48.570> side<00:05:49.130> so<00:05:50.130> we<00:05:51.030> got<00:05:51.210> that

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
there is my better side so we got that

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:58.490 
there is my better side so we got that
much<00:05:51.750> space<00:05:52.110> snug<00:05:52.919> fit<00:05:54.110> onboard<00:05:55.110> system<00:05:57.500> you

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
much space snug fit onboard system you

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.590 
much space snug fit onboard system you
can<00:05:58.740> turn<00:05:59.340> the<00:05:59.460> night<00:05:59.669> vision<00:06:00.030> on<00:06:00.180> which

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
can turn the night vision on which

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.409 
can turn the night vision on which
actually<00:06:00.930> just<00:06:01.880> activates<00:06:02.880> a<00:06:03.060> light<00:06:03.210> you

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
actually just activates a light you

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:06.880 
actually just activates a light you
can't<00:06:03.690> really<00:06:03.930> tell<00:06:04.260> the<00:06:04.290> difference<00:06:05.660> and

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.890 
can't really tell the difference and

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:12.770 
can't really tell the difference and
then<00:06:07.890> in<00:06:08.310> clear<00:06:08.760> the<00:06:09.000> test<00:06:09.300> data<00:06:11.419> I'm<00:06:12.419> not<00:06:12.570> sure

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
then in clear the test data I'm not sure

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.270 
then in clear the test data I'm not sure
what<00:06:12.930> that<00:06:12.960> means<00:06:14.750> it<00:06:15.750> also<00:06:15.990> keeps<00:06:16.980> a<00:06:17.160> lot

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
what that means it also keeps a lot
