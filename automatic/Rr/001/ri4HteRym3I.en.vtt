bigger than before like bigger than me

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.790 
bigger than before like bigger than me
tow<00:03:24.250> mater<00:03:24.489> but<00:03:25.420> not<00:03:25.540> just<00:03:25.810> that<00:03:25.930> I<00:03:26.290> mean<00:03:26.650> the

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
tow mater but not just that I mean the

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
tow mater but not just that I mean the
Haut<00:03:26.980> or<00:03:27.250> do<00:03:27.580> they<00:03:27.880> become<00:03:28.320> smaller<00:03:29.320> and<00:03:29.820> then

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
Haut or do they become smaller and then

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.340 
Haut or do they become smaller and then
in<00:03:31.239> 2006<00:03:32.080> they<00:03:32.650> go<00:03:32.860> even<00:03:33.220> bigger<00:03:33.670> than<00:03:34.320> for<00:03:35.320> the

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
in 2006 they go even bigger than for the

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.539 
in 2006 they go even bigger than for the
uh<00:03:35.880> um<00:03:37.260> pretty<00:03:38.260> tight<00:03:38.620> end<00:03:38.799> to<00:03:38.920> go<00:03:39.040> even<00:03:39.190> bigger

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
uh um pretty tight end to go even bigger

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.350 
uh um pretty tight end to go even bigger
and<00:03:40.000> then<00:03:41.010> for<00:03:42.010> a<00:03:42.040> card<00:03:42.370> is<00:03:42.610> dragging<00:03:43.120> it<00:03:43.209> goes

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
and then for a card is dragging it goes

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.229 
and then for a card is dragging it goes
even<00:03:43.510> bigger<00:03:43.989> huge<00:03:45.660> it's<00:03:46.660> like<00:03:46.750> really<00:03:47.110> cool

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
even bigger huge it's like really cool
