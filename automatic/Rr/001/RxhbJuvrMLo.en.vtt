i'm<00:03:16.320> in<00:03:16.410> PvE<00:03:16.710> perfect<00:03:17.640> balance<00:03:17.790> really<00:03:18.330> helps

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
i'm in PvE perfect balance really helps

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.270 
i'm in PvE perfect balance really helps
with<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.720> recoil<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:19.380> when<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.100> combine

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
with the recoil and when you combine

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.910 
with the recoil and when you combine
perfect<00:03:20.910> balance<00:03:21.090> with<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.930> shore<00:03:22.410> shot<00:03:22.590> is

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
perfect balance with the shore shot is

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.310 
perfect balance with the shore shot is
which<00:03:23.130> gives<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:23.490> more<00:03:23.670> target<00:03:24.030> acquisition

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
which gives you more target acquisition

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.570 
which gives you more target acquisition
