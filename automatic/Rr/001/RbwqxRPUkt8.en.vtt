to show you how to do the figure 8 this

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.490 
to show you how to do the figure 8 this
time<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.570> figure<00:00:21.810> eight<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:21.960> basically<00:00:22.470> i

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
time so the figure eight is basically i

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.750 
time so the figure eight is basically i
want<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.920> think<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.310> figure<00:00:23.580> eight

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
want you to think that the figure eight

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.650 
want you to think that the figure eight
is<00:00:24.600> actually<00:00:25.470> parallel<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:27.240> wall<00:00:27.449> in

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
is actually parallel to the wall in

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.540 
is actually parallel to the wall in
front<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.740> whatever<00:00:28.949> why<00:00:29.279> I'm<00:00:29.340> right

front of you so whatever why I'm right
in<00:00:29.820> front<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.179> draw<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> figure<00:00:30.960> eight

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
in front of you draw a figure eight

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.410 
in front of you draw a figure eight
going<00:00:31.619> down<00:00:31.949> like<00:00:32.399> they're<00:00:32.640> not<00:00:32.759> asleep<00:00:33.149> in

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
going down like they're not asleep in

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.970 
going down like they're not asleep in
figure<00:00:33.690> eight<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:34.110> like<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.320> call<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.739> sleep

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
figure eight I like to call that I sleep

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.770 
figure eight I like to call that I sleep
your<00:00:35.160> finger<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.480> one<00:00:36.600> that's

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
your finger in it so the one that's

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.479 
your finger in it so the one that's
almost<00:00:37.320> out<00:00:37.530> now<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.890> can<00:00:38.040> number<00:00:38.219> eight

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
almost out now that can number eight

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.830 
almost out now that can number eight
we're<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:38.850> close<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.120> office<00:00:39.239> degrees<00:00:39.690> down

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
we're so close the office degrees down

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.630 
we're so close the office degrees down
now<00:00:40.230> more<00:00:40.500> like<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> surfer<00:00:40.920> on<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.250> left<00:00:41.460> and

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
now more like a surfer on the left and

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.549 
now more like a surfer on the left and
circle<00:00:41.790> on<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.149> right<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:42.840> that's<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.079> sleepy

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
circle on the right so that's a sleepy

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.639 
circle on the right so that's a sleepy
grades<00:00:43.800> okay<00:00:44.219> so<00:00:44.789> draw<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.930> front<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.289> you

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
grades okay so draw that in front of you

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.830 
grades okay so draw that in front of you
the<00:00:46.950> wall<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.309> front<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.059> then<00:00:48.120> try<00:00:48.809> to

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
the wall in front of you and then try to

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.479 
the wall in front of you and then try to
draw<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.260> with<00:00:49.379> your<00:00:49.530> hand<00:00:49.770> from<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.280> so

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
draw it with your hand from this so

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.010 
draw it with your hand from this so
really<00:00:50.610> don't<00:00:50.850> overthink<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.600> kind<00:00:51.989> of

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
really don't overthink it just kind of

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.610 
really don't overthink it just kind of
go<00:00:52.140> down<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.739> up<00:00:53.370> down<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.590> up<00:00:55.590> down<00:00:56.090> and<00:00:57.620> okay

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
go down and up down and up down and okay

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.889 
go down and up down and up down and okay
so<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.760> could<00:00:59.969> be<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.120> sleeping<00:01:00.629> figure

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
so that could be a sleeping figure

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.080 
so that could be a sleeping figure
eights<00:01:01.079> what<00:01:01.890> if<00:01:02.010> you're<00:01:02.129> great<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.520> parallel

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
eights what if you're great is parallel

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.719 
eights what if you're great is parallel
to<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:04.140> wall<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.470> front<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.830> know<00:01:05.309> the

to the wall in front of you know the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.399 
to the wall in front of you know the
figure<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.119> could<00:01:06.210> be<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.479> standing<00:01:07.140> figure

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
figure it could be is standing figure

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.070 
figure it could be is standing figure
eight<00:01:07.619> okay<00:01:08.340> when<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.150> Circle<00:01:09.630> up<00:01:09.780> Circle

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
eight okay when the Circle up Circle

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.219 
eight okay when the Circle up Circle
down<00:01:10.740> soak<00:01:11.340> up<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:12.210> come<00:01:12.420> down<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.110> is
