00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.790
 I have to give my team an absolute 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.710
 compliment I think we 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.940
 now have the fourth game in eleven 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.410
 played days and I'm great 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.540
 Happy with my team 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.950
 Presented today she had the 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.490
 all the time has taken up the fight 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.490
 believed more 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.040
 today everyone has taken responsibility 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.250
 I think that we are the 45th in the 40 minutes 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.310
 minutes early play before you play 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.020
 was really well laid and actually 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.020
 have had good opportunities 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.990
 I would not say that unfairly 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.579
 then you have the second half you have one 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.600
 noticed that we ran out of air 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.670
 towards the end 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.990
 it is always s.Schnalen so 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.420
 mostly it is due to small things 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.460
 but also by own 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.380
 go into debt bad overpowered attacks 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.720
 played but backwards 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.399
 it was then and all in all it was 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.320
 already a deserved victory for flensburg 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.189
 and I think at the end of the game has 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.810
 one then noticed that the 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.420
 was just too big for wear 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.530
 That's why we do not have any more 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.630
 so much punch in attack 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.870
 then had some technical errors 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.280
 had the then also pay Flensburg 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.019
 to run counter-attacks but with the 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.120
 presentation I am very satisfied 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.980
 We knew the trio fails unfortunately 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.360
 Of course, a lot happens in the short term 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.380
 important player and I think so 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.480
 more had it than change options 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.470
 behind defense in the attack would then 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.670
 is going to be pretty close 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.560
 or would also have good chances 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.560
 had to beat flensburg 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.160
 we now think slowly the 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.060
 track found like the team itself 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.290
 present must produce that 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.030
 actually have shown impressive 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.319
 just be glad that the team today 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.319
 worked so well then it is beautiful 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.590
