alright<00:00:01.709> this<00:00:02.129> is<00:00:02.310> the<00:00:02.490> Jessica<00:00:02.939> Friedrich

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
alright this is the Jessica Friedrich

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.090 
alright this is the Jessica Friedrich
method<00:00:03.720> for<00:00:04.170> solving<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.560> Rubik's<00:00:04.859> Cube

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
method for solving the Rubik's Cube

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.490 
method for solving the Rubik's Cube
first<00:00:05.549> solve<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.509> cross<00:00:06.720> on<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.020> bottom<00:00:07.350> I

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
first solve the cross on the bottom I

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.890 
first solve the cross on the bottom I
made<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:07.919> white<00:00:08.130> cross<00:00:08.370> I<00:00:08.730> was<00:00:09.540> do<00:00:09.660> light

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
made a white cross I was do light

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.120 
made a white cross I was do light
because<00:00:10.139> I'm<00:00:10.260> used<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.620> doing<00:00:10.740> that<00:00:10.860> color

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
because I'm used to doing that color

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.270 
because I'm used to doing that color
there<00:00:12.030> are<00:00:12.150> three<00:00:12.330> basic<00:00:12.450> rules<00:00:12.900> one<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.070> where

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
there are three basic rules one is where

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.189 
there are three basic rules one is where
your<00:00:14.400> corner<00:00:14.759> is<00:00:14.910> facing<00:00:15.330> straight<00:00:15.630> up<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:15.990> hold

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
your corner is facing straight up I hold

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.660 
your corner is facing straight up I hold
the<00:00:16.320> cross<00:00:16.529> on<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.800> bottom<00:00:17.100> wear<00:00:17.400> your<00:00:17.490> white

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
the cross on the bottom wear your white

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.420 
the cross on the bottom wear your white
side<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.119> facing<00:00:18.240> straight<00:00:18.750> up<00:00:19.070> for<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.189> you

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
side is facing straight up for that you

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.740 
side is facing straight up for that you
want<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.640> find<00:00:20.789> its<00:00:21.000> corresponding<00:00:21.300> edge

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
want to find its corresponding edge

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.599 
want to find its corresponding edge
which<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:22.680> case<00:00:22.740> happens<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.220> red<00:00:23.400> blue

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
which in this case happens you red blue

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.420 
which in this case happens you red blue
and<00:00:23.760> attach<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.779> with<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.710> correct<00:00:25.980> color<00:00:26.189> in

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
and attach it with this correct color in

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.330 
and attach it with this correct color in
this<00:00:26.609> case<00:00:26.820> blue<00:00:27.119> whichever<00:00:27.660> side<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.230> on<00:00:28.920> the

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
this case blue whichever side is on the

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.049 
this case blue whichever side is on the
side<00:00:30.119> face<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.599> cube<00:00:30.720> not<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.230> face

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
side face of the cube not the you face

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.639 
side face of the cube not the you face
take<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.360> since<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.989> red<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.410> blue

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
take it and since this is red and blue

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.340 
take it and since this is red and blue
corner<00:00:34.950> red<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.520> blue<00:00:35.610> slide<00:00:35.880> here<00:00:36.230> roll<00:00:37.230> it

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
corner red and blue slide here roll it

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.150 
corner red and blue slide here roll it
away<00:00:38.040> from<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.469> take<00:00:40.469> its<00:00:40.620> corner<00:00:40.980> and

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
away from it take its corner and

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.340 
away from it take its corner and
move<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.120> on<00:00:42.300> top<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:43.430> undo<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:45.200> and<00:00:46.200> now

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
move it on top of it undo that and now

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.860 
move it on top of it undo that and now
the<00:00:46.410> hedge<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.010> attached<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.789> want<00:00:48.780> to

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
the hedge is attached and you want to

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.049 
the hedge is attached and you want to
just<00:00:48.960> fill<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.320> into<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.620> slot<00:00:49.920> which<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:50.969> this

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
just fill it into the slot which in this

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.799 
just fill it into the slot which in this
case<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.300> really<00:00:51.600> easy<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.930> figure<00:00:52.079> out<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
case is really easy to figure out the

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.680 
case is really easy to figure out the
next<00:00:54.809> case<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.530> when<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.399> have<00:00:56.550> one<00:00:57.300> color<00:00:57.510> on

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
next case is when you have one color on

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.010 
next case is when you have one color on
top<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.949> different<00:00:59.250> color<00:00:59.399> on<00:00:59.550> top<00:01:00.020> you

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
top and a different color on top you

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.869 
top and a different color on top you
just<00:01:01.140> move<00:01:01.410> them<00:01:01.590> stepped<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.219> opposite<00:01:02.640> sides

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
just move them stepped on opposite sides

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.660 
just move them stepped on opposite sides
of<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.090> cube<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:04.799> case<00:01:05.040> white<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.549> on

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
of the cube and in this case white is on

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.539 
of the cube and in this case white is on
the<00:01:05.760> left<00:01:05.939> side<00:01:06.920> now<00:01:07.920> we're<00:01:08.040> going<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.189> move<00:01:08.280> it

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the left side now we're going to move it

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.550 
the left side now we're going to move it
so<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.299> corner<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.780> above<00:01:10.049> its<00:01:10.200> correct

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
so that the corner is above its correct

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.130 
so that the corner is above its correct
slot<00:01:11.119> and<00:01:12.119> its<00:01:12.240> edges<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.659> opposite<00:01:12.960> side

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
slot and its edges on the opposite side

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.260 
slot and its edges on the opposite side
you<00:01:13.409> roll<00:01:13.650> them<00:01:13.799> over<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.970> now<00:01:15.090> they're

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
you roll them over so now they're

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.080 
you roll them over so now they're
connected<00:01:15.860> please<00:01:16.860> fill<00:01:17.220> them<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.490> attach

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
connected please fill them in attach

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.120 
connected please fill them in attach
them<00:01:18.299> right<00:01:18.450> there<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.170> white<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.530> white<00:01:19.650> and

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
them right there the white and white and

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.359 
them right there the white and white and
move<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.640> back<00:01:20.790> down<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:23.250> final<00:01:23.640> case<00:01:25.070> is<00:01:26.070> when

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
move it back down the final case is when

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.630 
move it back down the final case is when
they're<00:01:26.759> both<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.810> same<00:01:27.840> color<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.470> top<00:01:28.640> like

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
they're both the same color on top like

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.940 
they're both the same color on top like
these<00:01:29.850> are<00:01:30.000> both<00:01:30.090> blue<00:01:30.530> so<00:01:31.530> I'm<00:01:31.619> just<00:01:31.740> going<00:01:31.860> to

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
these are both blue so I'm just going to

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.060 
these are both blue so I'm just going to

going<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.140> take<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.409> edge<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.180> just<00:01:39.180> move<00:01:39.450> it

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
going to take the edge and just move it

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.819 
going to take the edge and just move it
over<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:42.390> same<00:01:42.600> side<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.960> cube<00:01:43.170> and

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
over to the same side of the cube and

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.340 
over to the same side of the cube and
when<00:01:44.009> i<00:01:44.040> roll<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.399> back<00:01:44.520> up<00:01:44.869> they're<00:01:45.869> connected

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
when i roll it back up they're connected

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.230 
when i roll it back up they're connected
and<00:01:47.149> i<00:01:48.149> put<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.479> place<00:01:49.759> there<00:01:50.759> are<00:01:50.909> certain

and i put it in place there are certain
times<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.750> get<00:01:51.899> special<00:01:52.649> cases<00:01:53.360> where

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
times you get special cases where

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.270 
times you get special cases where
they'll<00:01:54.509> be<00:01:54.540> connected<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.920> this<00:01:56.040> case

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
they'll be connected and in this case

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.920 
they'll be connected and in this case
you<00:01:56.790> just<00:01:56.969> want<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.210> break<00:01:57.390> them<00:01:57.600> without

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
you just want to break them without

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.389 
you just want to break them without
breaking<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.469> rest<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.799> your<00:01:58.890> first<00:01:59.250> two

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
breaking the rest of your first two

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.550 
breaking the rest of your first two
layers<00:01:59.640> so<00:02:00.420> use<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.780> stumpy<00:02:01.049> slot<00:02:01.320> right<00:02:01.500> here

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
layers so use the stumpy slot right here

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.289 
layers so use the stumpy slot right here
so<00:02:02.219> when<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.399> move<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.670> up<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.939> doesn't<00:02:03.030> break

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
so when you move it up it doesn't break

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.109 
so when you move it up it doesn't break
your<00:02:03.509> first<00:02:03.719> two<00:02:03.899> layers<00:02:04.520> so<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.579> break<00:02:05.909> the

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
your first two layers so you break the

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.660 
your first two layers so you break the
edge<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.630> corner<00:02:06.780> our<00:02:06.990> part<00:02:07.200> move<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.220> and

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
edge and corner our part move it and

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.969 
edge and corner our part move it and
then<00:02:08.759> move<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.030> back<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.840> now<00:02:10.349> they're<00:02:10.860> in<00:02:10.950> a

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
then move it back and now they're in a

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.920 
then move it back and now they're in a
case<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.430> we<00:02:11.550> know<00:02:11.730> with<00:02:12.120> opposite<00:02:12.599> colors

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
case that we know with opposite colors

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.780 
case that we know with opposite colors
on

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
on

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.950 
on
and<00:02:14.790> that's<00:02:14.970> just<00:02:15.060> going<00:02:15.210> to<00:02:15.330> go<00:02:15.420> into<00:02:15.660> place

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
and that's just going to go into place

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.310 
and that's just going to go into place
right<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.830> slot<00:02:16.950> there
