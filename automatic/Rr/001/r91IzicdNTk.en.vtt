with<00:03:29.040> your<00:03:29.190> hitch<00:03:29.310> right<00:03:29.549> and<00:03:29.820> then<00:03:30.360> you'll<00:03:30.510> be

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
with your hitch right and then you'll be

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.620 
with your hitch right and then you'll be
breaking<00:03:30.989> there<00:03:31.410> when<00:03:31.530> everything's<00:03:31.799> level

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
breaking there when everything's level

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.900 
breaking there when everything's level
but<00:03:33.630> I<00:03:34.110> enjoy<00:03:34.590> driving<00:03:34.890> it<00:03:35.130> it's<00:03:35.730> got<00:03:35.880> a

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910

moonroof<00:03:36.150> with<00:03:36.390> Sky<00:03:36.750> just<00:03:36.989> of<00:03:37.049> anything<00:03:37.290> you

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
moonroof with Sky just of anything you

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.620 
moonroof with Sky just of anything you
think<00:03:37.440> of<00:03:37.620> heated<00:03:37.920> steering<00:03:38.190> wheels<00:03:38.459> I<00:03:38.790> mean

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
think of heated steering wheels I mean

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.120 
think of heated steering wheels I mean
you<00:03:39.720> know<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:39.900> heated<00:03:40.200> second<00:03:40.650> row<00:03:40.769> seat<00:03:41.010> as

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
you know the heated second row seat as

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.640 
you know the heated second row seat as
well<00:03:41.250> as<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.519> front<00:03:41.820> row<00:03:42.000> seat<00:03:42.330> but<00:03:43.200> my

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
well as the front row seat but my

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.960 
well as the front row seat but my
favorite<00:03:43.950> part<00:03:44.100> though<00:03:44.280> is<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.400> intelligent

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
favorite part though is that intelligent

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.490 
favorite part though is that intelligent
cruise<00:03:45.120> control<00:03:45.180> we<00:03:45.660> can<00:03:45.780> lock<00:03:45.930> on<00:03:46.140> whoever<00:03:46.440> is

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
cruise control we can lock on whoever is

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.750 
cruise control we can lock on whoever is
in<00:03:46.590> front<00:03:46.650> of<00:03:46.890> you<00:03:47.010> and<00:03:47.190> it<00:03:47.310> will<00:03:47.430> just<00:03:47.549> stay<00:03:47.730> on

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
in front of you and it will just stay on

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.910 
in front of you and it will just stay on
that<00:03:47.880> person<00:03:48.780> speed<00:03:49.049> until<00:03:49.380> they<00:03:49.620> turn<00:03:49.890> off

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
that person speed until they turn off

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.039 
that person speed until they turn off
where<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.459> pass<00:03:50.670> them<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.060> then<00:03:51.750> it'll<00:03:51.870> go<00:03:52.019> to

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
where you pass them and then it'll go to

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.850 
where you pass them and then it'll go to
the<00:03:52.200> speed<00:03:52.470> that<00:03:52.590> you<00:03:52.739> set

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
the speed that you set

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.860 
the speed that you set
controls<00:03:55.550> very<00:03:55.850> ergonomically<00:03:56.420> I'd<00:03:56.540> really

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
controls very ergonomically I'd really

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.200 
controls very ergonomically I'd really
like<00:03:56.960> the<00:03:57.140> in<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.160> center<00:03:58.460> console<00:03:58.910> there's

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.210 
like the in the center console there's

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.050 
like the in the center console there's
the<00:03:59.450> GPS<00:03:59.900> which<00:04:00.170> has<00:04:00.410> a<00:04:00.680> lot<00:04:00.950> of<00:04:00.980> things<00:04:01.310> with

as well plans radio climate control but

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.010 
as well plans radio climate control but
it's<00:04:04.220> got<00:04:04.370> knobs<00:04:04.610> on<00:04:04.850> everything<00:04:05.270> so<00:04:05.840> many

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020

really the safest way to control your
your<00:04:15.410> systems<00:04:15.920> on<00:04:16.100> this<00:04:16.280> there's<00:04:16.489> a<00:04:16.580> knob<00:04:16.760> for

everything as a knob for the GPS for the

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.620 
everything as a knob for the GPS for the
map<00:04:18.920> so<00:04:19.100> you<00:04:19.160> can<00:04:19.310> actually<00:04:19.489> zoom<00:04:19.850> it<00:04:20.360> in<00:04:20.480> and

zoom it out if you're looking for

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.260 
zoom it out if you're looking for
certain<00:04:21.830> streets<00:04:22.130> you<00:04:22.760> can<00:04:22.880> do<00:04:22.970> that<00:04:23.090> with<00:04:23.210> the

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
certain streets you can do that with the

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.700 
certain streets you can do that with the
heat<00:04:23.390> controls<00:04:23.810> it's<00:04:24.050> got<00:04:24.200> independent<00:04:24.620> heat

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
heat controls it's got independent heat

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.620 
heat controls it's got independent heat
control<00:04:25.040> some<00:04:25.190> left<00:04:25.370> and<00:04:25.490> right<00:04:25.640> but

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
control some left and right but

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.910 
control some left and right but
everything's<00:04:26.990> done<00:04:27.110> with<00:04:27.260> a<00:04:27.320> knob<00:04:27.500> it's<00:04:27.770> got<00:04:27.890> a

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
everything's done with a knob it's got a

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.610 
everything's done with a knob it's got a
camera<00:04:28.130> system<00:04:28.430> on<00:04:28.790> it<00:04:28.940> that<00:04:29.360> is<00:04:29.540> incredible

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
camera system on it that is incredible

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.690 
camera system on it that is incredible
of<00:04:30.920> course<00:04:31.130> it<00:04:31.250> shows<00:04:31.400> you<00:04:31.490> when<00:04:31.580> you're

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
of course it shows you when you're

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.800 
of course it shows you when you're
backing<00:04:31.850> up<00:04:32.030> and<00:04:32.150> all<00:04:32.270> that<00:04:32.450> but<00:04:32.630> you<00:04:32.720> know

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
backing up and all that but you know

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.630 
backing up and all that but you know
slow<00:04:33.110> speeds<00:04:33.650> I<00:04:33.860> think<00:04:34.130> it's<00:04:34.280> under<00:04:34.460> three

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
slow speeds I think it's under three

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.610 
slow speeds I think it's under three
miles<00:04:34.850> an<00:04:35.000> hour<00:04:35.150> when<00:04:35.990> I<00:04:36.050> was<00:04:36.170> testing<00:04:36.530> it

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
miles an hour when I was testing it

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.370 
miles an hour when I was testing it
there's<00:04:37.430> cameras<00:04:38.000> all<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:38.210> way<00:04:38.270> around<00:04:38.540> it<00:04:38.780> so

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
there's cameras all the way around it so

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.930 
there's cameras all the way around it so
if<00:04:39.500> you're<00:04:39.620> pulling<00:04:39.980> upside<00:04:40.310> something<00:04:40.760> and

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
if you're pulling upside something and

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.430 
if you're pulling upside something and
you<00:04:41.030> can't<00:04:41.240> see<00:04:41.450> the<00:04:41.600> blind<00:04:41.780> spot<00:04:42.110> in<00:04:42.230> one<00:04:42.350> of

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
you can't see the blind spot in one of

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.800 
you can't see the blind spot in one of
your<00:04:42.530> fenders<00:04:42.890> you<00:04:42.920> just<00:04:43.250> look<00:04:43.400> at<00:04:43.520> the<00:04:43.700> at<00:04:44.390> the

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
your fenders you just look at the at the

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.090 
your fenders you just look at the at the

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
you can see exactly what you're running

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.260 
you can see exactly what you're running
into<00:05:00.310> what<00:05:01.310> the<00:05:01.400> camera<00:05:01.730> system<00:05:01.880> is<00:05:02.120> I've

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
into what the camera system is I've

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.610 
into what the camera system is I've
never<00:05:02.420> seen<00:05:02.600> one<00:05:02.690> quite<00:05:02.780> like<00:05:02.900> that<00:05:03.230> before<00:05:03.410> it

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
never seen one quite like that before it

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.350 
never seen one quite like that before it
shows<00:05:03.800> you<00:05:03.920> all<00:05:04.070> four<00:05:04.400> corners<00:05:04.640> at<00:05:04.880> once<00:05:05.060> I

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
shows you all four corners at once I

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.970 
shows you all four corners at once I
think<00:05:05.930> it's<00:05:06.050> a<00:05:06.080> graphic<00:05:06.470> in<00:05:06.590> the<00:05:06.680> middle<00:05:06.890> where

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
think it's a graphic in the middle where

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.410 
think it's a graphic in the middle where
it<00:05:07.040> shows<00:05:07.190> you<00:05:07.280> the<00:05:07.370> roof<00:05:07.550> because<00:05:07.790> the<00:05:08.090> camera

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
it shows you the roof because the camera

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.850 
it shows you the roof because the camera
is<00:05:08.480> not<00:05:08.570> in<00:05:08.750> the<00:05:08.840> air<00:05:08.990> but<00:05:09.260> it<00:05:09.380> does<00:05:09.530> show<00:05:09.560> you

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
is not in the air but it does show you

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.590 
is not in the air but it does show you
what's<00:05:10.220> on<00:05:10.340> each<00:05:10.490> side<00:05:10.730> of<00:05:10.760> the<00:05:10.880> vehicle<00:05:10.940> yeah

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
what's on each side of the vehicle yeah

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.850 
what's on each side of the vehicle yeah
it's<00:05:12.290> incredible<00:05:12.470> credible<00:05:13.250> system<00:05:13.580> on<00:05:13.730> it
