00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:10.230
 finally came back yes and I through headphones 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:15.210
 I'm sorry for the company is not that anyone 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:20.089
 until then I will create a class of my channel 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:24.659
 here and today i will have a pharma theory 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:28.800
 these forms 2 i'm young on the fifth there 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:33.500
 holly just bum me token 1 him here 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:37.050
 sixth fought 7 different town hall 5 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:45.450
 But everything is clear you can not particularly 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:48.510
 ask in general now I will start 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.530
 farm here we will have fan gold so 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.750
 me a fence or all too farm very 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.280
 okay so i want to show you 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:06.450
 my attack on one person right now I 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:10.920
 I will show you this help with a look yes 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.649
 Now as you can see it on Falt 7 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.469
 here is the resource storage elixir 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:21.030
 a lot of resources could be taken 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:22.590
 I unfortunately was all up to the end so I 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.289
 just drop a bunch 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:30.409
 barbarians they go smash like u 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:30.409
 him all protection is on the slide here 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:38.490
 sleep in headphones screaming and he has everything 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.789
 Protect gifts as you can and gift 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.299
 fuck I have expensive storage 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.009
 no 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.690
 this top 5 townhouse today developed 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.820
 so 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:56.260
 i just took a bunch of resources like you 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:02:01.740
 can see 7000 but i'm not the maximum 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:04.930
 so of course the fence 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.840
 I understand that he has it to them 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.230
 turned out in general about how the sucker spent 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.970
 the whole fence in africa base and i easily it 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:24.430
 blew away 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:26.350
 Well, as you can see, she and I have already died in 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.380
 In general, my remark here are such 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.830
 homeless people never build such bases 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.870
 because you have so easy to carry 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.880
 but the truth is not the image of it because even 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.020
 small woman and that's all my 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.600
 blown up so here are the cups I 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.500
 received and 43 lih anyway enough 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.690
 okay in general now i will show you 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:55.060
 tactic form at least my 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:58.600
 and it works very well in the general background 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.600
 whose homeless mortar is not under 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.420
 protected but here I am placed that 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.290
 that resources really can be normal 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.180
 take such an apartment, too, well protected 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.019
 that was close from the fence it can be 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.120
 easy to carry 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:19.510
 Here for example my version of the markers next 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.510
 it's easy let's run and how do these 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.549
 homeless people ran in that direction kibella that 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.220
 you will fall 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:32.500
 prince having run here and here, do not be 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:35.260
 suckers that's fine so here they start 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.910
 break all mortar 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:42.000
 break on the night can farm 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:46.540
 stick out against the background of this match in a row 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.470
 now there is no particular danger so what 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:54.310
 mortar word for everything now everyone 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:58.540
 don't care our guns they break easily here 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:02.630
 a woman has to do the barbarians video 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:06.140
 got a mortar to a penny of resources 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:09.950
 many 7 thousand feet well for me it 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:13.400
 Of course not very much but gray for 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:17.870
 there was enough fence there was a bomb why are you 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:20.660
 live bomb there my barbarian flew up 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.510
 he got the bar here he broke everything 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:35.260
 perfectly stayed there hall and 100 stars 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:41.830
 our all not that's all but all that's 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:45.290
 last it is easy to carry everything 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:48.250
 enough when you don't have a bunch of protection 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:52.220
 the army is not all that fast for you oh this all 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:55.570
 see my quickly broke taken away 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:59.000
 I get a lot of resources from the cups 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:01.790
 that's very good we took 3,000 from him 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.200
 5000 resources of course for me this 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:10.669
 ok because I'm 1 league the most in 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:14.800
 the very first I have enough resources 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:17.270
 to pump the fence yourself and homeless 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:21.140
 because I think that the side of the board 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:24.919
 important and swing fence 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:29.290
 Here are all 2 fence and pumped before him 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:33.970
 on farm so farm and what you need 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.970
 the troops load all the same on them 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:43.669
 matrimonial want here in general when i 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:47.240
 I will save 40,000 we will have kuan which 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:52.460
 would be called you ford as a name 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:57.440
 our channel well there my team here 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:06:00.710
 I write so to name and we will be there 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.400
 farm gigs are just guides 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:06.280
 release token good luck and easy 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.520
 here then by these very difficult farin 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:12.970
 I tried to farm them a lot of resources 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:16.270
 hope this is all the rest not but i need 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.690
 and cups and resource so i'm not my 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.130
 option 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:23.320
 the shape of the name of the bows is very convenient to farm 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.780
 that they are actually some guns 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.270
 sometimes it doesnâ€™t get like that 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:32.650
 next year but bows 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:35.380
 I have fewer lives in my life 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:37.690
 used to form a bow on its past 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:42.220
 account I just restarted the game me 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:47.199
 all maturity and therefore I now farm 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:50.770
 bows here 23 lives from 54 well, clear by whom 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:52.240
 better in whom more lives and damage here 9 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.030
 and here 11 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:58.449
 and the level of the same, and worth 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:00.190
 cheaper so I will cut the warms general 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:02.620

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.840
