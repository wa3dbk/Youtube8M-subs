lunge this time with both legs or feet
even<00:04:39.710> flat<00:04:40.070> to<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:40.370> ground<00:04:40.640> and<00:04:41.140> then<00:04:42.140> again

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
even flat to the ground and then again

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.110 
even flat to the ground and then again
you're<00:04:42.740> going<00:04:42.920> to<00:04:43.040> repeat<00:04:43.550> those<00:04:43.790> same

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120
