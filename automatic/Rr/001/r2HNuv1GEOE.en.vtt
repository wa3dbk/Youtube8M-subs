00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 there were people how are you less 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.549
 it's going very well 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.740
 so today we will end up 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.870
 for a small video rather special because 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.110
 it's the beginning of a new concept that 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.549
 I thought you're going to tell me it's 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.120
 already seen there has already been this kind of 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.460
 concept 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.420
 I will not name names so it's 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.130
 all this will be a series of resignations or 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.840
 a series of shows the show on 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.439
 world of warcraft which will be called 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.939
 the discoveries of nello the explorer 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.890
 so that's just 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.149
 once I find something 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.489
 interesting, but not usual 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.680
 in the game eh ben I'll I'll you 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.559
 will share by a small video as well 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.640
 as an explanation of what I found 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.320
 here I think it can be nice 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.640
 will be pretty short videos like that 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.149
 with six minutes sader function of this 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.510
 that I find 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.640
 and so that will always be a description 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.890
 then the video of the general of what 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.719
 I found or at least catch 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.539
 so that's maybe its part 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.250
 I think it can be fun 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.840
 some people looking to prat 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.970
 mob or others especially 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.340
 here are some little useless stuff 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.189
 but sometimes and arranged simple little twinkling 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.939
 look at my meetings and so here 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.890
 I hope you'll like it so 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.409
 start this first episode we're going 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.000
 talk about a late monster we're going to 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.159
 go back to the big game 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.530
 you will understand why because he 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.290
 is actually a big moray eel so 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.140
 big eel if you want them 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.159
 so patrol along the coasts of 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.070
 steppes of Toulon so here is the map 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.600
 for the actor who will pass later 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.220
 so that they make fun of is called the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.890
 natus that you see so on the screen a 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.600
 big migraine which is therefore in 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.280
 the sands long rates on the idh da rocha 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.990
 north is 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.590
 so to situate you so the steppes 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:56.219
 of tension you have a map 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.020
 I will find her sorry I have not everything 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.509
 visual sense now so you have the 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.729
 map of tuna steaks and you have 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.039
 small islands to the west so the 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.960
 steppes and it's really lille who is 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.989
 really there the most north so 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.930
 lille which is called diamonds is therefore the 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.879
 moray she walks on everything 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.260
 all the odds on the ribs 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:22.129
 from the north and east of this island I'm going 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.780
 you pass the card here 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.579
 here and so you see yourself 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.069
 appear small points of appearance 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:32.090
 of this rare word then one must know what 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.880
 little word brard finally has this little 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.470
 has 43 million health points is 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.049
 still important enough but 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.680
 frankly largely feasible at 5 to 5 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:45.030
 days so obviously once as long as 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.230
 personally 2006 we made it to this 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.349
 so you'll see it in the video on 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.120
 did it I think we were 7 8 or so 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.860
 I know more I do not know anymore but 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.930
 it was after a raid with friends and 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.970
 we thought why do not we go 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.180
 will do them to do big game fishing 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.920
 and that's it and then the little plus is it 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.069
 it is good bouki rare hamlet 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.900
 but the main thing is that they give 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:11.220
 lucchi drop natus from europe 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.220
 an offshoot of natus so a mascot and 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.900
 which will fall to 100% 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.000
 also you can cut up kills it 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.419
 which gives an exotic to host and 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.650
 a prismatic shell so that's for 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.150
 the little ones the little description of this 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.450
 mode there then you have to know that 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.209
 the occitane elite 2 levels 93 93 for 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.709
 the French over looks at me 83 million 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.750
 the products I have already said and the 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.260
 has only one spell called the 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.790
 blast of lightning so except lightning 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.230
 on the chosen enemy show damage 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.799
 nature so who does anyway 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.930
 enough big damage about 200 to 300 4 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.150
 dia / 2 / blackberry plates 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.190
 so it really hurts so really 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.280
 a good time that they can via the 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.560
 the first then hoisted for the agro 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.690
 try to size up close to the 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.870
 side that there is not a lot of 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.969
 ensure that there is no 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.020
 how do we reject so small of 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:07.480
 That little hot rocks 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.730
 if I say no nonsense gifted here are some 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.430
 offspring that each have 4 million pv 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.900
 in principle can not according to what 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.820
 I understood he was going to make it seem 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.410
 but personally I did not see them 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.510
 during my fight so it can vary 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.520
 we never know he played with the little 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.600
 video and we will meet for a 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.260
 close to the next episode 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.260
 ciao 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.690
 we
