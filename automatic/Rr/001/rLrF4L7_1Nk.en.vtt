here<00:03:05.480> I<00:03:05.660> think<00:03:06.200> it<00:03:06.320> still<00:03:06.620> works<00:03:06.650> actually

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
here I think it still works actually

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.410 
here I think it still works actually
well<00:03:08.810> this<00:03:08.959> I<00:03:09.520> think<00:03:10.520> so<00:03:10.670> I<00:03:10.970> think<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.270> have<00:03:11.390> to

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
well this I think so I think you have to

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.960 
well this I think so I think you have to
upgrade<00:03:11.600> this<00:03:12.190> or<00:03:13.190> when<00:03:13.370> you<00:03:13.459> upgrade<00:03:13.640> it<00:03:13.880> and

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
upgrade this or when you upgrade it and

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.430 
upgrade this or when you upgrade it and
i'll<00:03:14.120> take<00:03:14.330> you<00:03:14.420> to<00:03:14.480> city<00:03:14.750> and<00:03:14.900> you<00:03:15.080> have<00:03:15.200> to<00:03:15.320> do

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
i'll take you to city and you have to do

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.130 
i'll take you to city and you have to do
