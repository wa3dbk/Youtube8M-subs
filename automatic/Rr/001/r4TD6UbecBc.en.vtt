00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
the animation is cool but the gameplay

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.760 
the animation is cool but the gameplay
is<00:03:05.910> terrible<00:03:06.569> and<00:03:06.660> it's<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.900> platforming<00:03:07.560> game

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
is terrible and it's a platforming game

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:17.450 
is terrible and it's a platforming game
where<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:07.980> characters<00:03:08.400> really<00:03:08.640> can't<00:03:08.880> jump

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:25.880 

I'm<00:03:18.060> jump<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.450> hell<00:03:18.600> over<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:18.990> dog<00:03:19.200> man

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
so I'm I like stuck there I mean one of

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.450 
so I'm I like stuck there I mean one of
these<00:03:28.200> other<00:03:28.350> characters<00:03:28.830> can<00:03:28.980> figure<00:03:29.190> it<00:03:29.370> out

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 
these other characters can figure it out

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:35.330 
these other characters can figure it out
I<00:03:31.700> mean<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:33.090> graphics<00:03:33.630> are<00:03:33.780> nice<00:03:34.340> the

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:43.290 
I mean the graphics are nice the
animation<00:03:36.000> is<00:03:36.120> nice<00:03:36.770> this<00:03:37.770> is<00:03:37.950> stupid<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:38.820> mean

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:58.050 

if<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.600> gameplay<00:03:43.960> is<00:03:44.410> terrible

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.059 

I<00:03:58.120> guess<00:03:58.989> I'll<00:03:59.110> get<00:03:59.230> all<00:03:59.349> three<00:03:59.620> of<00:03:59.739> them<00:03:59.860> there

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
I guess I'll get all three of them there

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:10.150 
I guess I'll get all three of them there
and<00:04:00.220> figure<00:04:00.520> it<00:04:00.610> out

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.990 

oh<00:04:10.900> right<00:04:11.960> forgot<00:04:12.410> about<00:04:12.440> that<00:04:12.800> all<00:04:13.550> right

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
oh right forgot about that all right

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.600 
oh right forgot about that all right
I<00:04:14.680> wasn't<00:04:15.680> paying<00:04:15.890> attention<00:04:16.400> that<00:04:16.430> they

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:16.610 
I wasn't paying attention that they

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:22.330 
I wasn't paying attention that they
would<00:04:16.760> be<00:04:16.880> that<00:04:17.030> little<00:04:17.269> tiny<00:04:17.630> dog<00:04:17.989> there

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.950 

imagine<00:04:27.479> if<00:04:27.600> it<00:04:27.720> was<00:04:27.840> a<00:04:27.900> larger<00:04:28.680> dog

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
not that larger dogs more likely to

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.749 
not that larger dogs more likely to
attack<00:04:34.300> you<00:04:34.600> but<00:04:34.750> if<00:04:34.870> they<00:04:34.990> do<00:04:35.050> it's<00:04:35.759> more

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759 
attack you but if they do it's more

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.680 
attack you but if they do it's more
likely<00:04:36.970> to<00:04:37.090> really<00:04:37.569> really<00:04:37.960> hurt<00:04:39.509> all<00:04:40.509> right<00:04:40.569> I

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
likely to really really hurt all right I

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.390 
likely to really really hurt all right I
have<00:04:40.930> no<00:04:41.319> idea<00:04:41.620> what<00:04:41.740> to<00:04:41.830> do<00:04:41.979> here<00:04:42.190> none<00:04:42.370> of
