00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.770 
you're expecting far too much of people
I<00:01:19.770> think<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.189> really<00:01:20.460> needs<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.270> think<00:01:21.630> we

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
I think it really needs it I think we

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.990 
I think it really needs it I think we
should<00:01:21.960> stick<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> dick<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.430> wall<00:01:23.670> I

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
should stick to the dick to the wall I

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.399 
should stick to the dick to the wall I
mean<00:01:24.180> I'm<00:01:24.479> just<00:01:24.509> trying<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:25.020> write<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.170> bit<00:01:25.350> of

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
mean I'm just trying to write a bit of

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.170 
mean I'm just trying to write a bit of
interest<00:01:25.830> here<00:01:26.100> because<00:01:26.520> there's<00:01:26.700> no<00:01:26.820> getting

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
interest here because there's no getting

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.819 
interest here because there's no getting
away<00:01:27.240> from<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.570> fact<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.080> Messiah<00:01:28.439> has

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
away from the fact that the Messiah has

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.640 
away from the fact that the Messiah has
come<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.430> then<00:01:29.700> gone<00:01:29.939> away<00:01:30.180> again<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.659> where

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
come and then gone away again and where

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.420 
come and then gone away again and where
does<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:31.829> leave<00:01:32.130> us<00:01:33.500> he<00:01:34.500> might<00:01:34.680> come<00:01:34.920> back

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
does that leave us he might come back

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.920 
does that leave us he might come back
so<00:01:35.970> what<00:01:36.829> frankly<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:38.100> mean<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.420> know<00:01:39.540> him

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
so what frankly I mean you know him

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.800 
so what frankly I mean you know him
possibly<00:01:40.350> coming<00:01:41.009> back<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.490> not<00:01:41.850> an<00:01:42.000> event<00:01:42.299> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
possibly coming back is not an event the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.719 
possibly coming back is not an event the
film<00:01:43.049> volcano<00:01:43.590> does<00:01:43.770> not<00:01:43.920> start<00:01:44.220> with<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.490> clear

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729
