 expressiveness at the time of singing 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:30.930

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:33.960
 singer is a shame you came in 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:36.960
 very wrong in the tone of the song and you already 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.550

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.990

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:47.870
