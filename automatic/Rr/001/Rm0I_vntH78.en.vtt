hey<00:00:00.810> hey<00:00:01.050> everyone<00:00:01.560> zeps<00:00:02.159> rocity<00:00:02.730> here<00:00:03.030> and

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
hey hey everyone zeps rocity here and

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.999 
hey hey everyone zeps rocity here and
today<00:00:03.810> I<00:00:03.929> wanted<00:00:04.140> to<00:00:04.290> show<00:00:04.529> you<00:00:04.560> something

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
today I wanted to show you something

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.220 
today I wanted to show you something
pretty<00:00:05.700> cool<00:00:05.819> where<00:00:06.270> I<00:00:06.359> came<00:00:06.450> up<00:00:06.750> with<00:00:06.779> with

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
pretty cool where I came up with with

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.930 
pretty cool where I came up with with
the<00:00:07.259> new<00:00:07.620> edition<00:00:08.010> of<00:00:08.160> slime<00:00:08.429> blocks<00:00:08.700> in<00:00:08.910> the

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
the new edition of slime blocks in the

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.530 
the new edition of slime blocks in the
recent<00:00:09.480> 1.8<00:00:10.200> snapshot<00:00:10.800> so<00:00:11.639> I've<00:00:11.940> got<00:00:12.360> two

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
recent 1.8 snapshot so I've got two

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.770 
recent 1.8 snapshot so I've got two
passcodes<00:00:12.809> here<00:00:13.380> one<00:00:14.219> of<00:00:14.340> them<00:00:14.460> says<00:00:14.759> 97<00:00:15.540> times

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
passcodes here one of them says 97 times

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.560 
passcodes here one of them says 97 times
for<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.619> other<00:00:16.740> ones<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.070> 115<00:00:17.820> times<00:00:18.119> 3

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
for and the other ones is 115 times 3

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.019 
for and the other ones is 115 times 3
now<00:00:19.320> it's<00:00:19.619> not<00:00:19.859> just<00:00:20.130> some<00:00:20.369> simple<00:00:20.699> math

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
now it's not just some simple math

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.450 
now it's not just some simple math
equation<00:00:21.570> here<00:00:21.900> but<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:23.189> actually

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
equation here but this actually

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.900 
equation here but this actually
corresponds<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.420> our<00:00:24.449> Y<00:00:24.960> value<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:26.189> if<00:00:26.519> we<00:00:26.580> go

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
corresponds to our Y value so if we go

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.650 
corresponds to our Y value so if we go
to<00:00:27.289> Y<00:00:28.789> 97<00:00:29.789> we'll<00:00:30.119> see<00:00:30.390> what<00:00:30.660> we<00:00:30.840> get<00:00:32.300> alright<00:00:33.300> so

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
to Y 97 we'll see what we get alright so

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.770 
to Y 97 we'll see what we get alright so
we're<00:00:33.809> here<00:00:34.020> why<00:00:34.200> 97<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:36.149> times<00:00:36.450> for

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
we're here why 97 and the times for

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.139 
we're here why 97 and the times for
means<00:00:37.230> we<00:00:37.440> have<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.680> push<00:00:37.890> for<00:00:38.430> different

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
means we have to push for different

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.930 
means we have to push for different
buttons<00:00:39.690> all<00:00:40.260> right<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.710> we<00:00:40.829> just<00:00:41.070> get<00:00:41.730> rid<00:00:41.879> of

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
buttons all right so we just get rid of

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.299 
buttons all right so we just get rid of
that<00:00:42.030> debug<00:00:42.690> screen<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.290> we<00:00:43.710> fall<00:00:43.920> down<00:00:43.950> and

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
that debug screen and we fall down and

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.850 
that debug screen and we fall down and
at<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.149> top<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.360> each<00:00:45.570> jump<00:00:45.989> we<00:00:46.379> push<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.649> button

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
at the top of each jump we push a button

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.670 
at the top of each jump we push a button
so<00:00:47.610> as<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.059> can<00:00:48.300> see<00:00:48.539> right<00:00:48.570> there<00:00:48.930> we<00:00:49.440> pushed

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
so as you can see right there we pushed

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.189 
so as you can see right there we pushed
each<00:00:49.860> button<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.789> if<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.600> push<00:00:51.870> them<00:00:52.050> off

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
each button and if I can push them off

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.740 
each button and if I can push them off
there<00:00:52.860> we<00:00:53.039> are<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.579> door<00:00:53.760> opens<00:00:54.120> doesn't

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
there we are the door opens doesn't

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.000 
there we are the door opens doesn't
really<00:00:54.870> matter<00:00:55.050> if<00:00:55.199> i<00:00:55.260> push<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.649> few<00:00:55.890> extra

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
really matter if i push it a few extra

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.400 
really matter if i push it a few extra
you<00:00:56.640> can<00:00:56.760> always<00:00:57.000> modify<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.480> if<00:00:57.719> need<00:00:57.989> be<00:00:58.020> and

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
you can always modify it if need be and

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.939 
you can always modify it if need be and
we<00:00:59.190> get<00:00:59.340> all<00:00:59.579> our<00:00:59.609> goals<00:01:00.149> woohoo<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.379> that's

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
we get all our goals woohoo but that's

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.070 
we get all our goals woohoo but that's
not<00:01:02.070> all<00:01:02.219> we<00:01:02.370> also<00:01:02.670> have<00:01:03.000> another<00:01:03.510> pass<00:01:03.780> code

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
not all we also have another pass code

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.440 
not all we also have another pass code
here<00:01:05.030> ok<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.090> we're<00:01:06.570> at<00:01:06.750> Y<00:01:07.130> 115<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.310> our<00:01:09.119> piece

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
here ok so we're at Y 115 and our piece

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.420 
here ok so we're at Y 115 and our piece
of<00:01:09.479> paper<00:01:09.750> says<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.409> push<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> button<00:01:10.950> three

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
of paper says to push a button three

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.310 
of paper says to push a button three
times<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:12.030> we<00:01:12.180> get<00:01:12.330> rid<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.780> debug<00:01:13.170> screen

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
times so we get rid of that debug screen

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.149 
times so we get rid of that debug screen
once<00:01:13.680> again<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.189> we<00:01:14.729> fall<00:01:14.970> down<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.650> we<00:01:16.650> push

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
once again and we fall down and we push

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.039 
once again and we fall down and we push
the<00:01:17.310> button<00:01:17.520> at<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.700> top<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.060> each<00:01:18.270> jump<00:01:18.659> so

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
the button at the top of each jump so

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.840 
the button at the top of each jump so
one<00:01:19.549> two<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.869> three<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.520> what<00:01:23.520> do<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.670> know

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
one two and three and what do you know

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.969 
one two and three and what do you know
we<00:01:24.270> get<00:01:24.479> something<00:01:24.720> right<00:01:25.020> here<00:01:25.350> it's<00:01:25.560> our

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
we get something right here it's our

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.550 
we get something right here it's our
diamonds<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:26.909> that's<00:01:27.119> pretty<00:01:27.360> cool<00:01:27.600> very<00:01:28.439> cool

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
diamonds so that's pretty cool very cool

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.050 
diamonds so that's pretty cool very cool
indeed<00:01:29.990> so<00:01:30.990> I'm<00:01:31.380> guessing<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:32.009> all<00:01:32.220> know<00:01:32.700> how

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
indeed so I'm guessing you all know how

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.660 
indeed so I'm guessing you all know how
this<00:01:33.140> concept<00:01:34.140> works<00:01:34.619> it's<00:01:35.009> pretty

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
this concept works it's pretty

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.999 
this concept works it's pretty
self-explanatory<00:01:36.020> we<00:01:37.020> use<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.439> height<00:01:37.740> that

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
self-explanatory we use the height that

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.920 
self-explanatory we use the height that
you<00:01:38.070> fall<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.150> slime<00:01:39.390> blocks<00:01:39.689> and

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
you fall on on to the slime blocks and

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.539 
you fall on on to the slime blocks and
we<00:01:40.020> use<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.470> as<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.860> little<00:01:41.130> passcode

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
we use that as the little passcode

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.940 
we use that as the little passcode
that's<00:01:42.270> pretty<00:01:42.509> cool<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:43.409> here<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.710> my

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
that's pretty cool this here is my

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.940 
that's pretty cool this here is my
terrible<00:01:44.369> redstone<00:01:44.850> around<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> back<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:46.320> lot

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
terrible redstone around the back a lot

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.060 
terrible redstone around the back a lot
of<00:01:47.540> overcomplicated<00:01:48.540> unneeded<00:01:49.200> things<00:01:49.680> but<00:01:50.040> I

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
of overcomplicated unneeded things but I

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.780 
of overcomplicated unneeded things but I
just<00:01:50.340> made<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.939> little<00:01:51.240> more<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.960> know

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
just made it a little more you know

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.649 
just made it a little more you know
stranger<00:01:53.810> yeah<00:01:54.810> anyways<00:01:55.649> there<00:01:56.579> are<00:01:56.790> many

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
stranger yeah anyways there are many

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.280 
stranger yeah anyways there are many
ways<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:59.009> modify<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.430> redstone<00:01:59.909> and

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
ways you can modify the redstone and

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.350 
ways you can modify the redstone and
such<00:02:01.290> I've<00:02:01.619> just<00:02:01.649> got<00:02:01.979> some<00:02:02.189> memory<00:02:02.759> Arsenal

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
such I've just got some memory Arsenal

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
latches just hooked up to a simple door

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.380 
latches just hooked up to a simple door
and<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.619> leads<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.950> our<00:02:08.069> chests<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.849> course

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
and that leads to our chests of course

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.100 
and that leads to our chests of course
which<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.289> pretty<00:02:10.830> cool<00:02:11.160> another<00:02:11.900> thing<00:02:12.900> is

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.670

that

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
that

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.559

sometimes these buttons are a little

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.929 
sometimes these buttons are a little
hard<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.930> press<00:02:16.170> win<00:02:16.439> +<00:02:16.640> jumping<00:02:17.640> up<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:17.849> down
