00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.570
 Hello friends, guide says fan 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.280
 before you the second issue of the heading 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.980
 sailors no questions 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.289
 starting from the second issue I decided 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.769
 add new zest to the rubric 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.990
 which you will surely like 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:28.230
 this trick I dragged the essence than partly 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.660
 where did he like the pilot after each 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.340
 video in the sailors category has no questions 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.370
 you can write a topic next 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.500
 release thereby orders guide 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.590
 you are interested in the subtleties of the game 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.079
 mechanics write questions on the game or 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.660
 vote for those questions that you 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.760
 would like to get a video response if 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.250
 Guide on this topic on my channel yet 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.690
 No, and under your message typed 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.800
 more likes than others 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.340
 offers 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.399
 read the order for the topic accepted but if not 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.550
 lucky you should not despair write your 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.129
 subject subsequent release and then maybe 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.479
 be exactly she will win next time 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.460
 let's get to the point 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.140
 this release will be the short answer to 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.270
 question how to destroy ships 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.000
 opponents on aircraft carriers 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.360
 I certainly do not say that I am the most 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.780
 skill player on aircraft carrier no course 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.180
 not 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.490
 I play this class not very often 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.970
 because chasing this loud title 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.820
 no sense however i am able to reveal 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.090
 for you the basics and help move from stage 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.990
 oh my goodness what to do and even then a 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.590
 Aviki can kill for this and I 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.570
 I will not burden you with cumbersome theories 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.299
 talk about the types of aircraft and other 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.780
 Especially since it was already in my first 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.350
 better aircraft class video 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.729
 move on to practice with bombers 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.280
 fighters do not usually occur much 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.189
 questions because we start with torpedo 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.579
 Here they fly to the enemy battleship that 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.459
 do next to start to choose the best 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.890
 side to go on the attack here everything 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.000
 just much more efficient to go with 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.640
 ship's nose 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.730
 so the speed of your goals works for you 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.910
 the ship will go towards the torpedo a 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.790
 Do not go away from them, this will significantly reduce 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.280
 chances for successful defensive maneuvers except 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.260
 you go to the target from the stern 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.660
 you will not be leading long 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.360
 the plane and in the field of action by your 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.230
 goals and this ultimately can lead to 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.209
 that fewer planes will attack 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.570
 it is also important to choose the direction of attack 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.610
 it is best to let the torpedo on board the goals 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.190
 so the chances of hitting will be 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.190
 Significantly more so as the goal is unlikely 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.140
 whether can slip between torpedoes 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.780
 making or adjusting a choice is simple 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.750
 not necessarily physically driving the plane and 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.600
 from the side of attack you need though it is 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.920
 it would be useful just after 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.900
 attack symbols 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.410
 drag the slider around the circle 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.989
 reset and choose the right direction for 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.080
 increase success also need to catch 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.870
 moment of attack and here I can only give one 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.820
 advice worth trying to start thinking 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.680
 in advance 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.440
 analyze the course of the battle ship's position 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.220
 try your opponent and his speed 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.690
 guess ahead your thoughts 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.650
 pay attention to how they behave 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.840
 captains and choose the right targets 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.330
 conceited inexperienced green crepe 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.820
 often manages to destroy much 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.680
 faster as he can 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.010
 miss the air attack 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.100
 but as for experienced captains here 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.850
 have to sweat of course there are many 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.130
 tricks 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.829
 need the same use of them all not 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.570
 guarantees success without solid luggage 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.940
 of experience 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.390
 1 trick to help destroy more often 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.600
 of enemies 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.510
 This ability to use manual reset 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.209
 torpedo automatic reset does not work 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.370
 optimal and often wide fan 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.799
 does not automatically reset 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.070
 critical damage as it hits the target 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:17.190
 just a couple of torpedoes but holding alt you 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:20.280
 you can manually reset the torpedoes narrow 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.239
 fan will be able to reset them 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.580
 close to goal 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.110
 that they take a pout right at her pick 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.780
 there 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.599
 the main thing is not to overdo it with the desire to reset 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:33.530
 torpedoes closer to the target otherwise they may 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:36.770
 just do not have time for here 2 trick 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.620
 hammer and anvil tactics in theory everything 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.669
 just the air groups have to alternate 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.699
 go on the attack 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.319
 attack the first group you make the goal 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.659
 go into a defensive maneuver 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:51.409
 which may allow her to escape 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:56.349
 part of the damage however from 2 attacking group 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:56.349
 from another country the goal is no longer dodge 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.219
 third cross attack trick 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.759
 strike both at the same time 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:07.250
 parties 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:10.039
 so that the direction and so intersect 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:17.360
 right on target and so will you apply 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:17.870
 some damage on a particularly brisk goal 4 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.409
 trick 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:24.050
 this is the use of the game mechanic remember 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:27.590
 that bombs can ignite after being hit 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.779
 the target and the torpedoes cause the flow while 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.259
 the damage from these processes will be gradually 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:35.300
 destroy the target by the emergency team can 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:39.229
 avoid negative consequences 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.180
 but the big gd skill you already understood to 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:43.930
 what am i driving 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:46.669
 if not then everything is just to start 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.789
 exchange one attack for use 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:52.449
 emergency team have your goal but how 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:55.159
 only you are sure that the skill is gone 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:55.930
 apply and torpedo my another 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:58.969
 attack 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:01.490
 getting a serious opponent flow 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:04.270
 may go to the bottom earlier than his 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:07.879
 rollback skills emergency command 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:10.580
 it is the basics of all the basics to train them 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:13.069
 cooperative battles and then in random 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:16.159
 you will be harder to surprise at 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:18.800
 this will be my hope 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:19.490
 You all liked the work . Thank you for 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.490
 viewing 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:26.590
 7 feet under the keel and good luck to you 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.030

 as a sign of support 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:34.210
 subscribe to the channel and see my guides and 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:36.450
 stream on the game in addition to my group 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:40.000
 VKontakte has a lot of interesting things 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:42.280
 because the subscription will also be useful with 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.740
 given that I am releasing content 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.890
 almost every day for missing not 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.890
 will turn out
