00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.510
 And then everyone here is beautiful. 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.389
 speaking is the max 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.889
 the rafael as you prefer and today I am 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.900
 bringing the channel team 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.779
 a video showing how to modify the 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.060
 control of your xbox 360 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.119
 This time I was showing you how. 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.300
 will modify the analog of your xbox 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.090
 or are actually exchanging these two 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.550
 for these two new ones that I 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.710
 I bought a site where the extreme without 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.309
 want to advertise but already doing 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.860
 I finally bought there who will need it 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.610
 to modify our control 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.170
 simply this key is where it 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.809
 has the special size for the screws 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.460
 of the xbox control I bought in this 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.559
 site may also be leaving the link 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.910
 for you who cares 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.460
 finally let's get you started 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.000
 first you will have to open the control 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:07.650
 beauty has seven screws for you 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.070
 take three here three here and what stays 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.610
 behind the control battery here 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.439
 usually have a ribbon and this 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.080
 you pull out you will find a 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.790
 screw will only take that screw 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.640
 from here and the three on each side you open 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:31.079
 the control you will press one of the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.229
 triggers and pulls is just back is okay 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.320
 easy for you to take that part will not 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.450
 use more now in the video but if you 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.369
 want to clean because 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.290
 example here looking at my contract is 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.079
 even my dog ​​inside does not 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.149
 I know how but your never 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.369
 if you want to just take a 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.280
 neutral detergent and a toothbrush 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.380
 pass through the carcass not in the 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.290
 board 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.189
 Anyway, we're going to use this again. 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.630
 board 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.930
 but we will use another side of 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.210
 I always take the 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.119
 vibrate to make it easier but I will not do it 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.240
 Now, but if you want to watch this 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:16.190
 neighbors are right here 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:18.290
 after removing the plate by carefully pulling 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.150
 this part also will not ties 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.150
 want to even stop even scheme 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.810
 What interests us in this video is this 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.910
 part that is good after all how does the 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.590
 people do to change this crap 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:43.730
 my dialogues are very simple 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.880
 hold and pull it does not get too stuck 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.550
 and it's very easy to take it easy 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.900
 and for you to put the new ones is the same 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:57.350
 thing you just put in a place 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.240
 specific and open until it clicks 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.510
 ready he will be positioned 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:08.720
 control is enough for you 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:10.700
 put another ready the analogue were 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.000
 It's enough for me now to assemble the 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.380
 control again just do the opposite 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.110
 now you lay I usually lay 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.770
 this part here first to facilitate 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:27.410
 a little bit 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:33.100
 So you put it in the box now. 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.100
 in the right place and sambando out there 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.280
 so you just have to put the plate 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.350
 right place 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.150
 if it does not enter on the right because the 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.750
 he got stuck in the middle of the 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.720
 way 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.220
 just you check me underneath him 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.220
 get a right fit 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.970
 ready since the docking is all in place 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:06.190
 I usually leave type closer 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.600
 possible these movies here 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.620
 now that it vibrates that I do not know the name and 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.780
 It's called a vibrator now. 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.540
 simply simply put the other 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.229
 part of the control 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:23.630
 I usually leave this part well. 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:31.100
 right here to facilitate 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:37.880
 To get you to do this part. 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:40.640
 that you enter just squeeze the triggers and 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.440
 ready control is already set 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.720
 again 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:50.170
 just be sure to put the screws 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.170
 in places 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.180
 and ready after you've put all 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:15.940
 control screws but place the 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:18.539
 battery that if your control goal 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:22.120
 Congratulations, you survived this tutorial. 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:24.599
 and enjoy your new analogue 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.229
 sure they will disguise 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:27.750
 perfectly if you did not do anything 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.159
 wrong of course 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.720
