it's there that all the loading takes

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.630 
it's there that all the loading takes
place<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.530> trucks<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.070> they<00:01:32.130> are<00:01:32.280> off<00:01:32.460> to

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
as I mentioned it's all about the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.969 
as I mentioned it's all about the
freshness<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.020> products<00:01:37.530> that's

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
24 to 36 hours that's fast so they've

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.890 
24 to 36 hours that's fast so they've
got<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.370> freshness<00:02:40.670> nail<00:02:41.120> but<00:02:41.750> there's

got the freshness nail but there's

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.630 
got the freshness nail but there's
another<00:02:42.170> interesting<00:02:42.560> part<00:02:43.010> of<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.190> process

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
another interesting part of the process

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.730 
another interesting part of the process
where<00:02:44.420> we<00:02:44.540> are<00:02:44.720> now<00:02:44.900> in<00:02:44.960> this<00:02:45.080> particular<00:02:45.260> room

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
where we are now in this particular room

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.710 
where we are now in this particular room
is<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.460> reason<00:02:46.760> problems<00:02:47.150> milk<00:02:47.390> is<00:02:47.540> so

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
is the reason problems milk is so

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.470 
is the reason problems milk is so
unusual<00:02:48.290> so<00:02:48.500> unique<00:02:48.800> and<00:02:48.980> so<00:02:49.280> good<00:02:49.550> their<00:02:50.240> milk

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
unusual so unique and so good their milk

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.240 
unusual so unique and so good their milk
is<00:02:50.630> fortified<00:02:51.170> naturally<00:02:51.709> because<00:02:52.040> of<00:02:52.160> this

is fortified naturally because of this
machine<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:52.820> it's<00:02:52.940> called<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.330> MBR

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
milks natural water which in turn

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.340 
milks natural water which in turn
condenses<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.209> milk<00:03:02.420> and<00:03:02.600> raises<00:03:03.230> the
