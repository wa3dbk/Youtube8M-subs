00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.320 
uninstalled the game from the hard drive
and<00:05:45.320> formatted<00:05:46.160> all<00:05:46.340> seven<00:05:46.970> of<00:05:47.060> the<00:05:47.150> games

floppy disks and yet candle Cove I kept

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.870 
floppy disks and yet candle Cove I kept
coming<00:05:53.270> back<00:05:53.450> to<00:05:53.600> it<00:05:54.070> what<00:05:55.070> why<00:05:55.280> did<00:05:55.430> I<00:05:55.490> do<00:05:55.550> them

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
coming back to it what why did I do them

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.150 
coming back to it what why did I do them
the<00:05:56.300> hell<00:05:56.680> was<00:05:57.680> wrong<00:05:58.040> with<00:05:58.250> me<00:05:58.430> as<00:05:58.550> a<00:05:58.580> child

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160

the hell was wrong with me as a child
the<00:06:01.160> game<00:06:01.340> is<00:06:01.520> wretched<00:06:02.240> across<00:06:02.930> all<00:06:03.169> three

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
the game is wretched across all three

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.930 
the game is wretched across all three
systems<00:06:03.919> and<00:06:04.070> it's<00:06:04.370> hard<00:06:04.580> to<00:06:04.669> believe<00:06:04.760> that

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
systems and it's hard to believe that

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.340 
systems and it's hard to believe that
the<00:06:05.060> game<00:06:05.180> was<00:06:05.300> even<00:06:05.540> released<00:06:05.690> in<00:06:06.020> the<00:06:06.080> first

a full decade after the original game
was<00:06:12.620> presumably<00:06:13.070> released<00:06:13.550> but<00:06:14.390> people<00:06:15.050> must

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
why does no one discuss it I don't I

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.930 
why does no one discuss it I don't I
can't<00:06:28.820> understand<00:06:29.510> why<00:06:29.840> I'm<00:06:30.020> the<00:06:30.200> only<00:06:30.230> one

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:30.940 
can't understand why I'm the only one

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610 
maybe it's just because it's terminal I
