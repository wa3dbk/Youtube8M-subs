new valve

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.330 
new valve
it<00:00:12.599> came<00:00:12.840> with<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.049> gasket<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.710> it<00:00:13.860> also<00:00:13.980> came<00:00:14.309> a

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
it came with a gasket and it also came a

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.189 
it came with a gasket and it also came a
two<00:00:14.670> screws<00:00:15.089> which<00:00:15.389> will<00:00:15.540> hold<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.870> into<00:00:16.080> the

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
two screws which will hold it into the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.830 
two screws which will hold it into the
throttle<00:00:16.440> body<00:00:16.650> here<00:00:16.949> if<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.359> came<00:00:18.510> with<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.750> new

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
throttle body here if it came with a new

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.269 
throttle body here if it came with a new
components<00:00:19.380> let's<00:00:19.650> use<00:00:19.890> those<00:00:20.100> new

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
components let's use those new

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.640 
components let's use those new
components<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:21.660> first<00:00:21.900> thing<00:00:22.050> we<00:00:22.199> need<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.380> do

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
components so first thing we need to do

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.160 
components so first thing we need to do
is<00:00:22.970> disconnect<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.359> electrical<00:00:24.750> connector

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
is disconnect the electrical connector

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.410 
is disconnect the electrical connector
now<00:00:25.859> because<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.550> high<00:00:26.789> mileage<00:00:27.180> on<00:00:27.300> this

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
now because of the high mileage on this

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.720 
now because of the high mileage on this
vehicle<00:00:27.630> plastic<00:00:28.500> slow<00:00:28.680> brittle<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.250> uses

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
vehicle plastic slow brittle it uses

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.759 
vehicle plastic slow brittle it uses
this<00:00:30.150> plastic<00:00:30.660> pick<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.080> help<00:00:31.260> me<00:00:31.380> release<00:00:31.710> the

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
this plastic pick to help me release the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.130 
this plastic pick to help me release the
electrical<00:00:32.340> connector<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.390> it's<00:00:33.630> locked

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
electrical connector and it's locked

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.049 
electrical connector and it's locked
you<00:00:34.829> can<00:00:34.950> see<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.250> things<00:00:35.460> stuck<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:35.880> it

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
you can see that things stuck on it

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.580 
you can see that things stuck on it
pretty<00:00:36.210> well<00:00:36.649> so<00:00:37.649> we<00:00:37.950> get<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.579> disconnected

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
pretty well so we get a disconnected

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.330 
pretty well so we get a disconnected
that's<00:00:40.590> out<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.980> way

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
that's out of the way

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.670 
that's out of the way
I'm<00:00:42.329> gonna<00:00:42.420> take<00:00:42.570> my<00:00:42.719> ratchet<00:00:42.930> with<00:00:43.290> my<00:00:43.379> swivel

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
I'm gonna take my ratchet with my swivel

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.600 
I'm gonna take my ratchet with my swivel
socket<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:45.230> we<00:00:46.230> just<00:00:46.410> have<00:00:46.559> two<00:00:46.890> screws

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
socket and we just have two screws

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.029 
socket and we just have two screws
holding<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.270> place<00:00:48.710> into<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.829> throttle

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
holding this in place into the throttle

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.939 
holding this in place into the throttle
body<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:51.239> let's<00:00:51.390> go<00:00:51.510> ahead<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.960> remove<00:00:52.649> both

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
body so let's go ahead and remove both

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.520 
body so let's go ahead and remove both
of<00:00:53.879> these<00:00:54.000> old<00:00:54.180> screws<00:00:54.570> we<00:00:55.170> don't<00:00:55.320> want<00:00:55.440> to

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
of these old screws we don't want to

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.290 
of these old screws we don't want to
drop<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.800> but<00:00:56.100> we<00:00:56.219> can<00:00:56.340> discard<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.879> old<00:00:56.940> ones

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
drop it but we can discard the old ones

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.990 
drop it but we can discard the old ones
because<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.660> came<00:00:57.840> with<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> new<00:00:58.199> ones<00:00:59.000> this

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
because it came with the new ones this

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.630 
because it came with the new ones this
one<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.270> relatively<00:01:00.690> easy<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.109> access<00:01:01.640> we

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
one is relatively easy to access we

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.830 
one is relatively easy to access we
don't<00:01:02.820> even<00:01:02.969> have<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.239> remove<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.690> air

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
don't even have to remove the air

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.509 
don't even have to remove the air
cleaner<00:01:04.229> or<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.799> throttle<00:01:05.159> body<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.460> this

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
cleaner or the throttle body on this

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.179 
cleaner or the throttle body on this
particular<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.720> once<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.680> new<00:01:07.799> screws

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
particular one so once the new screws

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.410 
particular one so once the new screws
are<00:01:08.400> out<00:01:08.869> we<00:01:09.869> can<00:01:10.020> remove<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.409> here<00:01:10.909> and<00:01:11.909> we're

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
are out we can remove it here and we're

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.940 
are out we can remove it here and we're
going<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:13.100> use<00:01:14.100> our<00:01:14.250> new<00:01:15.530> gasket<00:01:16.530> components

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
going to use our new gasket components

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.700 
going to use our new gasket components
here<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.430> we'll<00:01:17.670> go<00:01:17.790> ahead<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.240> install<00:01:18.710> our

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
new I egg now using our new screws I'm

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.070 
new I egg now using our new screws I'm
going<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.229> reverse<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.470> removal<00:01:25.950> process<00:01:26.159> and

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
going to reverse the removal process and

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.770 
going to reverse the removal process and
reinstall<00:01:28.080> our<00:01:28.350> new<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.009> egg<00:01:29.310> fill<00:01:29.549> now<00:01:30.479> we<00:01:30.540> want

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
reinstall our new I egg fill now we want

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.090 
reinstall our new I egg fill now we want
to<00:01:30.840> be<00:01:30.900> careful<00:01:31.140> because<00:01:31.320> remember<00:01:31.799> these<00:01:31.979> are

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
to be careful because remember these are

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.590 
to be careful because remember these are
getting<00:01:32.340> threaded<00:01:32.729> into<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.030> plastic

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
getting threaded into the plastic

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.960 
getting threaded into the plastic
throttle<00:01:34.290> body<00:01:34.439> here<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:35.220> want<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.520> overly

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
throttle body here so we want to overly

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.760 
throttle body here so we want to overly
tighten<00:01:36.390> these<00:01:36.570> but<00:01:37.320> we're<00:01:37.409> going<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.590> just

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
tighten these but we're going to just

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.200 
tighten these but we're going to just
get<00:01:37.890> them<00:01:38.040> down<00:01:38.220> good<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.670> snug<00:01:38.850> we<00:01:39.030> want<00:01:39.150> to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
get them down good and snug we want to

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.590 
get them down good and snug we want to
make<00:01:39.299> sure<00:01:39.329> there's<00:01:39.630> no<00:01:39.810> vacuum<00:01:40.079> leaks<00:01:40.560> also

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
make sure there's no vacuum leaks also

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.350 
make sure there's no vacuum leaks also
so<00:01:42.600> we'll<00:01:43.170> tighten<00:01:43.560> these<00:01:43.649> get<00:01:44.549> them<00:01:44.610> good<00:01:45.299> and

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
so we'll tighten these get them good and

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.440 
so we'll tighten these get them good and
tight<00:01:45.630> but<00:01:46.200> let's<00:01:46.829> not<00:01:46.950> go<00:01:47.130> too<00:01:47.369> tight<00:01:47.579> because

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
tight but let's not go too tight because

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.910 
tight but let's not go too tight because
then<00:01:48.600> we<00:01:48.720> run<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.960> risk<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:50.659> snapping<00:01:51.659> or

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
then we run the risk of snapping or

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.340 
then we run the risk of snapping or
stripping<00:01:52.920> out<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.630> plastic<00:01:54.630> inside<00:01:55.170> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
stripping out the plastic inside the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.340 
stripping out the plastic inside the
throttle<00:01:55.710> body

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.750 

so<00:02:02.350> once<00:02:02.830> that's<00:02:03.100> done<00:02:03.630> we're<00:02:04.630> going<00:02:04.720> to<00:02:05.760> make

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
so once that's done we're going to make

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.380 
so once that's done we're going to make
our<00:02:06.940> electrical<00:02:07.330> connection<00:02:08.910> get<00:02:09.910> it<00:02:10.030> make

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
our electrical connection get it make

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.790 
our electrical connection get it make
sure<00:02:10.420> it's<00:02:10.720> locked<00:02:10.960> into<00:02:11.260> place

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
sure it's locked into place

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.940 
sure it's locked into place
lock<00:02:12.040> down<00:02:12.070> good<00:02:12.610> reinsert<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.630> lock<00:02:13.950> make

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
lock down good reinsert the lock make

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.100 
lock down good reinsert the lock make
sure<00:02:15.070> this<00:02:15.160> doesn't<00:02:15.400> come<00:02:15.670> loose<00:02:16.020> then<00:02:17.020> we

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
sure this doesn't come loose then we

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.930 
sure this doesn't come loose then we
need<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.440> relearn<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.490> memory

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
need to relearn the memory

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.270 
need to relearn the memory
well<00:02:19.630> before<00:02:19.900> we<00:02:20.080> relearn<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.650> memory<00:02:20.920> let's

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
well before we relearn the memory let's

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.830 
well before we relearn the memory let's
clear<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.670> old<00:02:21.790> memory<00:02:22.150> this<00:02:22.390> can<00:02:22.570> be<00:02:22.630> done

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
clear the old memory this can be done

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.370 
clear the old memory this can be done
via<00:02:23.230> scan<00:02:23.800> tool<00:02:24.010> or<00:02:24.870> if<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:26.020> have<00:02:26.200> to

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
via scan tool or if you have to

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.050 
via scan tool or if you have to
disconnect<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.040> negative<00:02:27.190> battery<00:02:27.400> terminal

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
disconnect the negative battery terminal

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.390 
disconnect the negative battery terminal
for<00:02:28.270> a<00:02:28.300> couple<00:02:28.600> seconds<00:02:29.020> then<00:02:29.980> whatever

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
for a couple seconds then whatever

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.980 
for a couple seconds then whatever
thing's<00:02:30.790> been<00:02:30.970> cleared<00:02:31.330> we're<00:02:31.660> going<00:02:31.780> to<00:02:31.840> do<00:02:31.960> a

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
thing's been cleared we're going to do a

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.890 
thing's been cleared we're going to do a
idle<00:02:32.650> realer<00:02:33.160> you<00:02:33.820> can<00:02:33.940> do<00:02:34.030> this<00:02:34.180> by<00:02:34.330> starting

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
idle realer you can do this by starting

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.990 
idle realer you can do this by starting
the<00:02:34.990> vehicle<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.650> letting<00:02:35.980> it<00:02:36.070> idle<00:02:36.459> without

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
the vehicle and letting it idle without

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.150 
the vehicle and letting it idle without
your<00:02:37.300> foot<00:02:37.480> on<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.690> throttle<00:02:37.900> but<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:38.740> offer

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
your foot on the throttle but I offer

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.770 
your foot on the throttle but I offer
two<00:02:39.430> minutes<00:02:39.760> then<00:02:40.330> we're<00:02:40.420> going<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.570> put<00:02:40.690> it

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
two minutes then we're going to put it

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.150 
two minutes then we're going to put it
in<00:02:40.870> gear<00:02:40.900> with<00:02:41.200> our<00:02:41.320> foot<00:02:41.500> on<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.680> brake<00:02:41.890> and

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
in gear with our foot on the brake and

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.190 
in gear with our foot on the brake and
let<00:02:42.640> it<00:02:42.820> relearn<00:02:43.150> that<00:02:43.360> for<00:02:43.630> two<00:02:43.750> minutes

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
let it relearn that for two minutes

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.080 
let it relearn that for two minutes
then<00:02:44.440> turn<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.680> air<00:02:44.830> conditioning<00:02:45.310> on<00:02:45.459> for

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
two minutes in order to let it allow to

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.480 
two minutes in order to let it allow to
compensate<00:02:49.300> for<00:02:50.050> the<00:02:50.170> new<00:02:50.290> engine<00:02:50.620> load<00:02:50.800> once
