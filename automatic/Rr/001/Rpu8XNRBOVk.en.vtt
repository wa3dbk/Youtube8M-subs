00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.000
 the first stage 6 12 years as I said 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.129
 that the first stage initiation 2 guys 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.580
 are of a radius of about 60 kilometers is 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:19.160
 obvious because they are minor are minor 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.039
 of 13 years 12 13 years can not be 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.800
 separate from their families 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.739
 and we try that being boys of the 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.050
 province get the highest level with 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:32.050
 them there is the golden one we said of the 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.629
 learning we try to take the 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.430
 maximum of tools to then be able 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.250
 run any game system with 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.989
 all individual tactical technician 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.280
 individual technical training or 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.989
 group as much so that they can 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.260
 have tail control two legs 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:53.290
 use of the head game to understand 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.330
 the domain of space orienting well 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.750
 the controls forward or toward 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:01.570
 where they want etc. not that 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.690
 we try to get it 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.880
 from there starting at age 13 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.280
 and the recruitment begins 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.930
 means that the villarreal is going to 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.090
 fix in last year's fry in 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.740
 children's first children's 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.210
 of second the cadets of first the 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.710
 mainly second cadets 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.040
 comfort of capture time 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.020
 previously we do catch up but of 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.240
 a tiny radio or sixty that what 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.740
 We have presented the best around here 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.490
 from there we will try to have what 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.310
 best of Spain knowing that at 13 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.840
 14 years old it's hard to get him out of the house 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.490
 and sometimes we need to have a 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.640
 special conditions and patience 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.979
 because good they go home more times 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.050
 sometimes we prioritize what they can return 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.470
 with his parents going to play x match 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.090
 with the fact of the end having it in the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.970
 two sites and that is going better 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.070
 from 15 go better and the boys 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.450
 they no longer ask us to practically go to 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.329
 house are comfortable here 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.490
 adapted to the lifestyle of the style 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.619
 of game and style of training to 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.929
 everything then have a little bit of 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.000
 global adaptation that we say then 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.060
 they are already players who are beginning to feel 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.160
 the real day profile 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.920
 and they have youth because we sign less 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.330
 because it is not the one from which there is no longer 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.030
 the level players would only be the 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.380
 good equipment that happens that thing 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.819
 before I went for children of second 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.690
 child and first we adapt by 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.840
 fry why because it really seems 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.090
 that you have to run more than the others 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.980
 and yes it is true that the farther 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.050
 that is, the farther away from what 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.560
 Professional fry plus risk has 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.970
 wrong but you have to go 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.769
 assuming the risk what happens that 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.220
 there will be more mistakes capturing 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.220
 more moment
