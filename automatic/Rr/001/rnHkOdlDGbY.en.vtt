for<00:02:02.360> a<00:02:02.450> lot<00:02:02.569> of<00:02:02.630> people<00:02:03.159> now<00:02:04.159> I'm<00:02:04.220> sure<00:02:04.369> there

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
for a lot of people now I'm sure there

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.949 
for a lot of people now I'm sure there
are<00:02:04.580> many<00:02:04.729> more<00:02:04.909> options<00:02:05.060> for<00:02:05.420> this<00:02:05.539> card<00:02:05.750> but

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:05.959 
are many more options for this card but

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.300 
are many more options for this card but
that's<00:02:06.140> one<00:02:06.319> of<00:02:06.409> the<00:02:06.470> reasons<00:02:06.740> I<00:02:06.830> think<00:02:06.920> it

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
that's one of the reasons I think it

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.919 
that's one of the reasons I think it
would<00:02:07.399> be<00:02:07.520> really<00:02:07.880> useful<00:02:07.909> same<00:02:08.720> goes<00:02:08.899> for

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
would be really useful same goes for

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.359 
would be really useful same goes for
videographers<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:09.619> stuff<00:02:09.890> like<00:02:09.979> that<00:02:10.160> too
