as a part of a complete deck i guess in

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.120 
as a part of a complete deck i guess in
my<00:01:06.720> opinion<00:01:07.050> it's<00:01:07.200> out<00:01:07.290> with<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.410> two<00:01:07.950> extra

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
my opinion it's out with the two extra

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.980 
my opinion it's out with the two extra
dollars<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.360> think<00:01:09.690> it's<00:01:09.780> more<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.960> a

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
dollars but I think it's more of a

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.780 
dollars but I think it's more of a
supply<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.410> demand<00:01:10.500> type<00:01:10.920> thing<00:01:11.160> people<00:01:11.670> love

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
supply and demand type thing people love

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.540 
supply and demand type thing people love
the<00:01:11.940> tins<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:13.350> company<00:01:13.740> figured<00:01:14.040> hey<00:01:14.310> we

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
the tins and the company figured hey we

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.130 
the tins and the company figured hey we
can<00:01:14.760> probably<00:01:15.030> charge<00:01:15.390> more<00:01:15.690> for<00:01:15.720> these<00:01:15.930> and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
can probably charge more for these and

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.680 
can probably charge more for these and
still<00:01:16.320> sell<00:01:16.590> them<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.010> well<00:01:17.730> that's<00:01:18.000> what<00:01:18.390> they

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
still sell them so well that's what they

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.440 
still sell them so well that's what they
have<00:01:18.720> done<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.530> as<00:01:20.340> plastics<00:01:20.909> thicker<00:01:21.330> than

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
have done and as plastics thicker than

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.850 
have done and as plastics thicker than
usual<00:01:21.780> as<00:01:21.930> well<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.409> guess<00:01:22.650> they've

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
usual as well so I guess they've

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.430
