00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.550 
is in fact graphite the term lead is a
common<00:04:16.120> misconception<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:20.019> reason<00:04:20.380> why<00:04:20.500> the

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
common misconception the reason why the

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.110 
common misconception the reason why the
bubbles<00:04:21.040> are<00:04:21.190> bigger<00:04:21.430> is<00:04:21.579> because<00:04:21.940> there's

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
bubbles are bigger is because there's

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.909 
bubbles are bigger is because there's
less<00:04:22.240> surface<00:04:22.570> area<00:04:22.930> for<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.440> bubbles<00:04:23.830> to

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
less surface area for the bubbles to

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.340 
less surface area for the bubbles to
form<00:04:23.950> causing<00:04:24.700> bigger<00:04:24.880> bubbles<00:04:25.390> there's<00:04:26.140> more

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
form causing bigger bubbles there's more

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.200 
form causing bigger bubbles there's more
surface<00:04:26.590> area<00:04:26.860> there's<00:04:27.250> smaller<00:04:27.610> bubbles<00:04:27.880> but

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
surface area there's smaller bubbles but

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:36.810 
surface area there's smaller bubbles but
in<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.419> same<00:04:28.600> amount<00:04:35.190> thanks<00:04:36.190> for<00:04:36.370> watching

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
in the same amount thanks for watching

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.410 
in the same amount thanks for watching
and<00:04:36.970> remember<00:04:37.870> to<00:04:38.140> be<00:04:38.380> safe
