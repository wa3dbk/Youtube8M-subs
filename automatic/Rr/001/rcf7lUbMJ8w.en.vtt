00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:18.220
 [music] 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.890
 Good day the pilot caught 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:24.279
 Canadians and everyone and today's video is not 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.460
 yak-9 t although this fight is nothing special 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.500
 will stand in the background want you the most 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.619
 the main thing is that now on the channel 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.110
 30 thousand subscribers of course even more 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:39.489
 30 thousand and somewhere 30500 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:42.670
 and it is largely largely merit 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:45.550
 you my subscribers and of course us 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.309
 who make this stuff for you 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.649
 in general, of course, the last moment 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.260
 quite a lot of podcast 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.879
 time then it was from not mistaken 10 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.399
 thousand people on the channel it seemed to me that 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.890
 it is very very much now i see 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.640
 30,000 and understand that there is still what 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.839
 seeks 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.070
 In general, probably a little bit the figure is not 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.850
 every day but let's say 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:13.659
 a monthly increase of about five thousand 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.780
 man somewhere 800 thousand views but 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.030
 from 800 to a million views of all videos 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.180
 a month right now we go on such 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.530
 of course they are shocking and can not 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.910
 not happy with a huge amount 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.010
 repost comments 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.640
 especially repost they are also very strong 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.920
 help generally what happened with that 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.100
 moment of 100 moment was igromir on 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:40.060
 which I have seen with many of you 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:43.510
 after that there was of course she talk 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.610
 the grounds were all this later on 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.740
 contests we have tried for you 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.680
 hold it then one of them soon 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.830
 will end but rather let him down 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.210
 finally here's how later of course 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.490
 there was this whole excommunication situation 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.800
 official support at the beginning was 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.750
 very hard 10 very hard but i'm not 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.810
 I can not thank you and probably 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.090
 Anton joined me that well here 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.390
 without you it would be much harder to come 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.209
 on just took and overwhelmed me in the game in 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.790
 PM vkontakte on u tube wherever 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:23.200
 only can be a huge amount 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:26.230
 just kind words of support wishes and 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.320
 so on, many of ZAZ have held the channel 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.510
 we like something else that is all 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.140
 your help how she was she 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.720
 was very necessary important and its fruit is this 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.730
 that now the channel has become even more 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.850
 popular, I have more strength to 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.640
 order to make a video and like that 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.040
 carry something telling you new 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.750
 I try to introduce new rubrics of course 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.700
 same due to numerous requests here 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.590
 recently there was even an arcade 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.240
 despite the fact that someone seemed to me 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.390
 that his year never come back and 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.550
 maybe this rubric will be let's say 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.310
 so permanent maybe not so frequent 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.800
 but constantly she is likely to become 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.370
 that's of course huge huge 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:12.580
 the amount was various positive 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:18.490
 reviews from other headings is all of course 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:20.920
 same your merit but in much further channel 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.830
 later , in all this time, 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.370
 almost daily broadcast then 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:30.270
 eat once a day do you have any 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.430
 content on war thunder meaning it is either 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.300
 Stream either nuts or review or some 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.959
 analytics 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.700
 or some other fun stuff 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.849
 at night something constantly goes out and you 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.300
 Feel free to open youtube in the evening and 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.400
 watch new video 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.980
 but I think for you who are interested 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.490
 the game is certain certain 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.130
 the pros are also channel almost completely 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.070
 currently covers the whole 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:02.150
 information all new items that go into 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:04.700
 art given and principle you do not need there 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.920
 look for something else to learn all 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.110
 necessary information is present at 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.450
 channel there is even a video but there by 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.880
 I do not know how to adjust the graphics 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.519
 How to get there Yes, everyone knows how it is 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.920
 bratchan generally good to take that bad 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.500
 that is, the principle of the channel can be on 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.960
 Currently find all unfortunately not 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.450
 everyone knows how to use this search 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.280
 Of course, minus but I hope that this 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.130
 the situation will be such a deal but 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.860
 and if she won't but we'll do more 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.110
 video repeat and so on some 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.360
 the planes have already been rethought that is 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.930
 were made re playing this 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:45.410
 for example spitfire to 16 is yak-3 my 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:48.050
 Favorite is Foka 5, that is, in principle 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.720
 many many were done were made 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.480
 guides on maneuver which but by main 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.130
 that is , the streams are now collected 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.220
 practically but practically 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.270
 collects even more sometimes thousands of people 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.270
 in the middle of the working week we manage 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.940
 collect there 950 that is even to the site 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.460
 channel for 200 people there services but 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.760
 we collect on stream and that is and among 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.650
 hematite ie channel principle channel 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.870
 Of course, developing at the moment 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.510
 channel relies heavily in development 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.480
 the game itself because but unfortunately it 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.190
 still not as well known as 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.780
 me and i think the developers but 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.180
 developers are probably even more than not 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.110
 although who knows we each have 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.450
 some desire 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.880
 Here Anton began to do some new 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:36.900
 rubrics he got better with his voice 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:40.230
 many noted but who did not note but he 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:43.920
 also has its own chip so I think, too, 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:47.070
 very very grateful to you for all your 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:51.720
 positive feedback for this feed back 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:53.700
 by the nose a huge huge huge grono 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.620
 support don't stop saying it'll 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.870
 speak because it is very very 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:01.160
 important at the moment while the channel is not yet 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:04.080
 became very cool important and so on 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.880
 while i try to answer you all 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.800
 vkontakte by the way I thought that well, all I'm here 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.890
 already a little bit and stop because it 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.690
 impossible 30,000 people 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.730
 the character sits responds vkontakte well 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.860
 almost all try to answer 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.320
 juice can but i think it's early or 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.630
 I don't have enough late 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:25.170
 It happens but I do not know yet until I 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:27.420
 all the same to you I answer here the last 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:30.210
 while the video began to go out fuh a.d. 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.280
 you I think it noticed again this 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.590
 thanks to your support with no longer 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.920
 stream pack full walk but not 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:40.170
 it turns out but I think that in the near 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.310
 time and this problem will also be solved 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.040
 and 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:47.400
 the channel will be released on a brand new one 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:50.550
 level is good it is always good 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.840
 something new something better and work 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.130
 over the improvement of the content will 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:59.100
 occur constantly and not only 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:01.050
 need quantitative and qualitative and above 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.550
 many other other questions there is 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.460
 a huge number of people have stickers 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:09.840

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:11.430
 and but there is a lot of plans to do 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.650
 sea plans 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.260
 the main thing is not to interfere with the main thing 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.820

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.650
