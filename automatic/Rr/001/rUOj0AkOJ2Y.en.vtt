out<00:01:21.659> with<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> cradle<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.260> everybody's<00:01:22.710> putting

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
out with a cradle to everybody's putting

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.469 
out with a cradle to everybody's putting
the<00:01:23.310> right<00:01:23.400> phone<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.820> car<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.210> using<00:01:24.450> it

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
the right phone in the car and using it

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.630 
the right phone in the car and using it
as<00:01:24.540> GPS<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.229> what's<00:01:25.830> unique<00:01:26.100> about<00:01:26.190> this<00:01:26.430> moved

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
as GPS so what's unique about this moved

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.190 
as GPS so what's unique about this moved
in<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.820> jail<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.090> iphone<00:01:27.360> holder<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.840> couple

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
in the jail and iphone holder a couple

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.050 
in the jail and iphone holder a couple
of<00:01:28.290> things<00:01:28.470> once<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.070> first<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.790> all<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.970> has

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
of things once it first of all it has

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.660 
of things once it first of all it has
gps<00:01:30.240> insiders<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.830> of<00:01:31.890> course<00:01:31.950> as<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> gps

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
gps insiders so of course as a gps

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.250 
gps insiders so of course as a gps
company<00:01:33.120> we<00:01:33.510> really<00:01:33.750> wants<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.080> make<00:01:34.229> sure

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
company we really wants to make sure

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.490 
company we really wants to make sure
that<00:01:34.680> we<00:01:34.890> brought<00:01:35.400> gps<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.330> the<00:01:36.960> GPS<00:01:37.320> chip

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
that we brought gps to this the GPS chip

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.780 
that we brought gps to this the GPS chip
set<00:01:37.680> inside<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> device<00:01:38.159> yourselves<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.729> key

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
set inside the device yourselves a key

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.880 
set inside the device yourselves a key
so<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.150> enhances<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.990> technically<00:01:40.320> gps

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
so it enhances the the technically gps

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.039 
so it enhances the the technically gps
capability<00:01:41.370> of<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.490> iphone<00:01:41.790> corrects<00:01:42.210> it

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
capability of the iphone corrects it

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.810 
capability of the iphone corrects it
also<00:01:43.229> has<00:01:43.320> bluetooth<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.369> can<00:01:44.520> do

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
also has bluetooth so that you can do

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.170 
also has bluetooth so that you can do
hands-free<00:01:45.450> calling<00:01:45.750> across<00:01:46.260> the<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.549> cradle

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
hands-free calling across the the cradle

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.960 
hands-free calling across the the cradle
as<00:01:48.270> well<00:01:48.650> and<00:01:49.650> you'd<00:01:50.220> like<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.369> do<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.729> either

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
as well and you'd like to do that either

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.530 
as well and you'd like to do that either

so<00:02:28.260> let's<00:02:28.440> just<00:02:28.650> put<00:02:28.800> this<00:02:28.830> one<00:02:29.040> in<00:02:29.160> here<00:02:29.340> okay

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
so let's just put this one in here okay

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.370 
so let's just put this one in here okay
i'll<00:02:29.910> show<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.209> that<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:30.989> you'll<00:02:31.110> notice<00:02:31.230> that
