trade man you don't spill anything and

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.140 
trade man you don't spill anything and
make<00:02:13.750> sure<00:02:13.900> that<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.200> tray<00:02:14.500> is<00:02:14.739> a

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
make sure that the tray is a

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.610 
make sure that the tray is a
horizontally<00:02:16.150> right<00:02:16.780> so<00:02:17.020> I'll<00:02:17.110> put<00:02:17.320> a<00:02:17.350> little

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
horizontally right so I'll put a little

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.710 
horizontally right so I'll put a little
envelope<00:02:18.160> at<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.580> back<00:02:18.730> of<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.120> tray<00:02:19.390> just<00:02:19.570> to

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
envelope at the back of the tray just to

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.699 
envelope at the back of the tray just to
make<00:02:19.840> sure<00:02:19.870> it's<00:02:20.140> straight<00:02:20.380> cause<00:02:20.590> it's

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
make sure it's straight cause it's

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.500 
make sure it's straight cause it's
slightly<00:02:21.010> tilted<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.790> then<00:02:21.940> you<00:02:22.030> pour<00:02:22.299> some

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
slightly tilted and then you pour some

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.400 
slightly tilted and then you pour some
more<00:02:22.630> water<00:02:22.870> on<00:02:23.320> top<00:02:24.040> as<00:02:24.280> you<00:02:24.340> can<00:02:24.430> see<00:02:24.730> and

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
more water on top as you can see and

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.750 
more water on top as you can see and
until<00:02:26.410> you<00:02:26.590> kind<00:02:26.860> of<00:02:26.920> get<00:02:27.100> this<00:02:27.220> little<00:02:27.519> kind

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
until you kind of get this little kind

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.500 
until you kind of get this little kind
of<00:02:27.850> like<00:02:28.890> trickle<00:02:29.890> of<00:02:30.100> water<00:02:30.130> then<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.360> can

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
of like trickle of water then you can

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.110 
of like trickle of water then you can
place<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:32.290> light<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:33.340> redhead<00:02:33.730> which<00:02:33.850> I<00:02:33.940> have

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
place the light the redhead which I have

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.810 
place the light the redhead which I have
just<00:02:34.900> over<00:02:35.080> it<00:02:35.530> pointing<00:02:35.980> downwards<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:36.730> the

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
just over it pointing downwards and the

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:37.860 
just over it pointing downwards and the
reason<00:02:37.090> why<00:02:37.150> it's<00:02:37.269> pointing<00:02:37.510> downwards

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
reason why it's pointing downwards

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.080 
reason why it's pointing downwards
because<00:02:38.019> I<00:02:38.080> want<00:02:38.260> I<00:02:38.560> want<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:39.070> mirror<00:02:39.820> and

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
because I want I want the mirror and

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.720 
because I want I want the mirror and
water<00:02:40.269> to<00:02:40.510> reflect<00:02:40.930> upwards<00:02:41.560> so<00:02:42.310> that's<00:02:42.519> why

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
water to reflect upwards so that's why

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.330 
water to reflect upwards so that's why
and<00:02:42.970> I've<00:02:43.060> got<00:02:43.239> the<00:02:43.420> hairdryer<00:02:44.380> just<00:02:45.010> slightly

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
and I've got the hairdryer just slightly

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.300 
and I've got the hairdryer just slightly
off<00:02:45.610> to<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:46.900> my<00:02:47.049> left<00:02:47.260> and<00:02:47.530> everything<00:02:47.860> blowing

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
off to to my left and everything blowing

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.680 
off to to my left and everything blowing
so<00:02:48.430> it<00:02:48.549> kind<00:02:48.700> of<00:02:48.790> as<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.060> can<00:02:49.269> see<00:02:49.390> gives<00:02:49.570> a

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
so it kind of as you can see gives a

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.960 
so it kind of as you can see gives a
little<00:02:49.840> bit<00:02:49.989> of<00:02:50.079> a<00:02:50.170> ripple<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.980> stuff<00:02:51.400> this

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
little bit of a ripple and stuff this

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.380 
little bit of a ripple and stuff this
will<00:02:52.329> reflect<00:02:52.690> on<00:02:53.440> to<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.370> background<00:02:54.790> and

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
will reflect on to the background and

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.729 
will reflect on to the background and
the<00:02:55.480> moment<00:02:55.810> you<00:02:55.870> can't<00:02:56.079> see<00:02:56.320> that<00:02:56.470> tough

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
the moment you can't see that tough

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.890 
the moment you can't see that tough
because<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.100> haven't<00:02:57.510> increased<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.690> shutter

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
because I haven't increased the shutter

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.140 
because I haven't increased the shutter
speed<00:02:59.049> shutter<00:02:59.829> speed<00:03:00.160> allows<00:03:00.579> you<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:00.910> be

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
speed shutter speed allows you to be

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.630 
speed shutter speed allows you to be
able<00:03:01.360> to<00:03:01.420> see<00:03:01.600> detail<00:03:02.170> so<00:03:02.890> at<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.220> moment<00:03:03.549> now

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
able to see detail so at the moment now

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.740 
able to see detail so at the moment now
I<00:03:03.670> can't<00:03:03.940> see<00:03:04.090> much<00:03:04.239> detail<00:03:04.390> on<00:03:04.600> the

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
I can't see much detail on the

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.180 
I can't see much detail on the
background<00:03:05.110> because<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.320> shutter<00:03:05.500> speed<00:03:05.680> is

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
background because the shutter speed is

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.130 
background because the shutter speed is
it's<00:03:07.150> running<00:03:07.329> quite<00:03:07.600> slow

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
it's running quite slow

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.630 
it's running quite slow
I<00:03:08.170> want<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:08.590> speed<00:03:08.980> up<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.310> shutter<00:03:09.519> speed

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
I want to speed up the shutter speed

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.310 
I want to speed up the shutter speed
they<00:03:09.910> be<00:03:10.090> able<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.329> see<00:03:10.570> but<00:03:10.750> I've<00:03:10.810> got<00:03:10.959> mice<00:03:11.110> up

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
they be able to see but I've got mice up

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.050 
they be able to see but I've got mice up
there<00:03:11.590> ready<00:03:11.769> I've<00:03:12.220> got<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.519> light<00:03:12.730> put<00:03:12.940> in

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
there ready I've got the light put in

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.780 
there ready I've got the light put in
there<00:03:13.269> I've<00:03:13.329> got<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.600> mirror<00:03:14.230> put<00:03:14.530> in<00:03:14.790> the

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
there I've got the mirror put in the

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.699 
there I've got the mirror put in the
like<00:03:16.000> putting<00:03:16.360> onto<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.750> mirror<00:03:16.989> which<00:03:17.410> now

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
like putting onto the mirror which now

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.620 
like putting onto the mirror which now
reflects<00:03:18.250> onto<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.850> background<00:03:19.329> and<00:03:19.540> when

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
reflects onto the background and when

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.720 
reflects onto the background and when
you<00:03:19.690> use<00:03:19.870> that<00:03:19.900> background<00:03:20.470> basically<00:03:21.190> as<00:03:21.670> a

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
you use that background basically as a

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.760 
you use that background basically as a
camera<00:03:22.150> like<00:03:22.269> an<00:03:22.390> animated<00:03:22.810> background<00:03:23.349> so<00:03:23.590> as

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
camera like an animated background so as

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.580 
camera like an animated background so as
fixes<00:03:24.310> basically<00:03:25.150> they're<00:03:25.390> not<00:03:25.900> now<00:03:26.080> increase

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
fixes basically they're not now increase

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.630 
fixes basically they're not now increase
the<00:03:26.680> shutter<00:03:26.800> speed<00:03:26.980> you<00:03:27.129> can<00:03:27.280> see<00:03:27.400> is<00:03:27.459> a<00:03:27.520> bit

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
the shutter speed you can see is a bit

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.540 
the shutter speed you can see is a bit
more<00:03:27.790> orange<00:03:28.150> and

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
more orange and

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.610 
more orange and
more<00:03:28.670> darker<00:03:29.120> now<00:03:29.270> so<00:03:29.870> you'd<00:03:30.020> be<00:03:30.140> able<00:03:30.290> to<00:03:30.410> see

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
more darker now so you'd be able to see

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.190 
more darker now so you'd be able to see
more<00:03:30.830> detail<00:03:31.420> as<00:03:32.420> you<00:03:32.480> can<00:03:32.630> see<00:03:32.840> as<00:03:33.020> it's

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
more detail as you can see as it's

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.960 
more detail as you can see as it's
getting<00:03:33.410> darker<00:03:33.710> that's<00:03:33.890> up<00:03:34.040> I'm<00:03:34.280> increasing

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
getting darker that's up I'm increasing

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.090 
getting darker that's up I'm increasing
the<00:03:35.030> shutter<00:03:35.210> speed<00:03:35.390> now<00:03:36.320> you<00:03:36.380> can<00:03:36.740> see<00:03:36.920> the

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
the shutter speed now you can see the

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.730 
the shutter speed now you can see the
ripples<00:03:37.390> you<00:03:38.390> can<00:03:38.540> see<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:38.780> ripples<00:03:38.960> hat<00:03:39.440> has

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
ripples you can see the ripples hat has

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.410 
ripples you can see the ripples hat has
it<00:03:39.890> kind<00:03:40.160> of<00:03:40.220> reflects<00:03:40.670> now<00:03:40.880> this<00:03:41.060> will<00:03:41.240> look

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
it kind of reflects now this will look

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.270 
it kind of reflects now this will look
good<00:03:41.570> on<00:03:41.720> anything<00:03:42.200> you<00:03:42.710> don't<00:03:42.830> have<00:03:43.040> to<00:03:43.160> have

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
good on anything you don't have to have

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.560 
good on anything you don't have to have
a<00:03:43.310> background<00:03:43.550> if<00:03:43.880> you've<00:03:44.000> got<00:03:44.120> a<00:03:44.150> nice<00:03:44.360> kind

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
a background if you've got a nice kind

quite<00:04:31.730> harsh<00:04:32.060> but<00:04:32.690> I<00:04:32.750> need<00:04:33.140> the<00:04:33.350> light<00:04:33.530> to<00:04:33.680> be

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
quite harsh but I need the light to be

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.380 
quite harsh but I need the light to be
this<00:04:33.950> bright<00:04:34.310> basically<00:04:35.090> in<00:04:35.150> everything

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
this bright basically in everything

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.020 
this bright basically in everything
stuff<00:04:35.690> and<00:04:36.050> now<00:04:36.740> once<00:04:37.100> of<00:04:37.250> increase<00:04:37.880> the

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
stuff and now once of increase the

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.700 
stuff and now once of increase the
shutter<00:04:38.180> speed<00:04:38.390> that<00:04:38.870> will<00:04:39.050> then<00:04:39.169> reduce<00:04:39.680> the

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
shutter speed that will then reduce the

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.230 
shutter speed that will then reduce the
amount<00:04:40.130> of<00:04:40.160> light<00:04:40.370> that<00:04:40.520> goes<00:04:40.669> into<00:04:40.850> the<00:04:41.000> lens

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
amount of light that goes into the lens

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.720 
amount of light that goes into the lens
you<00:04:41.450> get<00:04:41.570> this<00:04:41.810> kind<00:04:42.110> of<00:04:42.169> look<00:04:42.730> especially

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
you get this kind of look especially

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.180 
you get this kind of look especially
when<00:04:43.850> you<00:04:43.970> come<00:04:44.150> a<00:04:44.210> lack<00:04:44.450> and<00:04:45.080> blur<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:45.980> lens

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
when you come a lack and blur the lens

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.520 
when you come a lack and blur the lens
basically<00:04:46.880> so<00:04:47.270> that<00:04:47.419> way<00:04:47.630> you<00:04:47.690> can<00:04:48.169> get<00:04:48.380> all

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
basically so that way you can get all

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.840 
basically so that way you can get all
these<00:04:48.620> kind<00:04:48.890> of<00:04:48.980> beautiful<00:04:49.340> highlights<00:04:49.730> so

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
these kind of beautiful highlights so

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.300 
these kind of beautiful highlights so
you<00:04:49.940> can<00:04:50.060> bring<00:04:50.240> the<00:04:50.530> focus<00:04:51.530> in<00:04:51.740> and<00:04:51.890> out<00:04:52.040> to

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
you can bring the focus in and out to

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.310 
you can bring the focus in and out to
get<00:04:52.430> various<00:04:53.060> effects<00:04:53.419> so<00:04:53.630> you<00:04:53.690> can<00:04:53.870> see<00:04:54.080> as

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
get various effects so you can see as

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.380 
get various effects so you can see as
the<00:04:55.040> water<00:04:55.250> is<00:04:55.520> kind<00:04:55.760> of<00:04:55.850> hitting<00:04:56.090> the<00:04:56.210> water

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
the water is kind of hitting the water

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.730 
the water is kind of hitting the water
you're<00:04:56.780> getting<00:04:56.840> these<00:04:57.020> ripples<00:04:57.440> you<00:04:57.530> can

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
you're getting these ripples you can

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.550 
you're getting these ripples you can
pull<00:04:57.919> the<00:04:58.100> that<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.820> the<00:04:59.050> drive<00:05:00.050> back<00:05:00.320> or

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
pull the that the the drive back or

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.680 
pull the that the the drive back or
forward<00:05:00.860> to<00:05:01.100> kind<00:05:01.310> of<00:05:01.370> get<00:05:01.580> over<00:05:01.910> faster

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
forward to kind of get over faster

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.690 
forward to kind of get over faster
ripples<00:05:03.020> or<00:05:03.169> slower<00:05:03.410> ripples<00:05:03.770> but<00:05:04.250> stuff<00:05:04.520> as

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
ripples or slower ripples but stuff as

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.700 
ripples or slower ripples but stuff as
you<00:05:04.820> can<00:05:04.970> see<00:05:05.180> now<00:05:05.900> what's<00:05:06.140> of<00:05:06.290> the<00:05:06.440> kind<00:05:06.620> of

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710

I'm<00:05:14.270> using<00:05:14.570> the<00:05:14.900> camera<00:05:15.320> to<00:05:15.350> pan<00:05:15.710> across

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
I'm using the camera to pan across

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.880 
I'm using the camera to pan across
basically<00:05:17.180> and<00:05:17.419> the<00:05:17.810> highlights<00:05:18.380> are<00:05:18.620> really

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
basically and the highlights are really

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.380 
basically and the highlights are really
really<00:05:19.100> beautiful<00:05:19.280> because<00:05:19.970> I'm<00:05:20.060> using<00:05:20.240> the

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
really beautiful because I'm using the

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.760 
really beautiful because I'm using the
fast<00:05:20.630> shutter<00:05:20.810> speed<00:05:21.110> you're<00:05:21.260> able<00:05:21.530> to<00:05:21.560> see

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
fast shutter speed you're able to see

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.620 
fast shutter speed you're able to see
the<00:05:21.800> detail<00:05:22.310> and<00:05:22.490> now<00:05:22.730> it's<00:05:22.910> not<00:05:22.970> too<00:05:23.120> bright

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
the detail and now it's not too bright

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.240 
the detail and now it's not too bright
even<00:05:23.960> though<00:05:24.110> way<00:05:24.290> you<00:05:24.350> saw<00:05:24.590> before<00:05:24.770> the<00:05:25.100> LAT

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
even though way you saw before the LAT

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.350 
even though way you saw before the LAT
look<00:05:25.400> really<00:05:25.640> ready<00:05:25.820> bright<00:05:26.060> but<00:05:26.210> on<00:05:26.270> the

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
look really ready bright but on the

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.090 
look really ready bright but on the
camera<00:05:26.780> you<00:05:27.200> can<00:05:27.380> see<00:05:27.410> all<00:05:27.620> the<00:05:27.740> detail

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
camera you can see all the detail

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.310 
camera you can see all the detail
because<00:05:28.310> of<00:05:28.430> the<00:05:28.580> far<00:05:28.820> shutter<00:05:29.060> speed<00:05:29.390> this<00:05:30.080> I

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320
