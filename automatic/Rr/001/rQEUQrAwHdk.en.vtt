actual<00:02:39.000> strap<00:02:39.510> themselves<00:02:40.820> firstly<00:02:41.820> I<00:02:41.850> would

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
actual strap themselves firstly I would

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.940 
actual strap themselves firstly I would
have<00:02:42.270> loved<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:42.750> see<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.260> strap<00:02:43.650> being

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
have loved to see the strap being

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.610 
have loved to see the strap being
detachable<00:02:44.520> I<00:02:45.080> actually<00:02:46.080> I'm<00:02:46.170> not<00:02:46.290> sure<00:02:46.470> I'm

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
detachable I actually I'm not sure I'm

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.020 
detachable I actually I'm not sure I'm
seeing<00:02:46.920> all<00:02:47.130> of<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.310> million<00:02:47.610> dollar<00:02:47.760> range

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
seeing all of the million dollar range

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.460 
seeing all of the million dollar range
but<00:02:48.330> I<00:02:48.360> don't<00:02:48.540> think<00:02:48.660> any<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:48.960> the<00:02:49.050> straps<00:02:49.320> are

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
but I don't think any of the straps are

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.650 
but I don't think any of the straps are
the<00:02:49.500> taxable<00:02:49.920> but<00:02:50.130> in<00:02:50.580> this<00:02:50.850> super<00:02:51.360> small

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
the taxable but in this super small

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.270 
the taxable but in this super small
compact<00:02:52.080> size<00:02:52.410> I<00:02:52.740> think<00:02:52.800> that<00:02:53.040> should<00:02:53.220> be

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
compact size I think that should be

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.090 
compact size I think that should be
detachable<00:02:53.820> because<00:02:54.210> the<00:02:54.900> actual<00:02:55.320> camera<00:02:55.860> bag

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
detachable because the actual camera bag

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.720 
detachable because the actual camera bag
or<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:57.030> pouch<00:02:57.270> itself<00:02:57.810> does<00:02:58.710> act<00:02:59.010> as<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.280> really

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
or the pouch itself does act as a really

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.720 
or the pouch itself does act as a really
nice<00:02:59.940> sort<00:03:00.330> of<00:03:00.480> protective<00:03:01.320> pouch<00:03:01.710> for<00:03:02.520> your

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
nice sort of protective pouch for your

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.330 
nice sort of protective pouch for your

functionality and versatility if they

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.450 
functionality and versatility if they

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
around for a few hours testing this

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.610

actually used it and as happy as I was

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.050 
actually used it and as happy as I was
with<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.590> protection<00:04:02.160> that<00:04:02.280> provided<00:04:02.880> and

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
with the protection that provided and

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.410 
with the protection that provided and
the<00:04:03.120> size<00:04:03.480> it<00:04:03.930> was<00:04:03.980> it<00:04:04.980> continually<00:04:05.730> slid<00:04:06.240> off

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
really just in the bag and this is when

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.980

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.630 
it's sort of just hanging on the left
hand<00:04:13.260> or<00:04:13.440> more<00:04:13.620> right<00:04:13.770> hand<00:04:14.040> side<00:04:14.250> which<00:04:14.459> other

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
obviously don't have that issue but when

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.580

two<00:04:36.460> you've<00:04:36.790> got<00:04:36.820> extremely<00:04:37.540> frustrating<00:04:38.260> to

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
two you've got extremely frustrating to

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.170 
two you've got extremely frustrating to
the<00:04:38.890> point<00:04:39.130> where<00:04:39.340> I<00:04:39.370> just<00:04:39.760> didn't<00:04:40.000> feel<00:04:40.120> like

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
the point where I just didn't feel like

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.220 
the point where I just didn't feel like
walking<00:04:40.600> around<00:04:40.690> with<00:04:40.810> it<00:04:40.930> and<00:04:41.050> I<00:04:41.140> actually

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
walking around with it and I actually

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.080 
walking around with it and I actually
pulled<00:04:42.040> it<00:04:42.100> off<00:04:42.220> my<00:04:42.370> shoulder<00:04:42.760> and<00:04:42.850> I<00:04:42.940> was

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
pulled it off my shoulder and I was

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.570 
pulled it off my shoulder and I was
carrying<00:04:43.540> it<00:04:43.660> around<00:04:43.860> just<00:04:44.860> holding<00:04:45.280> it<00:04:45.310> in<00:04:45.430> my

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
carrying it around just holding it in my

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.810 
carrying it around just holding it in my
hands<00:04:46.000> so<00:04:46.180> it's<00:04:46.690> a<00:04:46.840> really<00:04:47.110> quick<00:04:47.470> fix<00:04:47.920> that

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
hands so it's a really quick fix that

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.700 
hands so it's a really quick fix that
Crumpler<00:04:49.300> could<00:04:49.630> implement<00:04:50.080> but<00:04:50.350> I<00:04:50.410> think<00:04:50.650> it

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
Crumpler could implement but I think it

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.710 
Crumpler could implement but I think it
would<00:04:50.830> definitely<00:04:51.010> improve<00:04:51.760> the<00:04:51.970> usage<00:04:52.480> and

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
would definitely improve the usage and

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.740 
would definitely improve the usage and
the<00:04:52.930> user<00:04:53.200> experience<00:04:53.580> with<00:04:54.580> the<00:04:54.850> 2<00:04:55.510> million

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
the user experience with the 2 million

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.800 
the user experience with the 2 million
dollar<00:04:55.870> home<00:04:56.290> I<00:04:56.700> do<00:04:57.700> think<00:04:58.300> that<00:04:58.390> some<00:04:58.630> of<00:04:58.720> the

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
dollar home I do think that some of the

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.620 
dollar home I do think that some of the
larger<00:04:59.230> ones<00:04:59.440> doing<00:05:00.400> your<00:05:00.640> five<00:05:01.000> six<00:05:01.390> and

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
larger ones doing your five six and

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.570 
larger ones doing your five six and
seven<00:05:01.690> million<00:05:02.230> dollars<00:05:02.650> I<00:05:02.830> think<00:05:02.890> they<00:05:03.520> do

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
seven million dollars I think they do

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.820 
seven million dollars I think they do
have<00:05:03.730> a<00:05:03.970> shoulder<00:05:04.390> pad<00:05:04.570> the<00:05:05.110> main<00:05:05.350> reason<00:05:05.800> for

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
have a shoulder pad the main reason for

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.030 
have a shoulder pad the main reason for
them<00:05:06.280> is<00:05:06.580> because<00:05:07.000> it's<00:05:07.360> quite<00:05:07.720> heavy<00:05:08.110> so<00:05:08.470> it

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
them is because it's quite heavy so it

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.770 
them is because it's quite heavy so it
gives<00:05:09.220> you<00:05:09.280> a<00:05:09.310> bit<00:05:09.460> of<00:05:09.550> protection<00:05:09.730> you<00:05:10.510> don't

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
gives you a bit of protection you don't

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.450 
gives you a bit of protection you don't
need<00:05:10.930> a<00:05:10.960> shoulder<00:05:11.290> pad<00:05:11.590> for<00:05:11.920> the<00:05:12.070> actual

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
need a shoulder pad for the actual

need a shoulder pad for the actual
weight<00:05:12.760> that<00:05:13.240> the<00:05:13.600> two<00:05:14.200> million<00:05:14.440> dollar<00:05:14.710> home

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
weight that the two million dollar home

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.220 
weight that the two million dollar home
ways<00:05:15.250> because<00:05:15.700> it's<00:05:15.850> very<00:05:16.090> light<00:05:16.450> but<00:05:16.720> the
