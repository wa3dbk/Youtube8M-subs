00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.170 
aspects but I would say that the issue
would<00:02:20.950> have<00:02:21.010> been<00:02:21.250> bigger<00:02:21.489> if<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:21.940> was<00:02:22.060> the

the<00:02:52.299> exact<00:02:52.720> filter<00:02:53.170> that<00:02:53.500> was<00:02:53.680> on<00:02:53.829> the<00:02:53.950> engine

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
the exact filter that was on the engine

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.250 
the exact filter that was on the engine
in<00:02:54.400> that<00:02:54.519> video<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.720> this<00:02:55.810> one<00:02:55.989> is<00:02:56.109> still

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
in that video and this one is still

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.430 
in that video and this one is still
sealed<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:58.060> it<00:02:58.420> came<00:02:58.600> from<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.900> small<00:02:59.019> engine

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
sealed and it came from a small engine

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.460 
sealed and it came from a small engine
shop<00:02:59.650> it's<00:02:59.920> very<00:03:00.190> very<00:03:00.489> a<00:03:00.989> well-built<00:03:01.989> filter

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
shop it's very very a well-built filter

going<00:03:06.519> to<00:03:06.579> bypass<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:07.120> valve<00:03:07.329> and<00:03:07.510> it's

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
going to bypass the valve and it's

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.990 
going to bypass the valve and it's
really<00:03:08.079> a<00:03:08.200> well<00:03:08.680> built<00:03:08.889> and<00:03:09.959> I<00:03:11.430> kind<00:03:12.430> of<00:03:12.519> get

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.849 
don't know what I'm doing and there's a
spark<00:03:21.280> plug<00:03:21.340> for<00:03:22.060> this<00:03:22.150> engine<00:03:22.500> so<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.560> exact

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
spark plug for this engine so the exact

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:27.979 
spark plug for this engine so the exact
one<00:03:24.069> they<00:03:24.220> recommend<00:03:24.669> yeah<00:03:25.450> RC<00:03:26.109> -<00:03:26.500> oh<00:03:26.530> I<00:03:26.739> see

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
one they recommend yeah RC - oh I see

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.379 
one they recommend yeah RC - oh I see
and<00:03:28.989> this<00:03:29.230> is<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.440> ng<00:03:29.980> candidate<00:03:30.489> that<00:03:30.910> I<00:03:30.970> run<00:03:31.239> in

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
and this is a ng candidate that I run in

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.430 
and this is a ng candidate that I run in
it<00:03:31.540> this<00:03:32.230> is<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:32.500> V<00:03:32.650> guru<00:03:32.889> pattern<00:03:33.419> so<00:03:34.419> bkr<00:03:35.049> FIV

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
it this is the V guru pattern so bkr FIV

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.559 
it this is the V guru pattern so bkr FIV
the<00:03:36.160> exact<00:03:36.459> same<00:03:36.669> sparkplug

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
the exact same sparkplug

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.170 
the exact same sparkplug
and<00:03:38.260> if<00:03:38.829> you<00:03:38.919> sit<00:03:39.220> them<00:03:39.310> side-by-side<00:03:39.549> they're

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
and if you sit them side-by-side they're

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.659

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669 
identical this type of person is going

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:44.280 
identical this type of person is going
to<00:03:42.730> come<00:03:42.819> out<00:03:42.970> and<00:03:43.209> tell<00:03:43.389> me<00:03:43.540> that<00:03:43.750> that's<00:03:44.049> not

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
to come out and tell me that that's not

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.050 
to come out and tell me that that's not
the<00:03:44.440> proper<00:03:44.709> spark<00:03:45.099> plug<00:03:45.310> it<00:03:45.489> won't<00:03:45.639> work<00:03:45.760> it's

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
the proper spark plug it won't work it's

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.629 
the proper spark plug it won't work it's
going<00:03:46.150> to<00:03:46.209> cause<00:03:46.450> problems<00:03:46.989> and<00:03:47.549> there's<00:03:48.549> a

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
going to cause problems and there's a

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.720 
going to cause problems and there's a
reason<00:03:49.000> people<00:03:49.180> get<00:03:49.450> irritated<00:03:50.200> if<00:03:51.069> you<00:03:51.280> go<00:03:51.489> I

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
reason people get irritated if you go I

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.909 
reason people get irritated if you go I
guess<00:03:52.090> they<00:03:52.239> call<00:03:52.389> them<00:03:52.540> armchair<00:03:53.260> mechanics

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
guess they call them armchair mechanics

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.020 
guess they call them armchair mechanics
because<00:03:54.190> they<00:03:54.310> just<00:03:54.549> preach<00:03:54.849> about

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
because they just preach about

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.490 
because they just preach about
everything<00:03:55.569> I<00:03:56.280> didn't<00:03:57.280> have<00:03:57.430> have<00:03:57.639> a<00:03:58.500> factory

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
everything I didn't have have a factory

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.030 
everything I didn't have have a factory

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
gasket to do the valve adjustment

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.270 
gasket to do the valve adjustment
I<00:04:02.840> don't<00:04:03.840> put<00:04:04.019> silicone<00:04:04.620> on<00:04:04.769> them<00:04:04.890> like<00:04:05.010> a<00:04:05.069> lot

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
I don't put silicone on them like a lot

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.699 
I don't put silicone on them like a lot
of<00:04:05.430> people<00:04:05.700> it<00:04:06.480> gets<00:04:06.689> the<00:04:06.840> proper<00:04:07.140> gasket<00:04:08.299> now

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
of people it gets the proper gasket now

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.800 
of people it gets the proper gasket now
his<00:04:10.709> comment<00:04:11.189> said<00:04:11.430> said<00:04:11.700> that<00:04:11.730> this<00:04:12.360> filter
