anything<00:00:38.480> like<00:00:38.660> it<00:00:38.900> when<00:00:39.320> you<00:00:39.410> first<00:00:39.650> spawn<00:00:40.310> in

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
anything like it when you first spawn in

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.240 
anything like it when you first spawn in
this<00:00:40.790> is<00:00:41.000> the<00:00:41.120> exact<00:00:41.449> block<00:00:41.750> you<00:00:41.960> spawn<00:00:42.260> on<00:00:42.469> you

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
this is the exact block you spawn on you

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.459 
this is the exact block you spawn on you
can<00:00:43.699> notice<00:00:44.000> your<00:00:44.239> you<00:00:44.390> spawn<00:00:44.660> directly<00:00:45.320> on

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
can notice your you spawn directly on

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.680 
can notice your you spawn directly on
top<00:00:45.739> of<00:00:45.949> a<00:00:46.100> ravine<00:00:46.520> which<00:00:46.969> I<00:00:47.300> thought<00:00:47.570> was

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
top of a ravine which I thought was

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.189 
top of a ravine which I thought was
pretty<00:00:47.899> cool

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
pretty cool

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:50.139 
pretty cool
yeah<00:00:48.590> that's<00:00:48.829> pretty<00:00:48.949> neat<00:00:49.280> but<00:00:49.850> then<00:00:49.969> I<00:00:50.030> get

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
yeah that's pretty neat but then I get

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.180 
yeah that's pretty neat but then I get
to<00:00:50.180> looking<00:00:50.449> around<00:00:50.480> and<00:00:50.960> I'm<00:00:51.739> completely

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190

this is pretty much it pretty much the
entire<00:01:20.540> map<00:01:21.200> that<00:01:21.439> I<00:01:21.560> have<00:01:21.770> explored<00:01:22.310> which<00:01:22.939> is

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
entire map that I have explored which is

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.649 
entire map that I have explored which is
a<00:01:23.210> good<00:01:23.659> bit<00:01:23.900> is<00:01:24.280> nothing<00:01:25.280> but<00:01:25.460> swampland<00:01:26.360> like

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
a good bit is nothing but swampland like

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.469 
a good bit is nothing but swampland like
this<00:01:26.990> you<00:01:27.619> know<00:01:27.799> little<00:01:28.490> bits<00:01:28.790> of<00:01:31.270> islands<00:01:32.270> and

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.719 
this you know little bits of islands and
different<00:01:32.840> stuff<00:01:33.020> like<00:01:33.079> that<00:01:33.470> and<00:01:33.799> that's

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
different stuff like that and that's

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.370 
different stuff like that and that's
actually<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:35.299> biggest<00:01:35.450> one<00:01:35.750> I<00:01:35.780> found<00:01:36.049> right

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
actually the biggest one I found right

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.289 
actually the biggest one I found right
now<00:01:36.560> I<00:01:36.590> wonder<00:01:37.009> how<00:01:37.189> big<00:01:37.340> this<00:01:37.490> one<00:01:37.640> is<00:01:37.850> but

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
now I wonder how big this one is but

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.310 
now I wonder how big this one is but
almost<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:38.810> entire<00:01:39.170> world<00:01:39.200> is<00:01:39.950> water<00:01:40.399> or

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
almost the entire world is water or

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.100 
almost the entire world is water or
surrounded<00:01:42.320> in<00:01:42.439> water<00:01:42.710> and<00:01:43.189> I<00:01:43.490> have<00:01:44.299> not<00:01:44.869> found

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
surrounded in water and I have not found

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.920 
surrounded in water and I have not found
anything<00:01:45.469> above<00:01:46.100> you<00:01:46.640> know<00:01:46.790> like<00:01:47.060> 34<00:01:47.719> in

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
anything above you know like 34 in

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.260 
anything above you know like 34 in
elevation<00:01:48.619> and<00:01:49.520> we<00:01:49.610> see<00:01:49.759> look<00:01:49.880> at<00:01:49.969> this<00:01:50.119> this

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
elevation and we see look at this this

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.670 
elevation and we see look at this this
is<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.509> biggest<00:01:50.689> island<00:01:51.110> I<00:01:51.200> found<00:01:51.469> right<00:01:51.619> here

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
is the biggest island I found right here

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.639 
is the biggest island I found right here
and<00:01:52.100> I<00:01:52.549> mean<00:01:53.180> this<00:01:53.299> is<00:01:53.719> an<00:01:53.899> enormous<00:01:54.110> landmass

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
and I mean this is an enormous landmass

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.959 
and I mean this is an enormous landmass
compared<00:01:55.280> to<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:55.520> other<00:01:55.670> stuff<00:01:57.009> but<00:01:58.009> I<00:01:58.399> went

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
compared to the other stuff but I went

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:00.730 
compared to the other stuff but I went
in<00:01:59.060> this<00:01:59.180> direction<00:01:59.360> for<00:01:59.990> a<00:02:00.020> good<00:02:00.439> ways<00:02:00.710> and

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
in this direction for a good ways and
