from<00:00:18.660> someone<00:00:19.050> else<00:00:19.230> so<00:00:19.619> let's<00:00:19.890> get<00:00:20.070> started

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
from someone else so let's get started

from someone else so let's get started
as<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:20.910> guys<00:00:21.090> can<00:00:21.270> see<00:00:21.330> my<00:00:22.080> my<00:00:22.710> team<00:00:23.010> energy

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
as you guys can see my my team energy

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.170 
as you guys can see my my team energy
it's<00:00:23.789> strained<00:00:24.240> have<00:00:24.779> no<00:00:25.050> energy<00:00:25.939> but<00:00:26.939> there's

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
it's strained have no energy but there's

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.080 
it's strained have no energy but there's
a<00:00:27.330> way<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.510> do<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.930> without<00:00:28.789> having<00:00:29.789> to

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
a way to do it without having to

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.880 
a way to do it without having to
purchase<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.660> energy<00:00:31.050> if<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.349> click<00:00:31.619> file

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
purchase the energy if you click file

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.340 
purchase the energy if you click file
you<00:00:32.099> guys<00:00:32.279> can<00:00:32.520> see<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:33.360> only<00:00:33.570> way<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.140> use

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
you guys can see the only way that I use

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.580 
you guys can see the only way that I use
my<00:00:34.500> energy<00:00:34.680> or<00:00:35.070> purchase<00:00:35.460> more<00:00:35.640> energy<00:00:36.590> what

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
my energy or purchase more energy what

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.410 
my energy or purchase more energy what
you<00:00:37.710> want<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.040> do<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.219> close<00:00:40.160> injustice<00:00:41.420> this

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
going to be without energy for a long

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.069 
going to be without energy for a long
time<00:01:40.680> as<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.490> guys<00:01:41.549> saw<00:01:41.909> it's<00:01:42.270> pretty<00:01:42.780> easy<00:01:42.899> to

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.560 
time as you guys saw it's pretty easy to
eliminate<00:01:43.770> energy<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.310> injustice<00:01:44.700> without

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
eliminate energy in injustice without

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.480 
eliminate energy in injustice without
having<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.990> hide<00:01:46.170> your<00:01:46.439> device<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.009> purchase
