00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
hi this is the homemade engine that I

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.249 
hi this is the homemade engine that I
was<00:00:04.220> telling<00:00:05.220> you<00:00:05.310> guys<00:00:05.370> about<00:00:05.520> I<00:00:06.270> had<00:00:07.109> the

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
frustrating and I got other projects

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.920 
frustrating and I got other projects
like<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.320> cub<00:00:16.500> cadet<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.520> Bolin's<00:00:17.940> but

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
like the cub cadet and the Bolin's but

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.240 
like the cub cadet and the Bolin's but
um<00:00:19.789> yeah<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:20.850> what<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.869> did<00:00:21.990> was<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.680> rearranged

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
the way the valves are going to go

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.800 
the way the valves are going to go
together

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
together

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
valves and they're just little tiny

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.520 
valves and they're just little tiny
cylinder<00:01:05.129> bolts<00:01:05.580> from<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.880> Briggs<00:01:06.150> &amp;<00:01:06.390> Stratton

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
cylinder bolts from a Briggs &amp; Stratton

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.560 
cylinder bolts from a Briggs &amp; Stratton
that<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.619> filed<00:01:07.890> down<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.460> little<00:01:08.729> tiny<00:01:08.939> lip<00:01:09.360> on

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
that I filed down the little tiny lip on

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.800 
that I filed down the little tiny lip on
the<00:01:09.750> end<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.369> put<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.729> drill<00:01:12.119> put<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
the end I put it in a drill put the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.570 
the end I put it in a drill put the
drill<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.229> vise<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.470> zip<00:01:14.100> tied<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
drill in the vise and zip tied the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.030 
drill in the vise and zip tied the
trigger<00:01:15.000> on<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:16.080> took<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.500> file<00:01:16.830> and

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
trigger on and I just took a file and

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.620 
trigger on and I just took a file and
pushed<00:01:17.280> against<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.060> I'd<00:01:18.270> make<00:01:18.479> it

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
pushed against it so I'd make it

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.350 
pushed against it so I'd make it
perfectly<00:01:19.080> round<00:01:19.490> and<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.610> took<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:21.030> was<00:01:21.210> only

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
perfectly round and it took it was only

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.230 
perfectly round and it took it was only
a<00:01:21.450> minute<00:01:21.659> or<00:01:21.900> two<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.080> make<00:01:22.320> each<00:01:22.890> one<00:01:23.240> but

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
a minute or two to make each one but

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.770 
a minute or two to make each one but
they<00:01:24.420> fit<00:01:24.840> perfectly<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.880> I<00:01:26.880> filed<00:01:27.150> down<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
they fit perfectly and I filed down the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.160 
they fit perfectly and I filed down the
edge<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:29.240> seat<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.590> that<00:01:31.590> works<00:01:33.079> let<00:01:34.079> me

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
edge of the seat so that works let me

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.360 
edge of the seat so that works let me
take<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.560> intake<00:01:34.890> off<00:01:35.100> I'll<00:01:35.369> show<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.640> that

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
I don't think it wants to come loose

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:04.000 
I don't think it wants to come loose
today<00:02:00.970> yeah<00:02:01.970> I<00:02:02.420> don't<00:02:03.260> think<00:02:03.410> I'll<00:02:03.650> be<00:02:03.770> able<00:02:03.860> to

um<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:47.570> ignition<00:02:48.020> over<00:02:48.110> I<00:02:48.350> just<00:02:48.620> have<00:02:48.739> a<00:02:48.770> set

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
um the ignition over I just have a set

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.050 
um the ignition over I just have a set
of<00:02:49.400> points<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:50.090> coil<00:02:50.360> run<00:02:51.230> off<00:02:51.410> or<00:02:51.890> points<00:02:52.610> on

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
of points and coil run off or points on

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.810 
of points and coil run off or points on
condenser<00:02:53.950> I'll<00:02:54.950> put<00:02:55.160> that<00:02:55.280> back<00:02:55.340> in<00:02:55.640> later

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
condenser I'll put that back in later

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.340 
condenser I'll put that back in later
run<00:02:56.720> off<00:02:56.840> see<00:02:57.489> this<00:02:58.489> flat<00:02:58.820> spot<00:02:59.290> because<00:03:00.290> I

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
run off see this flat spot because I

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.690 
run off see this flat spot because I
mean<00:03:00.530> if<00:03:00.650> it's<00:03:00.769> turning<00:03:01.250> this<00:03:02.150> way<00:03:03.370> that<00:03:04.370> flat

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
mean if it's turning this way that flat

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.590 
mean if it's turning this way that flat
spots<00:03:05.090> just<00:03:05.450> about<00:03:05.690> perfectly<00:03:06.820> up<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.450> down

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
spots just about perfectly up and down

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.289 
spots just about perfectly up and down
so<00:03:09.019> that's<00:03:09.200> one<00:03:09.380> of<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.530> clothes<00:03:10.000> right<00:03:11.000> asset

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
so that's one of the clothes right asset

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.620 
so that's one of the clothes right asset
Pistons<00:03:11.690> at<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:11.959> top<00:03:12.170> is<00:03:12.500> 100<00:03:13.160> so<00:03:13.880> that'll<00:03:14.510> be

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
Pistons at the top is 100 so that'll be

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.539 
Pistons at the top is 100 so that'll be
should<00:03:15.049> be<00:03:15.200> perfectly<00:03:15.620> advanced<00:03:16.160> and<00:03:16.310> this<00:03:16.430> is

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
should be perfectly advanced and this is

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.400 
should be perfectly advanced and this is
how<00:03:16.670> I'm<00:03:16.790> going<00:03:16.940> to<00:03:17.000> hook<00:03:17.150> up<00:03:17.299> the<00:03:17.450> camshaft<00:03:18.049> I

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
how I'm going to hook up the camshaft I

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.000 
how I'm going to hook up the camshaft I
was<00:03:19.310> going<00:03:19.489> to<00:03:19.549> have<00:03:19.730> like<00:03:19.970> a<00:03:20.180> belt<00:03:20.739> thing<00:03:21.739> but

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
was going to have like a belt thing but

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.860 
was going to have like a belt thing but
I<00:03:22.040> figured<00:03:22.370> that<00:03:22.549> would<00:03:22.670> just<00:03:22.940> slip<00:03:23.360> and<00:03:23.570> mess

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
I figured that would just slip and mess

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.650 
I figured that would just slip and mess
up<00:03:23.980> but<00:03:24.980> so<00:03:25.190> I<00:03:25.250> made<00:03:25.459> this<00:03:25.760> it's<00:03:26.030> an<00:03:26.180> old<00:03:26.360> cam

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
up but so I made this it's an old cam

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.840 
up but so I made this it's an old cam
gear<00:03:27.080> out<00:03:27.620> of<00:03:27.950> this<00:03:28.160> engine

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
gear out of this engine

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.280 
gear out of this engine
we<00:03:29.750> got<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.049> cam<00:03:30.260> now<00:03:30.500> I<00:03:31.810> have<00:03:32.810> a<00:03:32.840> screw

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
we got the cam now I have a screw

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.610 
we got the cam now I have a screw
drilled<00:03:33.620> through<00:03:34.750> almost<00:03:35.750> it<00:03:36.290> went<00:03:36.470> through

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
drilled through almost it went through

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.770 
drilled through almost it went through
the<00:03:36.860> end<00:03:37.100> of<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.340> keyway<00:03:37.730> it's<00:03:38.209> pushing<00:03:38.480> on

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
the end of the keyway it's pushing on

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.650 
the end of the keyway it's pushing on
this<00:03:39.250> which<00:03:40.250> kind<00:03:40.519> of<00:03:40.579> holds<00:03:40.880> this<00:03:41.030> bushing<00:03:41.540> in

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
this which kind of holds this bushing in

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.520 
this which kind of holds this bushing in
there<00:03:41.870> fine

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
there fine

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.490 
there fine
but<00:03:43.190> since<00:03:43.400> this<00:03:43.549> is<00:03:43.610> like<00:03:43.910> that<00:03:44.150> I<00:03:44.540> can<00:03:45.230> slide

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
but since this is like that I can slide

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.300 
but since this is like that I can slide
it<00:03:45.680> I<00:03:45.799> and<00:03:46.570> hook<00:03:47.570> it<00:03:47.720> up<00:03:47.810> with<00:03:47.870> this<00:03:48.650> thing<00:03:49.010> I

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
it I and hook it up with this thing I

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.310 
it I and hook it up with this thing I
always<00:03:49.790> not<00:03:50.060> a<00:03:50.090> lot<00:03:50.329> of<00:03:50.480> light<00:03:50.630> in<00:03:50.780> here<00:03:50.810> to<00:03:51.140> see

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
always not a lot of light in here to see

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
always not a lot of light in here to see
but<00:03:52.150> if<00:03:53.150> I<00:03:53.420> can<00:03:53.600> find<00:03:53.870> for<00:03:53.959> that<00:03:54.079> thing<00:03:54.890> is

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
but if I can find for that thing is

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.990 
but if I can find for that thing is
yeah<00:03:56.970> it's<00:03:57.599> kind<00:03:57.930> of<00:03:58.050> there<00:03:58.319> we<00:03:58.440> go<00:03:58.849> in<00:03:59.849> this

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
yeah it's kind of there we go in this

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.059 
yeah it's kind of there we go in this
way<00:04:00.270> the<00:04:00.690> it'll<00:04:01.080> it<00:04:01.290> won't<00:04:01.620> turn<00:04:02.280> on<00:04:03.650> I<00:04:04.650> don't

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
way the it'll it won't turn on I don't

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.820 
way the it'll it won't turn on I don't
know<00:04:05.130> if<00:04:05.280> i'll<00:04:05.370> solder<00:04:05.760> that<00:04:05.970> or<00:04:06.620> put<00:04:07.620> a<00:04:07.650> little

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
know if i'll solder that or put a little

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.790 
know if i'll solder that or put a little
dot<00:04:08.069> of<00:04:08.190> welds<00:04:08.580> that's<00:04:08.910> like<00:04:09.360> perfect<00:04:09.810> and<00:04:10.709> i

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
dot of welds that's like perfect and i

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.500 
dot of welds that's like perfect and i
got<00:04:10.950> to<00:04:11.069> get<00:04:11.130> a<00:04:11.190> bushing<00:04:11.640> so<00:04:11.819> if<00:04:11.880> it's<00:04:12.060> tight<00:04:12.330> on

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
got to get a bushing so if it's tight on

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.650 
got to get a bushing so if it's tight on
the<00:04:12.660> crankshaft<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:14.090> then<00:04:15.090> I'll<00:04:15.239> just<00:04:15.420> have

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
the crankshaft and then I'll just have

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.750 
the crankshaft and then I'll just have
the<00:04:16.410> nut<00:04:16.620> that<00:04:16.829> screws<00:04:17.130> on<00:04:17.280> here<00:04:17.519> and<00:04:17.609> then

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
the nut that screws on here and then

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.530 
the nut that screws on here and then
probably<00:04:17.970> a<00:04:19.010> space<00:04:20.010> or<00:04:20.280> something<00:04:20.790> but<00:04:21.389> if<00:04:21.480> I

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
probably a space or something but if I

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.150 
probably a space or something but if I
do<00:04:21.600> that<00:04:21.720> then<00:04:22.139> I<00:04:22.200> won't<00:04:22.440> be<00:04:22.560> able<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:22.860> use<00:04:22.980> this

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
do that then I won't be able to use this

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.310 
do that then I won't be able to use this
flat<00:04:23.490> spot<00:04:23.850> for<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.270> points<00:04:24.660> and<00:04:24.810> condenser

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
flat spot for the points and condenser

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.890 
flat spot for the points and condenser
so<00:04:25.760> that's<00:04:26.760> kind<00:04:27.270> of<00:04:27.300> where<00:04:27.450> I<00:04:27.480> start<00:04:27.750> turning

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
so that's kind of where I start turning

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.860 
so that's kind of where I start turning
the<00:04:28.200> troubles<00:04:28.940> this<00:04:29.940> will<00:04:30.150> probably<00:04:30.450> just<00:04:30.630> run

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
the troubles this will probably just run

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.230 
the troubles this will probably just run
here<00:04:31.350> then<00:04:32.310> I<00:04:32.340> can<00:04:32.520> just<00:04:32.610> have<00:04:32.760> push<00:04:32.970> rods

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
here then I can just have push rods

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.150 
here then I can just have push rods
going<00:04:33.690> to<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.930> valve<00:04:34.139> this<00:04:34.650> one<00:04:34.860> looks<00:04:35.100> like

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
going to the valve this one looks like

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.850 
going to the valve this one looks like
it<00:04:35.400> lines<00:04:35.610> up<00:04:35.790> perfectly<00:04:35.850> with<00:04:36.450> this<00:04:37.260> lobe

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
it lines up perfectly with this lobe

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.740 
it lines up perfectly with this lobe
this<00:04:38.639> one<00:04:38.820> doesn't<00:04:39.060> line<00:04:39.180> up<00:04:39.210> perfectly<00:04:39.690> with

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
this one doesn't line up perfectly with

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.560 
this one doesn't line up perfectly with
that<00:04:39.990> so<00:04:40.229> probably<00:04:40.590> have<00:04:40.740> like<00:04:40.979> push<00:04:41.940> rod<00:04:42.210> off

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
that so probably have like push rod off

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.420 
that so probably have like push rod off
the<00:04:43.050> cam<00:04:43.290> pushing<00:04:43.770> on<00:04:43.889> a<00:04:43.919> little<00:04:44.220> piece<00:04:44.400> that

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
the cam pushing on a little piece that

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.090 
the cam pushing on a little piece that
goes<00:04:44.790> like<00:04:44.880> this<00:04:45.229> and<00:04:46.229> then<00:04:46.410> that<00:04:46.650> will<00:04:46.950> hook

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
goes like this and then that will hook
