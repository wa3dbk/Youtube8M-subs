engine sitting up on top again this is
just<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.709> cheap<00:02:10.390> eventually<00:02:11.390> we're<00:02:11.540> gonna

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
just a cheap eventually we're gonna

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.850 
just a cheap eventually we're gonna
build<00:02:11.870> another<00:02:12.140> one<00:02:12.380> of<00:02:12.470> these<00:02:12.530> we're<00:02:12.769> gonna

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
build another one of these we're gonna

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.490 
build another one of these we're gonna
have<00:02:13.160> a<00:02:13.190> keen<00:02:13.820> with<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.390> t-80<00:02:14.810> air<00:02:14.989> compressor

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
have a keen with the t-80 air compressor

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.050 
have a keen with the t-80 air compressor
on<00:02:15.650> it<00:02:15.799> right<00:02:16.370> now<00:02:16.400> we're<00:02:16.730> running<00:02:16.850> an

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
on it right now we're running an

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.680 
on it right now we're running an
electric<00:02:17.420> air<00:02:17.570> compressor<00:02:19.299> but<00:02:20.299> we<00:02:20.450> did

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
electric air compressor but we did

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.740 
electric air compressor but we did
outriggers<00:02:22.030> that's<00:02:23.030> why<00:02:23.180> I<00:02:23.209> wanted<00:02:23.450> to<00:02:23.510> show

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
outriggers that's why I wanted to show

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.140 
outriggers that's why I wanted to show
you<00:02:23.810> what<00:02:24.110> we<00:02:24.230> found<00:02:24.470> was<00:02:24.830> that<00:02:24.860> uh<00:02:25.099> we<00:02:25.880> needed

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
you what we found was that uh we needed

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.420 
you what we found was that uh we needed
a<00:02:26.209> little<00:02:26.450> more<00:02:26.599> stability<00:02:27.020> so<00:02:27.380> we<00:02:28.220> put

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
a little more stability so we put

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.420 
a little more stability so we put
outriggers<00:02:28.940> out<00:02:29.150> hee

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
outriggers out hee

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.059 
outriggers out hee
and<00:02:29.640> works<00:02:30.360> fantastic<00:02:31.260> we<00:02:31.470> can<00:02:31.590> adjust<00:02:31.709> these

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
and works fantastic we can adjust these

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.339 
and works fantastic we can adjust these
in<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.340> out<00:02:32.430> we<00:02:32.610> can<00:02:32.730> take<00:02:32.909> them<00:02:33.030> off<00:02:33.239> but<00:02:34.200> this

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
in and out we can take them off but this

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.960 
in and out we can take them off but this
whole<00:02:34.590> thing<00:02:34.799> will<00:02:34.980> fit<00:02:35.220> inside<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:35.670> bed<00:02:35.849> of

it's just my backup but eventually were

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.880 
it's just my backup but eventually were
gonna<00:03:21.359> build<00:03:21.659> this<00:03:21.840> we're<00:03:22.049> gonna<00:03:22.140> share<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.530> TV

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
air compressor over here it goes down

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.940 
air compressor over here it goes down
and<00:03:26.180> there's<00:03:27.180> a<00:03:27.269> couple<00:03:27.930> big<00:03:28.170> rocks<00:03:28.200> up<00:03:28.709> under

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
and there's a couple big rocks up under

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.559 
and there's a couple big rocks up under
here<00:03:29.099> that<00:03:29.159> we're<00:03:29.459> dredging<00:03:29.700> you<00:03:30.420> could

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
here that we're dredging you could

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.000 
here that we're dredging you could
probably<00:03:30.720> see<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.049> shadow<00:03:31.319> of<00:03:31.560> one<00:03:31.739> of<00:03:31.890> them

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
probably see the shadow of one of them

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.550 
probably see the shadow of one of them
in<00:03:32.190> here<00:03:32.419> but<00:03:33.419> they're<00:03:33.599> about<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.930> size<00:03:34.169> of<00:03:34.380> my

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
in here but they're about the size of my

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.080 
in here but they're about the size of my
truck<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.280> we're<00:03:35.609> going<00:03:35.849> in<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.000> we're

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
truck and we're going in and we're

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.460 
truck and we're going in and we're
trying<00:03:36.329> to<00:03:36.389> work<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.720> edges<00:03:36.900> they<00:03:37.200> haven't

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
trying to work the edges they haven't

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.750 
trying to work the edges they haven't
been<00:03:37.530> moved<00:03:37.769> and<00:03:37.919> they<00:03:38.010> will<00:03:38.160> not<00:03:38.340> be<00:03:38.400> moved

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
been moved and they will not be moved

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.180 
been moved and they will not be moved
and<00:03:39.209> then<00:03:39.959> later<00:03:40.200> on<00:03:40.290> you<00:03:40.470> think<00:03:40.859> he<00:03:40.950> saw<00:03:41.160> us

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
and then later on you think he saw us

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.650 
and then later on you think he saw us
working<00:03:41.519> down<00:03:41.760> there<00:03:41.940> we<00:03:42.120> were<00:03:42.239> working<00:03:42.510> some

working down there we were working some

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.369 
working down there we were working some
bedrock<00:03:43.849> but<00:03:44.849> pretty<00:03:45.180> cool<00:03:45.359> little<00:03:45.540> unit<00:03:45.959> once

bedrock but pretty cool little unit once
I<00:03:46.470> get<00:03:46.620> it<00:03:46.709> fired<00:03:46.919> up<00:03:47.069> again<00:03:47.280> I'm<00:03:47.400> gonna<00:03:47.489> go

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
I get it fired up again I'm gonna go

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:52.890 
I get it fired up again I'm gonna go
ahead<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:47.819> show<00:03:47.970> you<00:03:48.150> it<00:03:48.299> running
