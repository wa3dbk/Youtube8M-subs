then I will probably do a redrawing so
don't<00:05:47.760> think<00:05:47.970> just<00:05:48.060> because<00:05:48.240> they're<00:05:48.570> chosen

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
don't think just because they're chosen

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.960 
don't think just because they're chosen
that<00:05:49.650> you<00:05:50.130> don't<00:05:50.310> have<00:05:50.370> the<00:05:50.490> chance<00:05:50.730> because

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
that you don't have the chance because

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.880 
that you don't have the chance because
it's<00:05:51.690> happened<00:05:52.020> in<00:05:52.080> the<00:05:52.140> past<00:05:52.260> quite<00:05:52.650> a<00:05:52.680> few

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
it's happened in the past quite a few

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.500 
it's happened in the past quite a few
times<00:05:53.070> people<00:05:53.400> don't<00:05:53.520> collect<00:05:54.120> their<00:05:54.300> prizes

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
times people don't collect their prizes

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.500 
times people don't collect their prizes
and<00:05:54.950> I<00:05:55.950> will<00:05:56.250> rear<00:05:56.430> aphal<00:05:56.760> so<00:05:57.240> I'll<00:05:57.360> probably

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
and I will rear aphal so I'll probably

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.070

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
let it go for two three four days

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.270 
let it go for two three four days
