00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello here is Peter and I want you 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.500
 in this video times the bewag doctor or 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.160
 intel wireless display technology with 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.740
 demonstrate the acer aspire 15 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.260
 I have a lg tv 47 inches here 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.350
 with integrated wireless display 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.240
 technology and that's what I connect now 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.699
 wireless with the switch 10 that you see 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.260
 left below in the corner and have to 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.180
 I connected a mouse with it here 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.420
 I do not walk right in front of the picture 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.310
 got to 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.980
 and we'll just do it now 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.440
 So you just go here to start in 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.309
 the right corner then on devices on 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.149
 project and then here is the 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.770
 wanted screen now 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.020
 maybe just too small on the display 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.820
 but here is lg tv and again 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.510
 means one goes then shortly and then 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.379
 is already doing the tv what the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.699
 connection works out to 90 percent so it 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.500
 not always sure that too 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.030
 really works so I often had 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.760
 crashes that just did not work 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.370
 but you have to stop there 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.830
 try and it depends if that 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.270
 network is busy that is 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:11.939
 Of course, completely normal via wireless 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.380
 by wlan and depending on how the grave 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.710
 busy that works more or 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.479
 it is less usable in real life 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.780
 not my eyes so if you now 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.570
 a video plays where the sound then to 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.100
 delay image at the same time it comes 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.990
 okay so if you are for example video 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.790
 youtube look or so but now for 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.520
 the normal use you see that 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.049
 right now if I'm on the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.020
 home screen come already 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.840
 delay 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.729
 That's a second if I have that 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.560
 Let's say that's where the transmission is 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.450
 not really liquid now i have 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.430
 that now mirrored that one 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.740
 really good can see how big the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.310
 Delay compared to left 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.899
 bottom and top right then you can 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.869
 the screen, of course 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.640
 he does not mirror does not publish 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.520
 but for example only the second 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.250
 turn on screen then you reach 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.399
 also on the tv the full one 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.620
 resolution so 1920 x 1080 pixels what 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.290
 the tv has the tablet can 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.180
 yes only 1366 x 768 pixels 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.010
 by extending it or just the 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.890
 second screen on power in the case 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.879
 here the tv 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:29.780
 then you have the resolution of 1920 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:32.060
 x 1080 pixeln where that then another 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.540
 ticking worse so if you go 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.489
 here for example my click hears and 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.680
 the delay then sees in the picture that 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.420
 are that really longer than it is 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.390
 anyway, and the delay would be 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.090
 with the mouse does not really help then 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.980
 So if you really want to do something 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.150
 then the decoration would be good 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.890
 Of course, if you balance now 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.569
 a video grazes both the image as 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.890
 also the sound delayed one comes then 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.250
 Of course, see the video as normal 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.290
 can 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.120
 but now if you want to play or 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.650
 Work what I hoped for 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.609
 Of course I have the bigger one now 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.019
 screens for example on 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:04.430
 desk and can me for example 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.769
 somehow something on the screen 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.420
 By reading there was by the delay 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.780
 for example, even the simplest 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.389
 scroll does not really fun 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.290
 So it's there and it works 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:20.329
 but not really in my eyes 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.769
 useful so that you can really handle it 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.900
 you can work with it shares 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.510
 normal things show but the 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.900
 Ornament is already there then 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.389
 play what I thought so what 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.069
 maybe that works 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.519
 not so you have two hdmi here 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.109
 exit 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.049
 but I would prefer it if 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:42.920
 Astana windows functions and is for 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:46.010
 the delay is much too much now 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.950
 big than that it's really usable yes 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.630
 so far the first impression of mÃ¼hlackers 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.190
 or Intel wireless display 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.829
 I hope the technology developed 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.600
 somehow still further for me 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.700
 currently nice 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.210
 gimmick but not really 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.530
 but you need movies or music 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.720
 looks then, of course, the sound 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.600
 shown delayed and the picture that 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.680
 then goes well and full hd is yes 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.990
 not bad either then 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.570
 can stream over the tv there 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.010
 I prefer but rather hdmi 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.030
 because then i just delay 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.200
 do not have from the tray to the tv 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.640
 if the input mountain of the television 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.020
 Of course not so big though is that 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.000
 the mother was not removed now 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.590
 more so yes so far the first impression 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.810
 is lucky as at switch 10 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.490
 continue without problems at the super great 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.710
 gets a bit shorter runtime than that 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.390
 t100 but the display is simply the 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.920
 that's what it's all about 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.270
 Already today as the screen is good 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.330
 it adapts to the environment 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:46.350
 but that's really great device 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.570
 for 43 euro and then with 64 gbyte too 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.910
 for 390 euro so I'm very 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.840
 Excited more videos will follow 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.470
 if questions are easy in the 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.300
 Comments 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.300
 you'll give it until next time
