00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.029 
would make my review on this excellent
EDC<00:00:13.500> knife<00:00:13.880> so<00:00:14.880> here<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.320> this<00:00:16.320> model<00:00:16.830> is

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
EDC knife so here it is this model is

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:24.290 
EDC knife so here it is this model is
the<00:00:17.100> 5<00:00:17.640> 5<00:00:18.029> 5<00:00:18.770> hg<00:00:19.770> blue<00:00:21.380> the<00:00:22.380> 5<00:00:22.560> 5<00:00:22.769> 6<00:00:23.160> as<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:24.090> thumb

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
the 5 5 5 hg blue the 5 5 6 as the thumb

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.470 
the 5 5 5 hg blue the 5 5 6 as the thumb
stood<00:00:24.539> here<00:00:24.869> instead<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.410> hole<00:00:25.789> so<00:00:26.789> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
stood here instead of the hole so the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.300 
stood here instead of the hole so the
grip<00:00:27.810> ginyan<00:00:28.170> line<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.740> probably<00:00:29.010> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
grip ginyan line is probably the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.490 
grip ginyan line is probably the
flagship<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:30.000> Benchmade<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.779> for<00:00:31.320> good

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
flagship of Benchmade and for good

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.310 
flagship of Benchmade and for good
reason<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.980> believe<00:00:32.690> they<00:00:33.690> are<00:00:33.719> high<00:00:34.260> quality

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
reason to believe they are high quality

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.340 
reason to believe they are high quality
knives<00:00:35.010> but<00:00:35.790> they're<00:00:36.000> sold<00:00:36.270> at<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> very<00:00:37.110> decent

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
knives but they're sold at a very decent

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.220 
knives but they're sold at a very decent
price<00:00:38.420> something<00:00:39.420> light<00:00:39.600> like<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.960> tenacious

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
price something light like the tenacious

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.860 
price something light like the tenacious
you<00:00:40.680> know<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.100> benchmade<00:00:41.520> vex<00:00:41.870> they're

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
you know the benchmade vex they're

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.590 
you know the benchmade vex they're
around<00:00:43.170> 30<00:00:43.739> euros<00:00:44.219> but<00:00:44.760> i<00:00:44.820> consider<00:00:45.239> them<00:00:45.390> as

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
around 30 euros but i consider them as

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.510 
around 30 euros but i consider them as
cheap<00:00:45.840> knives<00:00:46.050> because<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.980> pay<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> pretty

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
cheap knives because you pay a pretty

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.729 
cheap knives because you pay a pretty
low<00:00:47.700> price<00:00:48.000> but<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.809> also<00:00:48.960> got<00:00:49.260> some<00:00:49.530> really

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
low price but you also got some really

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.069 
low price but you also got some really
basic<00:00:50.129> materials<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.210> specifically<00:00:51.690> basic

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
basic materials and specifically basic

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.139 
basic materials and specifically basic
steers<00:00:52.320> like<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.890> TR<00:00:53.579> 13<00:00:53.940> MOV<00:00:54.329> or<00:00:54.360> 8<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.260> know

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
steers like a TR 13 MOV or 8 you know

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.639 
steers like a TR 13 MOV or 8 you know
so<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.270> knife<00:00:57.480> here<00:00:57.719> belongs<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.440> another

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
so this knife here belongs to another

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.880 
so this knife here belongs to another
category<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.359> price<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.809> more<00:01:00.989> around<00:01:01.379> 50

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
category and the price is more around 50

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.840 
category and the price is more around 50
euros<00:01:02.780> but<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.870> don't<00:01:04.290> consider<00:01:04.680> them<00:01:05.040> as<00:01:05.309> cheap

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
euros but I don't consider them as cheap

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.780 
euros but I don't consider them as cheap
knives<00:01:07.070> simply<00:01:08.070> because<00:01:08.340> they're<00:01:08.549> really

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
knives simply because they're really

all the inside area of the hell as you
can<00:02:09.420> see

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
can see

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.930 
can see
and<00:02:10.140> they're<00:02:10.739> not<00:02:10.860> burned<00:02:11.129> out<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.819> don't

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
and they're not burned out so you don't

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.880 
and they're not burned out so you don't
have<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.269> same<00:02:12.450> plasticky<00:02:13.170> feeling<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.769> you

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
have the same plasticky feeling that you

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.880 
have the same plasticky feeling that you
had<00:02:14.040> with<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.340> full-size<00:02:15.620> definitely<00:02:16.620> seems

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
had with the full-size definitely seems

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.580 
had with the full-size definitely seems
more<00:02:17.129> solid<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.819> not<00:02:18.150> as<00:02:18.330> empty<00:02:18.840> plastic<00:02:19.080> you

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
more solid and not as empty plastic you

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.789 
more solid and not as empty plastic you
know<00:02:20.120> but<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.390> is<00:02:21.450> still<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:22.049> a<00:02:22.140> look<00:02:22.349> and<00:02:22.620> also

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
know but it is still of a look and also

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.520 
know but it is still of a look and also
it's<00:02:23.129> exactly<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:23.730> same<00:02:24.230> same<00:02:25.230> material

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
it's exactly the same same material

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.199 
it's exactly the same same material
which<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:28.739> apparently<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.760> little<00:02:30.090> bit

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
which is apparently a little bit

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.680 
which is apparently a little bit
different<00:02:31.340> meaning<00:02:32.340> more<00:02:32.730> resistant<00:02:33.420> than

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
different meaning more resistant than

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.399 
different meaning more resistant than
frm<00:02:35.030> but<00:02:36.030> it's<00:02:36.239> basically<00:02:36.659> a<00:02:36.780> hard<00:02:37.170> plastic

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
frm but it's basically a hard plastic

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.789 
frm but it's basically a hard plastic
anyway<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.220> same<00:02:39.090> handle<00:02:39.390> on<00:02:39.569> 550<00:02:39.930> but<00:02:40.319> not<00:02:40.680> the

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
anyway so same handle on 550 but not the

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.650 
anyway so same handle on 550 but not the
same<00:02:40.980> feeling<00:02:41.129> in<00:02:41.370> your<00:02:41.430> hand<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.849> I<00:02:42.030> like

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
same feeling in your hand and I like

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.330 
same feeling in your hand and I like
this<00:02:42.810> animal<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.440> know<00:02:43.560> it's<00:02:43.739> it's<00:02:44.069> very

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
this animal you know it's it's very

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.759 
this animal you know it's it's very
comfortable<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.660> jumped<00:02:46.079> out<00:02:46.230> pretty

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
comfortable and it jumped out pretty

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.170 
comfortable and it jumped out pretty
much<00:02:46.920> everywhere<00:02:47.569> so<00:02:48.569> really<00:02:49.230> cool<00:02:49.910> make<00:02:50.910> the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
much everywhere so really cool make the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.479 
much everywhere so really cool make the
locking<00:02:51.540> mechanism<00:02:52.079> is<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.290> famous<00:02:52.530> access

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
locking mechanism is the famous access

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.490 
locking mechanism is the famous access
lock<00:02:53.700> which<00:02:54.000> is<00:02:54.030> awesome

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
lock which is awesome

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.740 
lock which is awesome
my<00:02:55.859> name<00:02:56.040> is<00:02:56.220> with<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.700> access<00:02:57.030> lock<00:02:57.269> I<00:02:57.450> just

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
my name is with the access lock I just

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.470 
my name is with the access lock I just
don't<00:02:57.989> tighten<00:02:58.349> the<00:02:58.650> pivot<00:02:59.010> because<00:02:59.579> you<00:03:00.359> know

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
don't tighten the pivot because you know

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.180 
don't tighten the pivot because you know
I<00:03:00.510> generally<00:03:01.230> like<00:03:01.379> my<00:03:01.560> knives<00:03:01.769> to<00:03:01.859> be<00:03:01.920> pretty

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
I generally like my knives to be pretty

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.599 
I generally like my knives to be pretty
tight<00:03:02.599> except<00:03:03.599> this<00:03:03.720> one<00:03:03.989> I<00:03:04.250> really<00:03:05.250> dig<00:03:05.579> that

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
tight except this one I really dig that

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.690 
tight except this one I really dig that
smoothness<00:03:06.359> I<00:03:06.569> mean<00:03:06.750> it's<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:07.829> easy<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.549> open

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
smoothness I mean it's so easy to open

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.880 
smoothness I mean it's so easy to open
them<00:03:08.970> too<00:03:09.120> close<00:03:09.359> and<00:03:09.599> then<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:09.930> love<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.739> you

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
them too close and then I love it you

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.839 
them too close and then I love it you
know<00:03:11.420> so<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.540> axis<00:03:12.840> is<00:03:12.930> extremely<00:03:13.470> valuable

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
know so the axis is extremely valuable

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.849 
know so the axis is extremely valuable
reliable<00:03:14.849> it<00:03:15.690> will<00:03:15.900> never<00:03:16.079> disengage<00:03:16.590> and

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
reliable it will never disengage and

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.050 
reliable it will never disengage and
it's<00:03:16.980> it's<00:03:17.220> probably<00:03:17.370> one<00:03:17.669> of<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.880> safest

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
it's it's probably one of the safest

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.539 
it's it's probably one of the safest
locks<00:03:18.480> out<00:03:18.690> there<00:03:18.870> currently<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:20.400> only

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
locks out there currently the only

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.659 
locks out there currently the only
interrogation<00:03:21.269> that<00:03:21.450> I<00:03:21.630> have<00:03:21.840> is<00:03:21.989> about<00:03:22.019> DISA

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
interrogation that I have is about DISA

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:27.159 
interrogation that I have is about DISA
the<00:03:23.669> arming<00:03:23.940> Springs<00:03:24.389> here<00:03:25.190> as<00:03:26.190> you<00:03:26.340> can<00:03:26.370> see

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:27.169 
the arming Springs here as you can see

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:30.409 
the arming Springs here as you can see
this<00:03:28.169> is<00:03:28.290> maybe<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.590> only<00:03:28.709> weakness<00:03:29.190> of<00:03:29.639> the

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
this is maybe the only weakness of the

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.360 
this is maybe the only weakness of the
lock<00:03:30.599> I<00:03:30.780> believe<00:03:31.019> but<00:03:31.709> I've<00:03:31.829> never<00:03:31.950> seen<00:03:32.190> one

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
lock I believe but I've never seen one

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.640 
lock I believe but I've never seen one
broken<00:03:32.639> so<00:03:32.940> I<00:03:32.970> assume<00:03:33.359> that<00:03:33.569> there<00:03:33.930> is<00:03:34.019> not<00:03:34.590> a

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
broken so I assume that there is not a

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.740 
broken so I assume that there is not a
real<00:03:34.889> problem<00:03:35.519> with<00:03:36.030> this<00:03:36.230> we<00:03:37.230> just<00:03:37.260> Springs

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
real problem with this we just Springs

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.020 
real problem with this we just Springs
but<00:03:39.750> anyway<00:03:39.989> extremely<00:03:40.680> smooth<00:03:40.949> very<00:03:41.760> fast

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
but anyway extremely smooth very fast

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.449 
but anyway extremely smooth very fast
and<00:03:42.359> I<00:03:43.199> mean<00:03:43.410> you<00:03:43.530> know<00:03:43.560> take<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.160> out<00:03:44.280> of<00:03:44.310> your

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459

talk<00:04:13.530> about<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.859> same<00:04:14.120> price<00:04:15.120> range<00:04:15.629> of<00:04:15.930> Steel

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
talk about the same price range of Steel

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.000 
talk about the same price range of Steel
I<00:04:16.639> think<00:04:17.639> video<00:04:17.880> 10<00:04:18.060> will<00:04:18.690> on<00:04:18.930> an<00:04:19.469> edge<00:04:19.739> a

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
I think video 10 will on an edge a

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.099 
I think video 10 will on an edge a
little<00:04:20.370> bit<00:04:20.519> better<00:04:20.789> and<00:04:21.180> it's<00:04:21.719> not<00:04:21.780> gonna<00:04:22.019> be

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
little bit better and it's not gonna be

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:22.910 
little bit better and it's not gonna be
harder

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
harder

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.630 
harder
this<00:04:23.280> one's<00:04:23.490> own<00:04:23.750> and<00:04:24.750> it<00:04:25.260> is<00:04:25.410> less<00:04:25.770> prompt<00:04:26.340> to

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
this one's own and it is less prompt to

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.960 
this one's own and it is less prompt to
chip<00:04:26.940> than<00:04:27.540> 154<00:04:28.260> because<00:04:28.590> 154<00:04:29.190> chips<00:04:29.520> quite

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
chip than 154 because 154 chips quite

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.040 
chip than 154 because 154 chips quite
easily<00:04:30.240> I<00:04:31.040> mean<00:04:32.040> not<00:04:32.220> really<00:04:32.400> but<00:04:32.940> easier<00:04:33.840> than

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
easily I mean not really but easier than

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.040 
easily I mean not really but easier than
video<00:04:34.260> talent<00:04:34.710> least<00:04:34.890> so<00:04:35.880> you<00:04:36.420> know<00:04:36.720> if<00:04:36.840> he<00:04:36.960> was

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
video talent least so you know if he was

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.190 
video talent least so you know if he was
pretty<00:04:37.380> hard<00:04:37.650> my<00:04:37.890> full-size<00:04:38.250> grip<00:04:38.730> and<00:04:39.000> I<00:04:39.930> had

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
pretty hard my full-size grip and I had

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.250 
pretty hard my full-size grip and I had
a<00:04:40.230> lot<00:04:40.650> of<00:04:40.710> microchips<00:04:41.640> here<00:04:42.030> on<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.360> edge<00:04:42.510> and

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
a lot of microchips here on the edge and

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.750 
a lot of microchips here on the edge and
it<00:04:43.470> was<00:04:43.590> pretty<00:04:43.830> hard<00:04:44.100> to<00:04:44.250> get<00:04:44.400> his<00:04:44.520> job<00:04:44.700> back

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
it was pretty hard to get his job back

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.280 
it was pretty hard to get his job back
so<00:04:45.290> took<00:04:46.290> me<00:04:46.670> along<00:04:47.670> not<00:04:48.360> a<00:04:48.390> long<00:04:48.690> time<00:04:48.960> but<00:04:49.140> I

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
so took me along not a long time but I

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.400 
so took me along not a long time but I
had<00:04:49.650> to<00:04:49.770> sharpen<00:04:49.950> it<00:04:50.190> with<00:04:50.220> media<00:04:51.410> Spyderco

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
had to sharpen it with media Spyderco

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.650 
had to sharpen it with media Spyderco
shot<00:04:52.650> me<00:04:52.830> Karen<00:04:53.100> took<00:04:53.490> quite<00:04:53.820> a<00:04:53.880> few<00:04:54.210> quite<00:04:54.630> a

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
shot me Karen took quite a few quite a

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.340 
shot me Karen took quite a few quite a
long<00:04:54.870> time<00:04:55.080> and<00:04:55.730> this<00:04:56.730> is<00:04:56.910> a<00:04:57.000> hologram<00:04:57.480> and<00:04:57.780> the

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
long time and this is a hologram and the

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.340 
long time and this is a hologram and the
grinding<00:04:58.920> is<00:04:59.100> pretty<00:04:59.910> thin<00:05:00.240> which<00:05:00.750> makes<00:05:01.050> it<00:05:01.230> a

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
grinding is pretty thin which makes it a

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.740 
grinding is pretty thin which makes it a
very<00:05:01.530> good<00:05:01.650> slicer<00:05:02.300> real<00:05:03.300> of<00:05:03.600> that<00:05:05.480> usual<00:05:06.480> side

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750
