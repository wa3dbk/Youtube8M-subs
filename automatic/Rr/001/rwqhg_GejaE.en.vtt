info here it is there you go it's in the

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.179 
info here it is there you go it's in the
huge<00:02:53.250> game<00:02:53.549> new<00:02:54.239> engine<00:02:54.689> I<00:02:54.889> think<00:02:55.889> it's<00:02:56.040> only

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
huge game new engine I think it's only

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:57.649 
huge game new engine I think it's only
going<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.430> be<00:02:56.489> coming<00:02:56.669> to<00:02:56.909> playstation<00:02:57.449> 4<00:02:57.629> and

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
going to be coming to playstation 4 and

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.140 
going to be coming to playstation 4 and
xbox<00:02:57.750> one<00:02:58.169> cause<00:02:59.159> of<00:02:59.189> the<00:02:59.519> new<00:02:59.669> ends<00:02:59.879> and<00:03:00.060> i

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
xbox one cause of the new ends and i

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.750 
xbox one cause of the new ends and i
think<00:03:00.480> that<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.900> current<00:03:01.680> general<00:03:02.129> last<00:03:02.400> gen

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
think that the current general last gen

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.439 
think that the current general last gen
can<00:03:03.359> actually<00:03:03.689> hold<00:03:03.959> up<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:05.310> these<00:03:05.849> engines

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:06.449 
can actually hold up to these engines

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:08.300 
can actually hold up to these engines
that's<00:03:06.689> coming<00:03:07.049> out<00:03:07.139> to<00:03:07.319> date<00:03:07.530> but<00:03:08.129> that's

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
that's coming out to date but that's

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.619 
that's coming out to date but that's
