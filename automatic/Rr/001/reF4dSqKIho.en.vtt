00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:04.800 

the<00:00:01.369> first<00:00:01.670> thing<00:00:01.969> you<00:00:02.479> need<00:00:02.929> to<00:00:02.959> do<00:00:03.490> when

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:04.810 
the first thing you need to do when

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.960 
the first thing you need to do when
calculating<00:00:05.810> and<00:00:06.080> figuring<00:00:06.740> out<00:00:06.980> how<00:00:07.910> many

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:07.970 
calculating and figuring out how many

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.930 
calculating and figuring out how many
risers<00:00:08.870> and<00:00:09.110> what<00:00:09.560> the<00:00:10.040> what<00:00:10.460> size<00:00:10.700> these

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:10.940 
risers and what the what size these

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.810 
risers and what the what size these
risers<00:00:11.269> will<00:00:11.900> actually<00:00:12.470> be<00:00:12.710> will<00:00:13.430> be<00:00:13.460> to

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
risers will actually be will be to

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.290 
risers will actually be will be to
measure<00:00:14.180> the<00:00:14.630> distance<00:00:15.110> from<00:00:15.200> the<00:00:15.620> top<00:00:15.950> of<00:00:16.309> the

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
measure the distance from the top of the

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.710 
measure the distance from the top of the
bottom<00:00:18.140> floor<00:00:18.529> top<00:00:19.070> of<00:00:19.279> the<00:00:19.400> lower<00:00:19.609> floor<00:00:20.029> to

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
bottom floor top of the lower floor to

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.829 
bottom floor top of the lower floor to
the<00:00:20.900> very<00:00:21.169> top<00:00:21.529> of<00:00:21.769> the<00:00:22.369> upper<00:00:22.849> floor<00:00:23.179> and<00:00:23.329> get

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:23.839 
the very top of the upper floor and get

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:26.290 
the very top of the upper floor and get
this<00:00:24.199> distance<00:00:24.859> and<00:00:25.069> in<00:00:25.550> our<00:00:25.669> example<00:00:26.149> we're

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
this distance and in our example we're

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.700 
this distance and in our example we're
going<00:00:26.480> to<00:00:26.569> use<00:00:26.659> 35<00:00:27.649> inches<00:00:28.569> then<00:00:29.569> you<00:00:29.929> will

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
going to use 35 inches then you will

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.119 
going to use 35 inches then you will
divide<00:00:31.159> the<00:00:31.699> average<00:00:32.480> riser<00:00:33.019> height<00:00:33.710> into

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
divide the average riser height into

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.799 
divide the average riser height into
this<00:00:34.579> number<00:00:35.320> we<00:00:36.320> should<00:00:36.350> end<00:00:37.039> up<00:00:37.399> with<00:00:37.809> four

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
this number we should end up with four

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.020 
this number we should end up with four
point<00:00:39.350> six<00:00:39.949> six<00:00:40.699> and<00:00:42.370> this<00:00:43.370> number<00:00:43.640> is

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
point six six and this number is

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.500 
point six six and this number is
important<00:00:44.870> for<00:00:45.079> two<00:00:45.289> ways<00:00:45.530> it's<00:00:46.429> not<00:00:46.609> a<00:00:47.030> it's

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
important for two ways it's not a it's

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.680 
important for two ways it's not a it's
not<00:00:47.570> our<00:00:47.960> riser<00:00:48.760> measurement<00:00:49.760> it's<00:00:50.059> going<00:00:50.480> to

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
not our riser measurement it's going to

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.549 
not our riser measurement it's going to
tell<00:00:51.050> us<00:00:51.079> basically<00:00:51.940> how<00:00:52.940> many<00:00:53.449> risers<00:00:54.289> we're

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
tell us basically how many risers we're

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.239 
tell us basically how many risers we're
going<00:00:54.890> to<00:00:55.039> have<00:00:55.339> so<00:00:56.300> we're<00:00:56.719> not<00:00:56.899> going<00:00:57.260> to<00:00:57.320> to

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:58.249 
going to have so we're not going to to

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:01.180 
going to have so we're not going to to
divide<00:00:58.909> four<00:00:59.690> point<00:01:00.019> six<00:01:00.320> six<00:01:00.589> into<00:01:00.980> anything

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
divide four point six six into anything

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.280 
divide four point six six into anything
but<00:01:02.120> we<00:01:02.329> are<00:01:02.539> going<00:01:02.899> to<00:01:03.489> use<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.760> next<00:01:05.290> closest

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
but we are going to use the next closest

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.060 
but we are going to use the next closest
number<00:01:07.190> so<00:01:07.910> we're<00:01:08.300> we<00:01:09.080> can<00:01:09.290> go<00:01:09.470> ahead<00:01:09.620> and

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
number so we're we can go ahead and

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.070 
number so we're we can go ahead and
divide<00:01:10.400> four<00:01:11.000> into<00:01:12.280> 35<00:01:13.280> we<00:01:14.060> can<00:01:14.240> divide<00:01:14.570> three

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
divide four into 35 we can divide three

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.330 
divide four into 35 we can divide three
into<00:01:15.400> 35<00:01:16.400> and<00:01:16.820> we<00:01:17.450> can<00:01:17.630> divide<00:01:17.900> 5<00:01:18.290> into<00:01:18.320> 35<00:01:19.100> what

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
into 35 and we can divide 5 into 35 what

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.860 
into 35 and we can divide 5 into 35 what
we're<00:01:19.460> going<00:01:19.730> to<00:01:19.790> go<00:01:19.970> ahead<00:01:20.120> and<00:01:20.360> start<00:01:20.630> with<00:01:20.840> a

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
we're going to go ahead and start with a

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.490 
we're going to go ahead and start with a
larger<00:01:21.590> number<00:01:21.970> so<00:01:22.970> after<00:01:23.870> we<00:01:24.050> divide<00:01:24.500> 5<00:01:25.250> into

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
larger number so after we divide 5 into

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.520 
larger number so after we divide 5 into
35<00:01:27.550> we<00:01:28.550> can<00:01:28.760> see<00:01:29.000> that<00:01:29.240> we<00:01:29.570> have<00:01:29.810> seven<00:01:30.410> now

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
35 we can see that we have seven now

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.430 
35 we can see that we have seven now
seven<00:01:30.980> isn't<00:01:31.190> going<00:01:31.610> to<00:01:31.700> be<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:32.030> bad<00:01:32.440> rise

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
seven isn't going to be a bad rise

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.720 
seven isn't going to be a bad rise
anything<00:01:34.340> between<00:01:34.580> seven<00:01:35.450> and<00:01:35.570> eight<00:01:35.840> inches

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
anything between seven and eight inches

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.070 
anything between seven and eight inches
preferably<00:01:37.730> between<00:01:38.300> seven<00:01:38.690> and<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:38.870> quarter

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
preferably between seven and a quarter

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.080 
preferably between seven and a quarter
and<00:01:39.440> seven<00:01:39.800> and<00:01:39.920> three-quarters<00:01:40.550> of<00:01:40.580> an<00:01:40.820> inch

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
and seven and three-quarters of an inch

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.860 
and seven and three-quarters of an inch
would<00:01:41.720> be<00:01:41.960> a<00:01:42.140> nice<00:01:42.650> riser<00:01:43.480> however<00:01:44.480> we<00:01:44.720> are

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
would be a nice riser however we are

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.160 
would be a nice riser however we are
going<00:01:44.900> to<00:01:45.110> double<00:01:45.590> check<00:01:45.620> and<00:01:46.300> divide<00:01:47.300> four

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
going to double check and divide four

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.070 
going to double check and divide four
into<00:01:48.670> 35<00:01:49.670> again<00:01:49.880> doesn't<00:01:50.330> hurt<00:01:50.450> to<00:01:50.600> divide<00:01:50.900> as

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
into 35 again doesn't hurt to divide as

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.490 
into 35 again doesn't hurt to divide as
many<00:01:51.290> of<00:01:51.380> these<00:01:51.440> numbers<00:01:51.830> into<00:01:52.010> as<00:01:52.280> we<00:01:52.460> want<00:01:52.730> to

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
many of these numbers into as we want to

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.750 
many of these numbers into as we want to
it's<00:01:54.500> just<00:01:54.770> going<00:01:54.920> to<00:01:55.100> give<00:01:55.250> us<00:01:55.400> more<00:01:55.700> options

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
it's just going to give us more options

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.910 
it's just going to give us more options
but<00:01:56.660> as<00:01:56.810> you<00:01:56.930> can<00:01:57.110> see<00:01:57.350> here<00:01:57.620> if<00:01:57.680> we<00:01:57.740> divide

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
but as you can see here if we divide

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.520 
but as you can see here if we divide
four<00:01:58.430> into<00:01:58.460> 35<00:01:59.150> we<00:01:59.360> come<00:01:59.570> up<00:01:59.750> with<00:01:59.930> eight<00:02:00.200> point

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
four into 35 we come up with eight point

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.310 
four into 35 we come up with eight point
seven<00:02:00.770> five<00:02:01.130> which<00:02:01.340> is<00:02:01.990> going<00:02:02.990> to<00:02:03.170> be

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
seven five which is going to be

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.470 
seven five which is going to be
unacceptable<00:02:03.980> for<00:02:04.550> most<00:02:04.790> building

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
unacceptable for most building

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.740 
unacceptable for most building

maximum rise for most building

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.700 
maximum rise for most building
departments<00:02:11.420> will<00:02:11.780> be<00:02:11.810> eight<00:02:12.260> inches<00:02:12.740> and<00:02:13.490> a

course anything above 8 inches won't be
comfortable<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.550> this<00:02:17.610> is<00:02:17.790> what<00:02:17.940> we're

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
comfortable and this is what we're

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.210 
comfortable and this is what we're
actually<00:02:18.270> shooting<00:02:18.870> for<00:02:19.140> is<00:02:19.410> safety<00:02:19.980> and

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
actually shooting for is safety and

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.850 
actually shooting for is safety and

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.880 
comfort without breaking any building
codes<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:24.060> there<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.600> in<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.840> nutshell<00:02:25.080> it

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890
