00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.340
 besides being the only human being that 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.620
 talk to these things go through hundreds 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.720
 he counted francs that he made 53 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.700
 degrees below zero that with those 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.590
 temperatures will ask people not 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.900
 come out because your nose freezes and 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:38.190
 ears of necrosis because they do not know what is 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:41.160
 this to be seen from bing in that it's just a 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.220
 task on the border between the us and canada 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.410
 state of new york down ontario 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.400
 canada from the opposite side and what 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.140
 you are seeing is a great 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.030
 throat 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.330
 covered by that cloud that does not really 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.459
 it's hot water or anything and that's water 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.819
 that is not frozen that the best is 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.690
 at 2 degrees to 3 degrees of temperature not 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.700
 is zero or less 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.930
 and it causes this clear because it is 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.060
 doing I do not know less 10 minus 20 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.310
 Niagara Falls are like this 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.689
 they are frozen in their entirety but 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.689
 good part yes 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.910
 good things to do with so much cold 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.620
 federico good and want to see these that 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.840
 are when the cold becomes a 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.970
 artistic fact these are beacons of 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:33.730
 different places in the north of the USA 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:34.870
 clear pouf 50 gr below zero we read yesterday 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.310
 they had warned they saw people 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.459
 that does not come out because the tip of the nose 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.319
 and the ears are frozen with a 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.800
 exposure of between 5 and 10 minutes to that 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:47.200
 cold is frozen these are images 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.720
 artistic if you want this to be 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.000
 he froze he put on the base this he put on a 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.950
 little water in the beard or a 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.610
 beard in snow does not urge these images 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.610
 impressive 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.930
 captain morgan if that nose was red 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.060
 and now we are talking I suppose I 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.849
 people who are used to clear but 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.379
 not so much you do not remember we have 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.690
 they said from chicago one thing are 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:18.729
 get used to ten degrees below zero 13 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.030
 which is what the 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:24.070
 winter but not my maximum 40 of 100 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.100
 60 I do not know what you're used to unless 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.320
 10 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.160
 and then green the right clothes the 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.160
 adequate heating 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.430
 the theme is that this year they had 40 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.970
 below zero water and the night the 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.970
 Capitol 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.390
 Washington is also cold is in Miami 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.650
 florida if i was saying it received 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.110
 I was looking at the forecasts for the 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.490
 next days improvements must be shared 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.310
 the weekend at chicago tribune 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.139
 have a joke they have renamed in the 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.939
 city â€‹â€‹like siberia 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.310
 it 's not, I 'm not inventing, there's 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:00.930
 neither good nor bad has the chicago 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.479
 tribune now 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.460
 of the clear of the cold that are happening and 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:09.289
 earth in the greatest the biggest blow of 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.289
