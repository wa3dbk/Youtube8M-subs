00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
section you're switching between two

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.060 
section you're switching between two
cards<00:01:02.149> you're<00:01:02.719> switching<00:01:03.289> between<00:01:03.500> an<00:01:03.860> E

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070

major<00:01:04.250> chord<00:01:04.489> which<00:01:05.210> is<00:01:05.269> inverted<00:01:05.810> so<00:01:05.960> your

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
major chord which is inverted so your

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.550 
major chord which is inverted so your

pinkie or whatever finger is easiest for

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.469 
pinkie or whatever finger is easiest for
you<00:01:09.740> actually<00:01:10.069> I<00:01:10.100> guess<00:01:10.369> you're<00:01:10.850> gonna<00:01:11.270> play<00:01:11.450> a

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
you actually I guess you're gonna play a

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.639 
you actually I guess you're gonna play a
G<00:01:11.780> sharp<00:01:11.810> a<00:01:12.380> B<00:01:12.679> and<00:01:13.610> then<00:01:14.600> E<00:01:14.990> and<00:01:15.259> if<00:01:15.380> you<00:01:15.440> sort

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
G sharp a B and then E and if you sort

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.029 
G sharp a B and then E and if you sort
of<00:01:15.710> see<00:01:16.009> that<00:01:16.220> shape<00:01:16.700> as<00:01:16.909> one<00:01:17.119> chord<00:01:17.450> as<00:01:17.950> one<00:01:18.950> of

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
of see that shape as one chord as one of

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:20.109 
of see that shape as one chord as one of
the<00:01:19.100> course<00:01:19.280> you're<00:01:19.369> working<00:01:19.460> with<00:01:19.700> that<00:01:19.909> you

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
the course you're working with that you

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.730 
the course you're working with that you
return<00:01:20.479> to<00:01:20.630> it'll<00:01:20.840> make<00:01:21.050> this<00:01:21.200> section<00:01:21.530> a<00:01:21.590> lot

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
return to it'll make this section a lot

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.450 
return to it'll make this section a lot
easier<00:01:22.130> so<00:01:23.649> in<00:01:24.649> your<00:01:24.800> right<00:01:24.950> hand<00:01:25.159> you<00:01:25.250> move

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
easier so in your right hand you move

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.850 
easier so in your right hand you move
from<00:01:25.670> an<00:01:25.850> e<00:01:26.179> you've<00:01:26.630> just<00:01:26.869> put<00:01:27.020> that<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.560> e

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
from an e you've just put that the e

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.350 
from an e you've just put that the e
minor<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:28.280> then<00:01:28.340> you<00:01:28.429> move<00:01:28.580> from<00:01:28.670> an<00:01:28.819> e<00:01:29.000> to<00:01:29.240> an

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
minor and then you move from an e to an

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.960 
minor and then you move from an e to an
F<00:01:30.549> so<00:01:31.549> you're<00:01:31.670> in<00:01:31.759> this<00:01:31.880> chord<00:01:32.149> and<00:01:33.700> as<00:01:34.700> soon<00:01:34.880> as

when<00:02:09.259> you<00:02:09.380> play<00:02:09.619> that<00:02:09.769> D<00:02:09.950> sharp<00:02:10.220> you're

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
when you play that D sharp you're

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.110 
when you play that D sharp you're
playing

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.070 

and<00:02:13.209> f-sharp<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.860> you<00:02:15.760> resolve<00:02:16.180> this<00:02:16.390> d<00:02:16.840> sharp

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
and f-sharp and you resolve this d sharp

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.800 
and f-sharp and you resolve this d sharp
to<00:02:17.230> an<00:02:17.319> e<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:18.000> when<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.090> hit<00:02:19.239> that<00:02:19.269> e<00:02:19.420> you

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
to an e and when you hit that e you

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.040 
to an e and when you hit that e you
start<00:02:20.459> your<00:02:21.459> left<00:02:21.700> hand<00:02:21.910> arpeggio<00:02:22.420> on<00:02:22.750> that

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
start your left hand arpeggio on that

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.309 
start your left hand arpeggio on that
first<00:02:23.230> quarter<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.560> showed<00:02:23.769> you<00:02:23.950> G<00:02:24.730> sharp<00:02:25.030> B<00:02:25.330> and

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
first quarter I showed you G sharp B and

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.970 
first quarter I showed you G sharp B and
E<00:02:27.300> so<00:02:28.300> if<00:02:28.690> that's<00:02:28.870> confusing<00:02:29.200> I<00:02:29.319> must<00:02:29.500> start

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
E so if that's confusing I must start

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.039 
E so if that's confusing I must start
start<00:02:30.430> over<00:02:30.610> again<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:30.879> just<00:02:30.940> sort<00:02:31.209> of<00:02:31.269> review

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
start over again and just sort of review

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.320 
start over again and just sort of review
so<00:02:32.650> that<00:02:32.799> year<00:02:33.010> there's<00:02:33.220> no<00:02:33.310> confusion<00:02:33.489> you've

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
so that year there's no confusion you've

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.119 
so that year there's no confusion you've
just<00:02:34.690> come<00:02:35.140> out<00:02:35.260> of<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:35.440> part<00:02:35.650> that<00:02:35.709> sounds<00:02:36.040> like

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
just come out of a part that sounds like

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.860 
just come out of a part that sounds like
this<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:38.280> then<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.370> play<00:02:39.519> this<00:02:39.640> E<00:02:39.819> and<00:02:40.330> then

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
this and then you play this E and then

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.229 
this and then you play this E and then
an<00:02:41.019> F<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:42.190> when<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.370> play<00:02:42.489> that<00:02:42.610> F<00:02:42.819> you<00:02:43.060> move

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
used to come up to here the second time

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.010 
used to come up to here the second time
in<00:03:18.850> this<00:03:18.940> section<00:03:19.180> you<00:03:19.480> don't<00:03:19.630> go<00:03:19.720> up<00:03:19.780> there

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
in this section you don't go up there

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.190 
in this section you don't go up there
again<00:03:20.140> you<00:03:20.500> just<00:03:20.620> stay<00:03:20.860> on<00:03:20.890> this<00:03:21.070> F<00:03:22.200> and

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
again you just stay on this F and

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.110 
again you just stay on this F and
resolve<00:03:23.770> to<00:03:24.010> this<00:03:24.160> for<00:03:25.090> two<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:26.470> then<00:03:27.340> so<00:03:28.000> the

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
resolve to this for two and then so the

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.900 
resolve to this for two and then so the
only<00:03:28.240> way<00:03:28.480> this<00:03:28.630> whole<00:03:28.930> piece<00:03:29.110> ends<00:03:29.910> this

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
only way this whole piece ends this
