00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:03.220
Leo  and the boat

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:15.600
Look, this is a playground and the big cars constructed by Leo the Truck.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.160
Hey, here he comes!

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.420
Hello, Leo.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.780
What are you going to construct today?

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.440
A ship like the one in the picture?

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.099
Well…

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.040
let’s start!

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.280
First we’ll find the body of the ship.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.040
This is the cabin for the captain.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.340
Let’s put an orange roof on it.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.100
A blue chimney with 2 rings.

00:01:32.416 --> 00:01:34.416
One, two.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.900
And a propeller to make the ship move forward.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.420
Very beautiful!

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.080
What’s up, Leo?

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.960
Do you think something is missing?

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.120
You can go and search…

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.780
Have you guessed what Leo is looking for?

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.800
Right! А lifebuoy.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.720
According to the rules of safety every ship must have a lifebuoy on board.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.560
Come on, Leo. Take it to its place.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.180
Look, here is the helm.

00:02:48.182 --> 00:02:50.182
Let’s take it as well!

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.200
Leo, you are a real captain!

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.140
Let’s put the lifebuoy…

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.360
and the helm on the ship.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.420
Wonderful!

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.820
Well done, Leo!

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.940
And here comes a helicopter that will help to put the ship on water.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.740
Like this.

00:04:01.344 --> 00:04:03.344
You are great, Leo!
