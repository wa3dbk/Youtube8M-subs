very early so my best luck was getting
on<00:02:22.350> eBay<00:02:22.739> but<00:02:23.120> they<00:02:24.120> put<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.630> on<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:25.320> Lego<00:02:25.739> shop

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
on eBay but they put it on a Lego shop

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.250 
on eBay but they put it on a Lego shop
at<00:02:26.130> home<00:02:26.310> for<00:02:26.970> backorder<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:27.750> if<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:27.930> ordered

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
at home for backorder so if you ordered

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.780 
at home for backorder so if you ordered
it<00:02:28.320> they<00:02:28.500> would<00:02:28.709> ship<00:02:28.950> at<00:02:29.070> a<00:02:29.100> later<00:02:29.340> date<00:02:29.580> and

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
it they would ship at a later date and

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.759 
it they would ship at a later date and
this<00:02:30.510> is<00:02:30.720> how<00:02:30.870> long<00:02:30.989> I<00:02:31.080> had<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.260> wait<00:02:31.440> I<00:02:31.470> had<00:02:31.680> to

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
this is how long I had to wait I had to

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.710 
this is how long I had to wait I had to
wait<00:02:31.890> about<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.610> ordered<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.239> maybe<00:02:33.390> like<00:02:33.569> the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
wait about I ordered it maybe like the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.570 
wait about I ordered it maybe like the
second<00:02:34.080> or<00:02:34.110> first<00:02:34.440> week<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.680> January<00:02:34.830> so<00:02:35.519> I

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
second or first week of January so I

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.710 
second or first week of January so I
didn't<00:02:35.760> wait<00:02:35.850> too<00:02:36.090> long<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.360> get<00:02:36.569> this

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720

think<00:03:11.250> it's<00:03:11.340> really<00:03:11.519> fair<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.760> do<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.239> best<00:03:12.780> of

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
think it's really fair to do a best of

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.390 
think it's really fair to do a best of
list<00:03:13.230> when<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.590> haven't<00:03:13.859> gotten<00:03:14.010> all<00:03:14.280> the
