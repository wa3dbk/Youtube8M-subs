an<00:01:05.369> outboard<00:01:05.700> lead<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.240> get<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.570> get<00:01:06.869> further

an outboard lead to get the get further

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.460 
an outboard lead to get the get further
out<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:08.640> really<00:01:09.240> has<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> double<00:01:10.020> benefit

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
out and this really has a double benefit

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.890 
out and this really has a double benefit
because<00:01:10.710> not<00:01:11.520> only<00:01:11.549> does<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.000> make<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.330> shape

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
because not only does it make the shape

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.190 
because not only does it make the shape
of<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.380> jib<00:01:13.740> more<00:01:14.400> even<00:01:14.850> from<00:01:15.090> bottom<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.900> top

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
of the jib more even from bottom to top

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.370 
of the jib more even from bottom to top
and<00:01:16.650> elite<00:01:17.460> profile<00:01:18.090> much<00:01:18.360> better<00:01:18.659> but<00:01:19.290> it

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
and elite profile much better but it

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.920 
and elite profile much better but it
also<00:01:19.530> opens<00:01:20.400> up<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.700> slot<00:01:21.030> between<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.659> jib

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
also opens up the slot between the jib

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.050 
also opens up the slot between the jib
and<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.380> main<00:01:22.590> allows<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.159> main<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.670> be<00:01:23.820> more

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
and the main allows the main to be more

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.370 
and the main allows the main to be more
more<00:01:24.720> effective<00:01:25.460> so<00:01:26.570> you<00:01:27.570> can<00:01:27.750> get<00:01:27.930> gains<00:01:28.170> of

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
more effective so you can get gains of

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.410 
more effective so you can get gains of
over<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.770> not<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> boat<00:01:29.369> speed<00:01:29.670> just<00:01:30.000> by<00:01:30.150> doing

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
over and not a boat speed just by doing

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.910 
over and not a boat speed just by doing
something<00:01:30.659> as<00:01:31.020> simple<00:01:31.200> as<00:01:31.380> setting<00:01:31.680> up<00:01:31.770> now

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
something as simple as setting up now

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.679 
something as simple as setting up now
board<00:01:32.220> lead<00:01:32.369> which<00:01:32.640> which<00:01:33.090> involves<00:01:33.540> just

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
board lead which which involves just

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.929 
board lead which which involves just
putting<00:01:33.960> one<00:01:33.990> block<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.650> rail<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.130> one

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
putting one block on the rail and one

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.990 
putting one block on the rail and one
extra<00:01:36.240> sheet<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:37.009> so<00:01:38.009> we've<00:01:38.220> just<00:01:38.250> been<00:01:38.610> doing

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
extra sheet on so we've just been doing

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.819 
extra sheet on so we've just been doing
that<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.540> we've<00:01:39.659> got<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> block<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.650> rail

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
that so we've got a block on the rail

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.580 
that so we've got a block on the rail
one<00:01:41.490> sheet<00:01:41.820> on<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.210> clew<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:43.259> now<00:01:43.409> there's

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
one sheet on the clew so now there's

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.399 
one sheet on the clew so now there's
actually<00:01:43.710> three<00:01:44.220> sheets<00:01:44.610> on<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.939> clue

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
actually three sheets on the clue

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.469 
actually three sheets on the clue
I'm<00:01:46.340> going<00:01:46.609> to<00:01:46.670> ease<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:47.749> old<00:01:48.280> inwardly<00:01:49.479> take

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
I'm going to ease the old inwardly take

00:01:50.479 --> 00:02:02.139 
I'm going to ease the old inwardly take
up<00:01:50.689> on<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:51.409> new<00:01:51.819> outboard<00:01:52.819> lead<00:02:00.939> it<00:02:01.939> looks

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
up on the new outboard lead it looks

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:03.309 
up on the new outboard lead it looks
much<00:02:02.329> better<00:02:02.539> already<00:02:02.719> and<00:02:02.959> you<00:02:03.170> can

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
much better already and you can

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.069 
much better already and you can
sometimes<00:02:03.770> share<00:02:04.130> half<00:02:04.909> the<00:02:05.149> load<00:02:05.359> between

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
sometimes share half the load between

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.169 
sometimes share half the load between
the<00:02:06.500> outboard<00:02:06.920> lead<00:02:07.280> and<00:02:07.579> the<00:02:07.640> inboard<00:02:07.969> lead

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
the outboard lead and the inboard lead

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.419 
the outboard lead and the inboard lead
if<00:02:08.330> you<00:02:08.479> only<00:02:08.629> want<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:08.899> take<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.289> sheet<00:02:09.560> out<00:02:09.799> a

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
if you only want to take the sheet out a

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.070 
if you only want to take the sheet out a
small<00:02:10.970> amount<00:02:11.000> if<00:02:11.420> you're<00:02:11.569> only<00:02:11.840> very

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
small amount if you're only very

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.130 
small amount if you're only very
slightly<00:02:12.440> cranked<00:02:12.950> off<00:02:13.239> but<00:02:14.239> speeds<00:02:14.870> already

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
slightly cranked off but speeds already

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.860 
slightly cranked off but speeds already
increased<00:02:15.680> by<00:02:15.890> nearly<00:02:16.459> and<00:02:16.700> not<00:02:16.849> there<00:02:17.120> so<00:02:17.810> it

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
increased by nearly and not there so it

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.390 
increased by nearly and not there so it
really<00:02:17.900> does<00:02:18.290> work<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:19.010> it's<00:02:19.129> definitely

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
really does work and it's definitely

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.490 
really does work and it's definitely
worth<00:02:19.610> trying<00:02:21.220> steering<00:02:22.220> out<00:02:22.370> I<00:02:23.500> first

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
worth trying steering out I first

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.430

sitting<00:02:25.280> down<00:02:25.459> to<00:02:25.700> be<00:02:25.819> honest<00:02:26.170> because<00:02:27.170> you've

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
sitting down to be honest because you've

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.380 
sitting down to be honest because you've
you're<00:02:27.769> in<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.160> safer<00:02:28.670> position<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:31.209> you<00:02:32.209> can

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
you're in a safer position and you can

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.000 
you're in a safer position and you can

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
most important thing is to do a very

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.479 
most important thing is to do a very
accurate<00:02:43.760> course<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:45.920> keep<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.310> boat

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
accurate course and to keep the boat

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.229 
accurate course and to keep the boat
speed<00:02:46.760> high<00:02:46.940> so<00:02:47.660> to<00:02:47.690> be<00:02:48.290> adjusting<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:48.799> sails

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.870 
speed high so to be adjusting the sails
to<00:02:50.440> maximize<00:02:51.440> your<00:02:51.650> boat<00:02:51.829> speed<00:02:52.130> so<00:02:52.639> as<00:02:52.670> the

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
to maximize your boat speed so as the

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.580 
to maximize your boat speed so as the
wind<00:02:53.060> increases<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:55.750> you<00:02:56.750> will<00:02:56.989> get<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.560> a

wind increases you you will get to a

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.250 
wind increases you you will get to a
