you're going to need these guys right
here<00:02:31.549> this<00:02:32.549> is<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.819> what<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.150> power<00:02:33.359> supply

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:33.859 
here this is the what the power supply

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:37.759 
here this is the what the power supply
connects<00:02:34.859> to<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.220> your<00:02:35.340> motherboard<00:02:35.639> right<00:02:36.769> so

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
connects to to your motherboard right so

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:38.960 
connects to to your motherboard right so
we're<00:02:38.130> going<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.310> get<00:02:38.370> our<00:02:38.489> power<00:02:38.670> supply

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
we're going to get our power supply

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.370 
we're going to get our power supply
tester<00:02:39.590> which<00:02:40.590> is<00:02:40.769> right<00:02:40.950> here<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:42.170> we<00:02:43.170> get<00:02:43.260> our

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
tester which is right here so we get our

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.050 
tester which is right here so we get our
power<00:02:43.560> supply<00:02:43.920> tester<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:46.459> we<00:02:47.459> get<00:02:47.639> our<00:02:47.790> power

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
power supply tester and we get our power

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.159 
power supply tester and we get our power
supply<00:02:48.269> connector<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:50.239> we<00:02:51.239> put<00:02:51.630> it<00:02:51.750> on<00:02:51.900> the

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:54.169 
supply connector and we put it on the

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:58.039 
supply connector and we put it on the
tester<00:02:55.169> right<00:02:55.410> here<00:02:56.510> that's<00:02:57.510> not<00:02:57.690> right<00:02:57.840> there

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
tester right here that's not right there

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.099 
tester right here that's not right there
I<00:02:58.079> think<00:02:58.200> it's<00:02:58.560> over<00:02:58.799> here

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
I think it's over here

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.800 
I think it's over here
it's<00:03:01.109> kinda<00:03:01.290> hard<00:03:01.380> to<00:03:01.470> do<00:03:01.590> with<00:03:01.709> one<00:03:01.919> hand

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
it's kinda hard to do with one hand

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.850 
it's kinda hard to do with one hand
there<00:03:03.810> we<00:03:03.959> go

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.270 

so<00:03:08.750> all<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:10.020> lights<00:03:10.230> turn<00:03:10.500> on<00:03:10.650> my<00:03:11.010> power

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
so all the lights turn on my power

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.910 
so all the lights turn on my power
supply<00:03:11.490> is<00:03:11.730> good<00:03:13.580> if<00:03:14.580> yours<00:03:15.590> if<00:03:16.590> you're<00:03:16.770> using

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
supply is good if yours if you're using

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.970 
supply is good if yours if you're using
the<00:03:17.130> power<00:03:17.310> supply<00:03:17.670> tester<00:03:17.910> and<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:19.080> couple<00:03:19.860> of

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
the power supply tester and a couple of

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.560 
the power supply tester and a couple of
these<00:03:20.040> lights<00:03:20.310> are<00:03:20.490> missing<00:03:20.880> if<00:03:21.210> only<00:03:21.480> a

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
these lights are missing if only a

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.540 
these lights are missing if only a
couple<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:21.930> them<00:03:22.050> are<00:03:22.230> turning<00:03:22.530> on<00:03:22.620> that<00:03:23.370> means

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
couple of them are turning on that means

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.480 
couple of them are turning on that means
your<00:03:23.640> power<00:03:23.820> supply<00:03:24.000> is<00:03:24.240> bad<00:03:24.540> okay<00:03:25.200> if<00:03:26.190> all<00:03:26.340> of

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
your power supply is bad okay if all of

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.280 
your power supply is bad okay if all of
them<00:03:26.640> are<00:03:26.730> on<00:03:26.760> your<00:03:27.390> power<00:03:27.600> supply<00:03:27.780> is<00:03:28.020> good

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
them are on your power supply is good

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.390 
them are on your power supply is good
all<00:03:28.830> right

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.910 

so<00:03:32.540> let's<00:03:33.540> say<00:03:33.750> your<00:03:33.900> let's<00:03:34.440> say<00:03:34.530> your<00:03:34.710> power

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
so let's say your let's say your power

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.890 
so let's say your let's say your power
supply<00:03:35.220> was<00:03:35.400> good<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:35.880> still<00:03:36.360> your<00:03:36.540> computer

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
supply was good and still your computer

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.310 
supply was good and still your computer
wasn't<00:03:37.200> turning<00:03:37.350> on<00:03:39.170> what<00:03:40.170> do<00:03:40.230> we<00:03:40.320> do<00:03:40.440> now<00:03:40.640> okay

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
wasn't turning on what do we do now okay

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.620 
wasn't turning on what do we do now okay
so<00:03:43.320> if<00:03:43.500> if<00:03:43.920> your<00:03:44.460> power<00:03:44.670> supply<00:03:44.880> is<00:03:45.090> good<00:03:45.390> and

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
so if if your power supply is good and

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.449 
so if if your power supply is good and
your<00:03:46.020> power<00:03:46.230> cable<00:03:46.680> is<00:03:46.740> good<00:03:46.920> then<00:03:47.130> that<00:03:47.280> means

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
your power cable is good then that means

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.800 
your power cable is good then that means
your<00:03:47.640> motherboard<00:03:48.209> is<00:03:48.770> bad<00:03:49.770> okay<00:03:50.690> so<00:03:51.690> we're

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
your motherboard is bad okay so we're

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.420 
your motherboard is bad okay so we're
going<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:51.990> use<00:03:52.140> a<00:03:52.170> motherboard<00:03:52.500> tester<00:03:53.250> and

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
going to use a motherboard tester and

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:03.040 
going to use a motherboard tester and
also<00:03:54.330> you<00:03:54.390> can<00:03:54.600> get<00:03:54.720> this<00:03:54.870> on<00:03:55.050> eBay

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.960 

next<00:04:03.830> through<00:04:06.190> through<00:04:07.190> these<00:04:07.370> ports<00:04:07.790> right

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
next through through these ports right

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:14.150 
next through through these ports right
here

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.920 

which<00:04:15.160> is<00:04:15.310> PCI<00:04:15.730> I<00:04:15.880> believe<00:04:16.329> that's<00:04:16.660> what<00:04:16.810> they

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
which is PCI I believe that's what they

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:23.670 
which is PCI I believe that's what they
call<00:04:17.109> this<00:04:17.260> PCI<00:04:17.680> PCI<00:04:18.959> ports<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:22.320> it's<00:04:23.320> got<00:04:23.500> for

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
call this PCI PCI ports and it's got for

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.850 
call this PCI PCI ports and it's got for
both<00:04:23.830> of<00:04:23.980> them<00:04:24.070> for<00:04:24.280> the<00:04:24.580> Strait<00:04:24.880> and<00:04:25.800> for<00:04:26.800> the

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
both of them for the Strait and for the

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.920 
both of them for the Strait and for the
one<00:04:26.980> that's<00:04:27.070> that<00:04:28.030> has<00:04:28.150> it<00:04:28.330> like<00:04:28.450> that<00:04:28.660> all

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
one that's that has it like that all

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.150 
one that's that has it like that all
right<00:04:28.990> so<00:04:29.290> we're<00:04:29.560> going<00:04:29.650> to<00:04:29.710> go<00:04:29.830> ahead<00:04:29.919> and

right so we're going to go ahead and

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.060 
right so we're going to go ahead and
install<00:04:30.430> this<00:04:30.550> guy<00:04:30.790> it's<00:04:31.090> pretty<00:04:31.270> easy<00:04:32.070> we're

things okay so use this users guide to

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.680 
things okay so use this users guide to
look<00:05:29.830> at<00:05:29.919> the<00:05:29.979> code<00:05:30.190> so<00:05:30.940> let's<00:05:30.970> plug<00:05:31.240> it<00:05:31.390> in<00:05:31.510> and

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
look at the code so let's plug it in and

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.940 
look at the code so let's plug it in and
let's<00:05:31.840> see<00:05:31.990> what<00:05:32.140> it<00:05:32.260> tells<00:05:32.410> us<00:05:34.830> what<00:05:35.830> I'm

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
let's see what it tells us what I'm

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:36.930 
let's see what it tells us what I'm
going<00:05:36.070> to<00:05:36.130> have<00:05:36.220> to<00:05:36.310> do<00:05:36.430> is<00:05:36.520> connect<00:05:36.789> it<00:05:36.880> back

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
going to have to do is connect it back

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.219 
going to have to do is connect it back
to<00:05:37.120> the<00:05:37.240> motherboard<00:05:37.660> because<00:05:37.810> I<00:05:37.990> have<00:05:38.140> it

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
to the motherboard because I have it

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:40.650 
to the motherboard because I have it
right<00:05:38.350> out<00:05:38.470> to<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:38.650> to<00:05:39.430> the<00:05:39.550> tester<00:05:39.910> so<00:05:40.150> let<00:05:40.600> me

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
right out to the to the tester so let me

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.750 
right out to the to the tester so let me
connect<00:05:40.900> it<00:05:40.960> back<00:05:41.080> to<00:05:41.200> the<00:05:41.289> motherboard<00:05:41.760> so

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
connect it back to the motherboard so

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.890 
connect it back to the motherboard so
there<00:05:42.910> is<00:05:43.060> connected<00:05:43.450> to<00:05:43.479> the<00:05:43.660> motherboard

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
there is connected to the motherboard

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.510 
there is connected to the motherboard
let's<00:05:44.380> turn<00:05:44.560> on<00:05:44.680> the<00:05:44.710> computer<00:05:45.190> and<00:05:45.250> let's<00:05:45.400> see

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
let's turn on the computer and let's see

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.459 
let's turn on the computer and let's see
what<00:05:45.640> it<00:05:45.729> says

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:51.469 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:55.719 

it's<00:05:51.860> telling<00:05:52.339> us<00:05:52.550> nothing<00:05:53.029> actually<00:05:54.729> and

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
it's telling us nothing actually and

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.429 
it's telling us nothing actually and
that<00:05:56.029> is<00:05:56.149> because<00:05:56.449> my<00:05:56.599> motherboard<00:05:56.929> is<00:05:57.199> good

00:05:57.429 --> 00:05:57.439 
that is because my motherboard is good

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:59.139 
that is because my motherboard is good
that's<00:05:57.769> why<00:05:57.979> it's<00:05:58.099> not<00:05:58.279> saying<00:05:58.580> anything<00:05:58.999> if

00:05:59.139 --> 00:05:59.149 
that's why it's not saying anything if

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:01.600 
that's why it's not saying anything if
yours<00:05:59.389> says<00:05:59.689> a<00:05:59.719> code<00:06:00.189> it<00:06:01.189> means<00:06:01.429> your

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
yours says a code it means your

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.059 
yours says a code it means your
motherboard<00:06:01.939> is<00:06:02.330> has<00:06:02.800> there's<00:06:03.800> something

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:04.069 
motherboard is has there's something

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:05.409 
motherboard is has there's something
wrong<00:06:04.159> with<00:06:04.339> your<00:06:04.429> motherboard<00:06:04.699> actually<00:06:05.179> and

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
wrong with your motherboard actually and

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:07.449 
wrong with your motherboard actually and
also<00:06:06.110> these<00:06:06.259> lights<00:06:06.559> here<00:06:06.889> indicate

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:07.459 
also these lights here indicate

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:09.189 
also these lights here indicate
something<00:06:07.849> else<00:06:07.999> so<00:06:08.209> your<00:06:08.449> users<00:06:08.719> guide<00:06:08.959> will

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 
something else so your users guide will

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:15.939 
something else so your users guide will
talk<00:06:09.439> about<00:06:09.619> that<00:06:10.719> and<00:06:12.189> that's<00:06:13.189> it<00:06:14.619> if<00:06:15.619> a<00:06:15.739> code

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:15.949 
talk about that and that's it if a code

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:17.619 
talk about that and that's it if a code
pops<00:06:16.219> up<00:06:16.519> it<00:06:16.729> means<00:06:16.819> your<00:06:16.999> motherboard<00:06:17.449> is

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:17.629 
pops up it means your motherboard is

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:04.699 
also this one here this one here is also

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:07.270 
also this one here this one here is also
a<00:07:04.850> power<00:07:05.090> cable<00:07:05.389> I<00:07:05.830> think<00:07:06.830> this<00:07:06.949> one<00:07:07.100> might<00:07:07.250> be

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 
a power cable I think this one might be

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.490 
a power cable I think this one might be
the<00:07:07.460> actual<00:07:07.760> one<00:07:07.910> for<00:07:08.090> my<00:07:08.180> power<00:07:08.360> but<00:07:09.169> if<00:07:09.410> you

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:09.500 
the actual one for my power but if you

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.060 
the actual one for my power but if you
notice<00:07:09.770> they<00:07:09.949> go<00:07:10.100> down<00:07:10.280> here<00:07:11.620> to<00:07:12.620> these<00:07:12.800> right

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:13.070 
notice they go down here to these right

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.420 
notice they go down here to these right
here<00:07:13.280> so<00:07:14.590> so<00:07:15.590> make<00:07:15.740> sure<00:07:15.770> those<00:07:16.040> are<00:07:16.100> connected

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:16.430 
here so so make sure those are connected

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.740 
here so so make sure those are connected
right<00:07:16.850> and<00:07:18.250> that's<00:07:19.250> the<00:07:19.729> pipe<00:07:19.940> if<00:07:20.090> your<00:07:20.540> power

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:20.750 
right and that's the pipe if your power

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.170 
right and that's the pipe if your power
button<00:07:21.050> is<00:07:21.260> the<00:07:21.350> problem<00:07:21.800> you<00:07:22.669> might<00:07:22.850> want<00:07:23.060> to

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:23.180 
button is the problem you might want to

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.050 
button is the problem you might want to
change<00:07:23.389> your<00:07:23.570> case<00:07:23.870> or<00:07:24.220> order<00:07:25.220> another<00:07:25.550> one<00:07:25.639> I

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:26.060
