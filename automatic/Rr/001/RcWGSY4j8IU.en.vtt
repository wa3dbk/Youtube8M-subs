00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.849
 to 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.279
 Hello such very good at all we are 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.289
 here in minecraft to show you a 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.360
 cosilla and seen there there is a problem 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.820
 with the sabers in the sky does not matter 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.119
 nothing and good as you have seen in the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.119
 Title 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.870
 that is, a man enters by gta no 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.920
 I'm not going to play here, I do not have a captor 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.840
 or anything bad and my time right now I 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.020
 interested in this kind of thing if I know that 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.230
 It's a great game but good for going to 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:48.000
 a folio out there 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.910
 I found this map of 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.680
 from one of what would have it down without problem 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:58.100
 indirectly taking the page 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.469
 Y 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.159
 and one of the classes the franklin house 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.990
 5 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.250
 I hope that 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:15.530
 of the most diehard fans like it 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:17.910
 first let's take it out 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.770
 I wear it knows it so you can see everything 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:24.700
 very well 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.700
 while the door of this ship 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.330
 and good once 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:39.579
 quartz the room good I always 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.770
 I would leave the quartz for the stone but not 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.770
 with the other 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.460
 it would give me a very 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.530
 a professional to my liking 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.210
 one for the others 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.890
 pretty well lit colors 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.330
 they also come hurt where I believe 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.850
 that in this case pretty well 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:06.210
 and we go to the house but we're going to 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.210
 suppose that this is pretty cool 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.590
 the box I accept 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.550
 men I hope the house everything is a 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.510
 hunt piece to a deer to a bear something 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.510
 I do not think it 's a human head 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.980
 here the truth is that these colors 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.950
 and I do not see it 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.920
 and not 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.959
 he wanted to steal 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.970
 for example the seats in red with the 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.080
 white sticks pretty much any 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.550
 warm tone with the with the stone and what 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.090
 soft of what will stick well as 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.730
 there the orange 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.909
 but that will always strike mind 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.569
 although also with a specific text 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:06.730
 after 5 who surely what 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:10.769
 there will surely be people who can 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.769
 here for non-smokers 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:19.460
 the exclusive lamp to get the 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.990
 lamp I have been told that 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.300
 good 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.540
 get here at your house after a day 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.230
 of business 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.230
 you come out here 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.460
 now when the sky breaks 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.730
 and I thought I was going down 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.730
 because I could from below the pool 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:53.440
 this will be your main the saints are a 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.440
 luxury the saints that belong 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.930
 it does not seem that 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:06.810
 has a good bookstore not the name 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:10.219
 transluce ice as you see here 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.219
 the Lord said Lord Rite has a 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:13.219
 swimming pool 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.010
 ours the terrace 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:28.410
 I believe that it is not 100% finished or I 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.410
 I think it's different 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:41.750
 it was a thing that in shop 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:44.100
 and I know who it so I 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.680
 voucher voucher 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.920
 let's just surprised my friend 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:53.160
 this possible umbrella 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:56.130
 I will never think that pretty good 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.390
 in the mini pool do not put outside 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.190
 of course 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.190
 I'm not seeing to see 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.270
 it will be 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.030
 3 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.810
 look 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.810
 efe 2 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.550
 my mom how nice 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:35.270
 how beautiful are these channels 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:39.230
 how to fly fly or the house was out like this 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.230
 that what would be 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.969
 this cow 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.979
 and days 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.460
 well, the house is very cool and you have to 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:51.460
 say it 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.610
 to bush 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:04.260
 I put marsh 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:07.350
 good has been a mini review 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.770
 to see this there is no I liked it 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.229
 quite the house 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.129
 the truth if it were with other packages of 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:15.500
 sure reading that would have been 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:17.530
 even better I do not have any to 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.530
 detectors 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.530
 any 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.400
 the truth that like the palm tree the palm tree 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:31.350
 straight palm trees there is less design of 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.690
 Palm tree 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.410
 that some are straight and other areas and 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.410
 directly 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.730
 as slanted as the palm trees of 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:44.680
 caribe a foto das por elemental bueno 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.490
 that already depends on the style of each one and 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.440
 how he likes to make each palm tree 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.740
 and well you have the map below for 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:56.539
 everyone who wants 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:07:00.110
 and have it on your computer or start here 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:02.770
 a survival or anything good 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.770
 I hope you liked it 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.250
