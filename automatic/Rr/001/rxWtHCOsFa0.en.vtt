00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.779 
marking the box I'll show you guys in a
second<00:00:49.829> soon<00:00:50.010> as<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.160> get<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.399> lip<00:00:50.640> open

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
second soon as I get this lip open

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.790 
second soon as I get this lip open
because<00:00:51.120> these<00:00:51.320> adhesive<00:00:52.320> lips<00:00:52.559> are

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
because these adhesive lips are

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.790 
because these adhesive lips are
extremely<00:00:53.899> sticky<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.320> they're<00:00:55.530> hard<00:00:55.739> to

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
extremely sticky and they're hard to

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.770 
extremely sticky and they're hard to
open<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.699> takes<00:00:56.969> up<00:00:57.120> most<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.510> video

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
open that takes up most of the video

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.700 
open that takes up most of the video
time<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.050> guess<00:00:59.899> that<00:01:00.899> probably<00:01:01.109> shouldn't<00:01:01.620> do

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
time I guess that probably shouldn't do

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:10.370
