album's<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.570> bit<00:02:14.750> uneven<00:02:15.050> though<00:02:15.290> because<00:02:15.470> it

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
album's a bit uneven though because it

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.230 
album's a bit uneven though because it
kind<00:02:15.920> of<00:02:15.980> goes<00:02:16.130> all<00:02:16.430> over<00:02:16.460> the<00:02:16.820> place<00:02:16.880> with

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
kind of goes all over the place with

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.700 
kind of goes all over the place with
what<00:02:17.420> it<00:02:17.510> wants<00:02:17.720> to<00:02:17.810> talk<00:02:18.020> about<00:02:18.170> maybe<00:02:18.530> the

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
what it wants to talk about maybe the

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.560 
what it wants to talk about maybe the
point<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.310> wants<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.670> drive<00:02:19.880> home<00:02:20.210> some

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
point that it wants to drive home some

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.940 
point that it wants to drive home some
of<00:02:20.600> these<00:02:20.750> tracks<00:02:21.020> are<00:02:21.170> surprisingly

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
of these tracks are surprisingly

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.100 
of these tracks are surprisingly
political<00:02:22.580> including<00:02:23.240> the<00:02:23.360> title<00:02:23.690> track<00:02:23.960> and

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
political including the title track and

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.140 
political including the title track and
black<00:02:24.380> cat<00:02:24.710> and<00:02:24.980> I<00:02:25.070> like<00:02:25.310> it<00:02:25.490> because<00:02:25.640> it<00:02:25.940> sees

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
black cat and I like it because it sees

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.790 
black cat and I like it because it sees

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
character's point of view it seems like

character's point of view it seems like
and<00:02:29.720> I<00:02:29.780> don't<00:02:29.960> think<00:02:30.170> I've<00:02:30.290> ever<00:02:30.320> seen<00:02:30.680> him<00:02:30.860> do

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
and I don't think I've ever seen him do

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.800 
and I don't think I've ever seen him do
that<00:02:31.220> before<00:02:31.430> I<00:02:32.150> guess<00:02:32.330> it's<00:02:32.480> not<00:02:32.630> that

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
that before I guess it's not that

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.940 
that before I guess it's not that
surprising<00:02:33.020> that<00:02:33.350> it's<00:02:33.560> a<00:02:33.620> little<00:02:33.830> bit

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
surprising that it's a little bit

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.650 
surprising that it's a little bit
political<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.610> more<00:02:34.730> introspective<00:02:35.090> because

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
political and more introspective because

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.480 
political and more introspective because
we<00:02:35.780> get<00:02:35.870> tracks<00:02:36.230> like<00:02:36.410> piece<00:02:36.800> song<00:02:37.130> which

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
we get tracks like piece song which

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.190 
we get tracks like piece song which

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
the pianos that roll in there just

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.170 
the pianos that roll in there just
seemed<00:03:19.100> like<00:03:19.130> something<00:03:19.460> maybe<00:03:19.730> out<00:03:19.940> of<00:03:20.090> an

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
seemed like something maybe out of an

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.880 
seemed like something maybe out of an
old<00:03:20.330> film<00:03:20.720> or<00:03:20.990> something<00:03:21.260> like<00:03:21.350> that<00:03:21.410> it<00:03:21.740> just

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
old film or something like that it just

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.500 
old film or something like that it just
seems<00:03:22.100> like<00:03:22.160> they<00:03:22.340> drew<00:03:22.580> inspiration<00:03:22.880> from<00:03:23.390> a

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
seems like they drew inspiration from a

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.330 
seems like they drew inspiration from a
lot<00:03:23.750> of<00:03:23.960> different<00:03:24.410> places<00:03:24.680> and<00:03:25.010> this<00:03:25.100> track

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
lot of different places and this track

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.070 
lot of different places and this track
runs<00:03:25.670> a<00:03:25.880> little<00:03:26.120> bit<00:03:26.300> longer<00:03:26.570> than<00:03:26.810> some<00:03:26.870> of

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
runs a little bit longer than some of

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.720 
runs a little bit longer than some of
the<00:03:27.140> other<00:03:27.290> tracks<00:03:27.590> on<00:03:27.860> this<00:03:28.070> record<00:03:28.520> maybe

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
the other tracks on this record maybe

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.490 
the other tracks on this record maybe
feels<00:03:29.000> a<00:03:29.150> little<00:03:29.390> bit<00:03:29.510> out<00:03:29.660> of<00:03:29.690> place<00:03:29.930> in<00:03:30.290> that

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
feels a little bit out of place in that

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.890 
feels a little bit out of place in that
sense<00:03:30.860> but<00:03:31.370> it<00:03:31.490> is<00:03:31.640> easily<00:03:32.030> one<00:03:32.390> of<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.600> best

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
sense but it is easily one of the best

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.710 
sense but it is easily one of the best

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
that debut album from Broken Bells I'm

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.270 
that debut album from Broken Bells I'm
not<00:04:11.840> sure<00:04:12.050> of<00:04:12.170> exactly<00:04:12.590> which<00:04:12.770> song<00:04:13.010> but

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
not sure of exactly which song but

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.500 
not sure of exactly which song but
getting<00:04:13.430> that<00:04:13.580> comparison<00:04:13.970> out<00:04:14.209> of<00:04:14.330> the<00:04:14.390> way

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
getting that comparison out of the way

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.720 
getting that comparison out of the way
this<00:04:14.720> track<00:04:14.990> is<00:04:15.200> a<00:04:15.320> lot<00:04:15.560> of<00:04:15.709> fun<00:04:16.010> once<00:04:16.250> again<00:04:16.549> a

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
this track is a lot of fun once again a

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.430 
this track is a lot of fun once again a
nice<00:04:16.970> instrumental<00:04:17.630> on<00:04:17.750> here<00:04:17.989> I<00:04:18.020> think<00:04:18.320> that

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
nice instrumental on here I think that

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.140 
nice instrumental on here I think that
drew<00:04:18.680> knew<00:04:19.190> whenever<00:04:19.520> to<00:04:19.640> be<00:04:19.760> a<00:04:19.790> little<00:04:20.060> bit

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
drew knew whenever to be a little bit

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.610 
drew knew whenever to be a little bit
more<00:04:20.299> assertive<00:04:20.600> with<00:04:20.810> his<00:04:21.020> voice<00:04:21.140> and<00:04:21.470> to<00:04:21.530> be

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
more assertive with his voice and to be

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.320 
more assertive with his voice and to be
more<00:04:21.890> restrained<00:04:22.400> so<00:04:22.669> it<00:04:22.790> strikes<00:04:23.030> a<00:04:23.180> nice

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
more restrained so it strikes a nice

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.390 
more restrained so it strikes a nice
balance<00:04:23.390> even<00:04:24.050> though<00:04:24.290> this<00:04:24.410> track<00:04:24.680> does

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
balance even though this track does
