00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:12.660
 I searched a lot on the Internet 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.020
 chocolate recipes 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.300
 fountains but in general there are few of them 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.199
 indicated but plainly 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.539
 ok what was not in general i decided 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.279
 experiment yourself for nonsense 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.910
 such phenomena have a chocolate fountain 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:32.099
 I took one small chocolate so 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:35.850
 without nuts, ordinary milk chocolate and 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.489
 two crowns for those without nuts 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.690
 it's just nuts alone left in 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:46.100
 general crown she is such a chocolate 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.800
 until melts just melting a milk she 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.920
 very so tightly in general 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.620
 can 3 crayons from users to your 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.980
 the choice is generally obtained such 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.730
 chocolate fountain he masses small 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:06.420
 general for its preparation will need 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:10.320
 3 chocolates a little tablespoon 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.619
 Ali unusual refined odorless 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.619
 to 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.500
 and if the chocolate fountain is for kids 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:23.300
 can add 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:26.880
 In general, Aliya chocolate itself very much 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.100
 machine that's a fountain and engine 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.130
 hard tina because he is your son already you 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.950
 and for this part type add olivia 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.340
 there a little bit and for strong chocolate 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.890
 the fountain will be for little kids then 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.070
 can this little tablespoon be 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.970
 usually add to make it easier to twist 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:53.690
 he engines then if to adults 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.690
 can add a little brandy or 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.930
 chocolate that is liquor such 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.930
 but I like it more expensively 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:09.720
 or here is such a liquor machine yes we 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.990
 here already 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.840
 chocolate fountain was presented from Italy and 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:20.190
 liqueur is also a hookah back with us in our 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.709
 Soviet unions more countries are full 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.900
 usually liquor is generally very 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.770
 delicious water and alley no any 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:34.360
 no effect on taste 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:36.190
 fountains up to adult alcohol 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.620
 can be added for kids a little 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.760
 dilute with water we do not overdo it better 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.890
 little by little more when chocolate is heated neither 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.030
 do not use 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.209
 microwave because you can spoil 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.000
 chocolate, it turns out the top 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:55.300
 chocolate and burn out inside 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.800
 like gorilla sugar for melting times 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.160
 chocolate is best to use 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:04.380
 normal water bath and gradually go there 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.090
 add a little alley and a little 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.120
 fluid of some kind because whispering was 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.850
 lighter cars that and twist it because 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.930
 that chocolate is very hard thick and and 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.930
 it's very hard for him to lift up 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.930
 such 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.330
 very tasty very interesting for children 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.330
 especially very interesting
