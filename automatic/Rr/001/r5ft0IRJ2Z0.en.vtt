00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
helmet and just tell you why I chose it

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.310 
helmet and just tell you why I chose it
really<00:00:20.840> so<00:00:21.840> here's<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.320> left<00:00:23.220> side<00:00:23.460> view<00:00:23.760> and

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
really so here's the left side view and

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.769 
really so here's the left side view and
in<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.470> rear<00:00:25.650> view<00:00:26.300> actually<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.420> rear<00:00:27.599> view

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
in the rear view actually the rear view

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.019 
in the rear view actually the rear view
is<00:00:27.930> actually<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.410> least<00:00:29.010> impressive<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.880> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
is actually the least impressive of the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.530 
is actually the least impressive of the
views<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.300> me<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:31.619> don't<00:00:32.489> really<00:00:32.700> like<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.420> way

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
views to me I don't really like the way

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.770 
views to me I don't really like the way
this<00:00:33.690> looks<00:00:33.750> but<00:00:34.170> um<00:00:34.760> the<00:00:35.760> reason<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.270> got<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.630> is

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
this looks but um the reason I got it is

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.049 
this looks but um the reason I got it is
because<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.440> was<00:00:37.739> one<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.640> lightest

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
because it was one of the lightest

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.700 
because it was one of the lightest
helmets<00:00:39.450> out<00:00:39.600> there

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
helmets out there

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.069 
helmets out there
I<00:00:40.739> believe<00:00:41.190> when<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.340> got<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.899> for<00:00:42.899> size

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
I believe when I got this for size

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.360 
I believe when I got this for size
medium<00:00:43.590> waiting<00:00:44.280> around<00:00:44.960> 175<00:00:45.960> grams<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:47.280> I've

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
medium waiting around 175 grams so I've

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.389 
medium waiting around 175 grams so I've
had<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.730> for<00:00:48.030> at<00:00:48.809> least<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.739> year<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.219> half

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
had this for at least a year and a half

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.189 
had this for at least a year and a half
now<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:51.090> think<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:52.730> wait<00:00:53.730> for<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.149> today

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
now I think and wait for you today

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.279 
now I think and wait for you today
I<00:00:55.260> think<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:55.980> wanying<00:00:56.670> at<00:00:56.850> 200<00:00:57.300> grams<00:00:57.570> so

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
I think it's wanying at 200 grams so

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.040 
I think it's wanying at 200 grams so
glasses<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.129> fit<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.550> some<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.300> these<00:01:00.359> vents<00:01:00.660> I

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
glasses do fit in some of these vents I

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.630 
glasses do fit in some of these vents I
don't<00:01:01.500> really<00:01:01.649> look<00:01:01.859> up<00:01:02.039> while<00:01:02.340> I'm<00:01:02.430> riding

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
don't really look up while I'm riding

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.850 
don't really look up while I'm riding
but<00:01:02.969> they<00:01:03.390> feeding<00:01:03.629> upside<00:01:04.110> down<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.680> they're

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
but they feeding upside down and they're

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.660 
but they feeding upside down and they're
pretty<00:01:05.010> secure<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:06.150> that's<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.450> nice<00:01:06.600> feature

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
pretty secure so that's a nice feature

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.380 
pretty secure so that's a nice feature
and<00:01:08.670> then<00:01:09.560> this<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.770> very<00:01:11.040> simple<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> justa

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
and then this is very simple a justa

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.080 
and then this is very simple a justa
below<00:01:12.570> or<00:01:13.200> self<00:01:13.799> adjusting<00:01:14.310> strap<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.820> just

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
below or self adjusting strap is just

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.530 
below or self adjusting strap is just
elastic<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:17.070> either<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:17.939> how<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.299> fit

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
elastic and so either this how it fit

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.090 
elastic and so either this how it fit
you<00:01:18.720> or<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.170> doesn't<00:01:21.470> so<00:01:22.470> I'll<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:22.830> go<00:01:22.979> ahead

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
you or it doesn't so I'll just go ahead

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.850 
you or it doesn't so I'll just go ahead
and<00:01:23.220> wait<00:01:23.369> for<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.790> guys<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.810> then<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.560> guys

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
and wait for you guys and then you guys

and wait for you guys and then you guys
can<00:01:26.040> make<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.220> decision<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:26.850> whether<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.330> would

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
can make a decision on whether you would

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.840 
can make a decision on whether you would
get<00:01:27.750> one<00:01:27.900> or<00:01:28.049> not<00:01:28.200> either<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:31.549> got<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.610> couple

get one or not either I got a couple

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.420 
get one or not either I got a couple
zeros<00:01:33.150> there<00:01:33.590> it's<00:01:34.590> alright<00:01:34.860> real<00:01:35.130> hard<00:01:35.340> to

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
zeros there it's alright real hard to

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.330 
zeros there it's alright real hard to
see<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:36.299> then<00:01:37.280> that<00:01:38.280> helmet<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.790> top<00:01:40.340> you're

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
see and then that helmet on top you're

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.359 
see and then that helmet on top you're

looking at one ninety-nine point nine

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.560 
looking at one ninety-nine point nine
grams<00:01:45.710> so<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.490> fully<00:01:47.759> supported<00:01:48.270> on<00:01:48.360> there

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
grams so it is fully supported on there

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.810 
grams so it is fully supported on there
and<00:01:50.240> as<00:01:51.240> far<00:01:51.479> as<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.720> know<00:01:52.340> just<00:01:53.340> kind<00:01:53.790> of
