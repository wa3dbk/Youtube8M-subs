not<00:02:16.960> because<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.350> get<00:02:17.500> this<00:02:17.680> hideous<00:02:18.130> looking

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
not because you get this hideous looking

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.840 
not because you get this hideous looking
seam<00:02:19.510> between<00:02:20.140> here<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:20.860> it's<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.490> can<00:02:21.670> see

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
seam between here and it's you can see

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.780 
seam between here and it's you can see
that's<00:02:22.000> not<00:02:22.150> even<00:02:22.270> lined<00:02:22.630> up<00:02:22.840> properly<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.790> to

that's not even lined up properly and to

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.250 
that's not even lined up properly and to
me<00:02:24.910> it<00:02:25.030> just<00:02:25.060> spoils<00:02:25.570> the<00:02:25.690> overall<00:02:26.020> look<00:02:26.170> of

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
me it just spoils the overall look of

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.960 
me it just spoils the overall look of
the<00:02:26.380> model<00:02:26.500> because<00:02:26.860> you<00:02:26.980> know<00:02:27.700> we<00:02:27.850> all

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
the model because you know we all

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.720 
the model because you know we all
display<00:02:28.360> them<00:02:28.680> sideways<00:02:29.680> such<00:02:30.100> as<00:02:30.220> this<00:02:30.430> and

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
display them sideways such as this and

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.730 
display them sideways such as this and
you<00:02:31.060> just<00:02:31.240> get<00:02:31.390> this<00:02:31.570> awful<00:02:31.870> looking<00:02:32.440> scene

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
you just get this awful looking scene

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.710 
you just get this awful looking scene
here<00:02:33.070> whereas<00:02:33.730> with<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.000> Phoenix<00:02:34.420> where<00:02:34.600> the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
here whereas with the Phoenix where the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.010 
here whereas with the Phoenix where the
wings<00:02:34.930> are<00:02:35.320> joined<00:02:35.950> together<00:02:36.430> as<00:02:36.910> one<00:02:37.720> piece

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
wings are joined together as one piece

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.930 
wings are joined together as one piece
into<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.560> body<00:02:38.740> you<00:02:39.010> get<00:02:39.160> a<00:02:39.190> much<00:02:39.460> better

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
into the body you get a much better

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.870 
into the body you get a much better
looking<00:02:40.450> wing<00:02:41.410> joint<00:02:41.710> section<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:42.370> in<00:02:42.610> fact

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
looking wing joint section and in fact

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.810 
looking wing joint section and in fact
and<00:02:43.270> a<00:02:43.870> lot<00:02:44.020> of<00:02:44.050> people<00:02:44.440> derived<00:02:44.800> JC<00:02:45.190> wings<00:02:45.610> as

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
and a lot of people derived JC wings as

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.150 
and a lot of people derived JC wings as
being<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.210> lowest<00:02:46.930> quality<00:02:47.170> of<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.920> bunch

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
being the lowest quality of the bunch

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.580 
being the lowest quality of the bunch
and<00:02:48.430> generally<00:02:48.880> they<00:02:49.060> are<00:02:49.270> but<00:02:50.200> even<00:02:50.230> still

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
and generally they are but even still

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.760 
and generally they are but even still
the<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.910> JC<00:02:52.180> wings<00:02:52.630> is<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:52.810> triple<00:02:53.290> seven<00:02:53.590> mold

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
the the JC wings is a triple seven mold

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.280 
the the JC wings is a triple seven mold
in<00:02:53.890> my<00:02:53.920> opinion<00:02:54.400> is<00:02:55.360> still<00:02:55.780> better<00:02:56.020> than<00:02:56.230> the

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
in my opinion is still better than the

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.990 
in my opinion is still better than the
Gemini<00:02:56.740> jets<00:02:57.040> one<00:02:57.250> because<00:02:57.610> at<00:02:57.700> least<00:02:57.820> they

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
Gemini jets one because at least they

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.460 
Gemini jets one because at least they
got<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.270> proper<00:02:58.570> wing<00:02:58.750> section<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.320> while

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
got the proper wing section and while

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.180 
got the proper wing section and while
the<00:02:59.620> nose<00:02:59.830> shape<00:03:00.160> isn't<00:03:00.690> necessarily

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
the nose shape isn't necessarily

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.680 
the nose shape isn't necessarily
accurate<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.430> as<00:03:03.670> accurate<00:03:04.360> as<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.540> other

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
accurate to as accurate as the other

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.420 
accurate to as accurate as the other
ones<00:03:04.930> it's<00:03:05.170> still<00:03:05.470> really<00:03:05.680> good<00:03:05.830> and<00:03:06.220> it's

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
ones it's still really good and it's

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.220 
ones it's still really good and it's
because<00:03:07.030> of<00:03:07.120> that<00:03:07.209> wing<00:03:07.450> section<00:03:07.900> it<00:03:08.020> still

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
because of that wing section it still

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.550 
because of that wing section it still
looks<00:03:08.440> better<00:03:08.590> overall<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:10.780> does<00:03:11.080> have<00:03:11.380> the

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
looks better overall it does have the

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.380 
looks better overall it does have the
fatter<00:03:11.800> wings<00:03:12.100> which<00:03:12.400> again<00:03:12.670> doesn't<00:03:13.120> look

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
fatter wings which again doesn't look

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.090 
fatter wings which again doesn't look
very<00:03:13.420> good<00:03:13.660> but<00:03:13.989> even<00:03:14.320> still<00:03:14.560> it's<00:03:14.769> actually

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
very good but even still it's actually

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.100 
very good but even still it's actually
got<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.370> most<00:03:15.519> printing<00:03:16.060> detail<00:03:16.540> out<00:03:16.840> of<00:03:16.959> all

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
got the most printing detail out of all

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.570 
got the most printing detail out of all

the triple sevens see here it's got the

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.820 
the triple sevens see here it's got the

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.340 
they don't have them on the Phoenix one
another<00:03:36.970> sore<00:03:37.269> point<00:03:37.540> with<00:03:37.630> this<00:03:37.840> mold<00:03:38.019> is<00:03:38.200> the

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
another sore point with this mold is the

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.250 
another sore point with this mold is the
really<00:03:38.769> thick<00:03:39.190> wing<00:03:39.550> sections<00:03:40.150> because<00:03:40.390> it

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
really thick wing sections because it

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.229 
really thick wing sections because it
makes<00:03:41.530> it<00:03:41.800> look<00:03:42.010> pretty<00:03:42.040> unrealistic<00:03:42.790> in<00:03:43.120> my

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
makes it look pretty unrealistic in my

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.060 
makes it look pretty unrealistic in my
opinion<00:03:43.630> so<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:43.900> Phoenix<00:03:44.290> have<00:03:44.530> this<00:03:44.739> lovely

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
opinion so the Phoenix have this lovely

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.580 
opinion so the Phoenix have this lovely
nice<00:03:47.370> thin<00:03:48.370> section<00:03:48.940> if<00:03:49.750> we<00:03:49.959> go<00:03:50.140> back<00:03:50.350> down

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
nice thin section if we go back down

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.890 
nice thin section if we go back down
here<00:03:51.010> see<00:03:51.790> how<00:03:51.970> they<00:03:52.090> taper<00:03:52.360> off<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:52.690> a<00:03:52.720> much

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
here see how they taper off to a much

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.330 
here see how they taper off to a much
thinner<00:03:53.200> point<00:03:53.500> it's<00:03:53.650> a<00:03:53.709> bit<00:03:53.860> difficult<00:03:54.310> to

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
thinner point it's a bit difficult to

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.320 
thinner point it's a bit difficult to
see<00:03:54.430> on<00:03:54.850> camera<00:03:56.550> but<00:03:57.550> if<00:03:57.700> you<00:03:57.820> notice<00:03:58.150> the

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
see on camera but if you notice the

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.440 
see on camera but if you notice the
Phoenix<00:03:58.750> one<00:03:58.900> is<00:03:59.019> a<00:03:59.050> lot<00:03:59.230> thinner<00:03:59.470> whereas<00:03:59.830> the

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
Phoenix one is a lot thinner whereas the

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.479 
Phoenix one is a lot thinner whereas the
Gemini<00:04:01.450> Jets<00:04:01.690> is<00:04:01.840> quite<00:04:02.140> thick<00:04:02.470> which<00:04:02.980> to<00:04:03.370> me

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
Gemini Jets is quite thick which to me

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.500 
Gemini Jets is quite thick which to me
isn't<00:04:03.970> very<00:04:04.180> accurate<00:04:05.760> another<00:04:06.760> major<00:04:07.209> point

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
isn't very accurate another major point

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.390 
isn't very accurate another major point
is<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:08.110> landing<00:04:08.470> gear<00:04:08.709> now<00:04:08.890> this<00:04:09.040> is<00:04:09.220> where<00:04:09.370> I

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
is the landing gear now this is where I

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.979 
is the landing gear now this is where I
think<00:04:09.489> is<00:04:09.790> they<00:04:10.030> definitely<00:04:10.570> need<00:04:10.750> to<00:04:10.870> improve

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
think is they definitely need to improve

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.960 
think is they definitely need to improve
for<00:04:13.989> example<00:04:14.500> not<00:04:14.860> while<00:04:15.280> it<00:04:15.489> doesn't<00:04:15.670> feature

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
for example not while it doesn't feature

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.180 
for example not while it doesn't feature
rolling<00:04:16.510> landing<00:04:16.930> gear<00:04:17.380> which<00:04:17.590> to<00:04:17.890> be<00:04:17.979> honest

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
rolling landing gear which to be honest

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.870 
rolling landing gear which to be honest
I'm<00:04:18.340> not<00:04:18.370> really

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
I'm not really

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.550 
I'm not really
fast<00:04:19.060> on<00:04:19.209> its<00:04:19.450> this<00:04:19.600> reruns<00:04:20.050> well<00:04:20.230> so<00:04:20.380> just

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
fast on its this reruns well so just

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.170 
fast on its this reruns well so just
supply<00:04:20.800> pieces<00:04:21.220> of<00:04:21.340> plastic<00:04:21.730> that<00:04:21.790> have<00:04:22.000> been

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
supply pieces of plastic that have been

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.240 
supply pieces of plastic that have been
stuck<00:04:22.450> in<00:04:22.660> there<00:04:22.900> sorry<00:04:23.740> about<00:04:23.800> the<00:04:24.040> focus

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
stuck in there sorry about the focus

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.070 
stuck in there sorry about the focus
it's<00:04:24.610> very<00:04:24.790> difficult<00:04:25.180> to<00:04:25.300> get<00:04:25.390> these<00:04:25.540> detail

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
it's very difficult to get these detail

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.640 
it's very difficult to get these detail
shots<00:04:26.670> but<00:04:27.670> to<00:04:28.420> be<00:04:28.540> honest<00:04:28.810> I<00:04:29.020> just<00:04:29.050> don't<00:04:29.440> like

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
shots but to be honest I just don't like

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.640 
shots but to be honest I just don't like
it<00:04:29.680> it<00:04:29.980> makes<00:04:30.220> it<00:04:30.760> look<00:04:30.940> very<00:04:30.970> unrealistic<00:04:31.870> and

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
it it makes it look very unrealistic and

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.170 
it it makes it look very unrealistic and
I<00:04:32.740> know<00:04:32.860> a<00:04:32.890> lot<00:04:33.040> of<00:04:33.190> people<00:04:33.490> will<00:04:33.610> say<00:04:33.850> that

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
I know a lot of people will say that

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.750 
I know a lot of people will say that
while<00:04:34.810> Gemini<00:04:35.500> Jets<00:04:35.740> quality<00:04:36.190> is<00:04:36.280> better<00:04:36.490> and

while Gemini Jets quality is better and

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.030 
while Gemini Jets quality is better and
Phoenix<00:04:37.150> does<00:04:37.390> have<00:04:37.690> a<00:04:37.720> lot<00:04:37.900> of<00:04:37.930> QC<00:04:38.230> quality

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
one thing on it so overall I'd have to

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.920 
one thing on it so overall I'd have to

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
triple sevens always buy Phoenix because

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.030 
triple sevens always buy Phoenix because
Phoenix<00:05:01.780> in<00:05:02.020> my<00:05:02.170> opinion<00:05:02.530> have<00:05:02.710> a<00:05:02.740> far

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
Phoenix in my opinion have a far

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.440 
Phoenix in my opinion have a far
superior<00:05:03.280> mold<00:05:04.650> than<00:05:05.650> the<00:05:05.890> Gemini<00:05:06.400> Jets<00:05:06.640> now<00:05:07.420> I

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
superior mold than the Gemini Jets now I

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.420 
superior mold than the Gemini Jets now I
can<00:05:07.720> understand<00:05:08.200> why<00:05:08.470> they<00:05:08.950> were<00:05:09.010> probably

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
can understand why they were probably

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.430 
can understand why they were probably
reluctant<00:05:10.120> to<00:05:10.180> update<00:05:10.540> their<00:05:10.750> mold<00:05:10.990> and<00:05:11.230> it's

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
reluctant to update their mold and it's

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.190 
reluctant to update their mold and it's
the<00:05:11.560> fact<00:05:11.800> that<00:05:11.950> these<00:05:12.640> diecast<00:05:13.360> molds<00:05:14.020> that

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
the fact that these diecast molds that

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.830 
the fact that these diecast molds that
they<00:05:14.860> used<00:05:15.040> to<00:05:15.130> produce<00:05:15.250> them<00:05:15.840> obscenely

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
they used to produce them obscenely

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.010 
they used to produce them obscenely
expensive<00:05:17.670> any<00:05:18.670> type<00:05:18.940> of<00:05:18.970> die<00:05:19.300> casting<00:05:19.870> with

and such the molds are going to be
ridiculously<00:05:25.840> expensive<00:05:26.170> you<00:05:26.800> know<00:05:26.920> a<00:05:27.220> lot<00:05:27.520> of

I've<00:05:32.320> know<00:05:32.620> for<00:05:32.890> some<00:05:33.100> Lego<00:05:33.400> parts<00:05:34.050> can<00:05:35.050> cost

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
I've know for some Lego parts can cost

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.780 
I've know for some Lego parts can cost
up<00:05:35.800> to<00:05:36.660> 250,000<00:05:37.660> euros<00:05:37.810> per<00:05:38.410> mold<00:05:38.800> which<00:05:39.760> is

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
up to 250,000 euros per mold which is

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.460 
up to 250,000 euros per mold which is
why<00:05:40.120> they're<00:05:40.360> probably<00:05:40.540> very<00:05:40.840> reluctant<00:05:41.380> to

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
why they're probably very reluctant to

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.860 
why they're probably very reluctant to
update<00:05:42.310> it<00:05:42.490> because<00:05:42.610> they<00:05:42.970> can<00:05:43.240> be<00:05:43.390> extremely

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
update it because they can be extremely

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.290 
update it because they can be extremely
expensive<00:05:44.400> but<00:05:45.400> in<00:05:45.550> the<00:05:45.670> end<00:05:45.820> you<00:05:45.970> know<00:05:46.120> with

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
expensive but in the end you know with

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.580 
expensive but in the end you know with
the<00:05:46.390> amount<00:05:46.630> that<00:05:46.720> and<00:05:46.960> volume<00:05:47.290> that<00:05:47.320> they'd

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
the amount that and volume that they'd

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.350 
the amount that and volume that they'd
sell<00:05:47.950> I'd<00:05:48.250> say<00:05:48.490> it's<00:05:48.640> probably<00:05:48.790> money<00:05:49.120> well

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
sell I'd say it's probably money well

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.390 
sell I'd say it's probably money well
spent<00:05:49.390> because<00:05:49.870> it<00:05:50.170> would<00:05:50.290> lend<00:05:50.650> them<00:05:50.860> to<00:05:50.890> have

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
spent because it would lend them to have

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.070 
spent because it would lend them to have
a<00:05:51.430> much<00:05:51.730> more<00:05:52.000> accurate<00:05:52.710> triple7<00:05:53.710> mold<00:05:54.030> now

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
a much more accurate triple7 mold now

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.540 
a much more accurate triple7 mold now
again<00:05:56.080> this<00:05:56.290> doesn't<00:05:56.680> always<00:05:56.830> hold<00:05:57.160> true<00:05:57.430> with

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
again this doesn't always hold true with

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.820 
again this doesn't always hold true with
the<00:05:57.670> rest<00:05:57.850> of<00:05:58.000> them<00:05:58.210> like<00:05:58.390> I<00:05:58.720> said<00:05:59.200> the<00:05:59.470> Gemini

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
the rest of them like I said the Gemini

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.860 
the rest of them like I said the Gemini
Jets<00:06:00.070> has<00:06:00.250> a<00:06:00.280> much<00:06:00.550> better<00:06:00.990> 747<00:06:01.990> mold<00:06:02.500> than

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
Jets has a much better 747 mold than

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.110 
Jets has a much better 747 mold than
Phoenix<00:06:04.870> will<00:06:05.080> the<00:06:05.170> 747<00:06:05.860> 400<00:06:06.130> series<00:06:06.670> anyway

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
Phoenix will the 747 400 series anyway

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.510 
Phoenix will the 747 400 series anyway
because<00:06:07.900> the<00:06:08.230> Phoenix<00:06:08.830> one<00:06:08.980> has<00:06:09.190> a<00:06:09.220> bit<00:06:09.490> more

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
because the Phoenix one has a bit more

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.370 
because the Phoenix one has a bit more
of<00:06:09.730> a<00:06:09.880> rounded<00:06:10.240> nose<00:06:10.450> rather<00:06:10.840> than<00:06:11.110> the<00:06:11.170> flat

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
of a rounded nose rather than the flat

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.110 
of a rounded nose rather than the flat
one<00:06:11.620> that<00:06:11.980> the<00:06:12.370> real<00:06:12.550> model<00:06:12.820> has<00:06:13.270> and<00:06:15.120> Phoenix

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
one that the real model has and Phoenix

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.380 
one that the real model has and Phoenix
also<00:06:16.450> has<00:06:16.840> in<00:06:17.200> my<00:06:17.320> opinion<00:06:17.350> a<00:06:17.770> far<00:06:18.010> superior

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.390 
also has in my opinion a far superior

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:22.170 
also has in my opinion a far superior
a330<00:06:19.390> and<00:06:19.570> a340<00:06:20.170> mold<00:06:20.580> and<00:06:21.580> I'm<00:06:21.700> unsure<00:06:21.880> about

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
a330 and a340 mold and I'm unsure about

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.180 
a330 and a340 mold and I'm unsure about
the<00:06:22.420> 76

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
the 76

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.010 
the 76
and<00:06:23.670> seven<00:06:24.030> five<00:06:24.210> seven<00:06:24.450> s<00:06:24.660> because<00:06:24.900> I've

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
and seven five seven s because I've

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.560 
and seven five seven s because I've
never<00:06:25.260> gotten<00:06:25.470> to<00:06:25.740> compare<00:06:26.160> and<00:06:26.400> I<00:06:26.820> think<00:06:27.150> that

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 
never gotten to compare and I think that

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.750 
never gotten to compare and I think that
they<00:06:27.720> pretty<00:06:28.050> much<00:06:28.290> use<00:06:28.620> almost<00:06:29.130> identical

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:29.760 
they pretty much use almost identical

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.760 
they pretty much use almost identical
737<00:06:30.570> miles<00:06:30.780> so<00:06:30.930> that's<00:06:31.080> not<00:06:31.230> a<00:06:31.260> thing

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
737 miles so that's not a thing

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.310 
737 miles so that's not a thing

comments I'm not against to Gemini Jets
but<00:06:43.200> I<00:06:43.320> just<00:06:43.530> can't<00:06:43.800> justify<00:06:43.860> what<00:06:44.580> the<00:06:44.670> prices

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 
but I just can't justify what the prices

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.730 
but I just can't justify what the prices
they<00:06:45.270> charge<00:06:45.300> for<00:06:45.840> their<00:06:45.960> one<00:06:46.110> four<00:06:46.380> hundred

they charge for their one four hundred
triple<00:06:47.130> seven<00:06:47.430> models<00:06:47.610> to<00:06:48.390> get<00:06:48.510> them<00:06:48.720> anymore

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
triple seven models to get them anymore

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.890 
triple seven models to get them anymore
because<00:06:49.350> to<00:06:49.800> me<00:06:49.950> the<00:06:50.220> the<00:06:51.150> quality<00:06:51.420> of<00:06:51.720> them

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:51.900 
because to me the the quality of them

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.570 
because to me the the quality of them
with<00:06:52.080> compared<00:06:52.620> to<00:06:52.830> them<00:06:53.010> are<00:06:53.220> like<00:06:53.460> the

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 
with compared to them are like the

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.520 
with compared to them are like the
prices<00:06:54.000> it's<00:06:54.330> just<00:06:54.570> not<00:06:54.750> worth<00:06:54.960> it<00:06:55.260> it<00:06:55.380> might

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.530 
prices it's just not worth it it might

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.320 
prices it's just not worth it it might
be<00:06:55.650> if<00:06:55.770> they<00:06:55.890> were<00:06:55.950> cheaper<00:06:56.490> I<00:06:56.700> would

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.330 
be if they were cheaper I would

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:58.970 
be if they were cheaper I would
recommend<00:06:57.840> them<00:06:57.990> but<00:06:58.200> seeing<00:06:58.470> is<00:06:58.650> that<00:06:58.680> can

00:06:58.970 --> 00:06:58.980 
recommend them but seeing is that can

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.220 
recommend them but seeing is that can
sometimes<00:06:59.190> be<00:06:59.460> as<00:06:59.820> equally<00:07:00.390> expensive<00:07:00.630> as

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.230 
sometimes be as equally expensive as

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.950 
sometimes be as equally expensive as
Phoenix<00:07:01.650> ones<00:07:02.070> I<00:07:02.310> am<00:07:03.150> a<00:07:03.240> person<00:07:03.630> anymore<00:07:03.930> I

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 
just can't recommend it which is why I'm

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.220 
just can't recommend it which is why I'm
