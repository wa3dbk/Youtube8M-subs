that should stop any roots that want to
go<00:02:49.980> through<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.549> you'll<00:02:50.849> still<00:02:51.120> have<00:02:51.329> the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
go through and you'll still have the

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.449 
go through and you'll still have the
absorption<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.410> capillary<00:02:52.890> action<00:02:53.099> with<00:02:53.370> the

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
absorption the capillary action with the

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.509 
absorption the capillary action with the
water<00:02:53.900> but<00:02:54.900> there's<00:02:55.560> some<00:02:55.769> because<00:02:56.280> if<00:02:56.400> you're
