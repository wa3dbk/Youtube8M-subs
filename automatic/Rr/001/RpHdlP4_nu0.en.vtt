 that luigi well but beyond the 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.890
 presentations 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:06.409
 I will show you if up as a Czech sad 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.409
 because it is working in short to the method 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.020
 took to see how many diamonds 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.680
 the impossible to find really south 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.250
 onward also done other things like 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.939
 all the planets in short, useless stuff ed 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:28.759
 to show you but let's move on to 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.759
 see how brawl and stuff then 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.759
 first of all settled what 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.820
 you will need a sword will be a sword 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.899
 and a pickaxe is fine that any 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.970
 material as you like and of course 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.329
 the object from banking 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.640
 now I support establishing inventory 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.659
 in it would be better to have it empty 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.369
 in fact smog though if you have the same 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.460
 just the object you want to send 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.400
 he only has one 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.250
 this pay the diamond where the mind 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.860
 only the Bulgarian diamond the others li 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.340
 you will put in some stockings in the meantime 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.990
 arranged training type for example 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.390
 nothing I show you immediately as you 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.000
 I make a brief summary then put it 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.100
 the furnace here 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.360
 make yourself the ingredient you want ball 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.700
 races here 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.550
 and there are climbs above started a 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.890
 splitting when you see it is cracking 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:31.030
 change and use the sword so that it does not 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.320
 it breaks and immediately withdraws then yes 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.640
 opens the screen and you have to keep 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.370
 pressed a until it broke 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.250
 formatively I will show you now 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.500
 then we rise above it rises above it 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.880
 click above is the ingredient of already 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.410
 so let's start breaking it when 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.959
 we see that it is breaking we change with 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:57.100
 the sword breaks and recreates the lo 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:03:05.890
 we open and hold on to this 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:08.769
 so we can happen to you there 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.470
 break shots I think the furnace 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.239
 the piece always disappears sometimes 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.360
 disappears sometimes not 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.390
 so I continually try now 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:23.130
 I'll show you until I can 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.130
 then nothing 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:33.370
 remember to stand on it a lot 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.010
 diamond have it any object you can 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:40.269
 pay even if you manage to get into it 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.790
 a dog inside for the deportees and behold 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:46.980
 made gentlemen and now you get rid of 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.980
 diamonds you don't need 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.640
 yes I know it seems such a law though 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.609
 now if there was the same good 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.019
 by one though if you go in inventing there 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:59.019
 you have 64 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:03.010
 But if you do use them uncles and go 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:05.280
 like that we look forward we look like you 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.280
 I show 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:14.230
 if you go use these diamonds don't 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:18.190
 it counts there, that is, there is only one 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:22.270
 what you have to do you have to take them and with 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:26.800
 the aics you see you can put them like this with 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:31.150
 the aics you keep it pressed type li li 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:38.730
 puts everyone all together and kind sees 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:44.080
 fears the gmc 64 mm from other 64 then but 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:47.110
 this is the working method for per 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.120
 have the objects buggy ie the 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.500
 infinite objects this here 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.140
 if you want to keep passing over it 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.940
 of the whole continuously and not and not 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.040
 it will disappear so that you don't leave the game 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:01.570
 however even if you do so picked up of 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:03.750
