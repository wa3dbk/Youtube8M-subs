00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.180
 and right now you can have one of these 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:08.210
 cell phones in hand have been transformed 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.830
 in a need to the various models 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.589
 that exist in the market were added 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.540
 two new and longed for are the 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:16.490
 state- of-the-art smartphones and that 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.360
 can overcome to listen well to the 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.360
 700 thousand pesos 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:26.619
 it does not lose definition, it is not placed 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.669
 the grainy image does not stop admiring 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.439
 your new cellphone 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.480
 Javier is one of the first Chileans 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.930
 that you already have in your hands the new 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.390
 galaxy s 6 age of samsung the idea is that 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.420
 when one charges this phone like this 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.190
 that simple charge much faster than 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.860
 the others are supposed to promise 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.410
 charge in minutes is a fan of the 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.600
 technology changes phone at least 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.500
 three times a year does not skimp on expenses 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.410
 of that there is no doubt invested about 800 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.059
 thousand pesos on this phone if you 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.460
 questions for this price you can buy 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.199
 a galaxy s 5 or you can buy an xperia 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.670
 7 to 3 or the phone that you want more 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.030
 a smart watch plus a console 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.470
 videogame and I would take out more things I do not know if 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.570
 it's worth it I bought it because I 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.670
 I wanted samsung hopes to get to the 4 thousand 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.280
 equipment sold during the first month 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.170
 in the market but what differences it brings 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.580
 this cell phone at this moment we are 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.539
 working with materials that are very 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.090
 similar to a crystal 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:24.759
 that's why inspiration in luxury in the 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.170
 gem in the jewelry not only with the 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.789
 external material but also the 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.649
 aluminum edge then in that 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:31.330
 meaning the design is the main 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.670
 destructive regarding the model that 6 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.050
 for experts this is about a 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.910
 bigotry to the material 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.340
 and is that like Javier there are many 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.590
 Chileans who unknowingly invest 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.140
 large sums of money in new 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.960
 phones particularly the young 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.330
 dear the last phone on the altar 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.060
 of his night watchman at bedtime 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.740
 they leave it there they touch it after they sleep in 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.260
 the morning they wake up early and the place 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.770
 of the daily prayer plays again 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.770
 that technology and they feel fulfilled 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.810
 happy but it 's worth spending so much 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.340
 Currently, most of the 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.440
 equipment offer us a very good 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.869
 performance the design and that kind of 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.790
 things are taken much more for consideration 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.590
 of what happened previously and the 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.910
 functionality is important but not 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.459
 It's all at the time of choosing a 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.020
 smartphone we ask our expert 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.090
 that will show us phones that 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.760
 offer similar characteristics 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.670
 but for a much lower price what 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.800
 we have the one plus one a team that 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.739
 It has a 5.5-inch screen 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.230
 full hd resolution so basically 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.830
 it's a team almost as powerful as the 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.810
 samsung galaxy s 6 but at a price 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.220
 much more accessible costs close to 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.620
 three hundred sixty-nine thousand pesos 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.110
 this here we have the tsja om and the 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.620
 version three thousand a team of four 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.049
 cores a 3 m camera 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.930
 how can you see a full hd screen 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:59.439
 this equipment costs half of the fact that 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.030
 The Samsung Galaxy S 6 about 299 thousand 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:03.010
 weights here in smart but the 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.769
 recommendation is always quoting before 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.719
 to buy and see if the product that 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.019
 you want to acquire fits your 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.019
 needs
