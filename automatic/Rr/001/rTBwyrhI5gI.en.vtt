hey guys nurse right here and here we
have<00:00:13.120> an<00:00:13.210> unboxing<00:00:13.510> of<00:00:13.870> the<00:00:14.050> western<00:00:14.530> digital

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
have an unboxing of the western digital

have an unboxing of the western digital
red<00:00:15.250> 3<00:00:15.820> terabyte<00:00:16.180> hard<00:00:16.480> drive<00:00:16.720> well<00:00:17.500> it's<00:00:17.590> more

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
red 3 terabyte hard drive well it's more

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.960 
red 3 terabyte hard drive well it's more
when<00:00:17.860> I'm<00:00:17.950> bagging<00:00:18.369> because<00:00:18.550> it<00:00:18.610> only<00:00:18.760> comes

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
when I'm bagging because it only comes

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.140 
when I'm bagging because it only comes
in<00:00:19.150> ESD<00:00:19.600> bag<00:00:19.869> but<00:00:20.320> whatever<00:00:20.710> so<00:00:21.490> this<00:00:21.970> hard

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
in ESD bag but whatever so this hard

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.000 
in ESD bag but whatever so this hard
drive<00:00:22.240> wasn't<00:00:22.540> in<00:00:22.900> stores<00:00:23.350> when<00:00:23.770> it<00:00:23.860> was<00:00:23.950> on

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010 
drive wasn't in stores when it was on

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.550 
drive wasn't in stores when it was on
sales<00:00:24.340> identified<00:00:24.910> online<00:00:25.300> so<00:00:26.050> if<00:00:26.350> you<00:00:26.440> get

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
sales identified online so if you get

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.590 
sales identified online so if you get
the<00:00:26.710> ship<00:00:27.010> it<00:00:27.250> should<00:00:27.490> come<00:00:27.730> in<00:00:27.970> a<00:00:28.180> brown

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:28.600 
the ship it should come in a brown

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.580 
the ship it should come in a brown
fragile<00:00:29.289> box<00:00:29.580> if<00:00:30.580> it<00:00:30.760> doesn't<00:00:31.180> the<00:00:31.870> mailman

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
fragile box if it doesn't the mailman

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.530 
fragile box if it doesn't the mailman
might<00:00:32.800> throw<00:00:32.950> it<00:00:33.010> around<00:00:33.160> it<00:00:33.970> also<00:00:34.090> comes<00:00:34.420> in

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
might throw it around it also comes in

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.080 
might throw it around it also comes in
some<00:00:34.750> pink<00:00:35.050> bubble<00:00:35.470> wrap<00:00:35.650> and<00:00:35.890> some<00:00:36.610> bags<00:00:36.879> of

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
some pink bubble wrap and some bags of

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.890 
some pink bubble wrap and some bags of
air<00:00:37.270> yeah<00:00:37.930> everyone<00:00:38.620> loves<00:00:38.650> bags<00:00:39.129> there

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
air yeah everyone loves bags there

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.660 
air yeah everyone loves bags there
anyway<00:00:40.900> let's<00:00:41.110> put<00:00:41.590> this<00:00:41.739> stuff<00:00:41.980> away<00:00:42.129> I'm

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
anyway let's put this stuff away I'm

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.840 
anyway let's put this stuff away I'm
going<00:00:43.030> to<00:00:43.089> play<00:00:43.300> with<00:00:43.420> it<00:00:43.650> and<00:00:44.650> get<00:00:45.550> straight

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
going to play with it and get straight

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.270 
going to play with it and get straight
to<00:00:45.970> the<00:00:46.000> product<00:00:46.589> so<00:00:47.589> this<00:00:47.800> is<00:00:47.920> the<00:00:48.070> hard<00:00:48.220> drive

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
to the product so this is the hard drive

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.479 
to the product so this is the hard drive
itself<00:00:48.760> it's<00:00:49.629> a<00:00:49.809> red<00:00:50.199> series<00:00:50.710> but<00:00:51.190> what's<00:00:51.370> the

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
itself it's a red series but what's the

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.700 
itself it's a red series but what's the
difference<00:00:51.640> between<00:00:51.850> a<00:00:52.120> Red<00:00:52.390> Sea's<00:00:52.710> when

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
difference between a Red Sea's when

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.229 
difference between a Red Sea's when
western<00:00:54.129> digital<00:00:54.489> first<00:00:54.699> started<00:00:55.120> making

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
western digital first started making

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.210 
western digital first started making
hard<00:00:55.600> drives<00:00:55.900> that<00:00:56.140> were<00:00:56.440> just<00:00:56.589> called<00:00:56.830> caviar

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
hard drives that were just called caviar

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.700 
hard drives that were just called caviar
series<00:00:57.790> well<00:00:58.540> then<00:00:58.690> after<00:00:59.199> a<00:00:59.290> while<00:00:59.350> they

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
series well then after a while they

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.920 
series well then after a while they
start<00:00:59.949> adding<00:01:00.190> introducing<00:01:00.909> color<00:01:01.150> seems<00:01:01.720> to

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
start adding introducing color seems to

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.079 
start adding introducing color seems to
represent<00:01:02.049> the<00:01:02.500> performance<00:01:03.040> so<00:01:03.670> black<00:01:03.909> would

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
represent the performance so black would

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.740 
represent the performance so black would
be<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:04.390> almost<00:01:05.290> highest<00:01:05.710> performance<00:01:06.159> drives

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
be the almost highest performance drives

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.170 
be the almost highest performance drives
below<00:01:08.070> velociraptors<00:01:09.070> which<00:01:09.340> are<00:01:09.549> really

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
below velociraptors which are really

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.270 
below velociraptors which are really
fast<00:01:10.600> black<00:01:11.049> drive<00:01:11.440> because<00:01:11.799> I<00:01:11.860> spin<00:01:12.159> at

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
fast black drive because I spin at

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.819 
fast black drive because I spin at
10,000<00:01:12.850> RPM<00:01:13.110> though<00:01:14.110> the<00:01:14.320> actual<00:01:14.500> drive

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:14.829 
10,000 RPM though the actual drive

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:17.700 
10,000 RPM though the actual drive
itself<00:01:15.189> is<00:01:15.369> smaller<00:01:15.759> but<00:01:16.270> it<00:01:16.509> needs<00:01:17.469> a<00:01:17.560> heat

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
itself is smaller but it needs a heat

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.560 
itself is smaller but it needs a heat
sink<00:01:18.009> because<00:01:18.250> it<00:01:18.460> spins<00:01:18.700> that<00:01:18.850> fast<00:01:19.119> that's

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
sink because it spins that fast that's

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.660 
sink because it spins that fast that's
not<00:01:19.719> the<00:01:19.780> point<00:01:19.930> there's<00:01:20.680> scorpio<00:01:21.189> blue<00:01:21.399> which

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
not the point there's scorpio blue which

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.160 
not the point there's scorpio blue which
is<00:01:21.700> a<00:01:21.850> balance<00:01:22.210> between<00:01:22.329> performance<00:01:23.079> and

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
is a balance between performance and

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.899 
is a balance between performance and
energy<00:01:23.590> and<00:01:23.799> then<00:01:24.280> there's<00:01:24.460> caviar<00:01:24.640> green

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
energy and then there's caviar green

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.330 
energy and then there's caviar green
which<00:01:25.299> is<00:01:25.420> an<00:01:25.570> energy<00:01:25.960> efficient<00:01:26.320> there<00:01:27.219> were

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
which is an energy efficient there were

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.429 
which is an energy efficient there were

optimized<00:01:32.740> drives<00:01:33.100> which<00:01:33.460> made<00:01:33.640> them<00:01:33.759> very

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
optimized drives which made them very

expensive so with consumers with an ass

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.300 
expensive so with consumers with an ass
they<00:01:37.659> ended<00:01:37.899> up<00:01:38.020> buying<00:01:38.259> a<00:01:38.500> green<00:01:38.890> or<00:01:39.070> black

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
they ended up buying a green or black

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.730 
they ended up buying a green or black
drive<00:01:39.750> because<00:01:40.750> they<00:01:40.869> were<00:01:40.960> cheaper<00:01:41.380> than<00:01:41.560> an

more than enough for your nest well I

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.480 
more than enough for your nest well I
think<00:01:59.020> it<00:01:59.229> should<00:01:59.350> be<00:01:59.380> fascinating<00:01:59.619> huh<00:02:00.280> gun

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490

think it should be fascinating huh gun
anyway<00:02:02.070> Wesson<00:02:03.070> digital<00:02:03.399> introduce<00:02:03.759> the<00:02:03.909> red

drive is recognized by the software on

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.219 
drive is recognized by the software on
the<00:04:05.470> nest<00:04:05.739> so<00:04:06.069> like<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.340> qnap<00:04:06.669> synology<00:04:07.329> this

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:08.229 
the nest so like the qnap synology this

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:10.860 
the nest so like the qnap synology this
provides<00:04:09.099> less<00:04:09.370> compatibility<00:04:10.299> issue<00:04:10.449> so

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
provides less compatibility issue so

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.110 
provides less compatibility issue so
sometimes<00:04:11.349> you<00:04:11.620> might<00:04:11.739> have<00:04:11.889> had<00:04:12.069> a<00:04:12.310> raid<00:04:12.819> card

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
sometimes you might have had a raid card

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.119 
sometimes you might have had a raid card
you<00:04:13.299> stuck<00:04:13.540> a<00:04:13.720> hard<00:04:14.199> drive<00:04:14.379> in<00:04:14.560> and<00:04:14.739> it<00:04:14.859> didn't

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129 
you stuck a hard drive in and it didn't

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.240 
you stuck a hard drive in and it didn't
recognize<00:04:15.579> it<00:04:15.759> at<00:04:15.909> all<00:04:16.530> so<00:04:17.530> yeah<00:04:17.799> this<00:04:18.070> has

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
recognize it at all so yeah this has
