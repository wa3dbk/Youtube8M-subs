00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.179
 hello and welcome to gamer express 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.009
 since watchdogs was announced this 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.929
 ubisoft title does a lot of talking about 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.949
 him generally well today he's going 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.900
 continue to make noise but without 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.640
 doubt not in a way that will delight sony 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.060
 his publisher where even the gamer who 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.160
 ahead 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.240
 initially planned for the end of 2013 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.699
 exit from watch the box is so 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.289
 officially postponed to spring 2014 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.849
 the development team was of course 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.019
 split a statement that explains to 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.090
 how much they are attached to the 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.590
 quality of the game etc etc etc 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.969
 the problem is that there it does not happen 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.110
 five short weeks before the release 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.059
 originally planned 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.649
 and it pecks a bit especially for everyone 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.829
 those who like you had pre-ordered 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.000
 a pack ps4 plus watchdogs sony a 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.770
 confirmed working on the issue 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.079
 partnership with ubisoft and 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.550
 resellers and if you're concerned the 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.989
 simpler still remains to contact the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.059
 store where you performed your 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.050
 preorder the delay does not happen alone 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.239
 since the racing game 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.550
 this cost is also reported and does not 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.320
 will not be released until April 2014 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.609
 these postponements are not without consequence 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.500
 for ubisoft since they come 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.820
 add to much less sales 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.100
 high than expected to splinter cell 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.600
 blacklisted rayman legend of this fact of 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.159
 the publisher had to revisit his forecasts of 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.720
 turnover down for 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.700
 the financial year 2013 2014 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.680
 that's the story yesterday we were doing you 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.299
 discover the pub spot for ps4 and 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.369
 today is the turn of the xbox 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.750
 world evoked in video on the other hand the 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.580
 style has nothing to do since it is 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.409
 for microsoft an explanatory video 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.060
 who try to prove to you 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.860
 arguments reflected that their machine and 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.350
 the console of the future but quickly marty 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.180
 program the delorean hurry up this is 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.920
 albert penello the planning director 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.570
 product of the xbox one that provides the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.220
 most information and we 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.570
 explains that the cloud allows through 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.159
 dedicated servers to find in 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.439
 any xbox on them 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.640
 specificities of your trophy profile 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.409
 customization etc 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.790
 the video also focuses on 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.500
 benefits of kinect and especially the 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.549
 voice control recognition 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.380
 visual allowing for example 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.420
 to exchange the joysticks in full part 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.829
 while remaining the number one player on 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.479
 also tells us about smart ice the app 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.189
 mobile who will gain abilities that 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.520
 will be used in particular on the 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.350
 games 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.119
 rise and dead rising 3 with the 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.799
 remote character customization 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.049
 in the first and emissions per shot 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.910
 phone for the second in 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.590
 conclusion albert penello insists on 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.990
 distinction between the console space 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.700
 dedicated to the game and 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.440
 devote to systems for the purpose 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.880
 to be able to evolve the machine without 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.010
 never take anything away from the power 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.480
 dedicated to the game we do not know yet whether 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.000
 the console will over teleporters 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.910
 in 2040 but we keep hope 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.440
 the success of pokemon x and pokemon is 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.330
 been dazzling since it's 4 million 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.220
 of copies that were sold in the 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.480
 world in just two days and what 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.650
 could be as dazzling as the one 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.630
 rage access from those who are 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.070
 faced a nasty backup bug 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.810
 the success of the game is not necessarily 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.310
 amazing and this for two very good 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.680
 reasons first of all the license counts to 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.820
 it alone 2 145 million units 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.500
 sold since its origins 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.820
 then this new version of the 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.410
 saga is a frank success 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.880
 could even say a big killing if 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.470
 we were young and crazy but be careful 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.610
 because if you already have your version and 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.830
 that you have plunged into reading 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.570
 especially never back up in the 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.190
 city says lumis indeed all 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.360
 versions of the game seems to share a bug 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.010
 which may make your game 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.440
 inaccessible and therefore destroy 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.940
 fully your progress you are 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.290
 now warned an informed pokemon in 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.850
 worth two bands but now I have 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.800
 nothing to say to conclude this news 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.410
 I think I'm going to dance a little 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.640
 jitter the pokemon and the question of the day 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.170
 comes to us today from naulleau ligny 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.640
 which gives me a vague impression of 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.620
 already-seen or even buzz in the 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.720
 matrix this dear naulleau ligny us 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.560
 asks if title will really be an excluded 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.790
 xbox one 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.560
 so first of all thank you for your 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.790
 question and for your loyalty naulleau has 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.800
 priori the answer is simply 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.900
 yes the innovative rayspan shooter 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.400
 entertainment that had been very big 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.900
 print has the right as big as 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.970
 his statue is presently presented 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.710
 as an excluded pc and xbox and that's same 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.730
 a big selling point for the 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.590
 microsoft console 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.150
 however, there is still hope 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.920
 an explanation of frank gibeau the 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.930
 great manitou of electronic art we believed 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.640
 perceive an involuntary index he 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.350
 suggests that title would not be 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.900
 only a temporary exclusivity 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.090
 indeed the studio aims a rotation of 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.860
 exits between battlefield title hempel 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.990
 fronte logically this rotation 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.550
 should also apply to ps4 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.510
 business to follow gamer express it's 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.160
 finished for today we end up 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.160
 tomorrow and by then I 'm fine
