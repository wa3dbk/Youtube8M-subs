down<00:01:48.720> half<00:01:48.930> size<00:01:49.200> eight<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.560> half<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:50.009> it's

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
down half size eight and a half and it's

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.340 
down half size eight and a half and it's
a<00:01:50.310> perfect<00:01:50.939> fit<00:01:51.180> nine<00:01:51.750> would<00:01:52.079> it'd<00:01:52.229> be<00:01:52.320> a

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
a perfect fit nine would it'd be a

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.660 
a perfect fit nine would it'd be a
little<00:01:52.500> bit<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.799> room<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.220> would<00:01:53.399> be<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.549> little

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
little bit of room it would be a little

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.999 
little bit of room it would be a little
tight<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.659> eight<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.960> half<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.470> perfect
