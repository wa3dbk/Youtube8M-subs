and this is the gatehouse I really like
but<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.850> did<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.149> double<00:00:51.239> gatehouse<00:00:51.870> that's<00:00:52.559> a

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
but I did a double gatehouse that's a

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.709 
but I did a double gatehouse that's a
good<00:00:52.829> picture<00:00:53.070> let<00:00:54.000> me<00:00:54.120> take<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> picture<00:00:54.539> of

if you don't like a turn down the render
distance<00:01:22.250> not<00:01:23.250> long<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:24.240> cuz<00:01:24.390> i've<00:01:24.509> got<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
distance not long it's cuz i've got the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.840 
distance not long it's cuz i've got the
shader<00:01:24.960> model<00:01:25.259> as<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.770> can<00:01:25.920> see<00:01:26.100> that's<00:01:26.729> why

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
shader model as you can see that's why

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.590 
shader model as you can see that's why
it's<00:01:26.880> blazing<00:01:27.659> move<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.619> camera<00:01:29.030> all<00:01:30.030> right<00:01:30.450> i
