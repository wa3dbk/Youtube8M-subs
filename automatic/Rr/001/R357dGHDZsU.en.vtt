00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.560
 Excuse the laughter of my dear 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.770
 interviewer happens to me that this scene 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.930
 It was very funny I do not know why 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.290
 Mark Ruffalo because it was getting to 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:28.210
 gallant and very funny that part now 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:31.720
 let's talk about black life and hulk 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.720
 two characters 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.730
 key for the avengers no doubt but 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.760
 answering the question that I 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.400
 they did I have read several comics 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.670
 many marvel comics too I would say 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.910
 I do that some of the game saga do not 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.630
 I do not remember having read it because it happened 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.380
 a long time but 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.420
 I did not see this in any young committee 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.080
 some special saga of marvel not ever 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.450
 I saw it good some alternative world of 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.220
 game is I think that neither so 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.160
 According to my question, I was wrong 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.050
 you can correct comments and 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.660
 put me in that with my term so I read it and 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.430
 me informal would be much to my liking 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.620
 did more is to agree clearly because what 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.690
 as and surely that law but I do not 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.780
 agreement thank you very much 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:28.340
 well this is one of the pools that 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.440
 surely marvel to get the juice 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.840
 directly this movie but that 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.510
 all continue to see is this romance that 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.370
 between bruce banner and the black widow who 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.819
 It makes me very funny I know why but not 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.700
 ask me good 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:47.359
 we will finish the video here surely 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.629
 then we will do the other part this was 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:53.769
 only a tiny preview of what 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:55.700
 that is going to come after something short 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.769
 we were only analyzing this 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.889
 part of the trailer that seemed to me 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.750
 and my very funny partner no no the 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.489
 scene but because with mark ruffalo it 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.450
 come out in front of a sack as he said 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:10.489
 here my partner so so good 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.989
 that was all and I say goodbye as always 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.989
 iron ends for all
