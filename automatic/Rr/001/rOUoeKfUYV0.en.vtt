impacts to the phone itself there are
some<00:04:26.900> great<00:04:27.169> things<00:04:27.410> about<00:04:27.620> this<00:04:27.860> phone<00:04:27.919> that

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
some great things about this phone that

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.070 
some great things about this phone that
I<00:04:28.310> noticed<00:04:28.820> there's<00:04:29.000> no<00:04:29.120> charging<00:04:29.630> light<00:04:29.810> here

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
I noticed there's no charging light here

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.940 
I noticed there's no charging light here
so<00:04:30.230> when<00:04:30.350> you're<00:04:30.470> charging<00:04:30.830> your<00:04:30.860> phone

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
so when you're charging your phone

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.500 
so when you're charging your phone
you're<00:04:31.370> not<00:04:31.400> going<00:04:31.669> to<00:04:31.730> see<00:04:31.880> an<00:04:31.970> actual<00:04:32.120> light

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
you're not going to see an actual light

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.540 
you're not going to see an actual light
here<00:04:32.810> I<00:04:32.960> think<00:04:33.440> that<00:04:33.470> was<00:04:33.680> to<00:04:33.800> save<00:04:34.010> battery<00:04:34.430> I

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
here I think that was to save battery I

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.159 
here I think that was to save battery I
tried<00:04:34.820> to<00:04:34.910> read<00:04:35.090> more<00:04:35.330> into<00:04:35.450> that<00:04:35.600> and<00:04:35.870> as<00:04:36.020> far

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
tried to read more into that and as far

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:37.930 
tried to read more into that and as far
as<00:04:36.230> notifications<00:04:36.710> are<00:04:37.280> concerned<00:04:37.640> your

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
as notifications are concerned your

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.060 
as notifications are concerned your
phone<00:04:38.180> will<00:04:38.330> awake<00:04:38.630> a<00:04:38.780> little<00:04:38.960> bit<00:04:39.320> so<00:04:39.860> the

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
phone will awake a little bit so the

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.560 
phone will awake a little bit so the
notification<00:04:40.550> will<00:04:40.640> be<00:04:40.669> dimmed<00:04:41.060> and<00:04:41.240> I<00:04:41.330> think

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
notification will be dimmed and I think

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.210 
notification will be dimmed and I think
that<00:04:41.660> was<00:04:41.750> another<00:04:42.080> way<00:04:42.350> to<00:04:42.410> save<00:04:42.710> battery<00:04:43.130> on

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
that was another way to save battery on

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.860 
that was another way to save battery on
this<00:04:43.310> phone<00:04:43.550> and<00:04:43.730> they<00:04:44.180> were<00:04:44.240> right<00:04:44.630> about

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
this phone and they were right about

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.630 
this phone and they were right about
this<00:04:45.110> you<00:04:45.290> can<00:04:45.440> charge<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:45.860> phone<00:04:46.130> I<00:04:46.340> guess<00:04:46.520> in

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
this you can charge the phone I guess in

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.370 
this you can charge the phone I guess in
like<00:04:46.790> 15<00:04:47.210> or<00:04:47.240> 20<00:04:47.600> minutes<00:04:47.630> and<00:04:48.020> you'll<00:04:48.200> have<00:04:48.320> a

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
like 15 or 20 minutes and you'll have a

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.350 
like 15 or 20 minutes and you'll have a
