00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860
 parsing from the site and guitarist. 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.740
 not 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.870
 hi, let's go straight to the analysis 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.510
 so to play this song 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.970
 we need to tune the guitar suddenly d for 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.550
 This need to lower the sixth string on 2 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.000
 half tones for it to give but tours 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:57.920
 and so first half beat at the open 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 6 5 fourth string give play on 6 7 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:08.850
 8 then for 5 we play 7 yes yes 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:16.880
 play back the sixth in the eighth 6 on 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.880
 the seventh and again two hits 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.940
 this is 3 will be repeated almost 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.940
 all songs 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.130
 when we play a couplet we don't 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.800
 finish the last note that is 6 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.730
 country on the seventh fret we instead 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.030
 a little longer hold on the eighth fret 6 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.030
 string 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.690
 further pinch the index finger 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.790
 6 5 4 string in the third fret play two 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.370
 hitting then three hitting pause 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.770
 three strike pause another three strike pause and 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.440
 then move to the fifth fret play 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.800
 one hit two blows pause then three 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.800
 hitting 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:17.209
 when we go to the chorus play like that 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:19.489
 and from his 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:28.980
 one hit on the eighth fret 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:29.569
 come i'll take the chorus then play it myself 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.489
 twice 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.489
 open four times on the tenth fret 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:45.359
 then twice in the third distance 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.000
 move up to 7 play one hit 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:56.639
 then withstand one more blow 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:00.439
 and on take further play almost as 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.439
 the ending is just the other 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.819
 further here we play 5 two times 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.819
 because 2 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:28.510
 with us getting crumpled 3 2 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.510
