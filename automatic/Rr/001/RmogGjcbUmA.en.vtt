00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
this goodness we have left that's the

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:45.920 
this goodness we have left that's the
best<00:02:39.030> part<00:02:39.300> is<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.690> top<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:44.360> you<00:02:45.360> may<00:02:45.570> not<00:02:45.750> if

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
best part is the top and you may not if

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.170 
best part is the top and you may not if
you<00:02:46.080> have<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.320> dome<00:02:46.710> for<00:02:47.310> your<00:02:47.460> cake<00:02:47.640> plate<00:02:47.820> you

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
may actually not be able to use the dome

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.040 
may actually not be able to use the dome
because<00:02:52.110> this<00:02:52.470> cake<00:02:52.740> is<00:02:53.660> kind<00:02:54.660> of<00:02:54.810> tall

tomorrow

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:07.540 
tomorrow
almost

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.300 

just<00:03:08.270> a<00:03:08.360> little<00:03:08.540> bit<00:03:08.750> more<00:03:08.990> and<00:03:09.530> then<00:03:09.980> we'll<00:03:10.220> be

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
just a little bit more and then we'll be

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:21.710 
just a little bit more and then we'll be
good

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.660 

don't<00:03:22.410> worry<00:03:22.560> if<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.770> falls<00:03:22.950> over<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.280> side<00:03:23.460> so

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
don't worry if it falls over the side so

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:33.700 
don't worry if it falls over the side so
we'll<00:03:23.790> just<00:03:23.970> clean<00:03:24.210> that<00:03:24.240> up

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:40.310 

and<00:03:34.760> that's<00:03:35.760> it<00:03:36.320> now<00:03:38.360> you<00:03:39.360> can<00:03:39.690> go<00:03:40.050> an<00:03:40.230> extra

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
and that's it now you can go an extra

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.540 
and that's it now you can go an extra
step<00:03:40.620> if<00:03:41.130> you<00:03:41.190> choose<00:03:41.820> and<00:03:42.210> you<00:03:43.050> can<00:03:43.550> drizzle

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
step if you choose and you can drizzle

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.980 
step if you choose and you can drizzle
this<00:03:44.970> with<00:03:45.330> a<00:03:45.360> chocolate<00:03:45.930> ganache<00:03:47.720> which<00:03:48.720> I'm

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
this with a chocolate ganache which I'm

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.720 
this with a chocolate ganache which I'm
not<00:03:49.140> going<00:03:49.380> to<00:03:49.560> do<00:03:49.710> today<00:03:49.920> because<00:03:50.310> Rick

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
not going to do today because Rick

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.250 
not going to do today because Rick
thinks<00:03:51.030> that's<00:03:51.210> a<00:03:51.300> freakish<00:03:51.690> thing<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:52.080> want

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
thinks that's a freakish thing to want

00:03:52.260 --> 00:04:00.980 
thinks that's a freakish thing to want
to<00:03:52.350> do<00:03:53.300> so<00:03:59.030> that's<00:04:00.030> how<00:04:00.240> you<00:04:00.300> put<00:04:00.540> together<00:04:00.660> a

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
to do so that's how you put together a

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
to do so that's how you put together a
German<00:04:01.410> chocolate<00:04:01.440> cake
