00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
now I have dialed a tone as close as I

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.350 
now I have dialed a tone as close as I
can<00:01:02.570> using<00:01:03.320> a<00:01:03.440> stock<00:01:03.740> amp<00:01:04.010> and<00:01:04.250> bias<00:01:04.820> desktop

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
can using a stock amp and bias desktop

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.410 
can using a stock amp and bias desktop
and<00:01:05.600> for<00:01:06.080> this<00:01:06.170> example<00:01:06.350> I<00:01:06.920> started<00:01:07.550> with<00:01:07.670> a<00:01:07.820> 67
