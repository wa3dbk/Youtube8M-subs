00:07:44.239 --> 00:07:44.249 
right here now we're going to add just a

00:07:44.249 --> 00:07:50.629 
right here now we're going to add just a
little<00:07:44.279> of<00:07:44.580> this<00:07:46.369> and<00:07:47.869> and<00:07:49.039> this<00:07:50.039> is<00:07:50.099> just<00:07:50.430> kind

00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 
little of this and and this is just kind

little of this and and this is just kind
of<00:07:50.699> a<00:07:50.789> little<00:07:51.149> guess<00:07:51.389> I'll<00:07:51.599> put<00:07:51.719> this<00:07:51.869> down

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.050 
of a little guess I'll put this down

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:53.509 
of a little guess I'll put this down
into<00:07:52.319> here<00:07:52.619> but<00:07:52.769> it<00:07:52.889> because<00:07:53.069> it<00:07:53.219> kind<00:07:53.459> of

00:07:53.509 --> 00:07:53.519 
into here but it because it kind of

00:07:53.519 --> 00:07:54.920 
into here but it because it kind of
stains<00:07:53.789> but<00:07:53.969> we<00:07:54.059> put<00:07:54.209> a<00:07:54.240> little<00:07:54.419> that<00:07:54.569> into<00:07:54.839> the

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:54.930 
stains but we put a little that into the

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:57.409 
stains but we put a little that into the
take<00:07:55.169> so<00:07:56.069> that<00:07:56.339> anything<00:07:56.849> that<00:07:56.879> goes<00:07:56.999> in<00:07:57.119> there

00:07:57.409 --> 00:07:57.419 
take so that anything that goes in there

00:07:57.419 --> 00:08:00.499 
take so that anything that goes in there
is<00:07:57.539> neutralized<00:07:58.259> right<00:07:58.499> off<00:07:58.619> the<00:07:58.740> bat<00:07:59.509> and

00:08:00.499 --> 00:08:00.509 
is neutralized right off the bat and

00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:02.600 
is neutralized right off the bat and
then<00:08:00.629> I'll<00:08:00.719> set<00:08:00.930> this<00:08:01.050> stuff<00:08:01.289> right<00:08:01.469> here<00:08:01.709> and

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:02.610 
then I'll set this stuff right here and

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:04.800 
then I'll set this stuff right here and
we'll<00:08:02.729> pump<00:08:02.939> a<00:08:03.029> little<00:08:03.119> this

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:04.810 
we'll pump a little this

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.950 
we'll pump a little this

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:10.380
