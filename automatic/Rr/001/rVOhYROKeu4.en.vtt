00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.969 

I'll<00:00:00.780> let<00:00:00.960> it<00:00:01.050> settle<00:00:01.230> is<00:00:01.380> reka<00:00:01.589> liberal<00:00:01.890> I'm

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
I'll let it settle is reka liberal I'm

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.280 
I'll let it settle is reka liberal I'm
going<00:00:02.100> to<00:00:02.190> try<00:00:02.370> and<00:00:02.460> do<00:00:02.550> some<00:00:02.730> calculations

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:03.290 
going to try and do some calculations

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.599 
going to try and do some calculations
some<00:00:04.290> actual<00:00:04.620> calculations<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.310> make<00:00:05.430> some

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
some actual calculations to make some

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:06.829 
some actual calculations to make some
predictions<00:00:05.700> and<00:00:06.150> see<00:00:06.299> if<00:00:06.359> we<00:00:06.450> can<00:00:06.600> get<00:00:06.750> the

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
predictions and see if we can get the

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.740 
predictions and see if we can get the
right<00:00:06.990> answer<00:00:07.460> but<00:00:08.460> I'll<00:00:09.030> just<00:00:09.179> close<00:00:09.450> some

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
right answer but I'll just close some

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.599 
right answer but I'll just close some
things<00:00:09.990> down<00:00:12.830> the<00:00:13.830> taxis

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:23.279 

balance<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.730> budget

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.540 

I'm<00:00:24.289> going<00:00:24.440> to<00:00:24.530> drive<00:00:24.650> do<00:00:24.800> some<00:00:24.980> very<00:00:25.100> simple

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
I'm going to drive do some very simple

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.050 
I'm going to drive do some very simple
calculations<00:00:26.270> today<00:00:26.630> and<00:00:27.520> what<00:00:28.520> I'm<00:00:28.640> sensing

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
calculations today and what I'm sensing

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.640 
calculations today and what I'm sensing
to<00:00:29.360> do<00:00:29.420> is<00:00:29.480> shut<00:00:29.720> down<00:00:29.750> the<00:00:30.110> foreign<00:00:30.410> sector

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
to do is shut down the foreign sector

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.260 
to do is shut down the foreign sector
completely<00:00:31.340> I'm<00:00:31.430> just<00:00:31.580> going<00:00:31.700> to<00:00:31.730> close<00:00:32.000> all

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
completely I'm just going to close all

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.670 
completely I'm just going to close all
of<00:00:32.300> the<00:00:32.450> valves<00:00:32.750> down<00:00:32.900> here<00:00:33.200> and<00:00:33.530> we'll<00:00:33.650> just

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
of the valves down here and we'll just

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.890 
of the valves down here and we'll just
concentrate<00:00:34.010> for<00:00:34.879> a<00:00:34.910> moment<00:00:35.270> on<00:00:35.360> the<00:00:35.450> banking

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
concentrate for a moment on the banking

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.260 
concentrate for a moment on the banking
sector<00:00:36.440> and<00:00:36.620> the<00:00:36.980> government<00:00:37.010> sector<00:00:37.400> but

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
sector and the government sector but

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.610 
sector and the government sector but
really<00:00:38.480> the<00:00:38.570> banking<00:00:38.989> sector<00:00:39.320> is<00:00:39.379> what<00:00:39.500> we're

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
really the banking sector is what we're

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.860 
really the banking sector is what we're
really<00:00:39.650> going<00:00:39.980> to<00:00:40.040> look<00:00:40.340> at<00:00:40.580> today<00:00:41.239> and<00:00:41.629> see<00:00:41.780> if

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
really going to look at today and see if

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.950 
really going to look at today and see if
we<00:00:41.989> can<00:00:43.000> do<00:00:44.000> some<00:00:44.180> predictions<00:00:44.660> do<00:00:44.780> some

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
we can do some predictions do some

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.830 
we can do some predictions do some
calculations<00:00:45.680> now<00:00:45.860> this<00:00:46.010> is<00:00:46.129> one<00:00:46.280> of<00:00:46.309> the<00:00:49.840> the

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
calculations now this is one of the the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.200 
calculations now this is one of the the
big<00:00:51.019> advantage<00:00:51.559> big<00:00:52.070> advances<00:00:52.699> that<00:00:52.850> Phillips

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
big advantage big advances that Phillips

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.880 
big advantage big advances that Phillips
made<00:00:53.510> and<00:00:53.750> I'm<00:00:53.809> not<00:00:53.960> an<00:00:54.080> economist<00:00:54.650> but<00:00:54.769> I'm

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
made and I'm not an economist but I'm

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.670 
made and I'm not an economist but I'm
sold<00:00:55.219> that<00:00:55.460> there<00:00:55.670> were<00:00:56.350> quite<00:00:57.350> a<00:00:57.410> bit<00:00:57.559> of

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
sold that there were quite a bit of

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.200 
sold that there were quite a bit of
disagreement<00:00:58.280> between<00:00:58.309> Keynes<00:00:58.879> and

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
disagreement between Keynes and

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.270 
disagreement between Keynes and
Robertson<00:00:59.780> about<00:01:00.079> exactly<00:01:00.739> what<00:01:00.860> it<00:01:00.950> was<00:01:01.070> that

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
Robertson about exactly what it was that

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.729 
Robertson about exactly what it was that
set<00:01:01.460> interest<00:01:01.850> rates<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:02.559> apparently<00:01:03.559> if

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
set interest rates and apparently if

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.320 
set interest rates and apparently if
though<00:01:03.920> pair<00:01:04.460> of<00:01:04.640> them<00:01:04.789> had<00:01:04.910> lived<00:01:05.089> to<00:01:05.300> see

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
though pair of them had lived to see

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.389 
though pair of them had lived to see
this<00:01:05.810> they<00:01:06.410> would<00:01:06.560> have<00:01:06.649> looked<00:01:06.800> at<00:01:07.070> Philips

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:07.399 
this they would have looked at Philips

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.670 
this they would have looked at Philips
solution<00:01:08.090> to<00:01:08.240> this<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:08.660> they<00:01:09.440> would<00:01:09.530> never

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
solution to this and they would never

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.450 
solution to this and they would never
have<00:01:09.800> argued<00:01:10.720> and<00:01:12.250> essentially<00:01:13.250> it's

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
have argued and essentially it's

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.790 
have argued and essentially it's
treating<00:01:13.940> it<00:01:14.030> like<00:01:14.210> a<00:01:16.930> stock<00:01:17.930> as<00:01:18.289> the<00:01:18.590> one<00:01:18.710> of

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
treating it like a stock as the one of

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.139 
treating it like a stock as the one of
the<00:01:18.860> clear<00:01:19.070> things<00:01:19.100> about<00:01:19.550> this<00:01:19.700> machine<00:01:19.850> is

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
the clear things about this machine is

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:21.279 
the clear things about this machine is
the<00:01:20.300> way<00:01:20.450> it<00:01:20.539> makes<00:01:20.690> a<00:01:20.780> clear<00:01:20.990> distinction

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
the way it makes a clear distinction

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.260 
the way it makes a clear distinction
what's<00:01:21.649> the<00:01:21.770> stock<00:01:22.009> and<00:01:22.190> what's<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.460> flow<00:01:22.729> so

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
what's the stock and what's the flow so

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.969 
what's the stock and what's the flow so
you're<00:01:23.390> a<00:01:23.420> big<00:01:23.690> stock<00:01:24.080> of<00:01:24.229> money<00:01:24.320> at<00:01:24.860> the

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
you're a big stock of money at the

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.710 
you're a big stock of money at the
bottom<00:01:25.340> there's<00:01:25.700> a<00:01:25.820> stock<00:01:26.149> of<00:01:26.300> money<00:01:26.420> here<00:01:26.630> in

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
bottom there's a stock of money here in

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.300 
bottom there's a stock of money here in
the<00:01:26.810> bank<00:01:27.020> there's<00:01:27.229> a<00:01:27.319> stock<00:01:27.590> of<00:01:27.740> money<00:01:27.890> held

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
the bank there's a stock of money held

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.740 
the bank there's a stock of money held
abroad<00:01:28.610> in<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.060> foreign<00:01:29.300> exchanges<00:01:29.630> and

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
abroad in the foreign exchanges and

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.109 
abroad in the foreign exchanges and
everything<00:01:30.050> else<00:01:30.170> is<00:01:30.349> a<00:01:30.380> flow<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:31.039> so<00:01:31.520> it's

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
everything else is a flow and so it's

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.880 
everything else is a flow and so it's
the<00:01:32.330> supply<00:01:32.750> and<00:01:32.810> demand<00:01:33.200> of<00:01:33.289> this<00:01:33.410> stock<00:01:33.709> of

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
the supply and demand of this stock of

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.120 
the supply and demand of this stock of
money<00:01:34.030> competed<00:01:35.030> for<00:01:35.179> loanable<00:01:35.450> funds<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:36.130> so

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
money competed for loanable funds and so

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.120 
money competed for loanable funds and so
interest<00:01:37.580> rates<00:01:37.670> are<00:01:38.360> set<00:01:38.869> to<00:01:39.380> some<00:01:39.560> extent<00:01:39.920> by

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
interest rates are set to some extent by

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.430 
interest rates are set to some extent by
the<00:01:40.759> quantity<00:01:41.390> of<00:01:41.420> money<00:01:41.630> in<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:41.899> bank<00:01:42.110> via

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
the quantity of money in the bank via

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.839 
the quantity of money in the bank via
this<00:01:42.590> curve<00:01:42.890> at<00:01:43.099> the<00:01:43.190> end<00:01:43.340> here<00:01:43.580> which<00:01:43.700> is

00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:43.849 
this curve at the end here which is

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:45.580 
this curve at the end here which is
called<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.090> liquidity<00:01:44.599> preference<00:01:45.110> function

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
called the liquidity preference function

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.430 
called the liquidity preference function
so<00:01:46.009> the<00:01:46.190> bank<00:01:46.459> is<00:01:46.700> full<00:01:47.090> now<00:01:47.929> the<00:01:47.990> economists

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
so the bank is full now the economists

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.460 
so the bank is full now the economists
going<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:48.649> help<00:01:48.800> me<00:01:48.920> if<00:01:49.190> the<00:01:49.399> bank<00:01:49.670> is<00:01:49.880> full<00:01:50.470> we

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
going to help me if the bank is full we

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.760 
going to help me if the bank is full we
don't<00:01:51.800> want<00:01:52.160> any<00:01:52.429> more<00:01:52.729> people<00:01:53.660> to<00:01:54.050> save<00:01:54.349> so

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
don't want any more people to save so

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.770 
don't want any more people to save so
the<00:01:55.039> interest<00:01:55.580> rates<00:01:55.880> will<00:01:56.569> go<00:01:57.050> down<00:01:57.590> and

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
the interest rates will go down and

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.910 
the interest rates will go down and
everyone<00:01:59.780> will<00:01:59.989> want<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.259> invest<00:02:00.679> because

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
everyone will want to invest because

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.650 
everyone will want to invest because
money's<00:02:01.220> cheap<00:02:01.489> so<00:02:01.759> these<00:02:01.940> long<00:02:02.239> start<00:02:02.539> to

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
money's cheap so these long start to

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.540 
money's cheap so these long start to
open<00:02:02.810> okay<00:02:03.709> so<00:02:04.399> that's<00:02:05.209> set<00:02:05.509> via<00:02:05.950> this<00:02:06.950> inverse

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
open okay so that's set via this inverse

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.820 
open okay so that's set via this inverse
relationship<00:02:07.580> so<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.539> bank<00:02:08.780> is<00:02:08.959> heart<00:02:09.319> high

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
relationship so the bank is heart high

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.770 
relationship so the bank is heart high
interest<00:02:10.429> rates<00:02:10.759> are<00:02:10.940> low<00:02:11.150> so<00:02:11.420> there's<00:02:11.569> a<00:02:11.599> sort

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
interest rates are low so there's a sort

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.330 
interest rates are low so there's a sort
of<00:02:11.810> inverse<00:02:12.140> relationship<00:02:12.830> not<00:02:12.980> exactly

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
of inverse relationship not exactly

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.880 
of inverse relationship not exactly
inverse<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:14.209> them<00:02:14.360> by<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:14.599> curve<00:02:14.870> there<00:02:15.230> but

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
inverse to them by that curve there but

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.160 
inverse to them by that curve there but
then<00:02:16.010> also<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:17.030> performance<00:02:17.930> of<00:02:18.050> these

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
then also the performance of these

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.900 
then also the performance of these
valves<00:02:18.470> at<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.860> bottom<00:02:19.220> is<00:02:19.459> governed<00:02:19.790> by

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
valves at the bottom is governed by

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.119 
valves at the bottom is governed by
these<00:02:19.970> little<00:02:21.099> these<00:02:22.099> little<00:02:22.400> graphs<00:02:22.640> here<00:02:24.129> so

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
these little these little graphs here so

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.800 
these little these little graphs here so
everything

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.059 

everywhere<00:02:28.810> does<00:02:28.930> these<00:02:29.050> little<00:02:29.290> sliders<00:02:29.650> to

everywhere does these little sliders to

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.339 
everywhere does these little sliders to

and constrict these waterfalls and

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.240 
and constrict these waterfalls and
they're<00:02:35.170> powered<00:02:35.410> by<00:02:35.560> these<00:02:35.620> little<00:02:35.800> sort<00:02:36.129> of

they're powered by these little sort of

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.089 
they're powered by these little sort of
perspective<00:02:37.080> little<00:02:38.080> sliders<00:02:38.739> in<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.010> as

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
perspective little sliders in and as

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.770 
perspective little sliders in and as
these<00:02:39.280> grass<00:02:39.550> go<00:02:39.790> up<00:02:39.879> and<00:02:40.000> down<00:02:40.150> powered<00:02:40.599> by<00:02:40.750> a

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
these grass go up and down powered by a

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.949 
these grass go up and down powered by a
float<00:02:41.170> for<00:02:41.200> example<00:02:42.480> they<00:02:43.480> will<00:02:43.599> open<00:02:43.720> and

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
float for example they will open and

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.809 
float for example they will open and
close<00:02:44.140> these<00:02:44.349> sliders<00:02:45.040> now<00:02:45.370> these<00:02:45.549> happen<00:02:45.790> to

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
close these sliders now these happen to

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.160 
close these sliders now these happen to
be<00:02:45.910> linear<00:02:46.330> grass<00:02:46.540> they<00:02:46.690> don't<00:02:46.840> have<00:02:46.989> to<00:02:47.080> be

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
be linear grass they don't have to be

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.350 
be linear grass they don't have to be
linear<00:02:47.349> they<00:02:47.560> could<00:02:47.739> be<00:02:47.830> nonlinear<00:02:48.400> curves<00:02:49.000> in

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
linear they could be nonlinear curves in

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.550 
linear they could be nonlinear curves in
here<00:02:49.989> to<00:02:50.470> do<00:02:50.830> a<00:02:50.860> nonlinear<00:02:51.370> function<00:02:51.519> and<00:02:52.560> so

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
here to do a nonlinear function and so

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.430 
here to do a nonlinear function and so
this<00:02:53.860> will<00:02:54.010> be<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.989> demand<00:02:55.989> for<00:02:56.290> loanable

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
this will be the demand for loanable

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.069 
this will be the demand for loanable
funds<00:02:57.099> I<00:02:57.220> believe<00:02:57.519> as<00:02:57.730> a<00:02:57.840> interest<00:02:58.840> rates

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
funds I believe as a interest rates

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.259 
funds I believe as a interest rates
versus<00:02:59.620> the<00:03:00.099> demand<00:03:00.489> for<00:03:00.670> loanable<00:03:00.819> funds<00:03:01.150> an

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
versus the demand for loanable funds an

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.089 
versus the demand for loanable funds an
investment<00:03:01.810> here<00:03:02.019> would<00:03:02.200> be<00:03:02.380> that<00:03:02.860> curve

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
investment here would be that curve

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.400 
investment here would be that curve
there<00:03:03.370> a<00:03:03.400> basic<00:03:03.849> sort<00:03:04.030> of<00:03:04.060> demand<00:03:04.420> curve<00:03:04.780> there

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
there a basic sort of demand curve there

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.830 
there a basic sort of demand curve there
now<00:03:05.950> I've<00:03:06.220> taken<00:03:06.430> all<00:03:06.880> of<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.209> curves<00:03:07.420> out

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
now I've taken all of the curves out

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.559 
now I've taken all of the curves out
except<00:03:08.680> for<00:03:08.890> two<00:03:09.130> there's<00:03:09.700> this<00:03:09.790> one<00:03:10.060> here<00:03:10.420> and

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
except for two there's this one here and

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.949 
except for two there's this one here and
this<00:03:10.959> one<00:03:11.200> here<00:03:11.879> this<00:03:12.910> hang<00:03:13.629> on<00:03:13.750> I'm<00:03:13.810> just

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
this one here this hang on I'm just

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.110 
this one here this hang on I'm just
going<00:03:14.079> to<00:03:14.110> make<00:03:14.829> sure<00:03:15.069> you<00:03:15.700> have<00:03:15.790> a<00:03:15.819> peg<00:03:16.090> II

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120
