00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
because it will get cakey and if you

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.170 
because it will get cakey and if you
have<00:02:01.079> dry<00:02:02.040> skin<00:02:02.070> as<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:02.939> do<00:02:03.170> it<00:02:04.170> will<00:02:04.649> cling<00:02:04.979> to

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
have dry skin as I do it will cling to

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.270

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
every dry spot you have and make it look

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.510 
every dry spot you have and make it look
works

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.000 

if<00:02:12.640> you<00:02:13.090> have<00:02:13.300> oily<00:02:13.780> skin<00:02:14.080> this<00:02:14.260> powder<00:02:14.530> may

if you have oily skin this powder may

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.710 
if you have oily skin this powder may
work<00:02:15.250> great<00:02:15.520> for<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:15.910> but<00:02:16.120> I'm<00:02:16.330> not<00:02:16.360> really

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
work great for you but I'm not really

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.490 
work great for you but I'm not really
sure<00:02:16.990> it<00:02:17.410> will<00:02:17.980> probably<00:02:18.490> clump<00:02:19.240> up<00:02:19.450> even<00:02:20.380> on

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
sure it will probably clump up even on

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.480 
sure it will probably clump up even on
you<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:24.540> noticed<00:02:25.540> that<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:26.020> it<00:02:26.830> kind<00:02:27.130> of<00:02:27.220> balls

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
you I noticed that it it kind of balls

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:35.730 
you I noticed that it it kind of balls
up<00:02:27.760> in<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.030> package<00:02:28.540> and<00:02:29.580> I<00:02:31.500> think<00:02:32.500> that<00:02:34.740> you

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
up in the package and I think that you

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.410 
up in the package and I think that you
have<00:02:35.890> to<00:02:35.980> be<00:02:36.100> super<00:02:36.310> careful<00:02:36.640> if<00:02:37.000> you<00:02:37.150> drop

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
have to be super careful if you drop

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.090 
have to be super careful if you drop
this<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.870> plastic<00:02:38.290> seems<00:02:38.590> to<00:02:38.710> be<00:02:38.800> really

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
this the plastic seems to be really

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.650 
this the plastic seems to be really
cheap<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:39.580> could<00:02:39.730> break<00:02:40.000> make<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.840> mess

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
cheap it could break make a mess

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.380 
cheap it could break make a mess
basically<00:02:43.680> there<00:02:44.680> is<00:02:45.070> to<00:02:45.580> sum<00:02:45.820> it<00:02:45.850> up<00:02:46.060> in<00:02:46.330> just

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
basically there is to sum it up in just

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.960 
basically there is to sum it up in just
like<00:02:46.810> one<00:02:47.050> sentence<00:02:47.410> there<00:02:48.130> are<00:02:48.160> tons<00:02:48.790> of

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
like one sentence there are tons of

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.120 
like one sentence there are tons of
other<00:02:49.150> drugstore<00:02:49.960> loose<00:02:50.230> powders<00:02:50.680> out<00:02:50.890> there

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
other drugstore loose powders out there

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.700 
other drugstore loose powders out there
that<00:02:51.430> are<00:02:52.240> even<00:02:52.600> cheaper<00:02:52.630> than<00:02:53.170> this<00:02:53.290> one<00:02:53.530> that

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
that are even cheaper than this one that

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.240 
that are even cheaper than this one that
will<00:02:53.920> work<00:02:54.070> better<00:02:54.780> I<00:02:55.780> find<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.710> this<00:02:56.980> one

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
will work better I find that this one

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.090 
will work better I find that this one
the<00:02:57.490> L'Oreal<00:02:58.360> hydro<00:02:58.930> perfect<00:02:59.320> you<00:02:59.590> see<00:02:59.860> how

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
the L'Oreal hydro perfect you see how

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.140 
the L'Oreal hydro perfect you see how
wore<00:03:00.340> out<00:03:00.520> it<00:03:00.700> is<00:03:02.160> seems<00:03:03.160> to<00:03:03.340> work<00:03:03.490> much<00:03:04.120> better

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
wore out it is seems to work much better

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.450 
wore out it is seems to work much better
let's<00:03:04.960> put<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.230> powder<00:03:05.410> side-by-side<00:03:08.460> the

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
let's put the powder side-by-side the

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.970 
let's put the powder side-by-side the
hydro<00:03:09.850> perfect<00:03:10.300> is<00:03:10.480> in<00:03:10.690> number<00:03:11.110> nine<00:03:11.650> one

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
hydro perfect is in number nine one

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:22.230 
hydro perfect is in number nine one
seven<00:03:14.550> light<00:03:15.550> and<00:03:16.620> this<00:03:17.620> one<00:03:17.890> is<00:03:18.250> in<00:03:21.150> middle<00:03:22.150> of

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
seven light and this one is in middle of

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.310 
seven light and this one is in middle of
Coto<00:03:22.510> one-sided<00:03:23.580> one<00:03:24.580> zero<00:03:25.090> five<00:03:25.360> translucent

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
Coto one-sided one zero five translucent

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.250 
Coto one-sided one zero five translucent
and<00:03:26.580> the<00:03:27.580> light<00:03:27.940> is<00:03:28.240> darker<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:31.720> difference

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
and the light is darker the difference

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.780 
and the light is darker the difference
in<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:32.590> two<00:03:32.830> I<00:03:34.770> think<00:03:35.770> this<00:03:36.040> one<00:03:36.250> is<00:03:36.280> more

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
in the two I think this one is more

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.690 
in the two I think this one is more
hydrating<00:03:37.030> feeling<00:03:37.870> and<00:03:38.250> feels<00:03:39.250> a<00:03:39.460> little

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
hydrating feeling and feels a little

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.230 
hydrating feeling and feels a little
more<00:03:40.120> wet<00:03:40.570> than<00:03:40.840> than<00:03:41.470> this<00:03:41.740> one<00:03:41.950> I<00:03:42.160> think<00:03:42.790> that

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
more wet than than this one I think that

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.770 
more wet than than this one I think that
the<00:03:43.570> L'Oreal<00:03:44.200> is<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:45.460> little<00:03:45.970> more<00:03:46.180> pink<00:03:46.480> toned

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
the L'Oreal is a little more pink toned

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.890 
the L'Oreal is a little more pink toned
whereas<00:03:47.740> the<00:03:48.130> covergirl<00:03:48.670> is<00:03:49.060> a<00:03:49.090> more<00:03:49.390> yellow

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
whereas the covergirl is a more yellow

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.700 
whereas the covergirl is a more yellow
toned<00:03:50.200> powder<00:03:50.730> so<00:03:51.730> you<00:03:52.330> know<00:03:53.050> I<00:03:53.080> will<00:03:53.350> keep

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
toned powder so you know I will keep

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.730 
toned powder so you know I will keep
this<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.750> I<00:03:55.750> don't<00:03:56.110> know<00:03:56.320> what<00:03:56.470> I'm<00:03:56.560> going<00:03:56.680> to

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
this and I don't know what I'm going to

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.260 
this and I don't know what I'm going to
do<00:03:56.890> with<00:03:57.040> it<00:03:57.190> I'll<00:03:57.310> stick<00:03:57.550> it<00:03:57.700> probably<00:03:58.060> in<00:03:58.180> the

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
do with it I'll stick it probably in the

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.750 
do with it I'll stick it probably in the
back<00:03:58.480> of<00:03:58.780> a<00:03:59.110> drawer<00:03:59.770> somewhere<00:04:00.070> and<00:04:00.460> who<00:04:00.550> knows

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
back of a drawer somewhere and who knows

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.880 
back of a drawer somewhere and who knows
the<00:04:00.940> next<00:04:01.180> time<00:04:01.300> I'll<00:04:01.480> use<00:04:01.510> it<00:04:01.870> but<00:04:02.650> what<00:04:02.860> I

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
the next time I'll use it but what I

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.300 
the next time I'll use it but what I
plan<00:04:03.370> on<00:04:03.580> doing<00:04:03.640> is<00:04:04.180> getting<00:04:04.990> another<00:04:05.590> one<00:04:05.950> of

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
plan on doing is getting another one of

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.900 
plan on doing is getting another one of
the<00:04:07.030> L'Oreal<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:08.440> smell<00:04:08.800> is<00:04:09.100> nothing<00:04:09.730> like

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
the L'Oreal the smell is nothing like

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.230 
the L'Oreal the smell is nothing like
the<00:04:10.120> covergirl<00:04:10.740> and<00:04:11.740> I<00:04:12.610> think<00:04:12.880> it<00:04:13.000> wears

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
the covergirl and I think it wears

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:20.840 
the covergirl and I think it wears
better<00:04:13.540> on<00:04:13.840> my<00:04:13.990> skin<00:04:14.320> because<00:04:14.500> it<00:04:15.010> is<00:04:15.630> a<00:04:16.739> a

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.680 

wetter<00:04:21.850> type

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.540 

powder<00:04:25.690> sorry<00:04:26.260> my<00:04:26.680> mind's<00:04:26.889> in<00:04:27.100> a<00:04:27.160> million

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
powder sorry my mind's in a million

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.370 
powder sorry my mind's in a million
places<00:04:27.700> right<00:04:28.060> now<00:04:28.410> I<00:04:30.450> do<00:04:31.450> think<00:04:31.810> that<00:04:31.930> with

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
places right now I do think that with

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.360 
places right now I do think that with
the<00:04:32.980> covergirl<00:04:33.460> that<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:35.130> powder<00:04:36.130> all<00:04:36.340> over

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
the covergirl that the powder all over

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.020 
the covergirl that the powder all over
it<00:04:37.050> that<00:04:38.050> the<00:04:38.200> formula<00:04:38.650> is<00:04:38.800> thinner<00:04:39.250> than<00:04:39.370> the

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
it that the formula is thinner than the

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.680 
it that the formula is thinner than the
covergirl

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
covergirl

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.990 
covergirl
I<00:04:40.840> mean<00:04:41.290> the<00:04:41.440> L'Oreal<00:04:42.130> let<00:04:42.310> me<00:04:42.430> say<00:04:42.610> this<00:04:42.760> all

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
I mean the L'Oreal let me say this all

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.210 
I mean the L'Oreal let me say this all
over<00:04:43.180> again<00:04:43.300> I<00:04:43.660> do<00:04:43.930> think<00:04:44.169> that<00:04:44.500> the<00:04:44.680> covergirl

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
over again I do think that the covergirl

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.170 
over again I do think that the covergirl
is<00:04:45.490> thinner<00:04:46.150> than<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:46.780> L'Oreal<00:04:47.230> powder<00:04:48.180> maybe

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
is thinner than the L'Oreal powder maybe

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.940 
is thinner than the L'Oreal powder maybe
they<00:04:49.360> changed<00:04:49.389> the<00:04:49.780> formula<00:04:50.139> I'm<00:04:50.500> not<00:04:50.770> really

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
they changed the formula I'm not really

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:57.330 
they changed the formula I'm not really
sure<00:04:51.310> but<00:04:53.310> yeah<00:04:54.310> not<00:04:54.850> for<00:04:55.150> me<00:04:55.300> and<00:04:55.830> I<00:04:56.830> am<00:04:56.980> very

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
sure but yeah not for me and I am very

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.560 
sure but yeah not for me and I am very
happy<00:04:57.820> to<00:04:59.220> report<00:05:00.220> that<00:05:00.550> I'm<00:05:00.850> going<00:05:01.390> right
