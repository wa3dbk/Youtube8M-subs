this presentation outlines the main

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.820 
this presentation outlines the main
parts<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.490> compound<00:00:14.940> light<00:00:15.269> microscope<00:00:15.830> it

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
parts of a compound light microscope it

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.980 
parts of a compound light microscope it
also<00:00:17.160> briefly<00:00:17.550> describes<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.359> functions<00:00:18.869> of

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
also briefly describes the functions of

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.540 
also briefly describes the functions of
these<00:00:19.170> parts<00:00:20.390> so<00:00:21.390> let's<00:00:21.990> begin<00:00:25.070> the<00:00:26.070> eyepiece

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
these parts so let's begin the eyepiece

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.509 
these parts so let's begin the eyepiece
lens<00:00:26.730> it's<00:00:27.630> also<00:00:28.050> known<00:00:28.260> as<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.560> ocular<00:00:29.160> lens

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
lens it's also known as the ocular lens

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.519 
lens it's also known as the ocular lens
and<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.720> first<00:00:31.019> point<00:00:31.349> of

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
and it is the first point of

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.150 
and it is the first point of
magnification<00:00:32.489> with<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> 10<00:00:33.540> times<00:00:33.899> or<00:00:34.200> 15
