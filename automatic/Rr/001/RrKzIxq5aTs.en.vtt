00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.000 
up for daily routine video you know that
my<00:01:44.270> major<00:01:44.450> takes<00:01:44.870> quite<00:01:45.110> a<00:01:45.170> long<00:01:45.260> time<00:01:45.410> but<00:01:45.890> on

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
my major takes quite a long time but on

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.670 
my major takes quite a long time but on
and<00:01:46.340> this<00:01:47.150> took<00:01:47.480> about<00:01:47.690> this<00:01:48.140> makeup<00:01:48.380> I'm

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
and this took about this makeup I'm

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.670 
and this took about this makeup I'm
wearing<00:01:49.040> now<00:01:49.100> take<00:01:49.460> about<00:01:49.640> 10<00:01:50.150> minutes<00:01:50.180> maybe

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
so it's a great alternative for when I

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.630 
so it's a great alternative for when I
don't<00:01:53.540> have<00:01:53.720> time<00:01:53.960> or<00:01:54.320> I<00:01:54.680> don't<00:01:54.830> want<00:01:54.980> to<00:01:55.310> do

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
don't have time or I don't want to do

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.850 
don't have time or I don't want to do
the<00:01:55.790> whole<00:01:56.050> shadow<00:01:57.050> highlight<00:01:57.530> everything

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
the whole shadow highlight everything

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.150 
the whole shadow highlight everything
they<00:01:58.430> need<00:01:58.640> and<00:01:58.790> that's<00:01:59.780> pretty<00:02:00.530> good<00:02:00.650> I'm

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
they need and that's pretty good I'm

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.640 
they need and that's pretty good I'm
very<00:02:01.220> happy<00:02:01.910> with<00:02:02.000> it<00:02:02.120> and<00:02:02.390> it's<00:02:02.690> like<00:02:03.140> it

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
very happy with it and it's like it

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.260 
very happy with it and it's like it
wouldn't<00:02:03.920> be<00:02:04.040> a<00:02:04.070> permanent<00:02:04.400> solution<00:02:04.700> for<00:02:05.150> me

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
wouldn't be a permanent solution for me

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.660 
wouldn't be a permanent solution for me
because<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.990> color<00:02:06.320> range<00:02:06.650> is<00:02:06.980> not<00:02:07.190> that<00:02:07.430> big

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
because the color range is not that big

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.750 
because the color range is not that big
and<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:09.500> color<00:02:09.740> is<00:02:09.830> not<00:02:10.190> hunger<00:02:10.550> isn't

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
and the color is not hunger isn't

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.450 
and the color is not hunger isn't
perfect<00:02:11.300> but<00:02:11.480> it's<00:02:11.720> good<00:02:11.930> enough<00:02:11.960> so<00:02:12.710> for<00:02:13.340> me

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
perfect but it's good enough so for me

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.570 
perfect but it's good enough so for me

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
difficult because I mean first of all

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.990 
difficult because I mean first of all
the<00:03:27.300> finish<00:03:27.630> will<00:03:27.810> not<00:03:27.930> be<00:03:28.080> great<00:03:28.350> because

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
the finish will not be great because

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.330 
the finish will not be great because
fingers<00:03:30.000> our<00:03:30.270> fingers<00:03:30.690> they're<00:03:31.050> not<00:03:31.200> like

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
brushes so this is moving kind of

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.370 
brushes so this is moving kind of
difficult<00:03:35.580> to<00:03:35.670> work<00:03:36.030> into<00:03:36.300> your<00:03:36.480> skin<00:03:36.810> evenly
