00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.210
 two in one 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.470
 and even better 3 one these cars 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.690
 called pickups 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.360
 they successfully combine themselves throughput 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.469
 classic frame SUV 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.870
 spaciousness and carrying capacity 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.369
 light truck generally speaking 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.710
 about truly universal 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.900
 car then this is definitely a pickup he and 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.000
 for daily trips around the city and for 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.890
 hunting trips or fishing it and for 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.619
 hard work and for pleasure 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.529
 real mr practical today we 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.840
 we test nissan np300 that means n. 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.489
 everything is very simple nissan pickup 300 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.200
 slightly rounded gross weight 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.360
 car i have three tons 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.750
 of which more than a thousand kilos accounted for 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.489
 on the mass of the transported cargo 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.680
 by the way in different countries this car 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.170
 sold under various frontier names 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.550
 hard body and even per-watt but because nissan 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.129
 navara looks completely different 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.690
 say you and deiner the thing is that 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.940
 np 300 pick up model 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.980
 this is only the previous one 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.719
 generations and between these models 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.120
 no internal competition 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.650
 exists first np300 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.900
 the japanese from sand and commercial 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.760
 car and secondly this car is worth 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.610
 significantly cheaper than the most affordable 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.299
 navar base np300 pickup in Ukrainian 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.400
 the market is available and 22900 dollar and already one 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.560
 this circumstance makes it perhaps 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.720
 the most advantageous offer among all 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.520
 Japanese off-road vehicles especially 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.770
 if you take into account that nissan 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.670
 The np300 is made exclusively in 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.670
 the land of the rising sun 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.670
 nissan np300 pickup produced 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.500
 directly in Japan the Japanese themselves 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.580
 attributed this car to the category 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.500
 commercial vehicles 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.360
 but we in Ukraine hardly believe me 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.890
 in what our people will acquire 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.370
 such a machine just to 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.190
 to transport goods for what then 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.360
 ask in this car will need 24 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.400
 centimeter ride height 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.770
 all-wheel drive transmission five 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.260
 full seats and large 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.810
 trunk to fit more than a ton of cargo 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.940
 correct such a car we will 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.850
 buy avid hunters and fishermen 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.220
 farmers and finally just those people who 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.320
 no weekend can spend 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.530
 at home they are constantly drawn to the real 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.740
 off road immediately I note that np 300 pick 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.870
 up 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.670
 this is not just the previous anavar this 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.770
 car before you enter our 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.840
 the market has been seriously refined by improving 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.420
 First , only one is delivered to us. 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.130
 bodywork version of the 5 th place in the second body 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.390
 got new optics bumpers and 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.730
 grille 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.290
 but the most important innovation in the engine compartment 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.209
 space in the predecessor 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.670
 similar in volume to the motor in two 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.280
 half liter was only 104 horse 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.810
 the power of the new pickup is herd increased 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.030
 up to 133 horses 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.760
 and at the same time increased torque 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.550
 up to 304 newton meters of course new 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.100
 navarro and engines even more powerful 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.760
 174 horses but our motor without system 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.440
 common rail 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.230
 and then u lets not so scrupulous 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.180
 choose refueling maximum torque 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.050
 the moment is already available at two thousand 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.360
 rpm 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.310
 so the concept 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.860
 pension on the break this pickups quite 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.280
 applicable 13 seconds from position to first 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.410
 hundreds 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.360
 very worthy as a merchant 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.460
 the result is the maximum speed for 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.160
 This car manufacturer announced 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.960
 at 160 kilometers an hour we will go 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.660
 to his word because to drive faster 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.400
 hundreds are now very expensive besides 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.170
 engine at high revs all the same 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.760
 noisy by the way the suspension here 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.670
 traditional for cars of this class 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.690
 torsion front and good old rear 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.030
 leaf spring 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.520
 despite the conservative design and 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.709
 the settings are also changing when enough 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.360
 high energy intensity and capacity 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.370
 smooth outcome and directional stability 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.650
 increased almost to the modern level 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.410
 crossover at least not even 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.180
 loaded np300 practically no goats on 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.800
 uneven tracks and does not require 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.050
 course correction driving on the track 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.390
 speeds even a hundred kilometers an hour than 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.370
 many of his competitors sin in fast 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.410
 turn the beginner behaves completely 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.510
 no cargo scares too 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.550
 larger members and easier than with honor 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.350
 they are controlled by gases with everything at 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.690
 This is not Sarov pickup shows 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.880
 good fuel efficiency misha 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.959
 we cycle less than 10 liters of diesel at 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.959
 every hundred kilometers 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.870
 as for the cabin, no frills 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.880
 standard japanese pickup late 90 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.160
 still it's a workhorse 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.840
 there is a minimum of amenities and no unnecessary 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.970
 but all that is necessary for 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.010
 hassle-free daily operation in 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.050
 any time of year and in any weather on 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.910
 any roads he has including 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.040
 touching air conditioner 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.260
 intensity direction controls 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.680
 review provided heated front 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.840
 the seats 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.940
 two front airbags 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.950
 a lot of ashtrays and a cup holder for 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.060
 dating we got a car 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.910
 average configuration 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.690
 that is, we have been installed 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.610
 power windows on all doors and 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.920
 central locking in the top version 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.080
 front side steps appear 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.210
 fog and hi from the 90s 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.950
 music center sit our Chinger 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.290
 disks and tape recorders 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.090
 as for the back sofa, he 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.280
 of course can immediately take three 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.230
 passengers but honestly the conditions for 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.000
 them there will be frankly spartan 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.580
 nothing can be done commercial 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.230
 the essence of the car is impossible to hide 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.960
 but what is his cargo bay 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:14.210
 long wide and deep if you are here 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.470
 put all your luggage and mass 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.380
 maybe more than a ton 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:23.790
 if exactly one thousand and fifty kilograms 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:28.460
 and now about the most interesting 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.460
 and the nissan np300 SUV features 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.660
 24 centimeters of ground clearance is 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.940
 unlikely to offer anyone else 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.380
 long stroke suspension and full 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.780
 4 by 4 system 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.880
 This car is able to force fords 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.950
 half a meter deep and maximum 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.920
 angle of entry 39 degrees 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.900
 Allowable transverse brand at all 48 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.640
 degrees if you climb into a hybrid but 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.370
 help razdatka which has three 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.810
 position 2h rear wheel drive for movement 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.170
 dry and hard coating 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.750
 4 full beer for slippery roads and 4l 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.730
 full plus stepdown connect 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.950
 Front axle can be up to 40 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.780
 kilometers an hour right on the move and here 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.030
 to activate a lower number will have 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.190
 stay the center differential in 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.750
 this transmission is not provided by others 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.910
 words front axle connects 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.040
 tough that's why the manufacturer 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.140
 recommends not to drive constantly 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.060
 four by four and only include it 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.980
 where it is really necessary but 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.900
 in order for the 5 meter machine to be better 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.940
 managed on asphalt including 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.960
 slippery in the rear axle stopped here 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.520
 limited slip differential 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.380
 increased friction 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.720
 it is he who improves the handling and 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.340
 course stoychev including when moving 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.710
 on slippery road and on high 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.720
 speeds all these water allow on 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.730
 that bottom they really don't choose 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.440
 road and even on bumpy primer 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.600
 maintain the speed that 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.070
 wants everything is limited only courage 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.240
 the driver and his reliability 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.320
 vestibular apparatus 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:54.270
 other restrictions are just not being 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.250
 in the end we only regret the water 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.290
 why didn't he take so long to 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.449
 our market is this wonderful in all 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.320
 relationship car he has a powerful 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:03.110
 economical motor 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.580
 impressive off-road capability 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.560
 The advantage of the Japanese assembly is large 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.580
 load capacity and the most affordable in 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.790
 class pickups Price 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:14.510
 a $ 22,900 competitor for sure 

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.510
 will have to make room
