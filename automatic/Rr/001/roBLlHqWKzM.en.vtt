00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
 hello to all I am delighted to you 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.419
 find today to talk to you 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.379
 a mascara 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:11.759
 this is the mascara of the brand 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:16.379
 April I actually explain to you I was at 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:19.199
 looking for untested makeup 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.600
 on animals and so I fell 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.580
 on the site is home beauty that I do not 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.920
 did not know at all I contacted the 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.390
 mark and they sent me three 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.859
 products so I will show you the 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.179
 two more after but I wanted 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.610
 really really really talk to you 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.940
 mascara because simply 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.190
 So when I opened the received frozen 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.930
 and I saw it was a brush 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:46.280
 like that so with hairs and I was 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.629
 angry with this type of mascara bronze 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.750
 for a long time actually I use and 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.420
 the silicone brushes are small 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.620
 pimples because since that was 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.210
 came out late if I think it's me 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.190
 suited a lot better than it was going 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.140
 a lot better and so by opening this 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.530
 mascara Thursday on behalf again a brush to 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.540
 the old good I understand myself and I 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.409
 still going to test and that's why 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.229
 that I'm talking to you about it because I was 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.670
 really bluffed really did not think 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.680
 they would work it's a mascara 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:19.200
 which is bio certified organic according to ecocert 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.400
 and so on 100% natural I thought 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.150
 really not that we could have a 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.890
 result so bluffing with an organic product 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:29.190
 so this thickened mascara 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.600
 he lasts the remedies I do not love me 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.270
 need to use a seat remedy 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.490
 and already left that is curving super 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.950

 tested on animals what I find 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.970
 super important I really try to me 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.479
 turn to more natural brands 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.530
