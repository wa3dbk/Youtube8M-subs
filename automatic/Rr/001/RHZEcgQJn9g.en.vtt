00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
now this is the hydrangea I call PG on

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.700 
now this is the hydrangea I call PG on
my<00:00:03.870> life<00:00:04.279> but<00:00:05.279> I<00:00:05.339> have<00:00:05.700> some<00:00:05.910> around<00:00:06.240> my<00:00:06.390> pool

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:06.710 
my life but I have some around my pool

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.220 
my life but I have some around my pool
that<00:00:07.710> looked<00:00:07.980> very<00:00:08.040> similar<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.780> nursery

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
that looked very similar and the nursery

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.530 
that looked very similar and the nursery
said<00:00:10.500> they're<00:00:10.679> called<00:00:10.950> mom<00:00:11.250> life<00:00:11.580> so<00:00:12.269> I<00:00:12.480> don't

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
said they're called mom life so I don't

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.379 
said they're called mom life so I don't
know<00:00:12.929> if<00:00:13.410> it's<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.980> different<00:00:14.429> hydrangea<00:00:15.089> but<00:00:15.299> I

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
know if it's a different hydrangea but I

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.040 
know if it's a different hydrangea but I
think<00:00:15.660> they're<00:00:15.900> all<00:00:16.139> PG<00:00:16.619> hydrangeas

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
think they're all PG hydrangeas

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.519 
think they're all PG hydrangeas
limelight<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.410> just<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:20.130> kind<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:21.090> PG<00:00:21.570> but<00:00:22.350> it's

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
limelight is just a kind of PG but it's

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.250 
limelight is just a kind of PG but it's
definitely<00:00:22.800> not<00:00:23.400> Mountain<00:00:24.150> hydrangea<00:00:24.900> like<00:00:25.080> I

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
definitely not Mountain hydrangea like I

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.519

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529
