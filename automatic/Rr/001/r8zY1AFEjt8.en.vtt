00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
find the right adapter for your fitting

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.790 
find the right adapter for your fitting
just<00:00:51.820> screw<00:00:52.060> that<00:00:52.090> on<00:00:52.330> hand<00:00:52.840> tight<00:00:55.740> now<00:00:56.740> you

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
just screw that on hand tight now you

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.040 
just screw that on hand tight now you
want<00:00:57.010> to<00:00:57.040> look<00:00:57.160> up<00:00:57.280> the<00:00:57.430> specs<00:00:57.790> in<00:00:58.150> your<00:00:58.570> manual

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
want to look up the specs in your manual

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.200 
want to look up the specs in your manual
they<00:00:59.830> will<00:01:00.010> be<00:01:00.630> key<00:01:01.630> on<00:01:01.780> engine<00:01:01.990> off<00:01:02.290> spec<00:01:02.740> and

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
they will be key on engine off spec and

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.990 
they will be key on engine off spec and
there'll<00:01:04.210> be<00:01:04.239> a<00:01:04.650> running<00:01:05.650> spectrum<00:01:06.220> fuel

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
there'll be a running spectrum fuel

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.800 
there'll be a running spectrum fuel
coming<00:01:07.210> out<00:01:07.390> as<00:01:07.509> you<00:01:07.600> see<00:01:07.770> as<00:01:08.770> I<00:01:08.920> tighten<00:01:09.310> this

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
coming out as you see as I tighten this

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:23.870 
coming out as you see as I tighten this
fitting<00:01:10.810> on<00:01:12.780> again<00:01:13.780> it's<00:01:14.020> just<00:01:14.050> hand<00:01:14.380> tight

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.240 

get<00:01:24.880> this<00:01:25.030> gauge<00:01:25.270> here<00:01:25.800> what<00:01:26.800> I'm<00:01:26.890> going<00:01:26.920> to<00:01:27.100> do

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
get this gauge here what I'm going to do

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.180 
get this gauge here what I'm going to do
is<00:01:27.580> just<00:01:28.030> turn<00:01:28.300> the<00:01:28.360> key<00:01:28.570> on<00:01:28.990> not<00:01:29.530> too<00:01:29.860> engine

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
is just turn the key on not too engine

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.030 
is just turn the key on not too engine
running<00:01:30.490> but<00:01:30.640> just<00:01:30.850> key<00:01:31.120> on<00:01:31.390> and<00:01:32.040> probably

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
running but just key on and probably

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.350 
running but just key on and probably
have<00:01:33.130> to<00:01:33.250> cycle<00:01:33.460> at<00:01:33.640> several<00:01:33.940> times<00:01:34.000> they

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
have to cycle at several times they

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.410 
have to cycle at several times they
build<00:01:34.600> up<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.960> full<00:01:35.200> pressure<00:01:35.640> okay<00:01:36.640> I'm

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
build up the full pressure okay I'm

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.899 
build up the full pressure okay I'm
going<00:01:37.540> to<00:01:37.600> leave<00:01:37.720> that<00:01:37.780> there<00:01:38.380> and<00:01:38.820> turn<00:01:39.820> the

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
going to leave that there and turn the

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:51.880 
going to leave that there and turn the
key<00:01:40.060> on

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.899 

you

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.880 

and<00:01:56.500> look

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
and look

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.650 
and look
thirty-eight<00:01:58.580> they're<00:01:58.850> so<00:01:59.060> worth<00:01:59.270> within

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
thirty-eight they're so worth within

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.710 
thirty-eight they're so worth within
spec<00:02:00.610> now<00:02:01.610> we're<00:02:01.820> going<00:02:01.970> to<00:02:02.060> turn<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.600> engine

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
spec now we're going to turn the engine

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:31.830 
spec now we're going to turn the engine
on<00:02:02.990> and<00:02:03.320> see<00:02:03.440> what<00:02:03.560> it<00:02:03.620> runs<00:02:03.860> at

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:40.060 

we<00:02:32.230> were<00:02:32.410> at<00:02:32.470> about<00:02:32.560> 32<00:02:33.040> psi

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.350 

26<00:02:41.070> to<00:02:41.220> 45<00:02:42.440> so<00:02:43.440> that's<00:02:43.620> good

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
26 to 45 so that's good

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.770 
26 to 45 so that's good
one<00:02:46.320> thing<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.650> could<00:02:46.890> do<00:02:47.100> if<00:02:47.370> if<00:02:48.360> you're<00:02:48.600> not

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
one thing you could do if if you're not

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.010 
one thing you could do if if you're not
in<00:02:48.990> range<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:50.130> can<00:02:50.280> test<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.780> fuel<00:02:51.780> pressure

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
in range you can test the fuel pressure

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.960 
in range you can test the fuel pressure
regulator

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.990 

just<00:02:57.810> right<00:02:58.020> here<00:02:58.310> what<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.430> can<00:02:59.580> do<00:02:59.700> is<00:02:59.910> you

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
just right here what you can do is you

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.570 
just right here what you can do is you
can<00:03:00.290> fill<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.410> hose<00:03:01.620> off<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.220> see<00:03:02.430> what

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
can fill the hose off and see what

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:10.120 
can fill the hose off and see what
happens<00:03:06.260> just<00:03:07.260> insist<00:03:07.770> and<00:03:07.950> fill<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.280> holes

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
happens just insist and fill the holes

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.410 
happens just insist and fill the holes
and<00:03:10.430> there<00:03:10.580> you<00:03:10.700> go<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:11.630> rises<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:14.060> this<00:03:14.270> is<00:03:14.330> the

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
and there you go it rises so this is the

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.830 
and there you go it rises so this is the
maximum<00:03:14.630> rate<00:03:14.930> they're<00:03:15.320> running<00:03:15.800> at<00:03:15.980> 38<00:03:16.820> is<00:03:17.630> to

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
maximum rate they're running at 38 is to

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.250 
maximum rate they're running at 38 is to
regulate<00:03:18.140> or<00:03:18.470> not<00:03:18.620> operating

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
regulate or not operating

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.920 
regulate or not operating
if<00:03:21.680> you<00:03:21.860> pull<00:03:22.069> this<00:03:22.220> hose<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:22.849> the<00:03:23.269> pressure

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
if you pull this hose and the pressure

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.289 
if you pull this hose and the pressure
doesn't<00:03:24.409> rise<00:03:24.640> it's<00:03:25.640> probably<00:03:25.940> a<00:03:25.970> problem

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
doesn't rise it's probably a problem

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.449 
doesn't rise it's probably a problem
