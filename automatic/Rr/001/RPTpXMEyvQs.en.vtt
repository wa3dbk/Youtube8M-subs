00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hi everyone I'm good just thrown 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.230
 in a free moment of writing and if not 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.300
 You have uploaded this week more than just one 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.000
 video has been because I've been traveling 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.920
 and all that, so I feel the delay 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.920
 but today I bring you the burkholder 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.100
 Well, I've already said this as a few 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.640
 travel days a week or so 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.170
 good 15 days and I was in segovia in the 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.489
 capitalist university and I have it 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.930
 passed very well 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.730
 I had planned to leave engraved on 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.489
 videos and go up little by little 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.780
 but I said better not because I had a 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.750
 lots of things to do before the 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.489
 trip and well it has complicated me a 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.140
 little and in the end I could not do what 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.900
 that I had planned the books that 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.129
 they have arrived in July are 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.230
 mainly 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.110
 things that I bought I think I won 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.729
 in contest I think there are only two books 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.979
 that are from publishers I'm not sure 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.320
 that they have sent me but well we are going to 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.649
 see the places where you can find 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.509
 claudia gray because this book I've already 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.060
 read and I think I've reviewed in the blog 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.160
 I'm not sure it was a reading that in 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.810
 a principle bored me a bit but that 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.640
 in the end I liked a lot I 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.620
 already spoken of in the wrap to which 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.560
 I'll let you in and 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.600
 and Well I think I said 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.250
 absolutely everything to a sierra see 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.840
 much this reading because he enlarged 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.460
 its pros and cons the truth is that 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.470
 it's pretty good the writer leaves 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.920
 with many many desire to continue 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.110
 to continue reading your stuff and 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.180
 Well, I recommend you very much 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.670
 claudia grace this novel is not read 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.530
 midnight or dark waters I think that 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.050
 It is also a saga and a book 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.210
 independent of her and that prove this 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.070
 writer because she has enough 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.810
 personality write is enough 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.630
 well the next book that is not from 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.590
 A whole book came to me through Anaya's pass 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.540
 and it's anti daily made a collaboration 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.450
 with them basically to make a 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.860
 video that for me was a little bit 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.520
 but good for sure for you 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.830
 as well 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.860
 I also leave you here around there in 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.780
 about how he defaced and destroyed this 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.760
 diary because it 's the same thing that destroys 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.520
 this newspaper only that with another edition and 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.520
 that is from another publisher and well 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.170
 really liked it well and all that but I 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.319
 I would not buy it 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.989
 in the next book he won the 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.599
 contest that he did go and on his channel 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.099
 that I'll leave it in the information and it's 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.290
 when you go to our in google 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.230
 the enjoyment of the river sÃ¡nchez chat 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.069
 editorial 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.480
 this is the cover and the back cover is 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.140
 it was made with the other books but it is 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.599
 that has finished me and good made the 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.700
 contest for a month or so and the 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.990
 results what was seen that were given 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.660
 make 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.760
 two weeks or three weeks good no more 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.370
 Of course the contest was held in July 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.350
 so he will have done almost two months 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.170
 the contest and two weeks ago or three 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.300
 that gave the results and well then to 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.540
 it seems to be a book in a book of 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.130
 short stories and we have done that 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.720
 He did not like it that much 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.760
 they did a little bit but I'll have to 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.650
 read it before and finally the two 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.890
 books that I'm going to show you I bought it 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.750
 in a bookstore that I went to in Portugal 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.970
 it was expressly to the bookstore and I passed 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.030
 all morning that with my sister and with 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.350
 a teacher in number the institute that 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.330
 there is in my town that by the way is a 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.700
 Very nice woman took us to her 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.010
 because he knows that we really like the 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.940
 reading and I knew that she loves the 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.970
 success and the truth is that it is 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.740
 awesome you enter the bookstore and 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.170
 it's all in books books by all 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.270
 parts books on the floor in the bookshelf 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.270
 everywhere is incredible the 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:55.480
 owner will be about 80 years old and 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.640
 I think they are the books they carry with 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.170
 all of life with that the book in a 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.730
 second-hand bookstore so the 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.870
 people are leaving in the books the going 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.540
 buying is going to take them 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.790
 go back to give them anything and it has been 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.260
 great everything almost everyone is in English or 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.360
 if not in German 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.170
 I think there are almost none in Spanish 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.790
 or very few and well, my brother 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.579
 and I left a few in plan 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.380
 we sold and I think they are possibly 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:24.280
 the only ones but little in Spain 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.940
 from the bookstore and I bought my for you 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.540
 of red molles 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.940
 is from penguin brandon and I love this 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.040
 edition is to say the Spanish I do not like 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.550
 absolutely nothing seems horrible to me 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.350
 but this one I love is super pretty 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.470
 I think 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:46.800
 and it is obviously in English you have me 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.990
 could read because I have other readings 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.460
 pending from publishers and books that 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.800
 they have been catching for quite some time 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.870
 a moment but I'm looking forward to start 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.970
 with reading because he can not buy me 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.430
 free to Spanish and this I think was 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.350
 five euros or so if it was 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.720
 five euros extra very cheap and had a 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.820
 a lot of desire to buy it that's another 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:10.200
 of the characteristics of the site that the 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:12.600
 books are very cheap in so I think 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.550
 which is in carboeiro upload a photo to 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.330
 instagram and the name you have it out there 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:20.220
 so good if you pass by there 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.980
 you lose the bookstore of true aunt john 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.500
 from nicholas sparks that by the way 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.970
 I also like editing a lot 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.460
 cover page 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.900
 then great is also pocket 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.190
 because almost the entire book were from 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.920
 pocket 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.230
 enzo that it looks beautiful love is 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.120
 super nice has a lyrics a little bit 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.220
 girl but I'm still looking forward 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.780
 start with this reading because the 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.310
 movie I loved in a story 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.630
 super pretty nicholas sparks 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.630
 I think he writes a way 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:51.810
 It is very personal and prices have some 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:54.390
 Most beautiful books I do not know the truth 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:58.680
 I really want to read this because 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:06:00.480
 I think I read something I read, I think the 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.970
 half of the last nicholas song 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.010
 sparks and I was really looking for that 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.020
 book instead of this one but since I was not 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.790
 and they had everything but really all 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.500
 nicholas books sparks even 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.820
 repeated I said well I'm going to 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.660
 buy fun since it was a number 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.640
 read and here I have it and soon it will fall 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.550
 because they really are a desire 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.500
 abysmal to read this book and up 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.570
 here the video is not very long since it is 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.580
 a bucolic I do not usually have many 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:28.950
 readings because in the end they go 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.750
 accumulating I ask for few things I buy 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.730
 few things because that's why in the end 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.830
 accumulate and I do not the terminals I have a 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.720
 book on the shelf that will lead as 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.889
 a year or half a year and still not have me 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.189
 read 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:43.020
 Well, in the description box 

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:47.240
 I leave the review and we see in a 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.240
 next video goodbye
