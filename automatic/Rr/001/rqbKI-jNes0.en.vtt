been making this point for a couple

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.000 
been making this point for a couple
years<00:03:05.489> now<00:03:05.760> about<00:03:06.599> how<00:03:06.629> President<00:03:07.560> Obama<00:03:07.739> even

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
years now about how President Obama even

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.190 
years now about how President Obama even
though<00:03:08.069> he<00:03:08.189> ordered<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.609> surge<00:03:08.879> never<00:03:09.810> once

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
though he ordered the surge never once

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.170 
though he ordered the surge never once
came<00:03:10.500> out<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:10.829> defended<00:03:11.340> his<00:03:11.489> own<00:03:11.760> foreign

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
came out and defended his own foreign

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.390 
came out and defended his own foreign
policy<00:03:12.209> when<00:03:12.720> it<00:03:12.750> came<00:03:12.989> to<00:03:13.139> Afghanistan<00:03:13.829> and<00:03:14.010> I

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
policy when it came to Afghanistan and I

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.160 
policy when it came to Afghanistan and I
think<00:03:14.609> that<00:03:14.790> part<00:03:15.060> of<00:03:15.120> it<00:03:15.209> it's<00:03:15.389> all<00:03:15.900> part<00:03:16.109> of

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
think that part of it it's all part of
