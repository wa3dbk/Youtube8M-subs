 they are so far 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.079

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.510
 chains in silver and purple 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:20.460
 comes the coat back that I 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:23.700
 transparent in purple or purple 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.849
 and he came with this little cap 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.410
 also in black and has a detail there 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.260

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.659
 chain 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.659
 this is for spectra I bought also 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.720
 these animals 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.900
 a little friend who is subscribed in my 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.270
 channel asked me why I blue lagoon 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.700
 has a seahorse I wonder the 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:54.210
 mark and the truth I did not remember what 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.500
 brand was then here is the brand not 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.950
 I know if he is present in the country of 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.950
 your 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:06.220
 It's very soft, it has a little heart nearby 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.270
 of the tail I bought this also that this 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.270
 for me spectra 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.410
 there is your heart I will customize a 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.410
 little bit so it looks more like your 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.410
 blue 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:26.300
 I bought this lion and the lion in color 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.650
 pink that is for me a sphere because 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.700
 we get it because the sphere has this 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.959
 complex to always believe the best 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.160
 then I thought that this little lion 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:39.750
 it was very good to his personality 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.750
 I bought this monkey 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.530
 I'm still not sure which of them is 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:48.590
 I 'm going to give it because they are the little animals 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.590
 so they're in bed I know that out there 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.740

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.930
 I also usually have a 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.000

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.480

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.480
 webber 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.909

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:10.670

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.350
 material that is imitation leather 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.060
 I really would have loved it to be 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:24.100
 in black but the collection went like this in 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:28.350
 cream or persimmon 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.350
 I bought it for this maybe you can see it 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:38.540

 it's a bit big, my guys show 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.280

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.430
