00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.250
 good are welcome today we are going to 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.240
 draw a pumpkin and for that we're going to 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.520
 start with an inverted l and from here the 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.880
 let's make the pumpkin stick and 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.850
 we start with a semicircle on one side and 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.870
 another semicircle in this way and another 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.450
 semicircle more and here we complete it 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.360
 in the first one by ashoka and another 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:05.670
 semicircle and we finished the pumpkin 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:07.830
 let me put a little bit of it and now 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.760
 It looks more like a pumpkin and a little leaf 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.729
 also and here is now let's paint 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.760
 the pumpkin so that it has a 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.860
 shadow we will not start with a color 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:26.170
 solid that is the orange color that 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:29.530
 I chose here and we are going to color around 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:33.090
 three parts of the pumpkin we are going to do 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.580
 two of the segments of the pumpkin 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.540
 colored in the dark orange color and 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:43.450
 we are going to leave a part blank for 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:47.590
 so we can color it 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:50.289
 with a much lighter yellow color 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.320
 so that it seems until the sun is 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.620
 hitting that side of the pumpkin and here 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.610
 is 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.740
 and that truth now let's color the 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.500
 shadow of the pumpkin in the part of 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.350
 down and as you can see I'm trying 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.710
 to give it the same shape as the pumpkin 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.600
 has in the shade and we are trying to 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.720
 that in the part where more 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.680
 where more hits the sun there is less shadow 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:23.670
 and where it's darkest 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.660
 the orange color then we make believe 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.030
 like the shadow is over there 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.330
 now let's color the stem and what 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.310
 let's color dark green and 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.250
 let's leave a portion blank and 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.100
 let's do the same with the sheet now 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:44.470
 Color moss with light green color and 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.470
 already here we finish the drawing
