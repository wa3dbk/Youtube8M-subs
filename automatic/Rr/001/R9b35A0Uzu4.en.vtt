to<00:00:54.449> actually<00:00:54.989> pair<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.309> if<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:57.000> and

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
to actually pair it so if it is on and

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.410 
to actually pair it so if it is on and
it<00:00:57.719> has<00:00:57.899> only<00:00:58.079> one<00:00:58.320> button<00:00:58.590> on<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.820> left<00:01:00.239> side

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
it has only one button on the left side

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.399 
it has only one button on the left side
here<00:01:00.690> next<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.609> microUSB<00:01:02.609> charger<00:01:03.409> so

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
here next to the microUSB charger so

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.490 
here next to the microUSB charger so
when<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.640> will<00:01:05.790> show<00:01:05.939> up<00:01:06.060> on

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.980 
meantime I can tell you that I have a
test<00:01:22.799> tag<00:01:23.040> here<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> very<00:01:24.780> simple

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
test tag here this is a very simple

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.310 
test tag here this is a very simple
plastic<00:01:25.470> card<00:01:25.950> which<00:01:26.759> has<00:01:26.970> an<00:01:27.210> RFID<00:01:27.509> chip<00:01:27.810> bail

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
plastic card which has an RFID chip bail

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.179 
plastic card which has an RFID chip bail
ten<00:01:28.880> so<00:01:30.110> as<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.380> can<00:01:31.530> see<00:01:31.740> we<00:01:32.040> already

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
ten so as you can see we already

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.319 
ten so as you can see we already
connected<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.030> let<00:01:33.270> me<00:01:33.540> go<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:34.229> file<00:01:34.680> maker<00:01:35.329> to

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
connected so let me go to file maker to

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:47.040 
connected so let me go to file maker to
test<00:01:36.619> scanning

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.420 

I<00:01:47.140> will<00:01:47.770> make<00:01:47.920> a<00:01:47.950> new<00:01:48.310> record<00:01:48.760> and<00:01:50.160> click<00:01:51.160> into

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
I will make a new record and click into

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.660 
I will make a new record and click into
a<00:01:51.460> serial<00:01:51.820> number

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.419 

so<00:01:56.670> now<00:01:57.479> I'm<00:01:57.960> going<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.640> tap<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.789> card<00:02:01.070> and<00:02:02.070> as

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
so now I'm going to tap the card and as

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.330 
so now I'm going to tap the card and as
you<00:02:02.549> can<00:02:02.670> see<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.119> over<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.420> scanned<00:02:04.219> or<00:02:05.219> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
you can see it over a scanned or the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.880 
you can see it over a scanned or the
digits<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.729> we<00:02:05.850> needed<00:02:07.879> so<00:02:09.649> that<00:02:10.649> concludes

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
digits that we needed so that concludes

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.210 
digits that we needed so that concludes
the<00:02:11.430> video<00:02:12.150> introduction<00:02:13.019> of<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.500> RFID

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220
