well I recently took delivery on a new
path<00:00:03.510> Lee<00:00:03.840> governor<00:00:04.319> bike<00:00:04.560> I<00:00:04.799> thought<00:00:05.009> we'd

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
path Lee governor bike I thought we'd

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.099 
path Lee governor bike I thought we'd
take<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.310> quick<00:00:05.609> trip<00:00:06.359> around<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.660> bike<00:00:06.870> and

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
take a quick trip around the bike and

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.930 
take a quick trip around the bike and
show<00:00:07.919> us<00:00:07.980> some<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.250> features<00:00:08.280> off

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
show us some of the features off

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.790 
show us some of the features off
it's<00:00:09.570> an<00:00:09.660> overview<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.019> it<00:00:10.170> you<00:00:10.230> can<00:00:10.380> see<00:00:10.559> the

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
it's an overview of it you can see the

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.660 
it's an overview of it you can see the
frame<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.490> built<00:00:12.480> in<00:00:12.719> an<00:00:13.019> old<00:00:13.170> 1930s<00:00:14.099> era<00:00:14.250> style

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.620 
long wheelbase the head tube and seat
tube<00:00:20.460> are<00:00:20.609> about<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.880> same<00:00:21.090> angle<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.480> think

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
tube are about the same angle I think

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.470 
tube are about the same angle I think
they're<00:00:21.750> both<00:00:21.840> 68<00:00:22.730> long<00:00:23.730> Forks<00:00:24.090> with<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.269> lot<00:00:24.449> of

for them by Reynolds in Birmingham they
don't<00:00:45.300> really<00:00:45.510> make<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.809> anymore<00:00:46.079> but<00:00:46.800> they

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
don't really make it anymore but they

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.180 
don't really make it anymore but they
want<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:47.250> correct<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.390> period<00:00:48.750> and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.550 
movement coming out of the back ends in
several<00:01:08.280> days<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.520> riding<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.090> far<00:01:09.560> the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
several days of riding it so far the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.710 
several days of riding it so far the
stays<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.790> back<00:01:11.970> are<00:01:12.180> built<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.479> what<00:01:12.600> they

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
stays in the back are built in what they

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.929 
stays in the back are built in what they
call<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> bottle<00:01:13.560> top<00:01:13.799> design<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.670> see<00:01:14.820> how

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
call a bottle top design you can see how

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.249 
call a bottle top design you can see how
the<00:01:15.000> top<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.450> states<00:01:15.689> kind<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.020> look<00:01:16.140> like

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
the top of the states kind of look like

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.980 
the top of the states kind of look like
a<00:01:16.290> bottle<00:01:16.500> there<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.670> chain<00:01:18.210> stays<00:01:18.479> are

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
a bottle there the chain stays are

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.170 
a bottle there the chain stays are
basically<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.799> same<00:01:19.830> now<00:01:20.430> interestingly<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
basically the same now interestingly the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.330 
basically the same now interestingly the
chain<00:01:21.869> stays<00:01:22.110> are<00:01:22.380> braised<00:01:22.680> on<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.130> frame

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
chain stays are braised on to the frame

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.490 
chain stays are braised on to the frame
while<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.090> seats<00:01:24.270> days<00:01:24.479> aren't<00:01:24.780> that's<00:01:25.320> how

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
while the seats days aren't that's how

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.390 
while the seats days aren't that's how
they<00:01:25.619> used<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.860> do<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.240> why<00:01:28.130> I'll<00:01:29.130> walk<00:01:29.280> you

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
they used to do it why I'll walk you

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.609 
they used to do it why I'll walk you
around<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.640> front<00:01:30.049> you<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:31.140> see<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.380> fork

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
around the front you can see the fork

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.429 
around the front you can see the fork
has<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.340> old<00:01:32.840> tubular<00:01:33.840> fork<00:01:34.049> crown<00:01:34.259> which<00:01:34.409> is

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
has a a old tubular fork crown which is

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.380 
has a a old tubular fork crown which is
basically<00:01:34.950> just<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.310> piece<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.490> frame<00:01:36.240> tubing

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
basically just a piece of frame tubing

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.130 
basically just a piece of frame tubing
onto<00:01:38.110> which<00:01:38.260> the<00:01:38.470> fork<00:01:38.770> legs<00:01:39.729> are<00:01:40.030> braised<00:01:40.360> you

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
onto which the fork legs are braised you

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.740 
onto which the fork legs are braised you

them<00:01:53.470> around<00:01:53.640> lift<00:01:54.640> them<00:01:54.759> up<00:01:54.940> to<00:01:55.000> get<00:01:55.270> a<00:01:55.330> more

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
them around lift them up to get a more

them around lift them up to get a more
upright<00:01:55.869> position<00:01:56.470> this<00:01:57.100> is<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:58.090> kind<00:01:58.300> of

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
upright position this is the kind of

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.170 
upright position this is the kind of
racier<00:01:59.110> look<00:01:59.380> which<00:01:59.650> which<00:02:00.100> I<00:02:00.220> like<00:02:00.460> so<00:02:00.790> I've
