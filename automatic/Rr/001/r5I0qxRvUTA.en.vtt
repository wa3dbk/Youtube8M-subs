 Italy 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.920
 the battle is raging to reach 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.930
 destroy the gustav line defended by 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.460
 herself world 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.290
 it will take four operations to the allies 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.439
 to get hold of the ride

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.290
 to take rome 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.230
 70 years later the reaction body

 light armor surrendered on this 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.109
 place steeped in history in order to 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.269
 practice planning an operation 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:48.749
 based on historical data from 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:48.749
 this battle 

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:53.260
 coming to the field allows 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.730
 to raise the level and move from 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.559
 level of knowledge at the 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.989
 understanding of the different aspects of 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.879
 this commitment is therefore the the does it 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.559
 to have both the staff of the 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.730
 rapid reaction headquarters 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.740
 France and the 3rd Light Brigade 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.770
 armored allowed me to have 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.930
 different levels of approach that we're going 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.900
 say serve the educational expectations of 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.840
 each one this exercise of reflection and 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.360
 planning has engaged 140 allied 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.490
 Nato Staff 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.710
 each nation present could draw inspiration 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.570
 of the offensive conducted at the time a 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.390
 common teaching that facilitates the 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.750
 inter - allied cooperation working all 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.880
 together as a weapon and so it'll be 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.650
 maybe in the future an army 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:43.540
