00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.910
 Guarcello chest does not make sense 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.290
 guys this is the xiview project 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.239
 because it does not know the second of the project 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.040
 silvio on the waste in short the mega 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.590
 silvio project there is a project that has 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.270
 created the youtuber which is called xilion 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.920
 I die and consists of say of 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.290
 publish a video where we say you do 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.940
 get to know your youtuber subscribers that 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.559
 like 1 the youtuber that follows those 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.660
 obviously not the famous ones because 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.390
 those famous simets with all but those 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.160
 let's say with in quotation marks relatively 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.580
 few subscribers that you would like to show 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.410
 to your and your skaters followers for 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.450
 so give the youtuber the opportunity 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.240
 a little smaller both to grow and if 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.950
 say more to show what writings 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.959
 you like it even if it is not mainstream e 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.600
 this video I sponsored 

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:25.819
 quotation marks three types of youtuber 11 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.220
 youtube or badly making videos like 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:29.869
 never understood a sniper mental 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.780
 he too always theater m 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.770
 and finally a clan we start from the youtube 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.409
 it's very normal that foo ends 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.750
 the youtube in normal quotation marks 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.090
 that anyway youtube is there and makes videos 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.610
 normal a bit like mine and it's called 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.439
 when when i think of you lately 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.020
 I started to learn about following well 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.600

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.009
 modest above all and diane person 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.509
 very sunny that you talk to us 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.369
 quietly whatever it is 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.539

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.159

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.319
 few able gowan I made a one 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.610
 against one that among other things that tore 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.769
 rumors on his channel that came out 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.230
 really fun starting 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.299
 obviously because I'm there watch 15 4 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.040
 can never miss then we pass to the dose 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.019
 for next dc of the sponsors for 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.400
 schooners sponsor because there 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.130
 i practically see what i do 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.970

 good guys and stay the rest family 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.359
 family is a crab started to follow 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.329
 like a week ago that Milan has 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:45.280
 marx fed to the manager I will march 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.239
 seen leg even if walmart is the first 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.000
 that the second ones are really me 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.799
 liked qua crasha magis houston is 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.139
 possible we are not a Romanist 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.239
 on facebook witches that leaves everything goes 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:57.100
 well here we are the place very meat 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.780
 also obviously almost all the members there 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.370
 I know most of us are know 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.720
 me so a pretty positive thing 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.670
 because you can talk about everything with them 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.760
 because they are also all the nice and 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.430
 then finally in addition to seeing clips that 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.799
 because if as really nice the clips 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.599
 who published in their montages 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.220
 my parents are also all seeing 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.900
 friendly and really very open for 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.329
 talk to any for any 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.680
 what with any person and time 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.599
 obviously they are managers of course 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.310
 free even there hard I never get lost 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.750
 manager inter something but for the lawyer 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.130
 no because I asked for it 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.750
 however, I asked the correct ones 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.849
 because it really seemed like a good one 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.440
 team quite hard by the team e 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.560
 anyway all those that are undermining 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.670
 now they could be there I can decide 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.310
 so he spoke no 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.960
 a kind of video answers also given 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.640
 they say oh well thank you joys 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.250
 youtube also thank the same thing 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.320
 which he had not named appointed in 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.610
 this in this project and therefore 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.230
 say a decided to make the 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.850
 answer so much the scazzo to cod 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.590
 youtube because to appoint can 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.120
 decide whether or not to make answers 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.070
 obviously the clan doesn't do it on 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.840
 channel club maybe on a leader's dog 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.890
 on the dog of gameplay and then who wants it 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.530
 do it 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.140
 finally the last channel you guys are 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.270
 i recommend that i think john zhao del 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.880
 my friend joi the channel that it really is 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.380
 from all these it deserves more is not there 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.390
 because here from the cameras I like to 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.350
 more see to these three who is appointed 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.850
 the wenger channel started and obviously 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.700
 there are already those who know how you think they were 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.950
 very strong very strong and above all 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.620
 Italian thing you can see Italians 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.260
 in fact lately very rare and then 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.270
 I really want a lot of fun and every 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.010
 video the clip holder type however carries 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.980
 really good gameplay then the p 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.870
 a very strong person right now there 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.160
 I talk like youtuber and the person 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.440
 really strong induced and knows a lot 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.660
 well in videos and doc files is enough 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.400
 nice there is more wind for example 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.740
 original tv I made the lottery of 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.840
 rabbi where he says all his members of 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.360
 comment on the video and all those 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.890
 let's say every tot was more from one 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.410
 kind of station what will come out 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.880
 will go make a video together arati are 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.890
 arrived the pieces of the goblin that me 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.840
 they fed the elf to be 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.520
 I live the vacuum cleaner along the 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.770
 we go back cia speak again 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.860
 of data however as a person I have it 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.720
 very much known in quotes it 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.360
 trust me enough and obviously because 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.950
 we did danish df so we have 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.540
 had to know it a minimum and you know that 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.250
 sometimes I do call skype ma 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.530
 really a very good person a lot 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.060
 modest and nice and more or less and of the 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.010
 my own ideas ie think this 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.540
 almost to Naples for this it sucks 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.160
 that is, let's say even less my own 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.840
 ideas so i'm also pretty 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.210
 well then the film you saw 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.900
 I like the beginning inler given a 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.940
 couple of weeks goes however there credits 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.380
 liked even if not static one million 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.240
 of kinematics and means because more than 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.430
 Another clips and a clip is not just that 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.050
 you can make it last six hours anyway i 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.070
 guys I close the video here because 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.450
