00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
about it and so I decided to pick up

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.420 
about it and so I decided to pick up
another<00:00:41.670> copy<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.239> try<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.660> on<00:00:42.780> my<00:00:42.930> gh3<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
another copy and try it on my gh3 the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.040 
another copy and try it on my gh3 the
first<00:00:44.610> time<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.789> tried<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.390> was<00:00:45.570> on<00:00:45.750> a

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
first time I tried it it was on a

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.650 
first time I tried it it was on a
smaller<00:00:46.379> camera<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:48.270> shot<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.539> all

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
smaller camera and I shot it all

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.900 
smaller camera and I shot it all
handheld<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.469> just<00:00:49.649> had<00:00:49.800> really<00:00:50.280> terrible

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
handheld and just had really terrible

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
handheld and just had really terrible
results<00:00:51.300> with<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.920> so<00:00:53.449> one<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.629> things<00:00:54.809> I

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
results with it so one of the things I

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.680 
results with it so one of the things I
thought<00:00:55.170> about<00:00:56.000> when<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.030> went<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.360> use<00:00:57.539> this

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
thought about when I went to use this

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.200 
thought about when I went to use this
lens<00:00:57.930> again<00:00:58.109> was<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.980> it's<00:00:59.370> effectively<00:01:00.090> a

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
lens again was that it's effectively a

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.170 
lens again was that it's effectively a
600<00:01:00.840> millimeter<00:01:01.199> lens<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.399> decided<00:01:03.000> to

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
600 millimeter lens so I decided to

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.090 
600 millimeter lens so I decided to
treat<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.570> like<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.870> would<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.409> 600<00:01:05.010> millimeter

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
treat it like I would a 600 millimeter

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.789 
treat it like I would a 600 millimeter
lens<00:01:05.640> if<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.939> see<00:01:06.170> full-frame<00:01:07.170> 600

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
lens if you see full-frame 600

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.380 
lens if you see full-frame 600
millimeter<00:01:08.100> lens<00:01:08.340> you're<00:01:08.850> talking<00:01:09.150> about<00:01:09.240> a

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
millimeter lens you're talking about a

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.429 
millimeter lens you're talking about a
huge<00:01:09.810> heavy<00:01:10.680> lens<00:01:11.090> that<00:01:12.200> most<00:01:13.200> people

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
huge heavy lens that most people

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.109 
huge heavy lens that most people
wouldn't<00:01:13.619> even<00:01:13.710> consider<00:01:13.950> shooting<00:01:14.490> handheld

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
wouldn't even consider shooting handheld

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.270 
wouldn't even consider shooting handheld
so<00:01:15.619> first<00:01:16.619> thing<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.830> thought<00:01:16.950> about<00:01:17.009> was

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
so first thing I thought about was

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.609 
so first thing I thought about was
locking<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.700> down<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.000> tripod<00:01:18.409> okay<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.470> I

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
locking it down on a tripod okay so I

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.810 
locking it down on a tripod okay so I
got<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.130> guy<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:21.500> tripod<00:01:22.500> collar<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:23.670> is

great so now instead of the camera being
attached<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.290> tripod<00:01:52.530> now<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.009> lens<00:01:53.430> is

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
attached to the tripod now the lens is

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.600 
attached to the tripod now the lens is
actually<00:01:54.060> supported<00:01:54.570> by<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.720> tripod<00:01:55.229> and

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
actually supported by the tripod and

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.090 
actually supported by the tripod and
that<00:01:56.610> makes<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.909> huge<00:01:57.119> difference<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:58.100> you're

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
that makes a huge difference so you're

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.530 
that makes a huge difference so you're
going<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.280> get<00:01:59.399> sharper<00:01:59.759> results<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.360> way

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
going to get sharper results that way

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.889 
going to get sharper results that way
anyway<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:02.850> other<00:02:02.880> thing<00:02:03.210> about<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.479> long

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
anyway the other thing about a long

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.499 
anyway the other thing about a long
focal<00:02:04.170> length<00:02:04.350> lens<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.969> rule<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.360> thumb

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
focal length lens is the rule of thumb

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.990 
focal length lens is the rule of thumb
about<00:02:06.960> shutter<00:02:07.590> speed<00:02:07.920> which<00:02:08.489> is<00:02:08.520> basically

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
about shutter speed which is basically

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.460 
about shutter speed which is basically
you<00:02:09.179> want<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.390> keep<00:02:09.539> your<00:02:09.629> shutter<00:02:09.929> speed<00:02:10.020> at

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
you want to keep your shutter speed at

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.309 
you want to keep your shutter speed at
or<00:02:10.860> above<00:02:11.310> your<00:02:11.879> focal<00:02:12.239> length<00:02:12.390> so<00:02:13.020> in<00:02:13.170> this

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
or above your focal length so in this

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.880 
or above your focal length so in this
case

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
case

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.800 
case
ideally<00:02:14.340> you'd<00:02:14.490> want<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.760> shoot<00:02:14.940> this<00:02:15.120> lens<00:02:15.450> at

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
ideally you'd want to shoot this lens at

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.380 
ideally you'd want to shoot this lens at
a<00:02:15.870> six<00:02:16.620> hundredth<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.100> second<00:02:17.520> or<00:02:17.640> faster<00:02:17.970> in

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
a six hundredth of a second or faster in

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.870 
a six hundredth of a second or faster in
order<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.750> get<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.020> sharpest<00:02:19.410> results<00:02:19.880> if

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
order to get the sharpest results if

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.400 
order to get the sharpest results if
you're<00:02:21.120> locked<00:02:21.330> down<00:02:21.510> on<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.750> tripod<00:02:21.990> you<00:02:22.380> can

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
you're locked down on a tripod you can

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.080 
you're locked down on a tripod you can
get<00:02:22.709> away<00:02:22.800> with<00:02:23.069> slower<00:02:23.280> shutter<00:02:23.400> speeds<00:02:23.850> sure

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
get away with slower shutter speeds sure

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.910 
get away with slower shutter speeds sure
but<00:02:24.390> if<00:02:24.569> you're<00:02:24.720> shooting<00:02:25.050> at<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.410> thirtieth<00:02:25.830> of

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.350 
shoot at 600 millimeter effective focal
length<00:02:31.050> then<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.459> chances<00:02:32.850> of<00:02:32.880> getting<00:02:33.030> tack

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.170 
length then the chances of getting tack
sharp<00:02:33.600> shots<00:02:33.870> go<00:02:34.080> way<00:02:34.350> down<00:02:34.850> so<00:02:35.850> keep<00:02:36.030> your

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
sharp shots go way down so keep your

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.970 
sharp shots go way down so keep your
shutter<00:02:36.360> speed<00:02:36.420> up<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:36.959> lock<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.709> thing<00:02:37.860> down

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
shutter speed up and lock the thing down

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.470 
shutter speed up and lock the thing down
on<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.190> tripod<00:02:38.580> I<00:02:39.110> got<00:02:40.110> really<00:02:40.410> nice<00:02:40.620> results

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
on a tripod I got really nice results

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.199 
on a tripod I got really nice results
shooting<00:02:42.480> stills<00:02:42.780> shooting<00:02:43.290> video<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:44.489> did

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
shooting stills shooting video I did

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.300 
shooting stills shooting video I did
find<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.810> keeping<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.410> image<00:02:46.890> stabilizer

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
find that keeping the image stabilizer

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.000 
find that keeping the image stabilizer
on<00:02:47.700> during<00:02:48.120> video<00:02:48.300> helped<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.500> keep<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.860> little

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
on during video helped to keep a little

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.310 
on during video helped to keep a little
bit<00:02:50.100> of<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.370> wobble<00:02:50.790> down<00:02:50.970> if<00:02:51.239> I<00:02:51.420> was<00:02:51.630> if<00:02:52.110> the

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
bit of the wobble down if I was if the

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.720 
bit of the wobble down if I was if the
wind<00:02:52.500> was<00:02:52.680> blowing<00:02:53.010> for<00:02:53.220> example<00:02:53.610> or

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
wind was blowing for example or

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:54.410 
wind was blowing for example or
something<00:02:54.000> like<00:02:54.090> that

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
something like that

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.020 
something like that
so<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:56.070> that<00:02:56.430> kind<00:02:56.640> of<00:02:56.700> surprised<00:02:57.000> me

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
so that that kind of surprised me

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.220 
so that that kind of surprised me
because<00:02:57.330> normally<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.720> turn<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.050> image

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
because normally you turn the image

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.640 
because normally you turn the image
stabilizer<00:02:58.650> off<00:02:58.950> on<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.340> tripod<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:01.500> other

stabilizer off on a tripod the other

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.199 
stabilizer off on a tripod the other
thing<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:01.950> noticed<00:03:02.010> was<00:03:02.400> that<00:03:02.459> my<00:03:02.820> heavier

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
thing I noticed was that my heavier

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.290 
thing I noticed was that my heavier
tripod<00:03:03.780> was<00:03:04.350> pretty<00:03:05.040> necessary<00:03:05.310> for<00:03:06.060> this

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
tripod was pretty necessary for this

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.330 
tripod was pretty necessary for this
long<00:03:06.570> focal<00:03:06.900> length<00:03:07.050> I<00:03:07.410> tried<00:03:07.769> it<00:03:07.950> with<00:03:08.100> my

long focal length I tried it with my

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.990

smaller travel tripod and the little
skinny<00:03:12.209> legs<00:03:12.540> just<00:03:12.900> didn't<00:03:13.260> isolate<00:03:13.709> the

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
skinny legs just didn't isolate the

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.550 
skinny legs just didn't isolate the
vibration<00:03:14.370> enough<00:03:14.670> for<00:03:15.209> shooting<00:03:15.690> at<00:03:15.840> 600

it in a little bit from the maximum 300

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.910 
it in a little bit from the maximum 300
millimetres<00:03:45.299> so<00:03:45.329> if<00:03:45.570> you're<00:03:45.690> shooting<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:46.110> 250

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
millimetres so if you're shooting a 250

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.530 
millimetres so if you're shooting a 250
millimeter<00:03:47.310> setting<00:03:47.730> or<00:03:47.910> somewhere<00:03:48.480> in

millimeter setting or somewhere in

millimeter setting or somewhere in
between<00:03:48.570> it<00:03:49.230> gets<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.560> little<00:03:49.799> sharper<00:03:50.190> but<00:03:50.640> I

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
between it gets a little sharper but I

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.080 
between it gets a little sharper but I
got<00:03:50.910> several<00:03:51.390> tack<00:03:51.810> sharp<00:03:52.170> shots<00:03:52.709> all<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:54.000> way

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
got several tack sharp shots all the way

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.690 
got several tack sharp shots all the way
racked<00:03:54.360> out<00:03:54.570> at<00:03:54.750> 300<00:03:55.200> millimetres<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:55.950> wide

that<00:04:00.000> you<00:04:00.090> can<00:04:00.299> go<00:04:00.480> with<00:04:00.750> this<00:04:01.170> lens<00:04:01.470> at<00:04:01.799> the

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
that you can go with this lens at the

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.400 
that you can go with this lens at the
300<00:04:02.459> millimeter<00:04:02.790> focal<00:04:02.970> length<00:04:03.299> so<00:04:03.930> stop<00:04:04.230> down

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
300 millimeter focal length so stop down

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.199 
300 millimeter focal length so stop down
to<00:04:04.560> f/8<00:04:04.890> a<00:04:05.250> little<00:04:05.790> sharper<00:04:06.209> sure<00:04:06.570> but

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
to f/8 a little sharper sure but

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.370 
to f/8 a little sharper sure but
shooting<00:04:09.209> it<00:04:09.299> wide<00:04:09.450> open<00:04:09.480> and<00:04:10.049> having<00:04:10.170> that

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
shooting it wide open and having that

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.530 
shooting it wide open and having that
extra<00:04:10.650> stop<00:04:10.950> of<00:04:11.130> shutter<00:04:11.340> speed<00:04:11.670> really<00:04:12.299> did

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
extra stop of shutter speed really did

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.930 
extra stop of shutter speed really did
make<00:04:12.660> a<00:04:12.720> difference<00:04:12.930> in<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.290> couple<00:04:13.410> of<00:04:13.590> cases

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
make a difference in a couple of cases

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.789 
make a difference in a couple of cases
so<00:04:14.940> I<00:04:15.329> don't<00:04:15.690> think<00:04:15.870> that<00:04:15.989> that's<00:04:16.169> necessarily

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
so I don't think that that's necessarily

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.650 
so I don't think that that's necessarily
imperative<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.609> get<00:04:17.760> good<00:04:18.000> results<00:04:18.419> from<00:04:18.479> this

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
imperative to get good results from this

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.630 
imperative to get good results from this

all in all I'm really happy with it I'm
I<00:04:23.099> don't<00:04:23.789> hesitate<00:04:24.270> for<00:04:24.479> a<00:04:24.539> minute<00:04:24.810> to<00:04:24.900> use

a week of hard use in the rainforest at

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
put it through its paces and figured out

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.110 
put it through its paces and figured out
the<00:04:38.039> best<00:04:38.490> way<00:04:38.849> to<00:04:38.879> to<00:04:39.479> use<00:04:39.750> it<00:04:39.930> so<00:04:41.000> for<00:04:42.000> the

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
the best way to to use it so for the

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.869 
the best way to to use it so for the
size<00:04:42.360> and<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:42.930> weight<00:04:43.139> I<00:04:43.550> don't<00:04:44.550> think<00:04:44.759> you

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:44.879 
size and the weight I don't think you

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:46.399 
size and the weight I don't think you
can<00:04:45.090> beat<00:04:45.300> it<00:04:45.449> you<00:04:45.599> can<00:04:45.750> throw<00:04:45.900> this<00:04:46.110> in<00:04:46.169> with

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:46.409 
can beat it you can throw this in with

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:48.260 
can beat it you can throw this in with
