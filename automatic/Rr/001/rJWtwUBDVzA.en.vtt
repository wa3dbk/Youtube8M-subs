00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
farming some of the alternate equipment

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.009 
farming some of the alternate equipment
in<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.550> game<00:00:11.730> this<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.240> basically<00:00:12.630> last<00:00:12.840> piece

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
in the game this is basically last piece

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.440 
in the game this is basically last piece
I<00:00:13.110> have<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.349> do<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.710> as<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.639> can<00:00:14.759> see<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:15.150> have

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
I have to do and as you can see I have

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.200 
I have to do and as you can see I have
luck<00:00:15.809> equipment<00:00:16.560> equipped<00:00:17.190> on<00:00:17.430> everybody's

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
luck equipment equipped on everybody's

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.660 
luck equipment equipped on everybody's
in<00:00:18.449> my<00:00:18.539> party<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.830> all<00:00:20.039> three<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.369> these<00:00:20.460> people

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
in my party so all three of these people

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.910 
in my party so all three of these people
have<00:00:21.029> over<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.510> hundred<00:00:21.779> luck<00:00:22.170> which<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.650> which

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
have over a hundred luck which is which

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.009 
have over a hundred luck which is which
is<00:00:22.949> good<00:00:23.220> because<00:00:23.670> actually<00:00:24.600> actually

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
is good because actually actually

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.330 
is good because actually actually
honestly<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.619> think<00:00:25.710> it's<00:00:25.949> pretty<00:00:26.160> worthless

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
honestly I think it's pretty worthless

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.029 
honestly I think it's pretty worthless
because<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:27.320> don't<00:00:28.320> think<00:00:28.500> luck<00:00:28.619> has<00:00:28.800> anything

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
because I don't think luck has anything

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.830 
because I don't think luck has anything
to<00:00:29.160> do<00:00:29.400> with<00:00:29.429> drop<00:00:29.730> rate<00:00:29.970> whatsoever<00:00:30.539> it

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
to do with drop rate whatsoever it

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.810 
to do with drop rate whatsoever it
definitely<00:00:31.769> affects<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.309> critical<00:00:32.640> hit<00:00:32.790> rate

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
definitely affects the critical hit rate

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.370 
definitely affects the critical hit rate
and<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.360> definitely<00:00:33.809> affects<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.170> deal

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
and it definitely affects this deal

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.950 
and it definitely affects this deal
right<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:35.010> for<00:00:35.430> sure<00:00:35.460> I've<00:00:36.420> tested<00:00:36.840> that

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
right that is for sure I've tested that

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.200 
right that is for sure I've tested that
extensively<00:00:37.500> but<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.190> doesn't<00:00:38.579> seem<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.090> be

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
extensively but it doesn't seem to be

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.670 
extensively but it doesn't seem to be
affecting<00:00:39.600> what<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.780> get<00:00:39.960> from<00:00:40.079> drops<00:00:40.350> at<00:00:40.559> all

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
affecting what I get from drops at all

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.970 
affecting what I get from drops at all
which<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.100> kind<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.399> annoying<00:00:42.170> but<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.200> have<00:00:43.860> it

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
which is kind of annoying but I have it

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.529 
which is kind of annoying but I have it
there<00:00:44.100> anyway<00:00:44.430> just<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.820> case<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.300> doesn't

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
there anyway just in case it doesn't

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.119 
there anyway just in case it doesn't
really<00:00:45.629> make<00:00:45.840> any<00:00:45.899> difference<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.860> set<00:00:47.100> up

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
really make any difference and I set up

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.610 
really make any difference and I set up
but<00:00:47.520> yet<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:47.940> guy<00:00:48.120> we're<00:00:48.809> gonna<00:00:48.899> try<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.410> get

an item from him it's my opinion Kafka's
best<00:00:53.760> piece<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.120> equipment<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.920> just

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
best piece of equipment and it's just

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.060 
best piece of equipment and it's just
been<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> pain<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.329> get<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.719> gave<00:00:58.320> up<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> while<00:00:58.800> ago

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
been a pain to get I gave up a while ago

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.500 
been a pain to get I gave up a while ago
cuz<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.399> haven't<00:00:59.550> been<00:00:59.730> getting<00:00:59.969> lucky<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
cuz I haven't been getting lucky the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.840 
cuz I haven't been getting lucky the
drop<00:01:01.020> rate<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.410> game<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.890> horrendously

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
drop rate in this game is horrendously

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.899 
drop rate in this game is horrendously
low<00:01:03.470> but<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.129> basically<00:01:05.369> what

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
low but this is this is basically what

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.880 
low but this is this is basically what
what<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.390> found<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.750> be<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.990> fastest<00:01:07.350> way<00:01:07.500> to

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
what I found to be the fastest way to

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.859 
what I found to be the fastest way to
beat<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.189> battle<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:09.119> goes<00:01:09.630> by<00:01:09.840> pretty

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
beat this battle and it goes by pretty

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.060 
beat this battle and it goes by pretty
fast<00:01:10.460> but<00:01:11.460> no<00:01:12.260> didn't<00:01:13.260> get<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.439> drop<00:01:13.590> again<00:01:13.860> I

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
fast but no didn't get the drop again I

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.039 
fast but no didn't get the drop again I
imagine<00:01:14.970> I'll<00:01:15.090> be<00:01:15.210> doing<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.540> for<00:01:15.810> several

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
imagine I'll be doing this for several

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.840 
imagine I'll be doing this for several
more<00:01:16.259> hours<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.890> still<00:01:17.250> won't<00:01:17.369> get<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> drop

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
more hours and still won't get the drop

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.039 
more hours and still won't get the drop
because<00:01:18.000> I've<00:01:18.240> been<00:01:18.330> doing<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.689> for<00:01:18.869> several

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
because I've been doing it for several

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.130 
because I've been doing it for several
before<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:20.040> haven't<00:01:20.490> gotten<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:21.140> yeah

inspired to make a video of a certain

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.270 
inspired to make a video of a certain
optional<00:01:28.490> big<00:01:29.490> hairy<00:01:29.909> bug<00:01:30.180> fight<00:01:31.250> but<00:01:32.250> I

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
optional big hairy bug fight but I

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.770 
optional big hairy bug fight but I
didn't<00:01:32.579> have<00:01:32.670> any<00:01:32.820> safe<00:01:33.000> States<00:01:33.299> over<00:01:33.570> there

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
didn't have any safe States over there
