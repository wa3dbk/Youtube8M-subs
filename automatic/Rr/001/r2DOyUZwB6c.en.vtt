general areas occasionally you'll have

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.560 
general areas occasionally you'll have

people spawning down and out in the in

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.840 
people spawning down and out in the in
the<00:03:02.630> ramps<00:03:03.170> leading<00:03:03.350> down<00:03:03.710> to<00:03:03.770> be<00:03:04.190> but<00:03:04.820> that

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
the ramps leading down to be but that

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.880 
the ramps leading down to be but that
rarely<00:03:05.270> happens<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:06.110> it<00:03:06.200> only<00:03:06.320> happens<00:03:06.770> in

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
rarely happens and it only happens in

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.820 
rarely happens and it only happens in
ground<00:03:07.190> war<00:03:07.490> i<00:03:07.520> believe<00:03:08.320> and<00:03:09.320> it<00:03:09.650> basically

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
ground war i believe and it basically

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.610 
ground war i believe and it basically
only<00:03:10.220> happens<00:03:10.610> when<00:03:10.700> there's<00:03:10.970> no<00:03:11.200> spawn<00:03:12.200> spots

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620

only happens when there's no spawn spots

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
always I guess you could say there's

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.530 
always I guess you could say there's
always<00:03:30.160> enough<00:03:31.160> spawn<00:03:31.459> spots<00:03:31.730> for<00:03:32.060> people<00:03:32.390> to

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
always enough spawn spots for people to

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.840 
always enough spawn spots for people to
spawn<00:03:32.810> in<00:03:33.080> and<00:03:33.530> what<00:03:33.860> happens<00:03:34.190> in<00:03:34.340> ground<00:03:34.580> more

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
spawn in and what happens in ground more

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.460 
spawn in and what happens in ground more
especially<00:03:35.209> is<00:03:35.540> that<00:03:35.750> there's<00:03:35.989> just<00:03:36.050> so<00:03:36.320> many

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
especially is that there's just so many

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.640 
especially is that there's just so many
fucking<00:03:36.739> people<00:03:37.070> and<00:03:37.550> and<00:03:38.450> even<00:03:39.140> equipment

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
fucking people and and even equipment

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.620 
fucking people and and even equipment
I've<00:03:39.739> heard<00:03:39.980> if<00:03:40.190> equipment<00:03:40.940> is<00:03:41.060> in<00:03:41.209> the<00:03:41.300> way<00:03:41.480> of

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
I've heard if equipment is in the way of

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.360 
I've heard if equipment is in the way of
a<00:03:41.690> spawn<00:03:41.930> spots<00:03:42.230> nobody<00:03:42.739> will<00:03:42.860> spawn<00:03:43.130> there

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
a spawn spots nobody will spawn there

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.400 
a spawn spots nobody will spawn there
but<00:03:43.640> anyway<00:03:44.540> there's<00:03:44.750> so<00:03:44.870> many<00:03:44.989> people<00:03:45.200> that

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
but anyway there's so many people that

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.280 
but anyway there's so many people that
when<00:03:45.980> you<00:03:46.100> spawn<00:03:46.520> in<00:03:46.850> it<00:03:47.090> will<00:03:47.600> spawn<00:03:47.870> you<00:03:48.080> in<00:03:48.200> a

if this existed with 74 you the famas on

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.820 
if this existed with 74 you the famas on
most<00:05:17.180> maps<00:05:17.420> we<00:05:17.630> get<00:05:17.780> shit<00:05:18.050> on<00:05:18.080> it<00:05:18.380> is<00:05:18.590> so<00:05:18.800> cheap

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
most maps we get shit on it is so cheap

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.690 
most maps we get shit on it is so cheap
you<00:05:19.550> shoot<00:05:20.150> so<00:05:20.420> fast<00:05:20.780> and<00:05:21.140> if<00:05:22.040> even<00:05:22.400> if<00:05:22.580> you're

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
you shoot so fast and if even if you're

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.910 
you shoot so fast and if even if you're
lagging<00:05:22.970> it<00:05:23.300> really<00:05:23.570> does<00:05:23.720> compensate<00:05:24.440> for

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:24.920 
lagging it really does compensate for

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.520 
lagging it really does compensate for
your<00:05:25.240> bullet<00:05:26.240> lag<00:05:26.420> you<00:05:26.930> shoot<00:05:27.170> so<00:05:27.320> many

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
your bullet lag you shoot so many

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.080 
your bullet lag you shoot so many
bullets<00:05:27.980> that<00:05:28.250> you<00:05:28.760> know<00:05:28.880> it<00:05:28.940> doesn't

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
bullets that you know it doesn't

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.580 
bullets that you know it doesn't
increase<00:05:29.360> damage<00:05:29.600> but<00:05:29.900> the<00:05:29.960> fact<00:05:30.170> is<00:05:30.260> shooting

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
increase damage but the fact is shooting

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.880 
increase damage but the fact is shooting
like<00:05:30.800> bullets<00:05:31.250> what<00:05:31.460> three<00:05:31.760> or<00:05:31.790> four<00:05:32.000> times<00:05:32.150> as

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
like bullets what three or four times as

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.470 
like bullets what three or four times as
twice<00:05:33.890> or<00:05:34.130> three<00:05:34.430> times<00:05:34.460> as<00:05:34.790> fast<00:05:34.820> or<00:05:35.420> faster

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
twice or three times as fast or faster

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.820 
twice or three times as fast or faster
it<00:05:36.260> compensates<00:05:37.130> for<00:05:37.430> that<00:05:37.850> lag<00:05:38.180> and<00:05:38.540> in<00:05:38.900> the

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
it compensates for that lag and in the

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.100 
it compensates for that lag and in the
competitive<00:05:40.310> playlist<00:05:40.790> you<00:05:41.360> know<00:05:41.480> you<00:05:42.050> know
