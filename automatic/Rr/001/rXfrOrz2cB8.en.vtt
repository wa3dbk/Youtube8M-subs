00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
bit of zinc in it zinc I've found messes

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.090 
bit of zinc in it zinc I've found messes
up<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.450> sintering<00:01:21.810> process<00:01:21.950> when<00:01:22.950> you're

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
up the sintering process when you're

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.289 
up the sintering process when you're
making<00:01:23.540> making<00:01:24.540> clay<00:01:25.310> so<00:01:26.310> my<00:01:26.729> ratio<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.210> I

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
making making clay so my ratio that I

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.280 
making making clay so my ratio that I
found<00:01:27.540> works<00:01:27.750> best<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.280> about<00:01:29.280> three<00:01:29.549> parts

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
found works best is about three parts

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.640 
found works best is about three parts
powder<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.829> one<00:01:32.189> part<00:01:33.439> methylcellulose<00:01:34.439> by

powder to one part methylcellulose by

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.260 
powder to one part methylcellulose by
volume<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.549> we'll<00:01:35.670> go<00:01:35.759> ahead<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:35.909> mix<00:01:36.030> them<00:01:36.240> up

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
volume so we'll go ahead and mix them up

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.530 
volume so we'll go ahead and mix them up
I'll<00:01:36.540> put<00:01:36.689> my<00:01:36.810> mask<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.229> here<00:01:38.299> always<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.450> good

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
I'll put my mask on here always a good

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.580 
I'll put my mask on here always a good
idea<00:01:39.810> doesn't<00:01:39.990> really<00:01:40.200> make<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.530> much

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
idea doesn't really make that much

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.460 
idea doesn't really make that much
powder<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.430> use<00:01:42.030> an<00:01:42.180> n95<00:01:42.479> mask<00:01:42.990> with<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> little

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
powder I use an n95 mask with a little

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.200 
powder I use an n95 mask with a little
vent<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:43.979> cuz<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.549> feel<00:01:44.700> like<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:44.909> easier<00:01:45.119> to

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
vent just cuz I feel like it's easier to

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.889 
vent just cuz I feel like it's easier to
breathe<00:01:45.450> with<00:01:45.659> it

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:57.430 

so<00:01:49.189> all<00:01:50.189> makes

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.540 

you<00:01:58.440> definitely<00:01:58.800> don't<00:01:58.860> have<00:01:58.980> to<00:01:59.130> be<00:01:59.220> exact

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
you definitely don't have to be exact

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.280 
you definitely don't have to be exact
with<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:02.090> buddy<00:02:03.090> can<00:02:03.300> get<00:02:03.450> roughly<00:02:03.900> three<00:02:04.170> to

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
with it buddy can get roughly three to

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:12.200 
with it buddy can get roughly three to
one<00:02:09.920> threes<00:02:10.920> just<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.400> little<00:02:11.580> dollar<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:12.030> store

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.009 

yeah<00:02:31.580> so<00:02:32.319> about<00:02:33.319> three<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:33.769> one<00:02:33.920> there

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
yeah so about three to one there

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.030 
yeah so about three to one there
one<00:02:36.019> nice<00:02:36.170> thing<00:02:36.200> about<00:02:36.440> making<00:02:36.890> your<00:02:36.980> own

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
one nice thing about making your own

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.580 
one nice thing about making your own
metal<00:02:37.310> clay<00:02:37.489> is<00:02:37.549> that<00:02:37.879> the<00:02:38.060> cost<00:02:38.299> for<00:02:39.200> this<00:02:39.379> is

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
metal clay is that the cost for this is

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.170 
metal clay is that the cost for this is
about<00:02:39.769> one-fourth<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.250> cost<00:02:40.519> of<00:02:40.700> commercial

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
about one-fourth the cost of commercial

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.410 
about one-fourth the cost of commercial
clays<00:02:41.390> commercial<00:02:42.200> pays<00:02:42.349> come<00:02:42.560> in<00:02:42.680> about<00:02:43.420> 100

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
clays commercial pays come in about 100

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:52.240 
clays commercial pays come in about 100
gram<00:02:45.129> little<00:02:46.129> vials<00:02:46.629> and<00:02:47.709> a<00:02:48.790> pound<00:02:49.790> is<00:02:51.250> 453

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
gram little vials and a pound is 453

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.930 
gram little vials and a pound is 453
grams<00:02:53.140> so<00:02:54.140> you<00:02:54.230> can<00:02:54.560> see<00:02:54.739> that<00:02:54.980> you<00:02:55.519> know<00:02:55.640> a

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
grams so you can see that you know a

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.729 
grams so you can see that you know a
pound<00:02:56.269> of<00:02:56.390> this<00:02:56.480> that's<00:02:56.720> even<00:02:57.349> up<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.590> about

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
pound of this that's even up to about

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.899 
pound of this that's even up to about
$20<00:02:59.470> would<00:03:00.470> be<00:03:00.650> a<00:03:00.680> lot<00:03:01.099> cheaper<00:03:01.340> than<00:03:01.489> paying

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
$20 would be a lot cheaper than paying

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:06.430 
$20 would be a lot cheaper than paying
you<00:03:02.569> know<00:03:02.659> at<00:03:03.170> least<00:03:03.940> $20<00:03:04.940> for<00:03:05.360> 18<00:03:06.079> to<00:03:06.200> 20

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
you know at least $20 for 18 to 20

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.180 
you know at least $20 for 18 to 20
dollars<00:03:06.560> for<00:03:06.980> for<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.489> commercial<00:03:07.910> place<00:03:09.190> so

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
dollars for for the commercial place so

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.030 
dollars for for the commercial place so
I<00:03:10.220> think<00:03:10.459> it<00:03:10.670> cost<00:03:10.790> about<00:03:11.000> 1/4<00:03:11.359> of<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:12.440> cost<00:03:12.739> of

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
I think it cost about 1/4 of the cost of

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.039 
I think it cost about 1/4 of the cost of
buying<00:03:13.879> commercial<00:03:14.269> clays<00:03:14.599> and<00:03:14.780> I<00:03:14.840> think<00:03:14.989> you

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
buying commercial clays and I think you

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.930 
buying commercial clays and I think you
get<00:03:15.170> a<00:03:15.200> very<00:03:15.410> similar<00:03:15.680> result<00:03:15.980> so<00:03:16.730> you<00:03:16.819> just

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
get a very similar result so you just

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.009 
get a very similar result so you just
mix<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:17.269> up<00:03:17.390> mix<00:03:17.660> it<00:03:17.930> up<00:03:18.019> really<00:03:18.260> well<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.900> I'll

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
mix it up mix it up really well and I'll

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.210 
mix it up mix it up really well and I'll
show<00:03:21.170> you<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.290> couple<00:03:21.410> examples<00:03:21.560> of<00:03:22.069> things

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
show you a couple examples of things

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.240 
show you a couple examples of things
that<00:03:22.549> I<00:03:22.579> have<00:03:23.030> made<00:03:23.299> from<00:03:23.959> homemade<00:03:24.260> clay<00:03:24.530> you

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
that I have made from homemade clay you

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.869 
that I have made from homemade clay you
do<00:03:25.370> have<00:03:25.549> to<00:03:25.700> have<00:03:25.790> a<00:03:25.819> kill<00:03:26.120> I<00:03:26.840> use<00:03:27.769> a<00:03:27.879> Paragon

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
do have to have a kill I use a Paragon

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.759 
do have to have a kill I use a Paragon
kill<00:03:29.180> that<00:03:31.720> kind<00:03:32.720> of<00:03:32.750> dirty<00:03:32.989> inside<00:03:33.200> but<00:03:33.709> you

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
kill that kind of dirty inside but you

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.229 
kill that kind of dirty inside but you
can<00:03:33.859> see<00:03:34.010> some<00:03:34.190> pieces<00:03:34.370> that<00:03:34.579> I'm<00:03:34.819> in<00:03:35.060> the

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
can see some pieces that I'm in the

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.509 
can see some pieces that I'm in the
process<00:03:35.480> of<00:03:35.959> firing<00:03:37.000> so<00:03:38.919> this<00:03:39.919> paragon<00:03:40.310> kill

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
process of firing so this paragon kill

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:41.440 
process of firing so this paragon kill
works<00:03:40.760> it's<00:03:40.940> good<00:03:41.060> to<00:03:41.150> have<00:03:41.269> a<00:03:41.299> digital

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
works it's good to have a digital

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.110 
works it's good to have a digital
controller<00:03:42.109> so<00:03:42.769> you<00:03:42.859> can<00:03:43.190> control<00:03:43.819> how<00:03:43.940> fast

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
controller so you can control how fast

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.509 
controller so you can control how fast
it<00:03:44.419> heats<00:03:44.569> up<00:03:44.840> and<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:49.099> different

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
it heats up and and the different

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.250 
it heats up and and the different
temperatures<00:03:50.299> you<00:03:50.329> want<00:03:50.599> to<00:03:50.660> fire<00:03:50.840> to<00:03:51.049> it<00:03:51.169> will

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
temperatures you want to fire to it will

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.599 
temperatures you want to fire to it will
control<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.680> temperature<00:03:52.040> once<00:03:52.250> it<00:03:52.340> gets<00:03:52.489> up

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
control the temperature once it gets up

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.670 
control the temperature once it gets up
to<00:03:52.639> tab<00:03:53.079> we'll<00:03:54.079> go<00:03:54.169> over<00:03:54.260> that<00:03:54.349> in<00:03:54.470> another

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
to tab we'll go over that in another
