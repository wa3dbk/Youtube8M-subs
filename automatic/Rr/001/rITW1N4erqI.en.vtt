00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.769

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.549

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.430

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.760

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.159
 I improved a lot, guys, I got much better. 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.980
 even I think I do not think you would 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.780
 like to revere is but anyway 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.290
 People, I'll put everything to power. 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.850
 to work here is to go back 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.740
 Putting it here and I'm setting it up 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.820
 she's beautiful and needs years 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.229
 coal ne 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.240
 I already made this hat that is also good 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.850
 Nice and made some bags too, the father of 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.270
 plus I explained that the coal car 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.520
 is 32 even in the case of the bag 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.020
 since it has good move on the ground 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.659

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.810
 bag the beauty hat I will put that 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:16.100
 until now you need to set it up 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:21.410
 need the power here and configure 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:23.450
 kaka is not the cow and the number is only 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.920
 between what she will start to do 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.100
 noise all alone caught the ores 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.170
 father everything else she'll dig team with 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.270
 square 10 by 10 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.330
 you're basically going to record 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.680
 a frame by 10 by 10 and will get all 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.480
 minerals and cancers through their 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.860
 do not just click it it will open the 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.200
 inventory but it has to be kind 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.130
 end everything at the end of the video in 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.520

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.340

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.680
 Rodrigo left because alone and in Brazil 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.930

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.650
 You're what it's like, this ore. 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.230

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.130

 I think it's very beautiful, I even did the boot. 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.030
 I will not make the helmet because the 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:49.490
 helmet new design of magic 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:51.230
 I thought it was cool, and my pants took over. 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.060
 we put on the pants cause it took 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.180
 but finally left another capital here 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.430
 because here we are sporting know 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.340
 Let me get my pants in here, I'm just 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.100
 listening although there is too much 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.010
 pants up the body is also the 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.230

 Bring it on, I'm not going to do it. 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.489
 Why else would I go to Central Europe? 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.590
 It runs out of the bag and I do not want to sound 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.630
 Good, I always thought it was cute, but anyway. 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.940
 left here in our armor logo 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.090
 now I have two spaces for everything but it is 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.330
 I'll store my pectoral files here. 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.520
 here for everything else 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:34.569
 and I'll show you guys what 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.129
 stay here this is call the thrush 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:38.020
 January, eta is improving 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:39.460
 enough that for all but I will 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.889
 show you the way it is 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.300
 way I'll give you a place where the disco 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.319
 already said that it will show that you 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.419
 I'll go 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:48.669
 Good people here is where I already 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.710
 I screwed up taking that bug 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.360
 to attack me but I came here 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.789
 Here I put it so much, it ends. 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.280
 even rock and so I have many 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.930
 blocks because until the finish and catching 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.020
 I can take her blocks later 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.789
 ore for everything else and very cava type 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.919
 they stayed on the steps down here 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:07.389
 has ravine and dad everything else 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.940
 here is very good has those ores 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:13.090
 still to be able to pick up many things 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.590
 still but kind of like the foot even I go 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.199
 show that he also had a 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.940
 meteor deal that crashed is but I think 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.560
 that the rodrigo took almost everything to 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.900
 to be able to make his armor, right? 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.460
 but whatever it is that you and have got a lot to 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.050
 be able to make them mature if you 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.060
 You want to see what I do, it's mature that 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.800
 here it is meteors I can only do that 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.629
 give a lot of work 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.020
 so not if I ever made a sword of 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:36.310
 meteors but it's nice, it's the galley 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.680
 Wanna show something to you? 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.520
 Also interesting is that here in 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.810
 depeche 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.979
 remembering that the link from the mountain foot 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:48.279
 talents that are also for those who want 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:50.680
 play goes all over the bucket is kind to 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:52.719
 a poison is not my poison of a 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.279
 that water that leaves with 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:55.870
 slowness to everything but very good 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:59.349
 When you want to do, you need to make a 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:02.650
 trip to no milk to drink but later 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:03.849
 You slow down duck but I showed you 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.039

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:54.479
 Then I was able to open that kind of thing. 

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:57.090
 taking all the ores I can 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:59.610
