state the stent is one of the most

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.140 
state the stent is one of the most
important<00:00:16.170> parts<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.770> procedure<00:00:17.250> this

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
important parts of the procedure this

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.019 
important parts of the procedure this
was<00:00:18.480> patented<00:00:19.080> by<00:00:19.140> dr.<00:00:19.770> shatkin<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.490> you

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
was patented by dr. shatkin and you

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.870 
was patented by dr. shatkin and you
really<00:00:21.539> need<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.560> put<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.250> implants<00:00:23.699> in

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
really need that to put the implants in

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.240 
really need that to put the implants in
the<00:00:24.000> right<00:00:24.180> position<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:24.869> that's<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.980> part

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
the right position so that's the part

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:41.049 
the right position so that's the part
all<00:00:26.519> gets<00:00:26.760> drilled<00:00:27.000> three<00:00:27.210> distinct<00:00:27.720> yes

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.819 

we've<00:00:42.059> seen<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.450> adjust<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.050> speed<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
we've seen you adjust the speed of the

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.910 
we've seen you adjust the speed of the
motor<00:00:44.250> they<00:00:44.780> what<00:00:45.780> different<00:00:46.260> speeds<00:00:46.590> do<00:00:46.829> you

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
motor they what different speeds do you

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.549 
motor they what different speeds do you
use<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.460> how<00:00:47.489> critical<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:49.050> actually

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
use and how critical is it to actually

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.470 
use and how critical is it to actually
use<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.160> write<00:00:50.340> speeds<00:00:50.789> for<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.120> different

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
use the write speeds for the different

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.080 
use the write speeds for the different
parts<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.989> procedure<00:00:52.379> very<00:00:53.340> important

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
parts of the procedure very important

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.979 
parts of the procedure very important
when<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:55.020> do<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.379> pinhole<00:00:55.890> initially<00:00:56.850> we<00:00:57.420> do

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
when we do the pinhole initially we do

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.010 
when we do the pinhole initially we do
it<00:00:58.170> at<00:00:58.350> 500<00:00:59.039> revs

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
it at 500 revs

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.979 
it at 500 revs
RPM<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.399> when<00:01:02.399> we<00:01:02.609> do<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.030> seating<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.780> what

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
RPM and when we do the seating like what

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.560 
RPM and when we do the seating like what
I'm<00:01:04.140> doing<00:01:04.170> now<00:01:04.439> with<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.189> slow<00:01:05.489> handpiece<00:01:06.060> we

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
I'm doing now with a slow handpiece we

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.789 
I'm doing now with a slow handpiece we
go<00:01:06.750> down<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.260> 15<00:01:08.210> rpm<00:01:09.260> so<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.409> implants

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
go down to 15 rpm so the implants

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.280 
go down to 15 rpm so the implants
actually<00:01:11.070> placed<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.880> mouth<00:01:12.290> utilizing

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
actually placed in the mouth utilizing

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.280 
actually placed in the mouth utilizing
the<00:01:13.439> drill<00:01:14.509> definitely<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.689> it's<00:01:15.840> coming<00:01:16.140> out

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
the drill definitely and it's coming out

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.480 
the drill definitely and it's coming out
of<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.530> sterile<00:01:16.979> packet<00:01:17.520> into<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.600> handpiece

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
of a sterile packet into the handpiece

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.580 
of a sterile packet into the handpiece
into<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.640> mouth<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.180> then<00:01:22.049> looks<00:01:22.350> like<00:01:22.439> a

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
into the mouth and then looks like a

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.370 
into the mouth and then looks like a
ratchet<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.520> using<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.420> tighten<00:01:25.259> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
ratchet that you using to tighten the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.679 
ratchet that you using to tighten the
implant<00:01:25.770> they<00:01:25.950> please<00:01:26.340> tell<00:01:27.210> us<00:01:27.360> about<00:01:27.630> that

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
implant they please tell us about that

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.499 
implant they please tell us about that
that<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.680> actually<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.369> mini<00:01:29.700> torque<00:01:30.150> wrench

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
that is actually a mini torque wrench

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.249 
that is actually a mini torque wrench
and<00:01:30.900> we<00:01:31.860> use<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.670> place<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.479> implant<00:01:33.960> at

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
and we use that to place the implant at

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.330 
and we use that to place the implant at
the<00:01:34.470> right<00:01:34.680> tension<00:01:35.390> right<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.810> gum<00:01:36.990> line

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
the right tension right to the gum line

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.850 
the right tension right to the gum line
so<00:01:38.509> that's<00:01:39.509> used<00:01:39.840> for<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.110> final<00:01:40.560> placement

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
so that's used for the final placement

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.630 
so that's used for the final placement
of<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.460> implant<00:01:42.619> definitely<00:01:43.619> because<00:01:44.369> you

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
of the implant definitely because you

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.760 
of the implant definitely because you
can't<00:01:44.909> do<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.270> by<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.509> handpiece<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.439> have<00:01:46.619> to

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
can't do it by the handpiece you have to

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.370 
can't do it by the handpiece you have to
do<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.070> like<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.420> it<00:01:48.420> seems<00:01:48.869> like<00:01:48.990> you're

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
do it like that it seems like you're

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.080 
do it like that it seems like you're
trying<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:50.159> bridge<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:50.700> his<00:01:50.880> head<00:01:51.060> right

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
trying the bridge in his head right

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.440 
trying the bridge in his head right
that's<00:01:51.810> absolutely<00:01:52.380> right<00:01:52.970> so<00:01:53.970> you're

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
that's absolutely right so you're

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.050 
that's absolutely right so you're
checking<00:01:54.689> with<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.619> what<00:01:56.520> are<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.640> taking

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
checking with the what are you taking

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.300 
checking with the what are you taking
for<00:01:57.090> when<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.479> try<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.750> in<00:01:58.020> at<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.829> bridge<00:01:59.040> go

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
for when you try it in at the bridge go

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.550 
for when you try it in at the bridge go
in<00:01:59.579> all<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.820> way<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.689> doesn't<00:02:01.020> rock<00:02:01.259> and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
in all the way that it doesn't rock and

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.520 
in all the way that it doesn't rock and
