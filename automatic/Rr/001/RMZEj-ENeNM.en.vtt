00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.289 
very fast in this game on level 13 now
already<00:03:10.600> I<00:03:10.900> think<00:03:11.769> I<00:03:11.860> played<00:03:12.070> for<00:03:12.670> hours<00:03:12.730> in

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
already I think I played for hours in

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.420 
already I think I played for hours in
game<00:03:13.660> time<00:03:13.959> or<00:03:14.200> three<00:03:14.650> hours<00:03:14.680> in<00:03:14.980> game<00:03:15.130> time

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
game time or three hours in game time

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
it's much faster than we mainly because

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.870 
it's much faster than we mainly because
they<00:03:18.940> have<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:19.450> prestige<00:03:20.200> system<00:03:20.680> which<00:03:21.489> I
