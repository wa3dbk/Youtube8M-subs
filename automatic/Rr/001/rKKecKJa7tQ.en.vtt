00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.609
 servus people were at the start how are you 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.540
 I wanted you in this video 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.300
 apologize for the best video 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.190
 and I had blog made in the 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.380
 were traveling for several hours in the car 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.480
 and bit crazy turned off and yes 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.070
 to me is really the case that 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.230
 I'm going to be hyperactive because of myself 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.510
 have so much energy and six hours 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.750
 traveling in the car is already for me 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.279
 a blatant thing in any case yes we 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.770
 made a little jokes and stuff 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.920
 about others on the street and so now 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.180
 not directly offended someone but 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.719
 Really in Rome has few jokes 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.420
 made 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.160
 and that did not work out so well 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.379
 the people of that somehow not so 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.510
 exemplary and then I just wanted 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.020
 to say sorry if I happen 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.579
 on the channel because I am actually 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.109
 not directly directly into someone 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.809
 I'm offending face anyway 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.710
 Never but that it was not called 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.670
 quite alright 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.820
 and now a little word 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:11.970
 in terms of model I even know 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.799
 not like it has become or I had 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.060
 It did not really work that way 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.890
 to become a role model 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.689
 So in terms of fitness I can do that 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.520
 well understand that people me 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.140
 follow me as an example is 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.740
 for me also a very big honor 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.740
 I want that still awesome but so as 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.150
 person yes that was not like that somehow 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.240
 planned that I said okay now 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.280
 I do what you are and now 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.810
 I want a role model sometimes I can 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.119
 I be an example I am only me 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.430
 be yourself and dear someone of the straight 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.649
 is and his staff ead etr has 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.530
 does not make up his character and 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.280
 does not come across naturally and the 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.460
 truth says and also with mistakes and 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:58.320
 to be represented as we really are 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:01.049
 which is just completely false lying on 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.110
 In any case , it really is me 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.000
 not necessarily want to be a role model too 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.920
 if I disappoint you now 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.090
 So I do not want that perfect 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.009
 to be a role model 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.739
 I do not want to pretend somehow 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.019
 or somehow we think try too 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.910
 to be what I am not yes I show you 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.150
 just just my experiences 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:25.200
 my life is my lifestyle and mine 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.569
 love in things fitness and that's why 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.310
 started this channel here 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.170
 That's when I started without 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.840
 to know at all that i am at all 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.879
 like to build up a reach or something 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.489
 that people know me 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.140
 it was just like that at the time i just got it 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.790
 opened a channel on videos 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.880
 turned and was actually only in the beginning 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.799
 for me super positive videos and stuff 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.709
 really thought so okay that's one 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.840
 cool thing it motivates people then 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.640
 of course I have found it 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.269
 I'm horny but it was not mine 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.480
 aim 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:01.010
 and right now it is so that each 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.239
 activity every action becomes a saving 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.860
 criticizes i understand it too is ok 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.200
 I can handle things super 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.519
 here is yes that I have your criticism now 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.579
 accepted and I apologize 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.200
 me here in public in the video 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:16.290
 but it was not really planned that way 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.790
 and i realized ok everything i did 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.049
 make a reaction it is very 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.319
 many people who follow me 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.840
 and I have a certain responsibility 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.510
 in any case in that sense again 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:32.150
 thanks for the criticism people i have 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.530
 hope you can sometimes synonymous with it 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.970
 deal well with it 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.859
 get along that I also sometimes I 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.060
 the perfect model is that I'm off and on 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:44.099
 to make mistakes and so it goes on 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.130
 See you at the next video it's 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.130
 too
