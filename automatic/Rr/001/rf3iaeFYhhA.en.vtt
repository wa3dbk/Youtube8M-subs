00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
I think it captures the feeling of

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.349 
I think it captures the feeling of
running<00:03:38.250> around<00:03:38.459> as<00:03:38.609> the<00:03:38.730> turtles<00:03:39.150> in<00:03:39.269> New

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
running around as the turtles in New

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.210 
running around as the turtles in New
York<00:03:39.510> City<00:03:39.599> on<00:03:39.840> rooftops<00:03:40.439> into<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.829> sewers

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
York City on rooftops into the sewers

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.770 
York City on rooftops into the sewers
you<00:03:41.459> know<00:03:41.579> climbing<00:03:42.150> all<00:03:42.269> walls<00:03:44.419> the<00:03:45.419> feeling

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
you know climbing all walls the feeling

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.089 
you know climbing all walls the feeling
of<00:03:45.840> being<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:46.230> ninja<00:03:46.409> turtle<00:03:46.799> I<00:03:46.829> think<00:03:47.010> it

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
of being a ninja turtle I think it

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.319 
of being a ninja turtle I think it
captures<00:03:47.280> that<00:03:47.549> really<00:03:48.150> really<00:03:48.450> well<00:03:48.859> um<00:03:50.329> next
