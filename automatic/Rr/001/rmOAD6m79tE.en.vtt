00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 problem youtuber welcome again 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.640
 to my channel in this short video I'm going to 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.240
 do a hard reset that is I'm going to 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.880
 reset the phone at your option a 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.670
 factory mode using the option that 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.740
 it's called hard reset basically this what 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.990
 we do for several reasons one can be 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.140
 that suddenly we put a password 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.359
 pattern or pin and we forgot and no longer 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.550
 we can enter another option 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.970
 could make him suddenly the phone 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.710
 is staying protocol or is not 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.920
 entering completely or the phone 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.469
 it can be very slow since we have 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.820
 installed many applications or also 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.370
 a good option to make a hard 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.379
 reset is that we're going to sell phone and 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.000
 we want to completely erase all the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.800
 information which is in him since the 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.329
 never laughs it erases all the 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.250
 information then the first thing that 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.250
 we have to do is turn off the phone 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.790
 now before making a player and you 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.100
 they are going to make a backup of all their 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.020
 information I do not take responsibility for 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.270
 that information if you lose your 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.380
 contacts your photos and your things 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.450
 important 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.640
 while the phone is off we go to 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.130
 use two keys on some phones 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.350
 which does with volume down and the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.910
 key on in this case the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.160
 left we have the keys that we are going to 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.640
 use in this case in that reference 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:24.030
 a liu wei in 360 is done with volume 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.260
 up and the power key yes 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.090
 they do it with volume action to young 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.159
 enter another menu that is in Chinese and 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.229
 do not understand anything 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.259
 well then what we are going to do is 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.899
 press the volume key 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.100
 up and then the key 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.719
 lit at once 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.250
 immediately let's do this let's 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.890
 enter a menu with which 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.990
 You can only drive or enter 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.670
 him using the volume keys 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.259
 then let's enter first to this 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.849
 first menu volume up and power 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.189
 let's go as soon as we enter this menu 

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:58.140
 that appears here here in this menu as 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.349
 can see tell me to select 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.959
 move uses uses only volume 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:06.149
 up and to select volume 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.910
 down then what I'm going to do 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.239
 is to move volume upwards to 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.769
 enter the part that says recovery and 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.280
 then I say what down to 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.610
 enter 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.250
 we wait to enter the option of 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.790
 recovery or here's the one that we're going 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.990
 to enter what the recovery mode calls 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.290
 ready then here we have all the 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.250
 options that interest us 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.680
 here are two options that are the most 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.209
 important and the first one is also 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.239
 considered important since if I 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.459
 I would like to do this factor and it is reset 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.939
 the factory model is simply the 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.920
 income for the first one that is 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:48.299
 just reset the computer here yo 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.810
 I can move with the arrow towards 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.030
 up and down 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.599
 and if you want to enter an option 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.970
 I use the power button as it says there 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.950
 the red combo place up work 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.870
 very new and with power volume 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.780
 I select then who is interested 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.250
 to make a factor check first what 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.030
 we must do is to handle wild 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.660
 partition here are the webcam cache 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.200
 partition the power button 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:20.500
 immediately down will tell me something 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.290

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.790
 how important it is to make a pact 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:35.170
 perform low where it says wide datafactory 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.450
 I give him a power button and here they give me 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.220
 many options but as you remember 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.110
 that if you go do this 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.610
 good for you are going to lose all your 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.100
 information and the phone is going to 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.710
 factory reset me under here with 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.080
 the input volume key to which 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:54.470
 says you want to erase all the data from 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.670
 user and then the power button and here 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.580
 down where it says what it is doing 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.860

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.570
 now let's get out of the phone 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.550
 doing a reset basically that we 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.790
 we move by default the first one appears 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:17.600
 option if it is not like this we go up to reboot 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.730
 system down we give you power button 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.010
 and we wait for the phone to 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.540
 reset the phone sometimes it 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.640
 delay this process a bit 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.600
 restoration can last between 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.880
 two and a half minutes and 3 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.830

 phone and it ends its process since 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.150
 these delay more or less between two 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.150
 minutes and a half and three minutes 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.560
