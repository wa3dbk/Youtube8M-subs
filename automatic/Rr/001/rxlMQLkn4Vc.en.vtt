layers in the atmosphere one of which we

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.460 
layers in the atmosphere one of which we

stratosphere<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.340> where<00:00:23.550> we<00:00:23.699> find<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.390> very

that are sensitive to UV radiation and
try<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.079> middle<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:53.190> nice<00:00:53.730> bright

try this in the middle of a nice bright
clear<00:00:54.750> day<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.170> they<00:00:55.320> turn<00:00:55.590> there's<00:00:56.039> amazing

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
clear day and they turn there's amazing

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.939 
clear day and they turn there's amazing
share<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.210> purple<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.809> then<00:00:58.020> on<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.350> cloudy<00:00:58.770> day

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
share of purple and then on a cloudy day

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.639 
share of purple and then on a cloudy day
they<00:00:59.250> turn<00:00:59.789> pink<00:01:00.120> now<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:01.020> snowing<00:01:01.170> out<00:01:01.620> here

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
they turn pink now it's snowing out here

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.349 
they turn pink now it's snowing out here
the<00:01:02.039> temperatures<00:01:02.460> about<00:01:02.670> thirty<00:01:02.969> degrees

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
the temperatures about thirty degrees

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.299 
the temperatures about thirty degrees
I'm<00:01:03.539> absolutely<00:01:04.110> excited<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.949> see<00:01:05.129> they're

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
I'm absolutely excited to see they're

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.219 
I'm absolutely excited to see they're
going<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.549> turn<00:01:05.820> at<00:01:06.119> all<00:01:06.270> because<00:01:06.930> that'll

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
going to turn at all because that'll

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.170 
going to turn at all because that'll
prove<00:01:07.409> whether<00:01:07.740> we're<00:01:08.220> getting<00:01:08.340> ultraviolet

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
prove whether we're getting ultraviolet

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.260 
prove whether we're getting ultraviolet
radiation<00:01:09.720> coming<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.140> us<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:11.430> snowy<00:01:11.970> day

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
radiation coming to us and a snowy day

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.810 
radiation coming to us and a snowy day
so<00:01:12.479> here<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:12.840> go<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.260> would<00:01:14.040> come<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.280> frisbees

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
so here we go I would come to frisbees

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.210 
so here we go I would come to frisbees
they<00:01:15.540> were<00:01:15.600> white<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.369> bingo<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:20.040> can

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
they were white and bingo so we can

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.640 
they were white and bingo so we can
actually<00:01:20.400> get<00:01:20.880> ultraviolet<00:01:21.659> radiation

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
actually get ultraviolet radiation

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.130 
actually get ultraviolet radiation
coming<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.280> us<00:01:23.460> even<00:01:24.060> through<00:01:24.600> all<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.840> these

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
coming to us even through all of these

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.880 
coming to us even through all of these
clouds<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.759> middle<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.090> snow<00:01:30.650> do<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.740> know

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
clouds in the middle of snow do you know

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.190 
clouds in the middle of snow do you know
why<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.130> frisbee<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:33.299> changed<00:01:33.720> color<00:01:33.930> well

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
why that frisbee just changed color well

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.260 
why that frisbee just changed color well
it's<00:01:34.350> because<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.650> all<00:01:34.860> those<00:01:35.270> ultraviolet

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
it's because of all those ultraviolet

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.480 
it's because of all those ultraviolet
rays<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.960> are<00:01:37.110> coming<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.619> us<00:01:37.860> from<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.280> Sun

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
rays that are coming to us from the Sun

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.399 
rays that are coming to us from the Sun
and<00:01:39.030> that's<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.390> reason<00:01:39.659> why<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.840> know<00:01:40.259> your

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
and that's the reason why you know your

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.569 
and that's the reason why you know your
mom<00:01:40.530> always<00:01:40.740> says<00:01:41.040> make<00:01:41.220> sure<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.400> put

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
mom always says make sure you put

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.609 
mom always says make sure you put
sunscreen<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:43.490> we<00:01:44.490> have<00:01:44.729> what<00:01:45.030> we<00:01:45.149> call

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
sunscreen on we have what we call

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.990 
sunscreen on we have what we call
constant<00:01:46.619> gases<00:01:47.159> which<00:01:47.490> are<00:01:47.670> things<00:01:47.850> like

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
constant gases which are things like

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.859 
constant gases which are things like
oxygen<00:01:48.990> nitrogen<00:01:49.579> argon<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.000> on<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.420> then

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
oxygen nitrogen argon and so on and then

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.380 
oxygen nitrogen argon and so on and then
we<00:01:51.899> have<00:01:52.200> what<00:01:52.350> we<00:01:52.470> call<00:01:52.649> variable<00:01:53.640> gases<00:01:54.119> and

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
we have what we call variable gases and

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.350 
we have what we call variable gases and
those<00:01:54.570> are<00:01:54.780> things<00:01:55.200> like<00:01:55.320> carbon<00:01:56.130> dioxide

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
those are things like carbon dioxide

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.700 
those are things like carbon dioxide
