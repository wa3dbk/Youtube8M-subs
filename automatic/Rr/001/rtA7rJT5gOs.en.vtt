00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.080 
file here now one thing to note is on
some<00:01:06.910> printers<00:01:07.479> depending<00:01:08.229> on<00:01:08.700> what<00:01:09.700> kind<00:01:09.970> of

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
some printers depending on what kind of

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.669 
some printers depending on what kind of
printer<00:01:10.420> you're<00:01:10.630> using<00:01:10.869> whether<00:01:11.170> it's<00:01:11.319> like

00:01:11.669 --> 00:01:11.679 
printer you're using whether it's like

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:14.550 
printer you're using whether it's like
for<00:01:11.920> example<00:01:12.009> a<00:01:12.539> ink<00:01:13.539> printer<00:01:14.200> or<00:01:14.350> you're

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
for example a ink printer or you're

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.080 
for example a ink printer or you're
using<00:01:14.740> a<00:01:14.979> laser<00:01:15.160> printer<00:01:15.640> or<00:01:15.700> something<00:01:16.000> like

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
using a laser printer or something like

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.190 
using a laser printer or something like
that<00:01:16.330> sometimes

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
that sometimes

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.279 
that sometimes
printers<00:01:17.740> can<00:01:17.950> be<00:01:18.069> faster<00:01:18.520> or<00:01:18.729> slower<00:01:18.970> so<00:01:19.959> you

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:20.289 
printers can be faster or slower so you

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.040 
printers can be faster or slower so you
if<00:01:20.800> you<00:01:21.009> have<00:01:21.220> a<00:01:21.250> lot<00:01:21.580> of<00:01:21.610> PDF<00:01:22.179> files<00:01:22.209> let's<00:01:22.840> say

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
if you have a lot of PDF files let's say

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.669 
if you have a lot of PDF files let's say
you<00:01:23.110> had<00:01:23.470> 25<00:01:24.569> you<00:01:25.569> might<00:01:25.840> want<00:01:26.080> to<00:01:26.319> pause

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
you had 25 you might want to pause

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:28.710 
you had 25 you might want to pause
between<00:01:27.069> jobs<00:01:27.640> because<00:01:28.119> then<00:01:28.300> this<00:01:28.479> gives

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
between jobs because then this gives

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.490 
between jobs because then this gives
your<00:01:28.869> computer<00:01:29.500> enough<00:01:30.220> time<00:01:30.580> to<00:01:31.209> receive<00:01:32.170> the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
your computer enough time to receive the

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.070 
your computer enough time to receive the
new<00:01:32.679> documents<00:01:33.399> because<00:01:34.209> many<00:01:34.450> printers<00:01:34.840> have

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
new documents because many printers have

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.320 
new documents because many printers have
what's<00:01:35.410> called<00:01:35.560> printer<00:01:36.039> memory<00:01:36.369> or<00:01:36.610> there's

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
what's called printer memory or there's

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.279 
what's called printer memory or there's
a<00:01:37.390> printer<00:01:37.780> buffer<00:01:38.110> so<00:01:39.660> you'd<00:01:40.660> want<00:01:40.899> to<00:01:41.080> just

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
a printer buffer so you'd want to just

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:42.900 
a printer buffer so you'd want to just
play<00:01:41.500> with<00:01:41.530> this<00:01:41.830> number<00:01:42.130> a<00:01:42.280> little<00:01:42.550> bit<00:01:42.700> to

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
play with this number a little bit to

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.570 
play with this number a little bit to
make<00:01:43.060> sure<00:01:43.420> your<00:01:43.929> printer<00:01:44.770> can<00:01:44.920> accept<00:01:45.340> all

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
make sure your printer can accept all

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.070 
make sure your printer can accept all
the<00:01:45.759> information<00:01:46.270> once<00:01:46.720> you've<00:01:46.869> done<00:01:47.020> that

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
the information once you've done that

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.199
