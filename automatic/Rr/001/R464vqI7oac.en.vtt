at the beginning of the game you're
going<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.119> want<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.359> make<00:00:18.570> your<00:00:18.690> way<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.930> the

00:01:01.480 --> 00:02:18.800 

Oh

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.290 

atomic<00:02:19.810> fishing

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.860 

I<00:02:24.430> cannot<00:02:25.430> foresee<00:02:25.880> a<00:02:25.910> situation<00:02:26.510> whereby<00:02:26.690> a

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
I cannot foresee a situation whereby a

00:02:26.870 --> 00:03:05.020 
I cannot foresee a situation whereby a
lack<00:02:27.260> of<00:02:27.290> ammo<00:02:27.680> was<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:27.920> positive<00:02:28.250> thing

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.729 

well<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.359> can<00:03:06.569> speculate<00:03:07.170> as<00:03:07.469> to<00:03:07.500> why<00:03:07.650> that

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
well I can speculate as to why that

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:22.100 
well I can speculate as to why that
sound<00:03:08.129> played<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.730> speculate

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:50.380 

here<00:03:23.110> i<00:03:24.180> have<00:03:25.180> been<00:03:25.660> granted<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.260> power
