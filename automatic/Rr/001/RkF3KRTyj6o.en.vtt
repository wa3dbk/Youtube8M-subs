so<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.610> next<00:01:59.790> year<00:02:00.030> it's<00:02:00.149> kind<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.360> last

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
so the next year it's kind of last

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.660 
so the next year it's kind of last
revised<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.380> already<00:02:01.649> got<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.950> basics<00:02:02.399> I

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
revised and I already got the basics I

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.760 
revised and I already got the basics I
think<00:02:03.210> then<00:02:03.329> our<00:02:03.450> C<00:02:03.750> course<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.439> one<00:02:04.619> thing

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
think then our C course the one thing

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.590 
think then our C course the one thing
you<00:02:04.920> can<00:02:05.100> do<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.490> you're<00:02:05.670> teaching<00:02:06.119> your<00:02:06.390> whole

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
you can do is you're teaching your whole

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.540 
you can do is you're teaching your whole

of<00:02:08.610> time<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:09.119> can<00:02:09.479> make<00:02:09.630> connections<00:02:09.959> which<00:02:10.800> in

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
of time I can make connections which in

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.059 
of time I can make connections which in
the<00:02:12.120> normal<00:02:12.420> course<00:02:12.599> of<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.810> year<00:02:12.840> maybe<00:02:13.739> would

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
the normal course of a year maybe would

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.370 
the normal course of a year maybe would
be<00:02:14.190> six<00:02:14.430> months<00:02:14.700> apart<00:02:14.849> I<00:02:15.390> can<00:02:15.480> do<00:02:15.810> those<00:02:16.019> two

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
be six months apart I can do those two

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.140 
be six months apart I can do those two
hours<00:02:16.560> apart<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.430> students<00:02:17.790> suddenly

see how the subject fits together much

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.809 
see how the subject fits together much
better
