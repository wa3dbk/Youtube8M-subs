00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.350 

and<00:01:26.680> then<00:01:26.980> I<00:01:27.310> believe<00:01:27.760> during<00:01:27.940> the<00:01:28.030> verse<00:01:28.210> you

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
and then I believe during the verse you

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.750 
and then I believe during the verse you
just<00:01:28.600> he<00:01:29.350> plays<00:01:29.560> that<00:01:29.680> same<00:01:29.920> rift<00:01:30.190> only<00:01:30.550> on<00:01:30.670> the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
just he plays that same rift only on the

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.050 
just he plays that same rift only on the
low<00:01:30.910> D<00:01:31.120> string<00:01:31.420> with<00:01:31.780> a<00:01:31.810> palm<00:01:32.350> muting<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.880> just

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
low D string with a palm muting so just

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.190 
low D string with a palm muting so just
go<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.750> then<00:01:38.050> sometimes<00:01:38.890> he<00:01:39.040> throws<00:01:39.250> in<00:01:39.430> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
go and then sometimes he throws in the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.580 
go and then sometimes he throws in the
same<00:01:41.200> lick<00:01:41.440> on<00:01:41.979> a<00:01:42.040> higher<00:01:42.250> octave<00:01:42.790> so<00:01:43.470> it's<00:01:44.470> on

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
same lick on a higher octave so it's on

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:52.410 
same lick on a higher octave so it's on
the<00:01:44.710> high<00:01:44.890> D<00:01:45.220> string<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:50.619> then<00:01:51.240> sometimes<00:01:52.240> he

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
the high D string and then sometimes he

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.290 
the high D string and then sometimes he
also<00:01:52.540> throws<00:01:53.310> another<00:01:54.310> octave<00:01:54.760> higher<00:01:54.790> which

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
also throws another octave higher which

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:02.389 
also throws another octave higher which
I<00:01:55.420> can't<00:01:55.630> do<00:01:55.750> this<00:01:55.780> completely<00:01:56.470> right<00:01:56.680> yet<00:01:56.860> but
