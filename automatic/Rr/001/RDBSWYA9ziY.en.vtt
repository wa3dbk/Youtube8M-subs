00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 Energydrinks are dangerous for the 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.589
 you can probably get health from it 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.299
 even die 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.769
 my name is ella and this is one 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.210
 basket schott a story from texas 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.580
 made us sit up and listen 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.590
 an actually healthy 26 year old 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.310
 American is on a heart attack 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.980
 died 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.020
 The report is near the infect could 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.850
 the daily energy drink consumption 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.340
 the man had previously stated that he 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.170
 usually eight to ten cans a day 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.580
 that would be like you drink 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.650
 probably can imagine extreme 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.000
 According to the report, the Texan is missing 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.280
 but also a daily pack 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.750
 smoked cigarettes that could be too 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.460
 what had to do with the death 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.680
 Generally you can not say that 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.940
 Only the consumption of energy drinks really 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.950
 directly led to death 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.800
 But is there a connection 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.360
 energy drinks like red bull rockstar or 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.460
 Monsters are not only in Germany 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.480
 pretty popular according to a study of 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.449
 European authority for 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.949
 food safety drink 68 of the 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.710
 European teenagers the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.930
 caffeinated drinks 12 at least 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.570
 four times a week and another twelve 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.369
 percent more than one liter per consumption 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.080
 that's probably because she's so cute 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.979
 are and directly to adolescents 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.140
 be marketed 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.280
 I personally like energy drinks already 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.229
 very much because it is just total 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.760
 I'll have rubbery juice then 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.509
 but also this effect vision 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.369
 gummi bear absolute leader in the 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.369
 Energy drinks is red bull 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.409
 the group has around 53 in 2013 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.270
 sold billions and thus one 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.720
 turnover of around 5 billion euros 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.369
 made 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.920
 originally, the drink comes out but 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.840
 Southeast Asia in Japan got the pilots 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.460
 taurine during World War II 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.860
 containing drinks to increase performance 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.900
 founder dietrich mateschitz has the 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.720
 idea then imported from thailand since 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.549
 1984 is the sweet drink to buy and 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.040
 red bull not synonymous somehow everywhere 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.570
 with at formula 1 or sports events 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.579
 even in space very much 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.770
 publicity to find out 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.630
 if energy drinks are really dangerous 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.610
 you have to look at what's there first 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.130
 so in there is the drinks before 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.750
 Caffeine and sugar are all caffeine 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.969
 makes awake increase the heartbeat and 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.759
 Blood pressure and promotes concentration 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.560
 sugar provides energy and at 27 grams 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.429
 In such a dose that could be quite 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.929
 be nice a lot 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.910
 There are many more ingredients 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.050
 the partly exotic names 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.030
 have and all one 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.340
 performance enhancing effect should have 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.750
 Theories, for example, never could 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.700
 be proved that at all 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.590
 any effect is still there 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.330
 nothing bad or sweet 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.610
 and coffee says no one that is 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.070
 dangerous the recommended daily dose 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.900
 Caffeine for an adult is 400 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.540
 milligrams, which is about four 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.520
 mugs espresso ok a can of energy 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.460
 Drink contains about 80 milligrams 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.800
 more than five cans with 250 milliliters 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.510
 so it should not be at the day 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.560
 children and adolescents are worth the price 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.330
 something below 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.280
 already with two cans passes 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.900
 Twelve-year-old boy the border like her 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.700
 maybe you can imagine 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.290
 you can easily beat that and 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.430
 just before that warns the study of 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.070
 food safety 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.380
 in Germany alone exceed 6.6 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.850
 the adolescent regularly the 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.040
 recommended dose of caffeine 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.260
 There are also these energy shots in such a way 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.790
 a small 60 milliliter serving 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.380
 just as much caffeine as in one 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.730
 big lohse that's just by the way 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.850
 because it does not allow any 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.930
 soft drinks are but 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.430
 food supplements there are the 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.470
 legal limits for caffeine 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.420
 so what if you have one 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.160
 Longer period of too much caffeine too 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.540
 The study notes that 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.130
 increased caffeine intake too 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.050
 cardiac arrhythmias and kidney damage 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.180
 The effect can be central 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.220
 Nervous system ranges from mild effects 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.920
 the nervousness trembles and 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.959
 Insomnia to panic attacks 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.790
 There are also allegations that the drinks 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.950
 can actually lead to death 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.600
 if that is really only on the drinks 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.090
 is not clear 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.370
 Almost every second drinks energy drinks 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.260
 in combination with alcohol through the 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.510
 stimulating effect is usually more 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.190
 from the whole consumed and you can 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.810
 his drunkenness is not correct anymore 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.790
 So, there are also those who come 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.950
 risks due to the alcohol to 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.209
 the addictive potential and the 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.100
 sugar content also brings the 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.870
 health burden with the sweet ones 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.660
 soft drinks can also have 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.010
 overweight for example the 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.840
 consumer protection organization foodwatch 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.010
 That's why it's been demanding for a long time 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.050
 Energy drinks only from 18 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.700
 otherwise the countries would deliberately buy 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.290
 take that with children and 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.400
 adolescent health disorders 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.140
 occur the German 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.880
 nutrition minister christian schmidt 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.780
 but does not see the need 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.850
 for a ban 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.100
 the warnings already on one anyway 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.080
 loose on it would be sufficient there 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.879
 that's not the drink 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.439
 recommended to pregnant and lactating women 

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:30.629
 Maybe because she is healing 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:32.610
 There can be more information about it 

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:35.129
 here and here it's all about information 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.960
 on packaging like modified drinks 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:38.819
 you drink so you really find her 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.860
 dangerous and would ban such a thing 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:42.270
 bring me the comments 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.860
 I 'm going to drink my coffee now 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.860
 how short you next to then
