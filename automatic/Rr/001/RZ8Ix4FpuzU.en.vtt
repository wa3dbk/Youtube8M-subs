00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.149 

now<00:00:00.539> I<00:00:00.599> want<00:00:00.900> to<00:00:00.960> talk<00:00:01.140> about<00:00:01.260> cardiac<00:00:01.650> Anatomy

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
now I want to talk about cardiac Anatomy

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.300 
now I want to talk about cardiac Anatomy
from<00:00:03.710> electrophysiological<00:00:04.710> perspective

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
from electrophysiological perspective

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.970 
from electrophysiological perspective
and<00:00:05.609> this<00:00:05.700> is<00:00:05.850> on<00:00:06.000> page<00:00:06.029> 7<00:00:06.750> of<00:00:06.930> your<00:00:07.290> cardiac

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
and this is on page 7 of your cardiac

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.910 
and this is on page 7 of your cardiac
dysrhythmia<00:00:08.820> interpretation<00:00:09.510> workbook<00:00:10.019> so

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
dysrhythmia interpretation workbook so

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.160 
dysrhythmia interpretation workbook so
when<00:00:11.730> we<00:00:11.849> look<00:00:12.059> at<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.509> heart<00:00:12.780> from<00:00:12.990> an

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
when we look at the heart from an

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.870 
when we look at the heart from an
anatomical<00:00:13.460> perspective<00:00:14.460> we're<00:00:14.700> really

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
anatomical perspective we're really

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.420 
anatomical perspective we're really
looking<00:00:15.150> at<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> four<00:00:16.139> chambered<00:00:16.470> two-sided

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
looking at a four chambered two-sided

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.470 
looking at a four chambered two-sided
pump<00:00:17.699> so<00:00:17.970> we're<00:00:18.240> talking<00:00:18.690> about<00:00:20.210> you<00:00:21.210> know<00:00:21.330> the

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
pump so we're talking about you know the

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.810 
pump so we're talking about you know the
right<00:00:21.660> side<00:00:21.990> here<00:00:22.439> which<00:00:22.820> receives

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
right side here which receives

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.480 
right side here which receives
deoxygenated<00:00:24.180> blood<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.439> sends<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.010> very

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
deoxygenated blood and sends it a very

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.679 
deoxygenated blood and sends it a very
short<00:00:26.730> distance<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.210> lungs<00:00:27.420> where<00:00:27.660> it

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
short distance to the lungs where it

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.620 
short distance to the lungs where it
picks<00:00:27.900> up<00:00:28.050> oxygen<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.800> returns<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:30.300> the

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
picks up oxygen and returns it to the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.540 
picks up oxygen and returns it to the
left<00:00:30.960> side<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.380> heart<00:00:31.529> now<00:00:31.859> oxygenated

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
left side of the heart now oxygenated

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.060 
left side of the heart now oxygenated
and<00:00:33.030> then<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.110> gets<00:00:34.230> pumped<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.710> rest<00:00:34.950> of

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
and then it gets pumped to the rest of

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.590 
and then it gets pumped to the rest of
the<00:00:35.130> body<00:00:35.340> so<00:00:35.640> we're<00:00:35.820> really<00:00:35.969> looking<00:00:36.210> at<00:00:36.450> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the body so we're really looking at the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.000 
the body so we're really looking at the
right<00:00:36.840> side<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> heart<00:00:37.469> pumping<00:00:37.860> it's

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
right side of the heart pumping it's

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.619 
right side of the heart pumping it's
belongs<00:00:38.370> left<00:00:38.820> side<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.210> heart<00:00:39.360> pumping

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
belongs left side of the heart pumping

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.450 
belongs left side of the heart pumping
it<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.899> rest<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.260> body<00:00:40.469> if<00:00:41.250> you'll

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
it to the rest of the body if you'll

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.729 
it to the rest of the body if you'll
recall<00:00:41.790> from<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.090> last<00:00:42.360> presentation<00:00:42.930> I

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
recall from the last presentation I

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.529 
recall from the last presentation I
mentioned<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.670> there<00:00:44.879> are<00:00:44.969> these<00:00:45.059> fibrous

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
mentioned that there are these fibrous

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.170 
mentioned that there are these fibrous
connective<00:00:45.719> tissue<00:00:46.170> rings<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:47.190> support<00:00:47.760> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
connective tissue rings that support the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.830 
connective tissue rings that support the
AV<00:00:49.079> valves<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.399> pulmonic<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.539> or<00:00:51.719> tek

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
AV valves and the pulmonic and a or tek

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.700 
AV valves and the pulmonic and a or tek
valves<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.410> what<00:00:53.399> these<00:00:54.260> rings<00:00:55.260> do

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
valves and what these rings do

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.420 
valves and what these rings do
essentially<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.870> isolate<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.070> ventricles<00:00:59.070> or

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
essentially is isolate the ventricles or

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.069 
essentially is isolate the ventricles or
the<00:00:59.640> atria<00:00:59.969> rather<00:01:00.149> from<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> ventricles<00:01:00.930> so

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
the atria rather from the ventricles so

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.179 
the atria rather from the ventricles so
the<00:01:01.680> only<00:01:02.039> link<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.149> SA<00:01:03.420> node<00:01:03.480> here

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
the only link this is the SA node here

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.580 
the only link this is the SA node here
between<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.880> atria<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> ventricles<00:01:07.380> is

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
between the atria and the ventricles is

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.840 
between the atria and the ventricles is
this<00:01:08.430> AV<00:01:08.729> node<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.950> bundle<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.580> His

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
this AV node and the bundle of His

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.609 
this AV node and the bundle of His
which<00:01:12.210> then<00:01:12.450> bifurcates<00:01:12.990> into<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.350> right<00:01:13.500> and

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
which then bifurcates into the right and

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.429 
which then bifurcates into the right and
left<00:01:13.770> bundle<00:01:13.950> branches<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:15.090> these<00:01:15.990> fabrics

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
left bundle branches so these fabrics

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.280 
left bundle branches so these fabrics
connective<00:01:17.250> tissue<00:01:17.430> rings<00:01:17.729> sometimes<00:01:18.290> some

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
connective tissue rings sometimes some

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.719 
connective tissue rings sometimes some
people<00:01:19.530> refer<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.860> them<00:01:20.070> as<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.250> skeletal

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
people refer to them as the skeletal

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.399 
people refer to them as the skeletal
system<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.180> heart<00:01:21.330> they<00:01:21.840> support<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
system of the heart they support the the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.280 
system of the heart they support the the
vowels<00:01:23.100> but<00:01:23.640> they<00:01:23.820> isolate<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.840> atria<00:01:25.140> from

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
vowels but they isolate the atria from

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.039 
vowels but they isolate the atria from
the<00:01:25.380> ventricles<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.000> why<00:01:27.210> from<00:01:27.689> an

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
the ventricles so this is why from an

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.380 
the ventricles so this is why from an
electrical<00:01:28.409> physiological<00:01:29.220> perspective<00:01:29.390> we

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
electrical physiological perspective we

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.060 
electrical physiological perspective we
look<00:01:30.420> at<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.840> heart<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.170> way<00:01:31.380> instead<00:01:31.799> of

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
look at the heart this way instead of

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.060 
look at the heart this way instead of
looking<00:01:32.369> at<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.729> as<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.409> two-sided<00:01:34.409> pump<00:01:34.770> right

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
looking at it as a two-sided pump right

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.170 
looking at it as a two-sided pump right
side<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.460> left<00:01:35.610> side<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:36.570> look<00:01:36.780> at<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.110> as<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:38.180> an

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
side and left side we look at it as a an

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.520 
side and left side we look at it as a an
organ<00:01:39.600> where<00:01:39.750> we're<00:01:39.900> looking<00:01:40.110> at<00:01:40.200> upper

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
organ where we're looking at upper

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.020 
organ where we're looking at upper
chambers<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.100> lower<00:01:41.280> chambers<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:41.880> we're

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
chambers and lower chambers so we're

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.539 
chambers and lower chambers so we're
looking<00:01:42.899> essentially<00:01:43.380> for<00:01:43.799> atrial<00:01:44.100> activity

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
looking essentially for atrial activity

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.429 
looking essentially for atrial activity
in<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.939> form<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.479> P<00:01:45.689> wave<00:01:45.869> if<00:01:45.990> we're<00:01:46.170> looking

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
in the form of a P wave if we're looking

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.620 
in the form of a P wave if we're looking
for<00:01:46.619> ventricular<00:01:47.009> activity<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.240> form<00:01:48.420> of

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
for ventricular activity in the form of

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.740 
for ventricular activity in the form of
a<00:01:48.720> QRS<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.860> R<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.759> atria<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.299> ventricles

a QRS and R the atria and the ventricles

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.569 
a QRS and R the atria and the ventricles
working<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.259> sync<00:01:52.530> with<00:01:52.649> one<00:01:52.860> another<00:01:53.130> in
