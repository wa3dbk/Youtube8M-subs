 if you like traveling like me 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.510
 then you probably collect 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.940
 also all sorts of tickets her 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.200
 take pictures you take notes with it 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.150
 you also later in things 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.830
 can or can I totally remember 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.720
 like to make friends is then ask me 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.570
 so what can you do about the city? 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.070
 recommend then I sit there because you do not 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.020
 is still times that a restaurant or 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.430
 where should you go to which strandabschnitt 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.500
 you should definitely the sisters of 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.880
 normal and therefore no longer accustomed 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.110
 we simply record the things and 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.870
 to keep and it's also fun 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.370
 then scrolling through it and what 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.210
 you need everything for your own 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:07.509
 to make a travel diary that has now 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.180
 a notebook white paper paper patch 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:14.020
 paper with world maps motif paper patch 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:18.240
 glue a brush a glue stick one 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.380
 sheer a marker and a pad 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.060
 first step we take ours 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.799
 notebook and tell it how it is 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.979
 it's pretty ugly, frankly 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:29.439
 and unimaginative because that's black 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.280
 i would din a4 in the first step 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.920
 take paper 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.469
 and yes the book cover practically with it 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.450
 Glue with normal glue and then 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:39.399
 only in the second step my paper patch 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.200
 take papers and the other glue 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:44.200
 I just believe that 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.389
 Paper is so skinny that you can get this one here 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.219
 dark this red and black area 

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:50.619
 that she will shine through and now 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:52.209
 does not look all that fancy so 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.789
 first cut white paper 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:56.789
 and paste the notebook with it 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.570
 l 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.500
 As you can see I have my notebook 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.480
 now stuck with the white paper and 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.970
 before I now with the paper patch 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.890
 I'll put on glue for the first time 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.080
 my papa patch paper a bit like that 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.850
 and cut the first time rightly 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.220
 so that it is a bit suitable for 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.140
 book and then I would even mine 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.660
 white din a4 paper with peter petz 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.710
 brush in the glue and then the beautiful 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.710
 glue paper over it 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.270
 l 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.420
 Yes 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.820
 The paper is dry he should be on 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.470
 Wait a while until that happens 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.330
 paper really is really dry 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.310
 because then you start and that way 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.590
 unfolds and then everything here so 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.989
 survives incise and a flat and 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.060
 sticks and if the paper then still 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.410
 it is wet then it can be very easy for you 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.120
 that happen right here in the 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.340
 corners then enter through you again 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.660
 Therefore, starting from scratch , then the tip 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.380
 Now I can do it 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.060
 hit 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.130
 I cut the now so rightly 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.410
 the inside works a tickle here 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.970
 here in the insides of the book and 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.970
 not nearly finished 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.740
 a travel diary is almost ready and 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.090
 looks much fancier than this red 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.500
 black thing before 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.759
 I will all now 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.400
 do not just label with his thick ones 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:19.479
 macker and write let's go on it 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.080
 can of course also something else on it 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.509
 write 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.129
 For example, if you know your destination exactly 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:26.530
 then you do not know Spain 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:30.030
 australia or something else on it me 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.030
 definitely write let's go now 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.669
 and finished is a travel diary me 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.650
 I'm already looking forward to my next one 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.090
 travel i definitely have a lot 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.189
 place and take a lot of notes 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.199
 and I wish you a lot of fun too 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:52.740
 while making things and at their next 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:52.740
 travel of course
