00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 the compact SUVs 

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.930
 have been pumping for some time in the market 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.300
 Brazilian for this reason several brands 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.849
 continue to grow eye on this segment 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.540
 this time who will soon be between 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.240
 we 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:20.520
 this little french here solve multipurpose 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.369
 Sports utility this does not matter 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.070
 What really matters is that this type of 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.710
 car as closed 2008 being 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.859
 launched here in Europe and is 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.140
 conquering people all over the world and 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.590
 next year will be manufactured here at 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.120
 Brazil too 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.180
 and even joe promises that the fight in the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.460
 segment will be big even if 2008 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.160
 do not have today's ford eco lines 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.129
 sport or appear for the king's help 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.989
 northeastern but with much collaboration 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.260
 the Brazilian engineering team and a 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.600
 modern but conservative style you want 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.120
 please Greeks and Trojans 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.039
 so it is not more than 16 millimeters 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.909
 at the time of suspension in relation to 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.580
 hatch 208 roof rack tires use 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.340
 and protective plates under the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.590
 bumper details that give you the air 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.760
 of robustness that so pleases also in 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.950
 our market 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.799
 for those who want more bold use 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.909
 although 2008 has traction on the wheels 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.070
 front 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.830
 the model optionally offers a 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.869
 system called cri adapting point 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.420
 the transmission automatically to the 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.960
 conditions and allows for adventures 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.869
 a little more radical 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.950
 here to drive in the likeness of 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:42.800
 208 is too large and could not be 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.050
 different after all besides the platform he 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.800
 shares two thirds of the pieces with 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.380
 radio 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.110
 and looks just like the picture 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.500
 instruments above the steering wheel ceiling 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.940
 glass finishing and materials 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.280
 of the same level 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.830
 the wheelbase is also the same 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.810
 but 2008 has a bit more space 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.250
 internal back by bank account 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.020
 thinner back 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.720
 better for those who go on the 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.780
 law the end of the island the tunnel on the floor 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.180
 continue to hinder until the end of the year 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.030
 2008 will be available here in Europe 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.100
 with five different engines two 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.310
 petrol and three diesel 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.530
 I walked with version 1.6 with 120 horses 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.890
 of the power closest to the 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:32.060
 engines that will have in Brazil at 1.5 and 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.819
 1.6 the same as those used in 208 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.519
 piniquim for being light the crossover 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.209
 of yew is only one thousand and eighty 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.760
 pounds 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.350
 performance is good and suspension does 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.170
 work efficiently 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.810
 makes the car comfortable and good of curve 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.670
 even though he is taller than the trio rep 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.079
 the Brazilian version will be the same as 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.870
 exception of some components 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:56.120
 suspension and for having 10 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.700
 millimeters more at the time on account of 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.130
 larger tires in higher balls 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.370
 everything to face our streets and 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.370
 roads
