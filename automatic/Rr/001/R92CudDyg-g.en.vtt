can see the progression of one shot to
the<00:02:12.770> next<00:02:13.100> as<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.370> bullet<00:02:13.640> is<00:02:13.730> fired<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:14.270> the

wirelessly on the monitor you see here
we'll<00:02:32.230> start<00:02:32.500> out<00:02:32.620> with<00:02:32.709> five<00:02:32.950> single<00:02:33.400> shots

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
we'll start out with five single shots

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.550 
we'll start out with five single shots
fired<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.209> then<00:02:34.330> go<00:02:34.720> to<00:02:34.780> full<00:02:34.989> auto<00:02:35.020> for<00:02:35.500> the

here<00:03:28.430> we<00:03:28.550> have<00:03:28.640> a<00:03:28.670> few<00:03:28.880> graphs<00:03:29.120> to<00:03:29.330> demonstrate

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
here we have a few graphs to demonstrate

mechanical events in the weapon to

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.449 
mechanical events in the weapon to
better<00:03:37.940> classify<00:03:38.420> performance<00:03:39.250> with<00:03:40.250> this

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
better classify performance with this

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:41.740 
better classify performance with this
you<00:03:40.520> will<00:03:40.819> be<00:03:40.910> able<00:03:41.030> to<00:03:41.120> see<00:03:41.360> how<00:03:41.540> well<00:03:41.690> a

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
you will be able to see how well a

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.420 
you will be able to see how well a
firearm<00:03:42.200> is<00:03:42.290> functioning<00:03:42.770> and<00:03:42.920> what

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
firearm is functioning and what

00:03:43.430 --> 00:04:03.970 
firearm is functioning and what
maintenance<00:03:43.730> it<00:03:44.030> may<00:03:44.150> need

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.960 

here<00:04:04.980> we<00:04:05.130> can<00:04:05.250> see<00:04:05.430> how<00:04:05.550> the<00:04:05.610> barrel

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
here we can see how the barrel

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.490 
here we can see how the barrel
temperature<00:04:06.360> can<00:04:06.540> affect<00:04:06.570> the<00:04:06.990> rate<00:04:07.110> of<00:04:07.170> fire

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
temperature can affect the rate of fire

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.590 
temperature can affect the rate of fire
when<00:04:08.400> we<00:04:08.490> start<00:04:08.730> firing<00:04:08.970> in<00:04:09.270> the<00:04:09.300> barrel

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
when we start firing in the barrel

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.630 
when we start firing in the barrel
temperature<00:04:10.020> is<00:04:10.170> cooler<00:04:10.350> the<00:04:11.130> rate<00:04:11.340> of<00:04:11.370> fire

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
temperature is cooler the rate of fire

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.700 
temperature is cooler the rate of fire
will<00:04:11.880> deviate<00:04:12.180> more<00:04:12.480> shot<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:12.780> shot<00:04:13.110> than<00:04:13.530> when

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
will deviate more shot to shot than when

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.069 
will deviate more shot to shot than when
the<00:04:13.800> barrel<00:04:14.040> is<00:04:14.100> warmed<00:04:14.430> up<00:04:14.600> you<00:04:15.600> can<00:04:15.720> see<00:04:15.870> here

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
the barrel is warmed up you can see here

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.750 
the barrel is warmed up you can see here
as<00:04:16.200> you<00:04:16.290> go<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:16.470> a<00:04:16.530> second<00:04:16.950> 30<00:04:17.130> round<00:04:17.340> magazine

as you go to a second 30 round magazine

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:47.010 
as you go to a second 30 round magazine
the<00:04:18.000> rate<00:04:18.180> of<00:04:18.209> fire<00:04:18.450> is<00:04:18.480> more<00:04:18.900> predictable
