so what we got coming up we have we're
talking<00:00:02.490> social<00:00:02.939> engineering<00:00:03.389> and<00:00:03.659> what<00:00:04.230> that

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
talking social engineering and what that

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.200 
talking social engineering and what that
means<00:00:04.620> is<00:00:04.859> think<00:00:05.130> about<00:00:05.160> it<00:00:05.400> social<00:00:05.850> meaning

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
means is think about it social meaning

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.089 
means is think about it social meaning
using<00:00:06.509> your<00:00:06.660> social<00:00:07.080> skills<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:07.589> engineering

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
using your social skills and engineering

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.070 
using your social skills and engineering
means<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.880> work<00:00:09.120> in<00:00:09.360> ways<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.960> get

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
means to work in ways and get

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.120 
means to work in ways and get
information<00:00:10.230> that<00:00:10.679> you<00:00:10.769> wouldn't<00:00:11.010> normally

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130

basic but it gives you the good ground
where<00:00:18.840> good<00:00:19.020> concept<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.680> exactly<00:00:20.130> how<00:00:20.369> social

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
where good concept is exactly how social

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.090 
where good concept is exactly how social
engineering<00:00:21.510> works<00:00:21.750> it's<00:00:22.140> great<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:22.590> let's

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
engineering works it's great so let's

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.340 
engineering works it's great so let's
check<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.430> out<00:00:23.490> 1230<00:00:24.449> 7pm<00:00:25.019> what<00:00:25.170> does<00:00:25.260> that

acting like I'm with that person now the
most<00:00:36.540> important<00:00:36.989> piece<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.260> information<00:00:37.590> that

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
most important piece of information that

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.680 
most important piece of information that
we're<00:00:38.070> looking<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.730> their<00:00:38.940> name<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.540> we'll

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
we're looking for is their name so we'll

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.000 
we're looking for is their name so we'll
listen<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.170> see<00:00:40.260> what<00:00:40.410> name<00:00:40.590> they<00:00:40.710> place<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
listen and see what name they place the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:59.460 
listen and see what name they place the
order<00:00:41.250> under<00:00:41.370> let's<00:00:41.910> do<00:00:42.059> it

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:10.380 

I<00:00:59.530> guess

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.560 

in<00:01:10.479> a<00:01:10.540> large

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
in a large

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.999 
in a large
very<00:01:12.900> proud

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
very proud

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:21.740 
very proud
half

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:52.319 

the<00:01:21.930> half

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.120 

okay<00:01:53.329> I<00:01:53.359> got<00:01:53.600> his<00:01:53.750> name<00:01:53.960> got<00:01:54.740> what<00:01:54.890> he<00:01:54.950> ordered

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
okay I got his name got what he ordered

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.429 
okay I got his name got what he ordered
got<00:01:55.640> his<00:01:55.759> information<00:01:56.109> let's<00:01:57.109> go<00:01:57.229> make<00:01:57.380> a

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
got his information let's go make a

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.649 
got his information let's go make a
phone<00:01:57.590> call<00:01:58.000> so<00:01:59.000> we're<00:01:59.119> back<00:01:59.149> at<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.509> house

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
phone call so we're back at the house

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.139 
phone call so we're back at the house
phone<00:02:00.200> in<00:02:00.409> hand<00:02:00.649> now<00:02:01.039> what<00:02:01.280> we<00:02:01.429> have<00:02:01.460> to<00:02:01.640> do<00:02:01.909> is

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
phone in hand now what we have to do is

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.080 
phone in hand now what we have to do is
we<00:02:02.479> have<00:02:02.509> to<00:02:02.689> outsmart<00:02:03.409> our<00:02:03.890> target<00:02:04.490> in<00:02:04.640> this

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
we have to outsmart our target in this

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.940 
we have to outsmart our target in this
case<00:02:05.329> our<00:02:05.479> target<00:02:05.780> is<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:05.960> manager<00:02:06.409> of<00:02:06.560> the

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
down all the crucial information that I

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.509 
down all the crucial information that I
need<00:02:12.140> to<00:02:12.170> know<00:02:12.410> when<00:02:12.920> I'm<00:02:13.040> on<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.250> phone

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
need to know when I'm on the phone

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.520 
need to know when I'm on the phone
that's<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.299> time<00:02:14.599> the<00:02:15.080> date<00:02:15.319> that<00:02:15.470> it

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
that's the time the date that it
