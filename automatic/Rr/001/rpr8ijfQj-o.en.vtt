step 1 so first off we're just going to

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.160 
step 1 so first off we're just going to
start<00:01:04.589> off<00:01:04.830> by<00:01:05.369> slicing<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.420> pound<00:01:06.659> cake<00:01:06.930> and

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
what I'm going to do is take a knife and

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.380 
what I'm going to do is take a knife and
I<00:01:09.930> first<00:01:10.170> started<00:01:10.500> off<00:01:10.590> with<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.220> cake<00:01:12.060> cutter

cooling rack and i'm spreading them
evenly<00:05:13.639> apart<00:05:13.909> so<00:05:14.149> that<00:05:14.179> we<00:05:14.419> don't<00:05:14.569> have<00:05:14.929> them

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
evenly apart so that we don't have them

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:24.429 
evenly apart so that we don't have them
too<00:05:15.289> close<00:05:15.439> together<00:05:18.939> step<00:05:19.939> 6<00:05:23.050> okay<00:05:24.050> so<00:05:24.110> now

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:24.439 
too close together step 6 okay so now

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:26.949 
too close together step 6 okay so now
i'm<00:05:24.680> just<00:05:24.979> taking<00:05:25.430> the<00:05:25.819> microwave<00:05:26.240> icing<00:05:26.779> and

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:26.959 
i'm just taking the microwave icing and

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:30.070 
i'm just taking the microwave icing and
drizzling<00:05:27.619> all<00:05:27.949> on<00:05:28.520> top<00:05:28.999> of<00:05:29.240> all<00:05:29.599> of<00:05:29.689> these

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
drizzling all on top of all of these

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.469 
drizzling all on top of all of these
cakes<00:05:30.529> and<00:05:30.889> it's<00:05:31.399> pouring<00:05:31.699> through<00:05:32.089> to<00:05:32.360> the

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
cakes and it's pouring through to the

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.209 
cakes and it's pouring through to the
bottom<00:05:32.869> on<00:05:33.050> the<00:05:33.289> top<00:05:33.469> of<00:05:33.499> the<00:05:33.709> parchment<00:05:33.919> paper

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:34.219 
bottom on the top of the parchment paper

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:36.609 
bottom on the top of the parchment paper
which<00:05:34.789> is<00:05:34.939> okay<00:05:35.330> because<00:05:35.360> you<00:05:35.809> can<00:05:35.990> reuse<00:05:36.409> that

00:05:36.609 --> 00:05:36.619 
which is okay because you can reuse that

00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:38.469 
which is okay because you can reuse that
so<00:05:36.919> once<00:05:37.189> it'll<00:05:37.490> it's<00:05:37.789> going<00:05:37.969> to<00:05:38.029> harden<00:05:38.330> like

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
so once it'll it's going to harden like

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.159 
so once it'll it's going to harden like
really<00:05:38.779> fast<00:05:39.369> so<00:05:40.369> you<00:05:40.459> can<00:05:40.699> just<00:05:40.909> reskin<00:05:41.449> to<00:05:42.139> a

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
really fast so you can just reskin to a

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:43.749 
really fast so you can just reskin to a
bowl<00:05:42.379> and<00:05:42.589> heat<00:05:42.860> it<00:05:42.889> back<00:05:43.009> up<00:05:43.159> so<00:05:43.519> you're<00:05:43.639> not
