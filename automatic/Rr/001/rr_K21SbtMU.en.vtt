00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.330
 Hello, how about youtube friends? 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.959
 say hello to your bow eye friend speak one 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:10.959
 some time ago I made a video where I taught 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:12.279
 how to test laptop chargers and 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:14.680
 I have been asked by several people who 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:16.800
 what do not I do a video where I teach them 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.220
 how laptop batteries are tested 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:26.079
 well on this occasion we are going here to 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:30.699
 approve a laptop battery and then what 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:33.370
 they need is two bits of cable 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:37.240
 solid delgaditos that enter the 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.100
 slots that the battery has and for 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.230
 course in a digital tester 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.860
 selected on the 12 volt scale 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.860
 wish 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.840
 They can use solid wires or needles 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:54.239
 sewing needles whatever they are more 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.000
 easier and in this case I will use 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.150
 the cables what I'm going to do right now is 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.940
 a close walk the slots and I 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.520
 I'm going to tell you the voltages that 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.500
 There on the battery and then will 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.970
 do I'm going to zoom out the camera so that 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.190
 look in the in the tester 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.900
 at this moment you can see 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.630
 perfectly the battery slots 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.000
 true these wide slots here there's no 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.950
 nothing we are going to put the first cable in the 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.320
 second slot of those that are closed 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.000
 and we put this cable quoted folded so a 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.149
 little for one side and the other equal 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.520
 bent for the other side and let's go 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.530
 trying this I'm going to leave here 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.530
 permanent this is the one that I will go 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.780
 moving 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.470
 I'm not going to put it here in the 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.960
 in the second slot to see what voltage 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.400
 there are be very careful so that you do not 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.260
 are going to produce a short and damage the 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:55.360
 drums 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:59.770
 in this slot there is no voltage tested 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.210
 where it goes on and here we have 10 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.030
 volts 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.350
 let's try where he is still there 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.759
 we have another 10 volts 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.759
 we try in the following 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.200
 in this we have 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.950
 here we do not have voltage we tested in this 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.239
 that goes on and here we have the 11 volts 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:30.849
 when the batteries are charged they are 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:33.610
 11 of 11 from 10 to 11 volts that have 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:37.930
 have batteries that are not good 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.880
 and a battery marks them 98 1.8 that 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.040
 means that it is possibly wrong to 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.049
 the battery or you need charge 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.100
 in this other slot we also have the 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:52.650
 11 volts and in this one too 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.360
 in this easy way you try a 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.940
 battery can you find the 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.210
 voltage now I'm going to push away the 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.200
 camera so that the tester looks at the 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.200
 voltage in the tester 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:13.680
 and here we have the voltage 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:17.610
 on land in three slots in this in 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.430
 this and in this are the 11 volts 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.820
 I'm going to take out the cable here, I put it in the 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:29.120
 another slot there we have 11 placed in 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.120
 this other and there we have the 11 volts 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.520
 in this here this being land here 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.380
 there is nothing 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.380
 and in this house are ten volts 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:48.290
 and here we have what we have is land 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:52.370
 so the proper voltage is going to 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.550
 find in those in the three slots that 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.950
 they are on this side 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.950
 from the right side 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.940
 On the right side 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.570
 is where they will find the voltage 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.570
 proper battery 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:18.010
 I hope this video helps you 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:20.560
 people who wanted to know how to try 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.140
 a laptop battery how to find the 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.830
 voltage remember that a dvd battery 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:29.960
 when it 's good it should be 10 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:32.979
 volts above 10 to 11 volts 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:38.169
 if it is at 78 volts then possibly 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:38.169
 whether it's serving us or not loading
