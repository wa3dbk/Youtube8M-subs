now this is a two-year-old step over if

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.750 
now this is a two-year-old step over if
the<00:00:41.150> cameraman<00:00:41.600> can<00:00:41.810> get<00:00:42.190> get<00:00:43.190> down<00:00:43.400> there<00:00:43.640> and

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
to start with free maiden treat it's

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.720 
to start with free maiden treat it's
just<00:01:05.720> a<00:01:05.840> grafted<00:01:06.380> stem<00:01:06.680> it's<00:01:06.950> a<00:01:07.040> one-year-old

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:07.730 
just a grafted stem it's a one-year-old

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
your step overs to be I usually work to

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.080 
your step overs to be I usually work to
about<00:01:22.010> 15<00:01:22.520> inches<00:01:22.729> then<00:01:24.190> just<00:01:25.190> below<00:01:25.850> the

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
about 15 inches then just below the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:34.930 
about 15 inches then just below the
wires<00:01:27.610> cut<00:01:28.610> to<00:01:28.790> a<00:01:28.820> bud<00:01:32.950> you<00:01:33.950> can<00:01:34.130> see<00:01:34.340> it's<00:01:34.550> just

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
wires cut to a bud you can see it's just

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.870 
wires cut to a bud you can see it's just
above<00:01:35.150> a<00:01:35.210> bud<00:01:35.450> at<00:01:35.720> a<00:01:35.780> slant<00:01:36.530> this<00:01:37.430> is<00:01:37.610> to<00:01:37.759> let

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
above a bud at a slant this is to let

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.100 
above a bud at a slant this is to let
the<00:01:38.229> water<00:01:39.229> go<00:01:39.530> off<00:01:39.680> fall<00:01:40.670> off<00:01:40.880> you<00:01:41.810> want<00:01:41.930> to<00:01:41.990> go

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
the water go off fall off you want to go

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.810 
the water go off fall off you want to go
a<00:01:42.140> bit<00:01:42.230> cleaner<00:01:42.590> than<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:44.680> that's<00:01:45.680> all<00:01:45.890> next

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
a bit cleaner than that that's all next

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.480 
a bit cleaner than that that's all next
year<00:01:47.230> these<00:01:48.230> two<00:01:48.470> buds<00:01:48.800> will<00:01:49.040> try<00:01:49.220> to<00:01:49.250> become

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
year these two buds will try to become

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.030 
year these two buds will try to become
dominant<00:01:50.180> and<00:01:50.870> they<00:01:50.960> will<00:01:51.110> put<00:01:51.290> on<00:01:51.320> thumbs

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
dominant and they will put on thumbs

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.899 
dominant and they will put on thumbs
these<00:01:52.909> two<00:01:53.180> arms<00:01:53.780> will<00:01:54.200> be<00:01:55.150> stepovers

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
these two arms will be stepovers

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.370 
these two arms will be stepovers
also<00:01:58.909> it's<00:01:59.180> very<00:01:59.270> important

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
also it's very important

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.090 
also it's very important
pruning<00:02:01.220> wise<00:02:01.400> that<00:02:02.090> every<00:02:02.420> year<00:02:02.780> you<00:02:03.650> reduce

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
pruning wise that every year you reduce

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.550 
pruning wise that every year you reduce
the<00:02:04.370> arms<00:02:04.760> you<00:02:05.540> need<00:02:05.720> to<00:02:05.840> reduce<00:02:06.170> them<00:02:06.380> by<00:02:06.409> a

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
the arms you need to reduce them by a

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.780 
the arms you need to reduce them by a
third<00:02:07.300> if<00:02:08.300> you<00:02:08.959> don't<00:02:09.410> do<00:02:09.619> this<00:02:09.860> what<00:02:10.640> will

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
third if you don't do this what will

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.820 
third if you don't do this what will
happen<00:02:11.090> is<00:02:11.269> you<00:02:11.780> can<00:02:11.930> fill<00:02:12.200> up<00:02:12.320> your<00:02:12.350> space

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
happen is you can fill up your space

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.880 
happen is you can fill up your space
very<00:02:13.340> very<00:02:13.640> quickly<00:02:15.190> but<00:02:16.190> you'll<00:02:16.430> get<00:02:16.700> no

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
very very quickly but you'll get no

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.440 
very very quickly but you'll get no
spurs<00:02:18.890> because<00:02:19.370> it's<00:02:19.549> the<00:02:19.670> Spurs<00:02:19.970> that<00:02:20.299> bear

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
spurs because it's the Spurs that bear

the dormant buds along the stem become

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.660 
the dormant buds along the stem become
active<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.080> next<00:02:27.350> year<00:02:27.560> they<00:02:27.980> all<00:02:28.130> try<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.430> be

so<00:02:43.220> reduce<00:02:44.220> every<00:02:44.640> year<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:45.180> know<00:02:45.390> the

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
so reduce every year I know the

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.720 
so reduce every year I know the
temptation<00:02:46.080> is<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.500> fill<00:02:46.890> up<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.160> whole<00:02:47.310> area

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
temptation is to fill up the whole area

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.660 
temptation is to fill up the whole area
but<00:02:48.570> you'll<00:02:48.780> end<00:02:48.810> up<00:02:49.140> with<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:50.100> load<00:02:50.280> of<00:02:50.310> bear

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
but you'll end up with a load of bear

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.900 
but you'll end up with a load of bear
stem<00:02:51.030> plenty<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:51.930> leaf<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:53.100> only

stem plenty of leaf and the only

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.720 
stem plenty of leaf and the only
fruit<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.300> next<00:02:54.570> year<00:02:54.750> so<00:02:55.590> that's<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.550> way<00:02:56.670> to

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
fruit the next year so that's the way to
