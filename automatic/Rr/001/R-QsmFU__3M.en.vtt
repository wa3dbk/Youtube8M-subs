so I'm gonna show you guys how to get

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.350 
so I'm gonna show you guys how to get
down<00:00:31.619> into<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.279> first<00:00:32.520> step<00:00:32.820> throughout<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
down into the first step throughout the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.900 
down into the first step throughout the
tap<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.140> tap<00:00:34.410> nose<00:00:34.649> all<00:00:35.550> right

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
tap of the tap nose all right

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.799 
tap of the tap nose all right
I<00:00:35.940> vote<00:00:36.540> clockwise<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:38.219> go<00:00:38.370> counterclockwise

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
I vote clockwise you go counterclockwise

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.069 
I vote clockwise you go counterclockwise
mirror<00:00:39.809> my<00:00:40.050> legs<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:41.040> everything<00:00:41.250> else<00:00:42.079> so

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
mirror my legs and everything else so

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:53.350 
mirror my legs and everything else so
they're<00:00:43.230> like<00:00:43.350> force<00:00:43.620> taxis<00:00:44.250> into<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.420> intro

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.580 

it's<00:00:54.360> important<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.989> spilled<00:00:55.289> your

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
it's important that you spilled your

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.490 
it's important that you spilled your
legs<00:00:55.820> like<00:00:56.820> this

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:10.310 

so<00:01:01.520> if<00:01:02.520> motion<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.239> go<00:01:03.390> after<00:01:09.110> second<00:01:10.110> heart

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
so if motion you go after second heart

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
so if motion you go after second heart
after<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.490> tax<00:01:11.729> you'll<00:01:12.720> do<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.020> routine<00:01:13.350> for

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
after the tax you'll do the routine for

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.940 
after the tax you'll do the routine for
the<00:01:14.400> rotation<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.000> may<00:01:15.119> focus<00:01:15.650> I'm<00:01:16.650> gonna

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
the rotation it may focus I'm gonna

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.950 
the rotation it may focus I'm gonna
clockwise<00:01:17.400> once<00:01:17.670> again<00:01:17.880> my<00:01:18.420> focus<00:01:18.630> would<00:01:18.900> be

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
clockwise once again my focus would be

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.240 
clockwise once again my focus would be
my<00:01:19.140> right<00:01:19.409> arm<00:01:20.060> punch<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.210> through<00:01:22.070> just<00:01:23.070> like

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
my right arm punch it through just like

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.240 
my right arm punch it through just like
how<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.400> do<00:01:23.549> baby<00:01:23.790> knows<00:01:24.060> they<00:01:24.240> got<00:01:24.390> big<00:01:24.570> nose

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
how you do baby knows they got big nose

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.700 
how you do baby knows they got big nose
mission

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
mission

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:43.210 
mission
so<00:01:28.340> as<00:01:28.490> you<00:01:28.700> tap<00:01:32.500> lift<00:01:33.500> up<00:01:39.400> our<00:01:42.190> focus

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
so as you tap lift up our focus

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.250 
so as you tap lift up our focus
hopefully<00:01:43.610> legs<00:01:43.910> back<00:01:44.120> up<00:01:44.300> again<00:01:44.540> like<00:01:45.080> I<00:01:45.200> said

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
hopefully legs back up again like I said

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.500 
hopefully legs back up again like I said
earlier<00:01:45.800> the<00:01:46.370> scissoring<00:01:46.700> is<00:01:46.910> very<00:01:47.150> important

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
earlier the scissoring is very important

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.900 
earlier the scissoring is very important
because<00:01:47.660> when<00:01:48.350> you<00:01:48.530> come<00:01:48.710> back<00:01:48.830> around<00:01:49.100> in<00:01:49.520> one

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
because when you come back around in one

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:59.170 
because when you come back around in one
of<00:01:50.030> centers<00:01:53.440> notation<00:01:54.940> so<00:01:57.100> scissors<00:01:58.180> every

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
of centers notation so scissors every

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:15.300 
of centers notation so scissors every
time<00:01:59.390> you<00:01:59.510> land<00:01:59.690> so<00:02:00.200> in<00:02:00.320> motion<00:02:03.610> just<00:02:04.610> wake<00:02:04.790> up

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.770 

you've<00:02:16.310> been<00:02:16.400> practicing<00:02:16.550> it<00:02:17.030> use<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.630> aux

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
you've been practicing it use the aux

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.110 
you've been practicing it use the aux
together<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:19.040> quick<00:02:19.250> run<00:02:19.430> down<00:02:19.459> to<00:02:19.760> this

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
together the quick run down to this

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.880 
together the quick run down to this
we're<00:02:20.450> stuff<00:02:20.630> that<00:02:20.780> I<00:02:20.840> talked<00:02:21.050> to<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:21.200> do<00:02:21.800> the

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
coin drop room and scissor it

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.340 
coin drop room and scissor it
back<00:02:25.730> up<00:02:25.940> in<00:02:26.480> order<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:26.840> prepare<00:02:27.140> for<00:02:27.290> your

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
next rotation so here's how it looks

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:42.149 
next rotation so here's how it looks
like

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.880
