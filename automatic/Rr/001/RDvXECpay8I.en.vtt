00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
being effective does not necessarily

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.880 
being effective does not necessarily
mean<00:01:03.090> being<00:01:03.270> exciting<00:01:03.780> exacting<00:01:04.199> that's<00:01:04.350> what

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890

Mayweather<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.460> most<00:01:06.090> important<00:01:06.420> made<00:01:06.540> with

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
Mayweather is a most important made with

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.450 
Mayweather is a most important made with
his<00:01:06.750> career<00:01:07.020> has<00:01:07.320> been<00:01:07.560> based<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:08.280> that

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
his career has been based on that

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.760 
his career has been based on that
analysis<00:01:09.060> he's<00:01:09.659> been<00:01:09.810> very<00:01:10.049> effective<00:01:10.170> but<00:01:10.650> if

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
analysis he's been very effective but if

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.020 
analysis he's been very effective but if
you<00:01:10.830> got<00:01:10.950> any<00:01:11.040> sole<00:01:11.250> factor<00:01:11.640> it's<00:01:11.790> not<00:01:11.880> always

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
you got any sole factor it's not always

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.910 
you got any sole factor it's not always
exciting<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:13.140> think<00:01:13.500> we'll<00:01:13.680> see<00:01:13.799> if

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.469 
exciting and so I think we'll see if

some fights where Mayweather tends to
fight<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> little<00:01:22.080> bit<00:01:22.290> more<00:01:22.470> like<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.710> did

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830

with photo Madonna first we've seen

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.350 
with photo Madonna first we've seen
other<00:01:25.080> fights<00:01:25.350> when<00:01:25.560> he<00:01:25.619> comes<00:01:25.830> into<00:01:26.009> boxes<00:01:26.580> do

other fights when he comes into boxes do

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.819 
other fights when he comes into boxes do

you expect Mayweather to be on his
bicycle<00:01:29.280> kind<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.640> moving<00:01:29.820> more<00:01:30.119> or<00:01:30.420> are<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
bicycle kind of moving more or are the

inspector<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.560> think<00:01:31.799> somebody<00:01:31.950> like<00:01:32.189> whoa<00:01:32.310> to

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
inspector I think somebody like whoa to

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.859 
inspector I think somebody like whoa to
force<00:01:32.670> me<00:01:32.850> whether<00:01:33.060> find<00:01:33.360> more<00:01:33.479> they<00:01:33.600> wanted

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
force me whether find more they wanted

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.149 
force me whether find more they wanted
to<00:01:33.960> assemble<00:01:34.259> something<00:01:34.439> like<00:01:34.590> Madonna<00:01:34.860> force

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
to assemble something like Madonna force

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.550 
to assemble something like Madonna force
me<00:01:35.310> whether<00:01:35.490> if<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.700> more<00:01:35.909> they<00:01:36.000> wanted<00:01:36.329> to

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
me whether if I more they wanted to

I<00:01:36.680> think<00:01:37.640> when<00:01:37.790> boy<00:01:38.659> fights<00:01:38.960> a<00:01:39.020> dangerous

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
I think when boy fights a dangerous

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.980 
I think when boy fights a dangerous
puncher<00:01:39.740> he<00:01:39.890> doesn't<00:01:40.220> he<00:01:41.119> doesn't<00:01:41.149> fight<00:01:41.810> with

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
puncher he doesn't he doesn't fight with

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.660 
puncher he doesn't he doesn't fight with
them<00:01:42.140> by<00:01:42.290> choice<00:01:42.590> I<00:01:42.860> think<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.369> fights<00:01:43.610> that

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
them by choice I think the fights that

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.039 
them by choice I think the fights that
he's<00:01:43.820> taking<00:01:44.060> on<00:01:44.119> by<00:01:44.270> choice<00:01:44.509> for<00:01:44.720> he<00:01:44.810> got<00:01:44.930> hit

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
he's taking on by choice for he got hit

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.020 
he's taking on by choice for he got hit
a<00:01:45.079> little<00:01:45.200> bit<00:01:45.350> more<00:01:45.530> early<00:01:46.220> on<00:01:46.250> it's<00:01:46.460> created

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
a little bit more early on it's created

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.060 
a little bit more early on it's created
democracy<00:01:47.659> you<00:01:48.409> know<00:01:48.470> I<00:01:48.530> think<00:01:48.590> made<00:01:48.920> that

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
democracy you know I think made that

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.580 
democracy you know I think made that
choice<00:01:49.220> to<00:01:49.399> fight<00:01:49.549> that<00:01:49.670> way<00:01:50.170> Manuel<00:01:51.170> Augustus

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
choice to fight that way Manuel Augustus

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.870 
choice to fight that way Manuel Augustus
you<00:01:51.770> made<00:01:51.979> that<00:01:52.100> choice<00:01:52.159> to<00:01:52.399> fight<00:01:52.549> that<00:01:52.700> way

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
you made that choice to fight that way

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.389 
you made that choice to fight that way
but<00:01:53.720> um<00:01:53.869> I<00:01:54.080> think<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:54.409> heavier<00:01:54.710> punchers<00:01:55.159> I

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
but um I think the heavier punchers I

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.190 
but um I think the heavier punchers I
don't<00:01:56.149> think<00:01:56.270> it<00:01:56.330> makes<00:01:56.479> that<00:01:56.689> choice<00:01:56.720> I<00:01:57.049> think

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
don't think it makes that choice I think

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.330 
don't think it makes that choice I think
they're<00:01:57.320> good<00:01:57.560> enough<00:01:57.649> fighters<00:01:58.070> they've

market style knockout but what it'll do
is<00:02:24.380> it'll<00:02:24.500> disrupt<00:02:24.830> your<00:02:25.010> time<00:02:25.220> here<00:02:25.489> you<00:02:25.640> get

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
won't get the combination or you may

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.780 
won't get the combination or you may
only<00:02:30.230> get<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.530> first<00:02:30.709> or<00:02:31.010> two<00:02:31.190> she<00:02:31.310> wears<00:02:31.640> one

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.539 
or two shots of the combination off and
then<00:02:33.170> it'll<00:02:33.319> fizzle<00:02:33.500> out<00:02:33.739> because<00:02:34.069> you<00:02:34.459> know

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
then it'll fizzle out because you know

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.160 
then it'll fizzle out because you know
you<00:02:34.640> got<00:02:34.760> disrupted<00:02:35.000> with<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.450> change<00:02:36.049> of

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
you got disrupted with a change of

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.300 
you got disrupted with a change of
distance<00:02:36.530> or<00:02:36.620> you<00:02:36.680> got<00:02:36.799> disrupted<00:02:36.980> with<00:02:37.280> a

counter<00:02:37.580> pot<00:02:37.730> shot<00:02:37.970> or<00:02:38.090> whatnot<00:02:38.209> so<00:02:38.599> I<00:02:38.900> think

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
counter pot shot or whatnot so I think

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.300 
counter pot shot or whatnot so I think
