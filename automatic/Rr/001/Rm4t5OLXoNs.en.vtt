there's a pedo the folks here on the
sign<00:00:55.140> that's<00:00:55.410> how<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.770> start<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.190> start

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
sign that's how it start to start

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.010 
sign that's how it start to start
peddling<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.059> then<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.239> magneto<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.960> know

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
peddling and then the magneto you know

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.119 
peddling and then the magneto you know
fix<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.500> fix<00:00:58.559> it
