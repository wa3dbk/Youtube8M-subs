00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
you're always going to want but maybe

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.160 
you're always going to want but maybe
your<00:01:20.759> emails<00:01:21.090> perhaps<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.840> just<00:01:21.930> want<00:01:22.020> to

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
your emails perhaps you just want to

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.359 
your emails perhaps you just want to
check<00:01:22.320> your<00:01:22.409> emails<00:01:22.740> yourself<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.310> can

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
check your emails yourself so you can

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.910 
check your emails yourself so you can
turn<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.729> push<00:01:23.880> notifications<00:01:24.659> off<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:25.740> your

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
emails like that and then you obviously

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.670 
emails like that and then you obviously
your<00:01:33.119> device<00:01:33.570> won't<00:01:33.689> always<00:01:34.020> be<00:01:34.170> searching

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
the auto lock two minutes is the minimum

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.639 
the auto lock two minutes is the minimum
it<00:01:48.390> can<00:01:48.540> have<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:49.079> that's<00:01:50.009> fine<00:01:51.320> if<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.380> go

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
it can have so that's fine if you go

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.859 
it can have so that's fine if you go
into<00:01:52.799> your<00:01:53.250> sounds<00:01:53.850> perhaps<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.600> don't<00:01:54.689> want

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
into your sounds perhaps you don't want

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.459 
into your sounds perhaps you don't want
your<00:01:54.960> volume<00:01:55.290> as<00:01:55.409> loud<00:01:55.649> or<00:01:56.280> as<00:01:57.200> poor<00:01:58.200> as<00:01:58.320> it

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
your volume as loud or as poor as it

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.039 
your volume as loud or as poor as it
comes<00:01:58.649> on<00:01:58.799> default<00:01:59.159> but<00:01:59.340> what<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.490> do<00:01:59.930> flip<00:02:00.930> the

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
comes on default but what I do flip the

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.630 
comes on default but what I do flip the
cylon<00:02:01.380> switch<00:02:01.590> on<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.950> never<00:02:02.219> really<00:02:02.490> want

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
cylon switch on I never really want

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.700 
cylon switch on I never really want
sounds<00:02:03.149> unless<00:02:03.360> I'm<00:02:03.479> listening<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.899> music<00:02:04.290> and

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
sounds unless I'm listening to music and

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.889 
sounds unless I'm listening to music and
even<00:02:04.979> then<00:02:05.100> if<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.430> lock<00:02:05.729> my<00:02:05.850> headphones<00:02:06.240> in<00:02:06.420> so

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
even then if I lock my headphones in so

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.290 
even then if I lock my headphones in so
that<00:02:06.990> helps<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.380> save<00:02:07.619> power<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.280> by<00:02:08.550> making

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
that helps to save power is by making

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.449 
that helps to save power is by making
sure<00:02:09.330> there's<00:02:09.509> no<00:02:09.599> sound<00:02:10.039> another<00:02:11.039> thing<00:02:11.310> I

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
sure there's no sound another thing I

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.640 
sure there's no sound another thing I
turn<00:02:11.670> auto-brightness<00:02:12.180> off

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
turn auto-brightness off

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.530 
turn auto-brightness off
and<00:02:13.800> then<00:02:14.129> I<00:02:14.400> bring<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:14.970> brightness<00:02:15.330> down<00:02:15.360> a

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and then I bring the brightness down a

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.420 
and then I bring the brightness down a
bit<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:15.930> don't<00:02:16.470> need<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.739> brightness<00:02:17.069> on<00:02:17.160> fault

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
bit I don't need the brightness on fault

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.979 
bit I don't need the brightness on fault
I<00:02:17.519> can<00:02:17.670> still<00:02:17.849> see<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.090> screen<00:02:18.390> really<00:02:18.870> well

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
I can still see the screen really well

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.680 
I can still see the screen really well
perhaps<00:02:19.260> that's<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.650> bit<00:02:19.860> too<00:02:20.040> dark<00:02:20.280> but<00:02:20.690> it's

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
perhaps that's a bit too dark but it's

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.699 
perhaps that's a bit too dark but it's
still<00:02:21.930> more<00:02:22.650> than<00:02:22.769> usable<00:02:23.129> like<00:02:23.700> this<00:02:24.709> so

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
still more than usable like this so

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.140 
still more than usable like this so
