00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.830 

changing<00:00:05.640> I<00:00:05.730> colors<00:00:06.090> is<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.240> pretty<00:00:06.540> easy<00:00:06.720> job

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:06.840 
changing I colors is a pretty easy job

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.900 
changing I colors is a pretty easy job
to<00:00:07.229> go<00:00:07.350> through<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:07.890> there's<00:00:08.549> a<00:00:08.610> couple<00:00:08.760> of

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
to go through and there's a couple of

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.340 
to go through and there's a couple of
different<00:00:09.180> methods<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.600> you<00:00:09.809> can<00:00:09.840> use<00:00:10.049> for

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:10.350 
different methods that you can use for

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.190 
different methods that you can use for
it<00:00:10.650> in<00:00:10.770> fact<00:00:11.070> it's<00:00:11.309> argued<00:00:12.150> quite<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.660> lot<00:00:12.960> out

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
it in fact it's argued quite a lot out

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.810 
it in fact it's argued quite a lot out
on<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.530> message<00:00:13.800> boards<00:00:14.099> about<00:00:14.190> which<00:00:14.490> method

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
on the message boards about which method

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.249 
on the message boards about which method
is<00:00:14.880> best<00:00:15.030> so<00:00:15.240> I'll<00:00:15.360> show<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.630> two<00:00:15.929> methods

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:16.259 
is best so I'll show you two methods

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:19.130 
is best so I'll show you two methods
which<00:00:16.380> I<00:00:16.529> think<00:00:16.770> work<00:00:17.009> extremely<00:00:17.580> well<00:00:18.140> first

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
which I think work extremely well first

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.929 
which I think work extremely well first
of<00:00:19.259> all<00:00:19.320> we<00:00:19.529> need<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.800> make<00:00:19.950> a<00:00:19.980> selection<00:00:20.310> we

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
of all we need to make a selection we

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.460 
of all we need to make a selection we
don't<00:00:21.119> have<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.300> do<00:00:21.419> anything<00:00:21.599> terribly<00:00:22.050> fancy

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
don't have to do anything terribly fancy

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.740 
don't have to do anything terribly fancy
I'm<00:00:22.649> just<00:00:22.980> going<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.250> use<00:00:23.489> a<00:00:23.750> elliptical

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
I'm just going to use a elliptical

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.609 
I'm just going to use a elliptical
marquee<00:00:25.470> tool<00:00:25.739> and<00:00:26.090> make<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.619> generally

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
marquee tool and make a generally

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.370 
marquee tool and make a generally
correct<00:00:28.860> a<00:00:29.189> roughly<00:00:29.610> correct<00:00:29.790> selection

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
correct a roughly correct selection

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.720 
correct a roughly correct selection
around<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:32.009> eye<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.759> be<00:00:33.149> changed<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.730> even

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
around the eye to be changed and even

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.070 
around the eye to be changed and even
though<00:00:35.820> it's<00:00:35.969> not<00:00:36.059> terribly<00:00:36.510> accurate<00:00:36.870> it's

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
though it's not terribly accurate it's

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.270 
though it's not terribly accurate it's
all<00:00:37.230> right<00:00:37.410> because<00:00:37.620> we're<00:00:37.980> going<00:00:38.130> to<00:00:38.220> be

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
all right because we're going to be

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.760 
all right because we're going to be
using<00:00:38.490> some<00:00:38.790> layer<00:00:39.240> masks<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:39.990> this<00:00:40.380> exercise

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
using some layer masks in this exercise

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.160 
using some layer masks in this exercise
so<00:00:41.580> we<00:00:41.700> can<00:00:41.820> correct<00:00:41.970> it<00:00:42.210> after<00:00:43.050> we're

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
so we can correct it after we're

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.190 
so we can correct it after we're
finished<00:00:43.200> with<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.190> IH<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.580> color<00:00:44.820> change<00:00:45.200> now

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
finished with the IH a color change now

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.890 
finished with the IH a color change now
the<00:00:46.800> best<00:00:46.980> method<00:00:47.480> well<00:00:48.480> we'll<00:00:48.600> try<00:00:48.780> this

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
the best method well we'll try this

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.840 
the best method well we'll try this
method<00:00:49.260> first<00:00:49.530> go<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.040> new<00:00:50.460> adjustment

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
method first go to the new adjustment

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.110 
method first go to the new adjustment
layer<00:00:51.000> button<00:00:51.150> and<00:00:51.829> place<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.190> solid<00:00:53.610> color

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
layer button and place in a solid color

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.810 
layer button and place in a solid color
layer<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:55.380> is<00:00:55.560> the<00:00:55.710> same<00:00:55.920> technique<00:00:56.340> we<00:00:56.520> use

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
layer this is the same technique we use

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.270 
layer this is the same technique we use
for<00:00:57.120> hair<00:00:57.810> color<00:00:58.050> changes<00:01:00.920> from<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.100> color

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
for hair color changes from the color

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.020 
for hair color changes from the color
picker<00:01:02.520> just<00:01:02.940> increase<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:04.369> saturation<00:01:05.369> and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
picker just increase the saturation and

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.520 
picker just increase the saturation and
lightness<00:01:06.180> control<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:06.869> we<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:06.990> actually<00:01:07.140> see

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
lightness control so we can actually see

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.310 
lightness control so we can actually see
the<00:01:07.710> colors<00:01:07.979> just<00:01:08.880> drag<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.360> off<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:10.170> one

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
the colors just drag this off to one

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.890 
the colors just drag this off to one
side<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.620> little<00:01:11.130> bit<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.330> can<00:01:12.390> see<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.870> eye

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
side a little bit so you can see the eye

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.680 
side a little bit so you can see the eye
and<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.350> just<00:01:14.100> simply<00:01:14.340> pick<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.120> color<00:01:15.330> that

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
and you just simply pick the color that

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.560 
and you just simply pick the color that
you're<00:01:15.870> interested<00:01:16.050> in<00:01:16.290> using<00:01:16.530> for<00:01:17.370> the<00:01:17.520> eye

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
you're interested in using for the eye

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.440 
you're interested in using for the eye
so<00:01:18.570> I'm<00:01:18.659> using<00:01:18.870> a<00:01:19.050> fairly<00:01:19.620> bright<00:01:19.920> blue<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.580> it

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
so I'm using a fairly bright blue and it

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.789 
so I'm using a fairly bright blue and it
looks<00:01:21.630> terrible<00:01:22.080> but<00:01:22.110> don't<00:01:22.440> worry<00:01:22.650> about

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
looks terrible but don't worry about

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.260 
looks terrible but don't worry about
that<00:01:23.010> we're<00:01:23.280> going<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.580> fix<00:01:23.760> that<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.120> moment

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
that we're going to fix that in a moment

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.700 
that we're going to fix that in a moment
and<00:01:24.540> say<00:01:24.890> okay<00:01:26.210> just<00:01:27.210> really<00:01:27.810> okay<00:01:27.930> there<00:01:28.320> and

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
and say okay just really okay there and

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.880 
and say okay just really okay there and
don't<00:01:29.930> let<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:30.990> get<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.260> to<00:01:31.440> work<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.770> need

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
don't let it get this to work you need

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.550 
don't let it get this to work you need
to<00:01:32.400> then<00:01:32.430> change<00:01:32.580> the<00:01:33.150> blending<00:01:33.690> mode<00:01:33.720> for<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
to then change the blending mode for the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.240 
to then change the blending mode for the
layer<00:01:35.090> so<00:01:36.090> go<00:01:36.360> from<00:01:36.720> normal<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.950> either

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
layer so go from normal to either

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.060 
layer so go from normal to either
overlay<00:01:39.240> which<00:01:39.990> gives<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> very<00:01:40.590> strong

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
overlay which gives you a very strong

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.109 
overlay which gives you a very strong
mixed<00:01:41.640> version<00:01:43.190> soft<00:01:44.190> light<00:01:44.430> which<00:01:44.729> we<00:01:44.909> also

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
mixed version soft light which we also

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.120 
mixed version soft light which we also
use<00:01:45.510> for<00:01:45.750> hair<00:01:45.990> colors<00:01:46.320> because<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.710> shows<00:01:46.950> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
use for hair colors because it shows the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.340 
use for hair colors because it shows the
underlying<00:01:47.700> textures<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.390> shadows<00:01:49.049> very

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
underlying textures and shadows very

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.390 
underlying textures and shadows very
well<00:01:49.590> or<00:01:50.580> color<00:01:51.680> color<00:01:52.680> will<00:01:52.830> also<00:01:53.189> show<00:01:53.369> you

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
well or color color will also show you

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.370 
well or color color will also show you
the<00:01:53.610> underlying<00:01:54.119> shadows<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.600> textures<00:01:54.930> but

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
the underlying shadows and textures but

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.770 
the underlying shadows and textures but
give<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.650> a<00:01:55.680> slightly<00:01:56.250> brighter

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
give you a slightly brighter

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.760 
give you a slightly brighter
representation<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.930> color<00:01:57.960> chosen<00:01:58.409> in

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
representation of the color chosen in

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.289 
representation of the color chosen in
fact<00:01:58.979> that's<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.220> closest<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.939> original

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
fact that's the closest to the original

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.539 
fact that's the closest to the original
color<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:01.290> i<00:02:01.320> just<00:02:01.560> might<00:02:01.680> stick<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.070> color<00:02:02.280> for

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
color so i just might stick to color for

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.960 
color so i just might stick to color for
this<00:02:02.700> exercise<00:02:03.320> all<00:02:04.320> right<00:02:04.560> now<00:02:04.830> for<00:02:05.280> getting

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
this exercise all right now for getting

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.759 
this exercise all right now for getting
this<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.330> look<00:02:07.340> accurate<00:02:08.689> the<00:02:09.689> opacity<00:02:10.110> needs

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
this to look accurate the opacity needs

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.489 
this to look accurate the opacity needs
to<00:02:10.979> be<00:02:11.069> adjusted<00:02:11.209> it's<00:02:12.209> often<00:02:12.569> far<00:02:12.900> too<00:02:13.139> bright

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:13.499 
to be adjusted it's often far too bright

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.860 
to be adjusted it's often far too bright
now<00:02:13.799> the<00:02:14.279> opacity<00:02:14.609> can<00:02:14.999> be<00:02:15.120> just<00:02:15.329> in<00:02:15.510> two<00:02:15.689> ways

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
now the opacity can be just in two ways

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.750 
now the opacity can be just in two ways
you<00:02:15.900> can<00:02:16.049> just<00:02:16.349> use<00:02:16.499> the<00:02:16.650> opacity<00:02:16.950> slider

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
you can just use the opacity slider

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.789 
you can just use the opacity slider
on<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:18.120> layer<00:02:18.330> itself<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:19.470> then<00:02:19.620> just

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
on the layer itself and then just

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.530 
on the layer itself and then just
gradually<00:02:20.159> dial<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:20.849> the<00:02:20.879> amount<00:02:21.209> of<00:02:21.299> blur

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
gradually dial in the amount of blur

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.110 
gradually dial in the amount of blur
that<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.840> want<00:02:22.019> to<00:02:22.079> adjust<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:23.120> perfectly

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
that you want to adjust in perfectly

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.500 
that you want to adjust in perfectly
reasonable<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:25.230> other<00:02:25.409> way<00:02:25.709> is<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.849> use<00:02:26.879> the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
reasonable the other way is to use the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.720 
reasonable the other way is to use the
color<00:02:27.930> adjustment<00:02:28.560> layer<00:02:28.709> itself<00:02:29.099> just

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
color adjustment layer itself just

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.660 
color adjustment layer itself just
double-click<00:02:30.150> on<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.299> thumbnail<00:02:31.579> bring<00:02:32.579> it

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
double-click on the thumbnail bring it

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.130 
double-click on the thumbnail bring it
back<00:02:32.760> into<00:02:32.970> position<00:02:33.150> so<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.629> can<00:02:33.780> see<00:02:34.019> what

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
back into position so you can see what

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.970 
back into position so you can see what
we're<00:02:34.290> doing<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:35.150> use<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.980> brightness

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
we're doing and use the brightness

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.830 
we're doing and use the brightness
slider<00:02:38.129> it<00:02:38.310> works<00:02:38.610> effectively<00:02:39.030> like<00:02:39.629> an

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
slider it works effectively like an

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.170 
slider it works effectively like an
opacity<00:02:40.140> slider<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.980> it's<00:02:41.370> dynamic<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.060> can

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
opacity slider and it's dynamic you can

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.759 
opacity slider and it's dynamic you can
see<00:02:42.390> that<00:02:42.420> as<00:02:42.599> it<00:02:42.720> happens<00:02:43.049> as<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.319> dial<00:02:43.650> it

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
see that as it happens as you dial it

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.099 
see that as it happens as you dial it
down<00:02:43.909> you<00:02:44.909> increase<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.629> amount<00:02:46.019> of

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
down you increase the amount of

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.679 
down you increase the amount of
saturation<00:02:46.680> it's<00:02:47.670> happening<00:02:48.150> for<00:02:48.269> that<00:02:48.450> color

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
saturation it's happening for that color

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:50.720 
saturation it's happening for that color
so<00:02:49.260> either<00:02:49.500> one<00:02:49.769> of<00:02:49.799> those<00:02:49.950> methods<00:02:50.159> is<00:02:50.489> fine

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
so either one of those methods is fine

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.039 
so either one of those methods is fine
if<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.090> don't<00:02:51.120> want<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.510> fool<00:02:51.629> around<00:02:51.690> with

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
if you don't want to fool around with

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.020 
if you don't want to fool around with
the<00:02:52.170> layer<00:02:52.409> opacity<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:53.370> can<00:02:53.549> do<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:53.790> all

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
the layer opacity you can do it all

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.270 
the layer opacity you can do it all
inside<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.659> the<00:02:54.750> color<00:02:54.959> picker<00:02:55.200> by<00:02:55.709> using<00:02:55.950> the

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
inside of the color picker by using the

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.990 
inside of the color picker by using the
color<00:02:56.489> and<00:02:56.760> by<00:02:57.239> using<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:58.760> slider<00:02:59.760> at<00:02:59.970> the

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
color and by using the slider at the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.229 
color and by using the slider at the
side<00:03:00.269> to<00:03:00.450> control<00:03:00.870> its<00:03:01.049> saturation<00:03:02.060> so<00:03:03.060> I'll

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
side to control its saturation so I'll

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.069 
side to control its saturation so I'll
settle<00:03:03.540> on<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:03.959> I<00:03:03.989> think<00:03:06.079> perfectly

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
settle on that I think perfectly

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.949 
settle on that I think perfectly
reasonable<00:03:07.940> okay<00:03:08.940> cleaning<00:03:09.420> up<00:03:09.510> because

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
reasonable okay cleaning up because

reasonable okay cleaning up because
we've<00:03:10.349> used<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.620> layer<00:03:10.799> mask<00:03:11.099> I'll<00:03:12.060> just<00:03:12.209> show

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
we've used the layer mask I'll just show

so I'll take a brush tool click on the

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.960 
so I'll take a brush tool click on the
adjustment<00:03:33.090> layer<00:03:34.010> make<00:03:35.010> sure<00:03:35.250> I'm<00:03:35.489> loaded<00:03:35.879> up

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
adjustment layer make sure I'm loaded up

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.729 
adjustment layer make sure I'm loaded up
with<00:03:36.150> black<00:03:36.690> paint<00:03:37.019> because<00:03:37.319> I'm<00:03:37.530> going<00:03:37.650> to

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
with black paint because I'm going to

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.250 
with black paint because I'm going to
take<00:03:37.919> out<00:03:38.220> this<00:03:38.519> extra<00:03:39.299> little<00:03:39.329> piece<00:03:39.750> of<00:03:39.989> blue

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
take out this extra little piece of blue

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.000 
take out this extra little piece of blue
that<00:03:40.530> I<00:03:40.739> do<00:03:40.799> not<00:03:41.220> want<00:03:41.579> to<00:03:41.639> have<00:03:42.859> so<00:03:43.859> we'll<00:03:43.980> just

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
that I do not want to have so we'll just

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.180 
that I do not want to have so we'll just
go<00:03:44.340> here<00:03:44.699> and<00:03:44.879> just<00:03:45.870> paint<00:03:46.139> that<00:03:46.410> across<00:03:46.680> very

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
go here and just paint that across very

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.449 
go here and just paint that across very
simple<00:03:47.730> very<00:03:49.010> flexible<00:03:50.010> when<00:03:50.099> you<00:03:50.190> do<00:03:50.280> it<00:03:50.370> this

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
simple very flexible when you do it this

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.000 
simple very flexible when you do it this
way<00:03:50.639> because<00:03:50.790> you<00:03:51.120> can<00:03:51.349> manually<00:03:52.349> adjust<00:03:52.470> it

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
way because you can manually adjust it

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.740 
way because you can manually adjust it
quite<00:03:53.879> easily<00:03:54.530> now<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.620> iris<00:03:56.280> I'll<00:03:57.269> just

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
quite easily now the iris I'll just

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.800 
quite easily now the iris I'll just
adjust<00:03:57.900> this<00:03:58.319> by<00:03:58.560> increasing<00:03:59.040> my<00:03:59.160> brush<00:03:59.370> size

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.039 

just<00:04:03.810> reduce<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:04.889> there<00:04:05.389> I'll<00:04:06.389> just<00:04:06.780> take

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
just reduce that there I'll just take

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.879 
just reduce that there I'll just take
out<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.319> iris<00:04:07.889> app<00:04:08.190> we<00:04:08.940> get<00:04:09.120> that<00:04:09.239> detail<00:04:09.629> back

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:09.889 
out the iris app we get that detail back

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.979 
out the iris app we get that detail back
now<00:04:10.889> I've<00:04:11.099> also<00:04:11.430> lost<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.449> little<00:04:12.720> bit<00:04:12.930> of

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
now I've also lost a little bit of

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.890 
now I've also lost a little bit of
detail<00:04:13.650> over<00:04:13.949> here<00:04:14.359> so<00:04:15.359> I<00:04:15.389> need<00:04:15.629> to<00:04:15.720> put<00:04:15.840> that

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
detail over here so I need to put that

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.080 
detail over here so I need to put that
back<00:04:16.229> in<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:16.680> I<00:04:17.070> do<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.340> exact<00:04:17.579> opposite<00:04:17.909> I

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
back in and I do the exact opposite I

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.300 
back in and I do the exact opposite I
just<00:04:18.359> switch<00:04:18.659> to<00:04:18.989> white<00:04:19.409> paint<00:04:19.799> because<00:04:20.039> I'm

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
just switch to white paint because I'm

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.850 
just switch to white paint because I'm
still<00:04:20.489> working<00:04:20.880> on<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.560> adjustment<00:04:22.560> layer

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
still working on the adjustment layer

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.000 
still working on the adjustment layer
mask<00:04:23.330> and<00:04:24.330> just<00:04:24.510> reduce<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:24.930> brush<00:04:25.500> size<00:04:25.530> and

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
mask and just reduce the brush size and

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.029 
mask and just reduce the brush size and
I'm<00:04:26.520> adding<00:04:26.880> in<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.030> white<00:04:27.360> to<00:04:27.690> add<00:04:27.990> in<00:04:28.200> to

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
I'm adding in the white to add in to

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.610 
I'm adding in the white to add in to
that<00:04:29.250> layer<00:04:29.610> mask<00:04:29.940> so<00:04:30.750> you<00:04:30.870> can<00:04:31.020> add<00:04:31.200> in

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
that layer mask so you can add in

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.939 
that layer mask so you can add in
tracked<00:04:31.830> using<00:04:32.790> black<00:04:33.180> and<00:04:33.360> white<00:04:33.570> very<00:04:34.530> handy

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
tracked using black and white very handy

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.120 
tracked using black and white very handy
and<00:04:34.979> very<00:04:35.340> easy<00:04:35.550> to<00:04:35.699> do<00:04:36.530> I'm<00:04:37.530> just<00:04:37.650> back<00:04:37.919> out<00:04:38.070> a

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
and very easy to do I'm just back out a

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.740 
and very easy to do I'm just back out a
little<00:04:38.190> bit<00:04:39.949> so<00:04:40.949> you<00:04:41.010> can<00:04:41.130> judge<00:04:41.490> for<00:04:41.639> yourself

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
little bit so you can judge for yourself

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.070 
little bit so you can judge for yourself
does<00:04:42.750> it<00:04:42.930> look<00:04:43.050> good<00:04:43.290> well<00:04:44.130> the<00:04:44.310> edges<00:04:44.760> around

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
does it look good well the edges around

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.300 
does it look good well the edges around
that<00:04:46.080> mask<00:04:47.660> might<00:04:48.660> be<00:04:48.870> a<00:04:48.900> little<00:04:49.229> bit<00:04:49.470> hard<00:04:49.740> so

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
that mask might be a little bit hard so

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.520 
that mask might be a little bit hard so
what's<00:04:50.669> a<00:04:50.790> good<00:04:50.970> idea<00:04:51.360> for<00:04:51.570> you<00:04:51.900> to<00:04:51.930> consider

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
what's a good idea for you to consider

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.770 
what's a good idea for you to consider
is<00:04:53.130> to<00:04:53.400> blur<00:04:53.639> it<00:04:53.669> a<00:04:53.910> little<00:04:54.120> bit<00:04:54.389> now<00:04:54.540> you<00:04:54.600> can

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
is to blur it a little bit now you can

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.689 
is to blur it a little bit now you can
blur<00:04:55.050> it<00:04:55.169> using<00:04:55.440> a<00:04:55.500> Gaussian<00:04:55.949> blur<00:04:56.100> or<00:04:56.340> you<00:04:56.520> can

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
blur it using a Gaussian blur or you can

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.150 
blur it using a Gaussian blur or you can
blur<00:04:56.910> it<00:04:57.060> manually<00:04:57.600> using<00:04:58.410> the<00:04:58.710> blur<00:04:58.889> tool

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
blur it manually using the blur tool

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.000 
blur it manually using the blur tool
from<00:04:59.550> the<00:04:59.690> toolbox<00:05:00.690> to<00:05:00.840> the<00:05:00.930> site<00:05:01.139> either<00:05:01.710> way

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
from the toolbox to the site either way

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.370 
from the toolbox to the site either way
is<00:05:02.070> perfectly<00:05:02.639> reasonable<00:05:02.910> I<00:05:03.380> personally

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
is perfectly reasonable I personally

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.310 
is perfectly reasonable I personally
prefer<00:05:04.770> to<00:05:05.100> use<00:05:05.280> a<00:05:05.750> Gaussian<00:05:06.750> blur<00:05:06.900> so<00:05:07.229> I'll

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
prefer to use a Gaussian blur so I'll

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.140 
prefer to use a Gaussian blur so I'll
use<00:05:07.380> filter<00:05:08.100> blur<00:05:08.660> Gaussian<00:05:09.660> blur<00:05:11.000> I'll<00:05:12.000> just

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
use filter blur Gaussian blur I'll just

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.210 
use filter blur Gaussian blur I'll just
bring<00:05:12.419> in<00:05:12.570> the<00:05:12.660> dialogue<00:05:13.080> so<00:05:13.320> you<00:05:13.410> can<00:05:13.590> see<00:05:13.979> the

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
bring in the dialogue so you can see the

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.700 
bring in the dialogue so you can see the
Gaussian<00:05:14.669> blur<00:05:14.789> dialog<00:05:15.270> box<00:05:15.479> and<00:05:15.690> you<00:05:16.320> can<00:05:16.350> see

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
Gaussian blur dialog box and you can see

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.050 
Gaussian blur dialog box and you can see
how<00:05:16.949> will<00:05:17.310> below<00:05:17.760> the<00:05:18.000> edge<00:05:19.940> immediately<00:05:20.940> now

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
how will below the edge immediately now

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.610 
how will below the edge immediately now
just<00:05:21.270> increase<00:05:21.660> our<00:05:21.810> just<00:05:21.990> a<00:05:22.080> little<00:05:22.320> bit<00:05:22.470> I

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
just increase our just a little bit I

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.290 
just increase our just a little bit I
don't<00:05:22.889> want<00:05:23.039> much<00:05:23.250> blur<00:05:23.520> just<00:05:23.729> to<00:05:23.820> soften<00:05:24.060> the

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
don't want much blur just to soften the

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.900 
don't want much blur just to soften the
edge<00:05:24.419> a<00:05:24.449> little<00:05:24.600> bit<00:05:24.840> and<00:05:25.289> say<00:05:26.190> okay<00:05:27.770> and

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
edge a little bit and say okay and

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.969 
edge a little bit and say okay and
that's<00:05:29.910> the<00:05:30.030> color<00:05:30.210> change<00:05:30.539> using<00:05:31.229> a<00:05:31.440> color

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
that's the color change using a color

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.189 
that's the color change using a color
fill<00:05:32.280> layer<00:05:32.520> they'll<00:05:33.240> turn<00:05:33.539> off<00:05:33.720> this<00:05:33.930> layer

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
fill layer they'll turn off this layer

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.110 
fill layer they'll turn off this layer
and<00:05:34.440> we'll<00:05:34.830> show<00:05:35.039> you<00:05:35.070> the<00:05:35.430> next<00:05:35.580> method<00:05:35.849> which

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
and we'll show you the next method which

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.779 
and we'll show you the next method which
is<00:05:36.270> to<00:05:36.389> use<00:05:36.539> a<00:05:36.570> hue<00:05:36.960> and<00:05:37.139> saturation<00:05:37.200> layer<00:05:38.070> now

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
is to use a hue and saturation layer now

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.080 
is to use a hue and saturation layer now
to<00:05:38.849> save<00:05:39.270> time<00:05:39.300> I'm<00:05:39.690> going<00:05:39.840> to<00:05:39.930> copy<00:05:40.530> this

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
to save time I'm going to copy this

you're using the Mac of course you're
using<00:05:46.650> a<00:05:46.889> command<00:05:47.220> click<00:05:47.460> and<00:05:47.700> then<00:05:48.360> add<00:05:48.660> a<00:05:48.900> new

using a command click and then add a new
adjustment<00:05:49.530> layer<00:05:49.849> for<00:05:50.849> hue<00:05:51.810> and<00:05:52.080> saturation

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710

now<00:05:55.710> when<00:05:56.070> you're<00:05:56.190> do<00:05:56.340> using<00:05:56.610> a<00:05:56.760> hue<00:05:57.030> and

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
now when you're do using a hue and

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.360 
now when you're do using a hue and
saturation<00:05:57.210> layer<00:05:58.080> the<00:05:58.919> only<00:05:59.130> thing<00:05:59.250> you've

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
saturation layer the only thing you've

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.040 
saturation layer the only thing you've
really<00:05:59.580> got<00:05:59.669> to<00:05:59.700> be<00:05:59.820> aware<00:05:59.910> of<00:06:00.120> is<00:06:00.510> that<00:06:00.539> the

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
really got to be aware of is that the

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.409 
really got to be aware of is that the
colorized<00:06:01.650> box<00:06:01.949> should<00:06:02.699> be<00:06:02.760> turned<00:06:03.150> on

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
colorized box should be turned on

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.810 
colorized box should be turned on
because<00:06:04.139> you<00:06:04.560> need<00:06:04.860> to<00:06:05.039> be<00:06:05.130> able<00:06:05.250> to<00:06:05.430> apply<00:06:05.550> the

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.570 
because you need to be able to apply the
color<00:06:06.210> exactly<00:06:06.900> if<00:06:07.530> you<00:06:07.770> just<00:06:07.979> use<00:06:08.039> normal

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
color exactly if you just use normal

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.460 
color exactly if you just use normal
mode<00:06:08.760> the<00:06:09.270> results<00:06:09.990> are<00:06:10.080> going<00:06:10.199> to<00:06:10.289> be<00:06:10.380> a

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
mode the results are going to be a

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.930 
mode the results are going to be a
little<00:06:10.680> bit<00:06:10.860> shaky<00:06:11.160> and<00:06:11.400> difficult<00:06:11.849> to

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
little bit shaky and difficult to

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.839 
little bit shaky and difficult to
control<00:06:12.240> so<00:06:12.870> set<00:06:13.229> it<00:06:13.320> to<00:06:13.410> colorize<00:06:13.680> and<00:06:14.070> then

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:14.849 
control so set it to colorize and then

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:17.719 
control so set it to colorize and then
use<00:06:15.150> the<00:06:15.330> hue<00:06:15.599> slider<00:06:15.919> to<00:06:16.919> choose<00:06:17.220> the<00:06:17.430> exact

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:17.729 
use the hue slider to choose the exact

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:20.750 
use the hue slider to choose the exact
color<00:06:17.910> share<00:06:18.270> that<00:06:18.389> you<00:06:18.510> want<00:06:18.720> I'm<00:06:19.550> going<00:06:20.550> to

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:20.760 
color share that you want I'm going to

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.219 
color share that you want I'm going to
for<00:06:20.940> the<00:06:21.030> Blues<00:06:21.270> remember<00:06:21.599> to<00:06:21.720> enhance<00:06:22.020> the

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:22.229 
for the Blues remember to enhance the

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:25.150 
for the Blues remember to enhance the
blues<00:06:22.500> so<00:06:23.250> I'm<00:06:23.310> looking<00:06:23.580> for<00:06:23.760> a<00:06:23.789> blue<00:06:23.970> shade

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 
blues so I'm looking for a blue shade

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.620 
blues so I'm looking for a blue shade
somewhere<00:06:26.160> around<00:06:26.400> there<00:06:26.699> and<00:06:26.849> then<00:06:27.300> increase

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.630 
somewhere around there and then increase

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.390 
somewhere around there and then increase
or<00:06:27.810> decrease<00:06:27.960> the<00:06:28.289> saturation<00:06:28.440> according<00:06:29.310> to

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
or decrease the saturation according to

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:35.320 
or decrease the saturation according to
taste

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.060 

you<00:06:36.330> can<00:06:36.480> turn<00:06:36.660> on<00:06:36.930> and<00:06:37.230> off<00:06:37.350> the<00:06:37.560> preview<00:06:37.920> so

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070 
you can turn on and off the preview so

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.770 
you can turn on and off the preview so
you<00:06:38.190> can<00:06:38.310> see<00:06:38.460> how<00:06:38.490> the<00:06:38.700> effect<00:06:39.120> looks<00:06:39.330> if<00:06:39.630> it's

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 
you can see how the effect looks if it's

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.350 
you can see how the effect looks if it's
enough<00:06:40.020> or<00:06:40.200> not<00:06:40.410> I<00:06:40.880> just<00:06:41.880> increase<00:06:42.240> the

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
enough or not I just increase the

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.620 
enough or not I just increase the
saturation<00:06:42.510> a<00:06:42.930> little<00:06:43.170> bit<00:06:43.290> more<00:06:43.520> yep<00:06:44.520> and<00:06:44.910> say

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630 
saturation a little bit more yep and say

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.910 
saturation a little bit more yep and say
okay<00:06:47.660> so<00:06:48.660> then<00:06:48.780> you<00:06:48.870> go<00:06:49.020> to<00:06:49.290> different<00:06:49.470> methods

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:49.920 
okay so then you go to different methods

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.640 
okay so then you go to different methods
for<00:06:50.310> changing<00:06:51.000> the<00:06:51.120> eye<00:06:51.150> color<00:06:51.600> that's<00:06:52.140> before

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
for changing the eye color that's before

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.980 
for changing the eye color that's before
and<00:06:52.880> that's<00:06:53.880> after<00:06:54.090> using<00:06:54.420> a<00:06:54.600> hue<00:06:54.870> saturation

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 
and that's after using a hue saturation

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.860 
and that's after using a hue saturation
layer<00:06:55.560> and<00:06:55.770> that's<00:06:56.460> before<00:06:56.580> and<00:06:57.000> that's<00:06:57.720> after

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
layer and that's before and that's after

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.380 
layer and that's before and that's after
using<00:06:58.290> a<00:06:58.530> solid<00:06:58.830> color<00:06:59.070> layer<00:06:59.310> pick<00:07:00.210> the<00:07:00.360> one

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:00.390 
using a solid color layer pick the one

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.920 
using a solid color layer pick the one
that<00:07:00.540> spins<00:07:01.440> your<00:07:01.680> wheels
