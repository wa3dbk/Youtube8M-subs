defense<00:00:10.380> which<00:00:11.340> despite<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.210> fact<00:00:12.450> that<00:00:12.599> they

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
defense which despite the fact that they

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.410

were blown out really did show some

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.700 
were blown out really did show some
improvement<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.080> think<00:00:16.350> that's<00:00:16.500> something

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
improvement and I think that's something

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.740 
improvement and I think that's something
of<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.520> silver<00:00:17.760> lining<00:00:17.970> that<00:00:18.210> we<00:00:18.300> can<00:00:18.449> take<00:00:18.630> out

let them down and I am encouraged at
this<00:06:01.530> point<00:06:01.710> that<00:06:01.980> the<00:06:02.070> Nuggets<00:06:02.490> did<00:06:03.030> play

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
this point that the Nuggets did play

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.600 
this point that the Nuggets did play
improved<00:06:04.380> pick-and-roll<00:06:04.890> defense<00:06:05.040> they<00:06:05.430> got

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
improved pick-and-roll defense they got

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:06.950 
improved pick-and-roll defense they got
away<00:06:05.790> from<00:06:05.850> their<00:06:06.150> switching<00:06:06.540> scheme<00:06:06.810> which

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
away from their switching scheme which

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.930 
away from their switching scheme which
they<00:06:07.110> have<00:06:07.230> been<00:06:07.410> overusing<00:06:08.280> for<00:06:08.610> the<00:06:08.790> whole

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
they have been overusing for the whole

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.360 
they have been overusing for the whole
season<00:06:09.150> it's<00:06:09.480> something<00:06:09.840> that<00:06:10.160> was<00:06:11.160> just

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
season it's something that was just

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.160 
season it's something that was just
really<00:06:11.610> not<00:06:11.970> a<00:06:12.000> good<00:06:12.480> tactic<00:06:12.900> and<00:06:13.050> not

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.170 
really not a good tactic and not

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.270 
really not a good tactic and not
something<00:06:13.560> that<00:06:13.710> the<00:06:13.740> Nuggets<00:06:14.070> should<00:06:14.190> have

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
something that the Nuggets should have

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.790 
something that the Nuggets should have
been<00:06:14.430> employing<00:06:14.760> gaming<00:06:15.570> in<00:06:15.660> game<00:06:15.870> out<00:06:16.080> still

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
been employing gaming in game out still

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.070 
been employing gaming in game out still
you<00:06:16.950> can<00:06:17.100> see<00:06:17.370> even<00:06:18.000> though<00:06:18.300> they<00:06:18.570> did<00:06:19.050> a

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
you can see even though they did a

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.830 
you can see even though they did a
better<00:06:19.290> job<00:06:19.410> they're<00:06:19.800> still<00:06:20.010> arrestee<00:06:20.460> there

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
better job they're still arrestee there

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.970 
better job they're still arrestee there
there<00:06:21.840> are<00:06:21.870> times<00:06:22.140> or<00:06:22.320> the<00:06:22.350> help<00:06:22.590> was<00:06:22.740> a<00:06:22.800> little

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:22.980 
there are times or the help was a little

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.650 
there are times or the help was a little
bit<00:06:23.070> too<00:06:23.280> late<00:06:23.490> and<00:06:23.760> I<00:06:24.060> think<00:06:24.120> had<00:06:24.510> they<00:06:24.630> been

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
bit too late and I think had they been

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.270 
bit too late and I think had they been
focusing<00:06:25.230> on<00:06:25.290> playing<00:06:25.560> this<00:06:25.680> style<00:06:26.040> of

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
focusing on playing this style of

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.100 
focusing on playing this style of
aggressive<00:06:27.150> pick-and-roll<00:06:27.600> defense<00:06:27.750> all

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
aggressive pick-and-roll defense all

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.240 
aggressive pick-and-roll defense all
season<00:06:28.140> long<00:06:28.560> they<00:06:28.770> would<00:06:28.860> have<00:06:29.010> been<00:06:29.130> a<00:06:29.160> much

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250 
season long they would have been a much

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.310 
season long they would have been a much
better<00:06:29.610> job<00:06:29.670> at<00:06:30.150> this<00:06:30.570> point<00:06:30.900> of<00:06:30.990> the<00:06:31.080> year<00:06:31.200> and

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.320 
better job at this point of the year and

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.690 
better job at this point of the year and
it<00:06:31.380> would<00:06:31.560> have<00:06:31.680> also<00:06:32.010> resulted<00:06:32.490> in<00:06:32.580> a<00:06:32.670> few

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:32.700 
it would have also resulted in a few

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.120 
it would have also resulted in a few
more<00:06:33.000> wins<00:06:33.180> for<00:06:33.420> them<00:06:33.680> enough<00:06:34.680> at<00:06:34.890> least<00:06:34.980> to

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130 
more wins for them enough at least to

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.710
