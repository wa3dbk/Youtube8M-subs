means<00:01:49.710> you've<00:01:49.890> killed<00:01:50.040> someone<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.850> our<00:01:51.810> our

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
means you've killed someone and our our

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.460 
means you've killed someone and our our
time<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:53.090> I<00:01:54.170> thought<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.259> was<00:01:55.380> interesting

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
time so I thought that was interesting

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.749 
time so I thought that was interesting
and<00:01:55.710> he<00:01:55.829> also<00:01:55.950> has<00:01:56.100> two<00:01:56.219> other<00:01:56.310> shorter<00:01:56.579> pads

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
and he also has two other shorter pads

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.880 
and he also has two other shorter pads
but<00:01:56.969> I'll<00:01:57.390> get<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.350> moment

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
but I'll get to that in a moment

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.950 
but I'll get to that in a moment
so<00:01:59.009> like<00:01:59.610> most<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.030> my<00:02:00.090> clones<00:02:00.299> all<00:02:00.570> metal

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
so like most of my clones all metal

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.889 
so like most of my clones all metal
armor<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.409> fabric<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.390> actually<00:02:03.390> there's<00:02:03.840> a

armor and fabric and actually there's a

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.630 
armor and fabric and actually there's a
little<00:02:04.049> bit<00:02:04.140> fabric<00:02:04.380> when<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:04.590> guy<00:02:04.680> got<00:02:05.549> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
little bit fabric when this guy got the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.459 
little bit fabric when this guy got the
kneepads<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:06.149> little<00:02:06.360> piece<00:02:06.509> four<00:02:06.960> pieces<00:02:07.170> on

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
the ammo pack no chest detailing at all

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.729 
the ammo pack no chest detailing at all
he's<00:02:11.430> playing<00:02:12.270> just<00:02:12.510> like<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.660> other<00:02:12.780> guys

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
he's playing just like the other guys

to do with him and he'll be done so
that's<00:02:19.349> pretty<00:02:19.560> simple<00:02:19.859> I'm<00:02:20.670> going<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:21.030> the

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
that's pretty simple I'm going to the

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.940 
that's pretty simple I'm going to the
arms<00:02:21.390> now<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.569> lot<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.810> them<00:02:21.930> do<00:02:22.049> have<00:02:22.079> a<00:02:22.439> lot<00:02:22.920> of

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
arms now a lot of them do have a lot of

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.209 
arms now a lot of them do have a lot of
the<00:02:23.370> same<00:02:23.689> markings<00:02:24.689> as<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.439> can<00:02:25.560> see<00:02:25.709> as<00:02:26.010> the

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.219 
the same markings as you can see as the

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:28.580 
the same markings as you can see as the
blue<00:02:26.549> stripes<00:02:26.819> we<00:02:27.540> could<00:02:27.659> kind<00:02:27.840> ental<00:02:28.200> they

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
blue stripes we could kind ental they

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.399 
blue stripes we could kind ental they
have<00:02:28.769> the<00:02:28.950> same<00:02:29.159> blue<00:02:29.909> striping<00:02:30.329> but<00:02:31.139> one<00:02:31.379> of

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
have the same blue striping but one of

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.440 
have the same blue striping but one of
the<00:02:31.530> unique<00:02:31.560> things<00:02:32.099> about<00:02:32.159> him<00:02:32.549> is<00:02:33.209> that<00:02:33.359> he

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
the unique things about him is that he

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.640 
the unique things about him is that he
has<00:02:33.599> to<00:02:33.629> teardrop<00:02:34.230> shapes<00:02:36.049> on<00:02:37.049> either<00:02:37.349> arm

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
has to teardrop shapes on either arm

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.410 
has to teardrop shapes on either arm
which<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:37.980> thought<00:02:38.069> was<00:02:38.189> pretty<00:02:38.250> cool<00:02:38.519> gives<00:02:39.359> a

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
which I thought was pretty cool gives a

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.270 
which I thought was pretty cool gives a
little<00:02:39.540> bit<00:02:39.659> more<00:02:39.799> distinctive<00:02:40.799> to<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.099> and

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
little bit more distinctive to it and

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.849 
little bit more distinctive to it and
then<00:02:41.760> also<00:02:41.939> his<00:02:42.209> knee<00:02:42.480> pads<00:02:42.719> he<00:02:43.409> has<00:02:43.620> these

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
then also his knee pads he has these

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.589 
then also his knee pads he has these
stripes<00:02:44.219> that<00:02:44.549> go<00:02:44.790> straight<00:02:45.090> down<00:02:45.239> and<00:02:45.480> then

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
stripes that go straight down and then

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.349 
stripes that go straight down and then
over<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.079> his<00:02:46.230> foot<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.530> little<00:02:46.709> bit<00:02:47.239> that<00:02:48.239> was<00:02:48.329> a

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
over to his foot a little bit that was a

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:49.339 
over to his foot a little bit that was a
little<00:02:48.510> bit<00:02:48.599> annoying<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.930> pain<00:02:49.109> just

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
little bit annoying the pain just

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:50.629 
little bit annoying the pain just
because<00:02:49.560> it's<00:02:49.739> hard<00:02:49.889> to<00:02:50.010> paint<00:02:50.159> at<00:02:50.280> that<00:02:50.400> angle

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
because it's hard to paint at that angle

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.030 
because it's hard to paint at that angle
once<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.090> put<00:02:51.269> that<00:02:51.299> metal<00:02:51.540> on<00:02:51.750> but<00:02:52.079> my<00:02:52.739> internet

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
once I put that metal on but my internet

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.190 
once I put that metal on but my internet
pretty<00:02:53.310> well<00:02:53.459> moving<00:02:54.389> through<00:02:54.689> the<00:02:54.780> back<00:02:54.930> he

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
pretty well moving through the back he

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.009 
pretty well moving through the back he
has<00:02:55.379> his<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.709> thermal<00:02:56.340> detonator<00:02:56.549> right<00:02:57.510> here

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
has his a thermal detonator right here

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.949 
has his a thermal detonator right here
and<00:02:58.230> then<00:02:58.469> if<00:02:59.159> you<00:02:59.340> can<00:02:59.519> see<00:02:59.879> in<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.209> back<00:03:00.480> he

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
and then if you can see in the back he

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.830 
and then if you can see in the back he
has<00:03:01.109> the<00:03:01.260> blue<00:03:01.500> rim<00:03:01.790> that<00:03:02.790> goes<00:03:03.030> around<00:03:03.299> his

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
has the blue rim that goes around his

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.649 
has the blue rim that goes around his
helmet<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.879> course<00:03:06.060> either<00:03:06.150> gray<00:03:06.389> the

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
helmet and the course either gray the

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.750 
helmet and the course either gray the
fill<00:03:06.810> in<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:07.049> other<00:03:07.230> gap<00:03:07.469> but<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.489> blue<00:03:08.609> ring

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
fill in that other gap but the blue ring

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.289 
fill in that other gap but the blue ring
that<00:03:08.849> goes<00:03:08.939> atop<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:10.650> helmet<00:03:11.030> it's<00:03:12.030> not<00:03:12.180> gonna

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
that goes atop the helmet it's not gonna

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.509 
that goes atop the helmet it's not gonna
so<00:03:12.480> he's<00:03:12.659> gonna<00:03:12.780> move<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.049> that<00:03:13.169> best<00:03:13.409> the<00:03:14.099> top

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
so he's gonna move it that best the top

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.610 
so he's gonna move it that best the top
the<00:03:15.239> rim<00:03:15.419> that<00:03:15.450> goes<00:03:15.629> around<00:03:15.719> the<00:03:15.870> top<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:16.230> also

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
the rim that goes around the top it also

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.580 
the rim that goes around the top it also
goes<00:03:16.829> on<00:03:16.919> the<00:03:17.010> back<00:03:17.189> as<00:03:17.489> well<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.260> that<00:03:19.260> kind<00:03:19.500> of

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
goes on the back as well so that kind of

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.899 
goes on the back as well so that kind of
the<00:03:19.680> scoops<00:03:19.949> around<00:03:21.859> and<00:03:22.859> then<00:03:23.129> his<00:03:23.579> head<00:03:23.790> is

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
the scoops around and then his head is

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:25.969 
the scoops around and then his head is
his<00:03:24.060> head<00:03:24.239> I'm<00:03:24.989> not<00:03:25.199> a<00:03:25.229> big<00:03:25.409> fan<00:03:25.560> of<00:03:25.620> doing<00:03:25.799> the

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:25.979 
his head I'm not a big fan of doing the

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:27.559 
his head I'm not a big fan of doing the
faces<00:03:26.489> just<00:03:26.699> because<00:03:26.970> once<00:03:27.239> you<00:03:27.329> put<00:03:27.359> the

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
faces just because once you put the

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.839 
faces just because once you put the
helmet<00:03:27.930> on<00:03:27.959> it's<00:03:28.290> hard<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.650> get<00:03:28.829> it<00:03:28.919> to<00:03:28.949> not

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
helmet on it's hard to get it to not

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.149 
helmet on it's hard to get it to not
scratch<00:03:30.239> off<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.989> I<00:03:31.199> could<00:03:31.590> do<00:03:31.769> it<00:03:31.919> but<00:03:32.129> I

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
scratch off and I could do it but I

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.890 
scratch off and I could do it but I
would<00:03:32.340> have<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:32.609> use<00:03:32.760> two<00:03:33.090> heads<00:03:33.359> to<00:03:33.629> make<00:03:33.750> it

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
would have to use two heads to make it

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.330 
would have to use two heads to make it
look<00:03:34.079> I<00:03:34.319> can<00:03:34.590> make<00:03:34.709> it<00:03:34.829> look<00:03:34.919> really<00:03:35.099> good

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
look I can make it look really good

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.159 
look I can make it look really good
I<00:03:35.519> just<00:03:36.120> need<00:03:36.239> to<00:03:36.299> use<00:03:36.419> two<00:03:36.569> heads<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:37.049> I<00:03:37.109> don't

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
I just need to use two heads and I don't

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.080 
I just need to use two heads and I don't
really<00:03:37.409> have<00:03:37.590> extra<00:03:38.099> clone<00:03:38.549> heads<00:03:38.819> lying

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
really have extra clone heads lying

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.319 
really have extra clone heads lying
around<00:03:39.209> in<00:03:39.569> order<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.500> do<00:03:40.799> so<00:03:41.099> but<00:03:41.489> if<00:03:41.909> I<00:03:42.180> can

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
around in order to do so but if I can

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.259 
around in order to do so but if I can
find<00:03:42.419> a<00:03:42.569> way<00:03:42.689> to<00:03:42.750> somehow<00:03:43.400> apply<00:03:44.400> face<00:03:44.790> detail

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
find a way to somehow apply face detail

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.449 
find a way to somehow apply face detail
and<00:03:45.540> not<00:03:45.689> have<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:46.019> scratch<00:03:46.259> off<00:03:46.439> when<00:03:47.400> you

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
and not have it scratch off when you

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.800 
and not have it scratch off when you
take<00:03:47.609> the<00:03:47.699> helmet<00:03:47.909> on<00:03:47.970> and<00:03:48.120> off<00:03:48.180> then<00:03:48.359> I<00:03:48.419> will<00:03:48.569> I

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
take the helmet on and off then I will I

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.289 
take the helmet on and off then I will I
will<00:03:49.319> finally<00:03:50.040> do<00:03:50.519> that<00:03:50.669> and<00:03:50.849> I<00:03:50.909> would<00:03:51.060> do<00:03:51.180> it

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
will finally do that and I would do it

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.610 
will finally do that and I would do it
because<00:03:51.389> I<00:03:51.629> think<00:03:51.689> it<00:03:51.900> would<00:03:51.989> add<00:03:52.109> to<00:03:52.139> the

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
because I think it would add to the

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.039 
because I think it would add to the
characters<00:03:52.979> but<00:03:53.220> I<00:03:54.030> couldn't<00:03:54.569> find<00:03:54.659> the<00:03:54.780> face

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
characters but I couldn't find the face

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.619 
characters but I couldn't find the face

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
know how that would have worked out with

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.339 
know how that would have worked out with
the<00:04:05.879> helmet<00:04:06.239> stuff<00:04:06.449> so<00:04:06.659> I<00:04:06.689> decided<00:04:07.109> not<00:04:07.199> to<00:04:07.259> do

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
the helmet stuff so I decided not to do

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.979 
the helmet stuff so I decided not to do
it<00:04:07.470> but<00:04:07.530> anyway<00:04:07.790> cool<00:04:08.790> figure<00:04:09.090> he's<00:04:09.569> got<00:04:09.810> an

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
it but anyway cool figure he's got an

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.860 
it but anyway cool figure he's got an
awesome<00:04:10.109> features<00:04:10.590> I<00:04:10.620> do<00:04:10.829> like<00:04:11.009> to<00:04:11.129> hear<00:04:11.280> job

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
awesome features I do like to hear job

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.420 
awesome features I do like to hear job
design<00:04:12.870> that<00:04:13.079> was<00:04:13.169> kind<00:04:13.769> of<00:04:13.859> checked<00:04:14.310> out<00:04:14.370> a

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
design that was kind of checked out a

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.129 
design that was kind of checked out a
little<00:04:14.639> harder<00:04:14.939> to<00:04:15.090> do<00:04:15.419> pain<00:04:15.659> special<00:04:15.989> on<00:04:16.049> the

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
little harder to do pain special on the

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.420 
little harder to do pain special on the
helmet<00:04:16.470> but<00:04:16.590> it's<00:04:16.739> a<00:04:16.769> little<00:04:16.919> bit<00:04:17.039> smaller

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
helmet but it's a little bit smaller

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.479 
helmet but it's a little bit smaller
right<00:04:18.239> up<00:04:18.359> in<00:04:18.509> there<00:04:18.659> but<00:04:18.690> I<00:04:19.229> think<00:04:20.099> it<00:04:20.340> turned

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
right up in there but I think it turned

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.020 
right up in there but I think it turned
out<00:04:20.549> really<00:04:20.789> well

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
out really well

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.800 
out really well
and<00:04:21.380> yeah<00:04:22.380> good<00:04:22.770> figure<00:04:23.039> so<00:04:24.029> that's<00:04:24.690> pretty

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
and yeah good figure so that's pretty

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:25.760 
and yeah good figure so that's pretty
much<00:04:24.870> it<00:04:24.990> guys<00:04:25.110> and<00:04:25.260> then<00:04:25.380> of<00:04:25.469> course<00:04:25.650> the

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
much it guys and then of course the

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.529 
much it guys and then of course the

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
are chomping at the bit in order to

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.010 
are chomping at the bit in order to
figure<00:04:34.860> how<00:04:35.009> to<00:04:35.039> make<00:04:35.220> this<00:04:35.400> I<00:04:35.669> will<00:04:36.449> push<00:04:36.900> that

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
will try to do something really epic

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.930 
will try to do something really epic

of<00:05:11.969> leading<00:05:12.090> my<00:05:12.270> own<00:05:12.330> idea<00:05:12.750> with<00:05:12.870> this<00:05:12.990> and

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:13.229 
of leading my own idea with this and

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.570 
of leading my own idea with this and
just<00:05:14.599> just<00:05:15.599> kind<00:05:15.810> of<00:05:15.900> go<00:05:16.289> crazy<00:05:16.319> and<00:05:16.860> then<00:05:17.009> you

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
just just kind of go crazy and then you

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.740 
just just kind of go crazy and then you
know<00:05:17.699> make<00:05:17.849> something<00:05:18.030> up<00:05:18.210> on<00:05:18.300> my<00:05:18.389> head<00:05:18.539> and

know make something up on my head and
then<00:05:19.440> go<00:05:19.710> for<00:05:19.979> it<00:05:20.099> and<00:05:20.340> hopefully<00:05:20.639> it<00:05:20.969> will

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
then go for it and hopefully it will

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.499 
then go for it and hopefully it will
turn<00:05:21.330> out<00:05:21.360> I<00:05:21.990> have<00:05:22.500> some<00:05:22.740> really<00:05:22.979> awesome<00:05:23.509> neon

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
paint out and also I do use Apple Barrel

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.050 
paint out and also I do use Apple Barrel
paint<00:05:43.080> I'm<00:05:43.319> gonna<00:05:44.009> use<00:05:44.159> testers<00:05:44.610> paint<00:05:44.909> this

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
paint I'm gonna use testers paint this

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.649 
paint I'm gonna use testers paint this
is<00:05:45.150> like<00:05:45.270> model<00:05:45.719> paint<00:05:47.060> and<00:05:48.060> that's<00:05:48.300> just

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:48.659 
is like model paint and that's just

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:52.100 
is like model paint and that's just
that's<00:05:49.080> the<00:05:49.949> complicated<00:05:50.430> stuff<00:05:50.580> I<00:05:51.360> got<00:05:51.960> some

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
that's the complicated stuff I got some

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.749 
that's the complicated stuff I got some
testers<00:05:52.620> white<00:05:52.979> which<00:05:53.279> I<00:05:53.370> don't<00:05:53.639> normally

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 
testers white which I don't normally

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:57.170 
testers white which I don't normally
paint<00:05:54.120> with<00:05:54.740> normally<00:05:55.740> I<00:05:55.949> use<00:05:56.400> Apple<00:05:56.729> Barrel<00:05:57.000> I

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
paint with normally I use Apple Barrel I

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.790 
paint with normally I use Apple Barrel I
actually<00:05:57.449> lost<00:05:57.690> my<00:05:57.900> set<00:05:58.110> my<00:05:58.319> testers<00:05:58.650> white

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
actually lost my set my testers white

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.860 
actually lost my set my testers white
that's<00:05:58.949> why<00:05:59.069> I<00:05:59.099> don't<00:05:59.190> use<00:05:59.370> it<00:05:59.509> but<00:06:00.509> I<00:06:00.539> think<00:06:00.629> it

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
that's why I don't use it but I think it

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.700 
that's why I don't use it but I think it
might<00:06:00.990> make<00:06:01.020> it<00:06:01.349> a<00:06:01.589> little<00:06:01.800> bit<00:06:02.009> more<00:06:02.190> smoother

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
might make it a little bit more smoother

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.140 
might make it a little bit more smoother
because<00:06:04.710> sometimes<00:06:05.310> when<00:06:05.460> you<00:06:05.550> get<00:06:05.610> a<00:06:05.699> lot<00:06:05.969> of

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
because sometimes when you get a lot of

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.959 
because sometimes when you get a lot of
this<00:06:06.360> paint<00:06:06.629> on<00:06:06.810> a<00:06:07.110> lot<00:06:07.949> of<00:06:08.039> a<00:06:08.129> player<00:06:08.400> will<00:06:08.580> dry

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:08.969 
this paint on a lot of a player will dry

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:10.969 
this paint on a lot of a player will dry
and<00:06:09.509> it'll<00:06:09.779> have<00:06:09.960> these<00:06:10.080> lines<00:06:10.349> in<00:06:10.680> it<00:06:10.800> it

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 
and it'll have these lines in it it

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:14.390 
and it'll have these lines in it it
might<00:06:11.129> crack<00:06:11.460> a<00:06:11.490> little<00:06:11.819> bit<00:06:12.949> and<00:06:13.949> it<00:06:14.190> just

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
might crack a little bit and it just

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.550 
might crack a little bit and it just
it's<00:06:14.610> it's<00:06:15.210> okay<00:06:15.479> but<00:06:15.750> I<00:06:15.779> would<00:06:16.110> like<00:06:16.229> it<00:06:16.379> to<00:06:16.409> be

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
it's it's okay but I would like it to be

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.959 
it's it's okay but I would like it to be
smoother<00:06:16.889> and<00:06:17.069> I<00:06:17.099> know<00:06:17.219> model<00:06:17.490> paint<00:06:17.669> does

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:17.969 
smoother and I know model paint does

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:20.529 
smoother and I know model paint does
that<00:06:18.180> so<00:06:18.360> hopefully<00:06:18.569> this<00:06:18.990> won't<00:06:19.139> be<00:06:19.319> glossy

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:20.539 
that so hopefully this won't be glossy

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:23.390 
that so hopefully this won't be glossy
there's<00:06:21.539> actually<00:06:21.960> no<00:06:22.229> label<00:06:22.710> on<00:06:22.889> here<00:06:23.190> tell

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
there's actually no label on here tell

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.159 
there's actually no label on here tell
me<00:06:23.430> what<00:06:23.580> type<00:06:24.089> of<00:06:24.120> paint<00:06:24.389> it<00:06:24.509> is<00:06:24.599> always<00:06:25.050> like

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
me what type of paint it is always like

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:29.899 
me what type of paint it is always like
warning<00:06:25.589> labels<00:06:26.069> and<00:06:26.699> just<00:06:27.949> like<00:06:28.949> flame<00:06:29.460> like

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:29.909 
warning labels and just like flame like

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:32.209 
warning labels and just like flame like
hazards<00:06:30.599> and<00:06:30.779> stuff<00:06:30.990> so<00:06:31.229> I<00:06:31.529> don't<00:06:31.889> really<00:06:32.039> know

00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:32.219 
hazards and stuff so I don't really know

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:33.559 
hazards and stuff so I don't really know
exactly<00:06:32.460> what<00:06:32.819> kind<00:06:32.969> of<00:06:33.120> says<00:06:33.270> I<00:06:33.360> know<00:06:33.449> it's

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:33.569 
exactly what kind of says I know it's

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:35.329 
exactly what kind of says I know it's
white<00:06:33.719> so<00:06:34.440> hopefully<00:06:34.740> that<00:06:34.889> will<00:06:34.949> work<00:06:35.129> and

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:35.339 
white so hopefully that will work and

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:36.709 
white so hopefully that will work and
then<00:06:35.400> that<00:06:35.580> will<00:06:35.669> make<00:06:35.699> these<00:06:35.969> look<00:06:36.240> a<00:06:36.479> lot

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:36.719 
then that will make these look a lot

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:40.610 
then that will make these look a lot
nicer<00:06:37.219> it'll<00:06:38.219> be<00:06:38.279> more<00:06:38.430> sleek<00:06:38.669> so<00:06:39.500> okay<00:06:40.500> guys

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620
