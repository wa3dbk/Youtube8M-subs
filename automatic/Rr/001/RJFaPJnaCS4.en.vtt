hello<00:00:00.570> I'm<00:00:01.110> healthy<00:00:01.680> I<00:00:02.429> was<00:00:02.700> a<00:00:02.730> technician

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:04.790 
hello I'm healthy I was a technician

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:13.999 
hello I'm healthy I was a technician
thanks<00:00:07.010> wall<00:00:08.599> these<00:00:09.599> are<00:00:09.929> actually<00:00:11.059> m48<00:00:13.009> tanks

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
thanks wall these are actually m48 tanks

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.760 
thanks wall these are actually m48 tanks
that<00:00:14.730> were<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.240> main<00:00:15.570> number<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.230> things<00:00:16.470> in

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
that were the main number of things in

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.010 
that were the main number of things in
the<00:00:16.890> Israeli<00:00:17.400> military<00:00:17.789> during<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.690> Yom

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
the Israeli military during the Yom

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.519 
the Israeli military during the Yom
Kippur<00:00:19.199> War<00:00:19.789> this<00:00:20.789> tank<00:00:21.150> will<00:00:21.420> cut<00:00:21.930> into<00:00:22.140> half

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
Kippur War this tank will cut into half

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.450 
Kippur War this tank will cut into half
so<00:00:22.980> it's<00:00:23.539> possible<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.689> see<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.990> inside

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
so it's possible to see the inside

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.749 
so it's possible to see the inside
without<00:00:26.460> actually<00:00:26.910> getting<00:00:27.060> into<00:00:27.539> other<00:00:28.320> tank

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.299 

what<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.910> see<00:00:33.120> here<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.809> for<00:00:34.140> example<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:35.100> is

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
what you see here is for example this is

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.069 
what you see here is for example this is
a<00:00:35.570> tube<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.899> would<00:00:37.140> hold<00:00:38.210> around<00:00:39.210> for<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
a tube that would hold around for the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.270 
a tube that would hold around for the
gun<00:00:42.440> here<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.629> canal<00:00:45.649> and<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.829> can<00:00:47.039> see

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
gun here is the canal and you can see

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.979 
gun here is the canal and you can see
all<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.760> routing<00:00:48.350> equipment<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:50.039> actually

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
all the routing equipment that actually

00:00:50.989 --> 00:01:01.099 
all the routing equipment that actually
move<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.530> turret<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.629> gun<00:00:59.719> just<00:01:00.719> behind

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
move the turret and the gun just behind

it was hit by small ammunition there'll

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.170 
it was hit by small ammunition there'll
be<00:05:22.330> holes<00:05:22.720> in<00:05:22.900> it<00:05:23.050> and<00:05:23.380> dust<00:05:23.830> would<00:05:24.340> actually

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
be holes in it and dust would actually

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.250 
be holes in it and dust would actually
send<00:05:26.050> would<00:05:26.320> get<00:05:26.500> into<00:05:26.950> the<00:05:27.100> engine

send would get into the engine

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.140 
send would get into the engine
later<00:05:29.260> the<00:05:29.620> Israeli<00:05:29.950> military<00:05:30.100> replaced<00:05:30.910> it

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
later the Israeli military replaced it

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:38.070 
later the Israeli military replaced it
with<00:05:31.800> steel<00:05:33.030> encased<00:05:34.140> filters<00:05:35.160> that<00:05:36.510> are<00:05:37.510> much

more protected against small ammunition

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.440 
more protected against small ammunition
and<00:05:40.510> from<00:05:40.900> here<00:05:41.169> the<00:05:41.470> air<00:05:42.190> would<00:05:42.580> come<00:05:43.240> into

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
and from here the air would come into

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:49.220 
and from here the air would come into
the<00:05:43.690> engine

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.770
