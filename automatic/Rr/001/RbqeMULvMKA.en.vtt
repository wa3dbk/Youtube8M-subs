up than what I usually have I seem to

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.400 
up than what I usually have I seem to
make<00:03:14.250> him<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.850> bit<00:03:15.420> more<00:03:15.570> of<00:03:15.630> an<00:03:15.780> effort<00:03:15.990> when<00:03:16.380> I

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
make him a bit more of an effort when I

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
why that is I guess it's just because

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.230 
why that is I guess it's just because
it's<00:03:19.920> something<00:03:20.160> out<00:03:20.370> with<00:03:20.460> the<00:03:20.490> ordinary<00:03:20.790> for
