00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.290
 Hi everyone, joey here again and welcome back. 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.550
 Today I'm going to show you how to build a dosing system. 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.379
 A dosing system allows you to trace elements, fertilizers, supplements and other liquids to you 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:14.379
 to dose the aquarium. 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.270
 It does this in small fixed amounts at fixed times of the day. 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.460
 Many planted aquarium and reef owners dose their aquariums on a daily basis. Some 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.810
 Count on a dosing system to do it for them, while others manually daily 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.810
 dose. 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.400
 Manual dosing does not offer much consistency. 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.120
 There are times when you may miss a dose, or 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.019
 simply cannot dose at the same time every day. This is where a dosing system 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:36.020
 is useful while offering consistency. 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.449
 A dosing system consists of two main parts: 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.030
 A dosing container and a dosing pump Both are usually sold separately. 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.440
 Bought, this will execute you $ 200. The one I will show you how to build 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.819
 only will cost you less than $ 30. 

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:48.819
 So let's get started. 

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:50.010
 For the dosage container 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.559
 You get a small plastic container that needs a lockable lid. Preferred 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.289
 spill-resistant and approximately 2 liters in size. 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.329
 This one, I paid $ 2.50 for. Size will depend entirely on what you want to use 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.329
 in front of. 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.829
 You don't need anything special or expensive though. 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.630
 Even a simple bottle of water will work. (If it is a flat bottom) 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.100
 You will also need Airline ball valves: You have two of these. These are quite normal 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.140
 to be found online 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.270
 with an aquarium supply. They fit perfectly within an airline 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.930
 snake and its barbed wire at the end so that the line does not come loose. 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.190
 They will cost you around $ 0.50. 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.810
 Common airline hose will also be needed. 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.440
 A small amount of silicone will be used. 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.400
 Start by drilling a hole as close to the bottom of the holder as possible. The 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.900
 The gap must be as large as the airline hose. 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.619
 Take a small piece of the airline hose and attach it to one of the ball valves 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:43.619
 . 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.640
 Place the ball valve with the end airline, in the opening of the bottle. The ball valve 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:55.040
 light makes society wider than normal and this helps to seal the bottle 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.280
 to create . The seal will prevent leaks and movement. The purpose of this valve will be 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.280
 discussed later. 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.380
 Add a dab of silicone around the ball valve to help seal. 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.380
 This completes the dosage container. 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.740
 Now we need a pump. I recommend using the "Tom Aquatics Aqua -Lifter Dosing Pump 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.509
 ". When you search it online, you find that it is now around $ 15 on average. This is 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.800
 similar to an air pump, but instead of air can be liquid pump. It is pumping 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.340
 small amounts of liquid though, which is perfectly suitable for this project. This one 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.680
 pump is a must. 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.020
 Close the lift pump on the valve of the container. 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.530
 This valve must be connected to the suction input 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.700
 of the pump. 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:33.280
 Connect a small piece of the airline to the pump output. Then the second one 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.060
 ball valve. Then more airline. 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.630
 This will serve as the return to your aquarium. 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.740
 That is it. 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.230
 So how does this work? 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.540
 Liquid is drawn from the container and pumped into the aquarium. 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.230
 The ball valve connected to the holder serves as a switch-off and a place around the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.150
 disconnect the pump from the holder. The valve ensures nothing leaks if you do that. 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.750
 The ball valve at the outlet controls the fluid flow. 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.870
 Now let's talk about how to set this up and how to get the right amount of power out 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.340
 to get . We need to know one thing: How much water is 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.650
 in a drop. It takes 20 drops of water on 1 milliliter 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.790
 to make water. So for example, if you drip this with 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.319
 a speed of 1 drop per second, you will drip 3 milliliters 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.880
 water in 1 minute. 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.459
 This measurement is how you will calculate the current. 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.220
 When you turn on this pump, you will notice that the water is off and does not actually drip 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.020
 . You must use the ball valve on the pump output to check the flow 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.300
 and bring it down to an infusion. 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.380
 NEVER limit the power in. Only limit the power to go out. Limiting 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.840
 of going into a pump's power will ruin any water pump in no time. 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.750
 So now that we know how we calculate the dosage. We can't have this dripping whole 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.459
 day . so we have to set it on a timer. 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:00.340
 A cheap timer is all that is needed here. One that will allow you to handle it 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.420
 and off by the minute. Usually this will cost you around $ 5 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.760
 Set the timer to put in the pump once a day, for a specific period. 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.000
 I would like to use a 5 minute setting. in 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.510
 this is enough in most cases. So let's look at an example 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.410
 , now we understand trickle prices ... Suppose we have to dose 20 ml of fertilizer 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.880
 the aquarium once a day. That means we have to for it 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.940
 Make sure there are 400 drops to make up that 20 milliliters. 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.070
 If you drip 2 drops per second, you will reach those 400 drops in a matter 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.290
 from 2 minutes. So we would set the timer to come on for 2 minutes as well 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.680
 then exclude again, once a day. 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.410
 Now I put Exercise with water first. Get your drip just before adding in it 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.030
 real thing. This can take a few attempts and maybe even a few days to make sure 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.030
 to ensure that the infusion is always correct. 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.120
 Placing the drain hose near a power head or returning a filter 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.320
 will ensure that it is always evenly distributed in the aquarium and not just dosing 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.740
 an area in the aquarium. 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:58.310
 So that's how you build a dosing system. If anything else, I hope this deck 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.690
 your thinking and maybe more ideas inspired. 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.980
 Anyways, I hope you enjoyed the video, I also want to thank you for watching 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.180
 , and we'll see you next time.
