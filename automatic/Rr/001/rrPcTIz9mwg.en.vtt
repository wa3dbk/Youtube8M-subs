00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.750 
touch so let's take this out and here we
have<00:00:47.960> the<00:00:48.079> case<00:00:48.260> itself<00:00:48.680> now<00:00:49.370> like<00:00:49.489> the<00:00:49.609> name

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
have the case itself now like the name

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.849 
have the case itself now like the name
says<00:00:50.030> this<00:00:50.420> is<00:00:50.719> the<00:00:50.750> candyshell<00:00:51.379> grip<00:00:51.440> and

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:51.859 
says this is the candyshell grip and

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:54.670 
says this is the candyshell grip and
it's<00:00:52.070> basically<00:00:52.399> a<00:00:52.870> remake<00:00:53.870> on<00:00:54.109> the<00:00:54.320> original

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
it's basically a remake on the original

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.229 
it's basically a remake on the original
candy<00:00:54.980> shell<00:00:55.190> and<00:00:55.430> let<00:00:55.699> me<00:00:55.789> take<00:00:55.879> a<00:00:55.940> look<00:00:56.030> at

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
candy shell and let me take a look at

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.689 
candy shell and let me take a look at
that<00:00:56.390> one<00:00:56.750> in<00:00:56.989> comparison<00:00:57.649> to<00:00:57.739> this<00:00:57.859> one<00:00:58.100> right

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
that one in comparison to this one right

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.819 
that one in comparison to this one right
now<00:00:58.940> so<00:00:59.660> there<00:00:59.809> are<00:00:59.870> three<00:01:00.050> main<00:01:00.320> features

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
now so there are three main features

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.349 
now so there are three main features
that<00:01:01.160> are<00:01:01.309> different<00:01:01.640> between<00:01:01.699> these<00:01:02.059> first

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
that are different between these first

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:03.549 
that are different between these first
of<00:01:02.510> all<00:01:02.600> so<00:01:02.719> you<00:01:02.780> can<00:01:02.870> see<00:01:02.989> on<00:01:03.079> the<00:01:03.170> original

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
of all so you can see on the original

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.500 
of all so you can see on the original
candy<00:01:03.829> show<00:01:03.980> the<00:01:04.550> hard<00:01:04.820> plastic<00:01:04.970> package

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
candy show the hard plastic package

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.120 
candy show the hard plastic package
flushed<00:01:05.810> through<00:01:05.990> out<00:01:06.170> while<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:06.710> candyshell

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
flushed through out while the candyshell

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.040 
flushed through out while the candyshell
grip<00:01:07.190> it<00:01:07.940> actually<00:01:08.090> has<00:01:08.390> some<00:01:08.600> silicone

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
grip it actually has some silicone

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.050 
grip it actually has some silicone
insert<00:01:09.350> here<00:01:09.620> which<00:01:09.950> provides<00:01:10.370> us<00:01:10.640> a<00:01:10.910> nice

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
insert here which provides us a nice

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.380 
insert here which provides us a nice
grip<00:01:11.300> with<00:01:11.510> these<00:01:11.660> rub<00:01:11.990> rubber<00:01:12.800> waves<00:01:13.490> here<00:01:13.820> so

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
grip with these rub rubber waves here so

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.930 
grip with these rub rubber waves here so
on<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.750> inside<00:01:15.110> on<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:15.950> camp<00:01:16.160> original<00:01:16.670> candy

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
on the inside on the camp original candy

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.480 
on the inside on the camp original candy
shell<00:01:17.120> you<00:01:17.840> do<00:01:18.020> have<00:01:18.230> the<00:01:18.530> honeycomb<00:01:19.130> feature

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
shell you do have the honeycomb feature

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.760 
shell you do have the honeycomb feature
which<00:01:20.120> cuts<00:01:20.450> down<00:01:20.540> on<00:01:20.750> weight<00:01:21.080> and<00:01:21.290> also<00:01:21.650> add

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
which cuts down on weight and also add

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.320 
which cuts down on weight and also add
some<00:01:21.950> more<00:01:22.040> shock<00:01:22.310> absorption<00:01:22.700> while<00:01:23.150> the

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
some more shock absorption while the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.060 
some more shock absorption while the
candyshell<00:01:23.690> grip<00:01:23.750> you<00:01:24.440> have<00:01:24.470> that<00:01:24.800> flush

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
candyshell grip you have that flush

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.710 
candyshell grip you have that flush
throughout<00:01:25.460> now<00:01:25.760> the<00:01:25.820> reason<00:01:26.030> it<00:01:26.240> did<00:01:26.420> this<00:01:26.540> is

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
throughout now the reason it did this is

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.840 
throughout now the reason it did this is
because<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:27.830> silicone<00:01:28.310> that<00:01:28.340> you<00:01:28.550> can<00:01:28.700> see

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
because the silicone that you can see

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.360 
because the silicone that you can see
right<00:01:28.880> here<00:01:29.330> goes<00:01:29.780> just<00:01:30.560> throughout<00:01:30.980> the<00:01:31.160> case

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
right here goes just throughout the case

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.980 
right here goes just throughout the case
so<00:01:31.970> if<00:01:32.030> you<00:01:32.150> were<00:01:32.210> to<00:01:32.240> make<00:01:32.390> those<00:01:32.540> dimples

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
so if you were to make those dimples

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.780 
so if you were to make those dimples
there<00:01:33.140> there'll<00:01:33.800> be<00:01:33.860> no<00:01:34.070> silicone<00:01:34.520> and<00:01:34.610> you'd

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
there there'll be no silicone and you'd

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.580 
there there'll be no silicone and you'd
be<00:01:34.910> able<00:01:35.000> to<00:01:35.180> get<00:01:35.360> dust<00:01:35.690> and<00:01:36.020> everything<00:01:36.170> in

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
be able to get dust and everything in

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.620 
be able to get dust and everything in
there<00:01:36.640> so<00:01:37.640> I'm<00:01:37.670> glad<00:01:37.820> they<00:01:38.000> did<00:01:38.180> that<00:01:38.210> at<00:01:38.480> least

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
there so I'm glad they did that at least

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.810 
there so I'm glad they did that at least
and<00:01:39.350> then<00:01:39.560> last<00:01:39.800> but<00:01:39.920> not<00:01:40.100> least<00:01:40.160> is<00:01:40.550> on<00:01:40.730> the

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
and then last but not least is on the

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.070 
and then last but not least is on the

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
dimples as you can see and what these do

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.730 
dimples as you can see and what these do

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
casing compares the original candy shell

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.880 
casing compares the original candy shell
is<00:01:56.750> that<00:01:56.900> because<00:01:57.140> it<00:01:57.230> does<00:01:57.410> feature<00:01:57.590> more

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
is that because it does feature more

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.860 
is that because it does feature more
silicone<00:01:58.370> it<00:01:59.030> does<00:01:59.180> have<00:01:59.330> some<00:01:59.480> more<00:01:59.630> shock

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
silicone it does have some more shock

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.110 
silicone it does have some more shock
absorption<00:02:00.290> but<00:02:00.800> also<00:02:01.040> it's<00:02:01.730> a<00:02:01.820> little<00:02:02.030> bit

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
absorption but also it's a little bit

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.030 
absorption but also it's a little bit
more<00:02:02.300> manageable<00:02:02.600> you<00:02:03.320> can<00:02:03.470> maneuver<00:02:03.860> it<00:02:03.920> a

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
more manageable you can maneuver it a

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.080 
more manageable you can maneuver it a
little<00:02:04.160> bit<00:02:04.310> more<00:02:04.460> so<00:02:04.580> it's<00:02:04.700> easier<00:02:04.910> to<00:02:05.000> get

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090
