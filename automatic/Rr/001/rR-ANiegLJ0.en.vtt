your working on it now tell us tell us
about<00:00:07.950> this<00:00:08.160> right<00:00:08.970> so<00:00:09.330> that<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.599> big

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
about this right so that the big

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.930 
about this right so that the big
innovation<00:00:10.440> let's<00:00:11.160> let's<00:00:11.400> let's<00:00:11.639> roll<00:00:11.790> that

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
innovation let's let's let's roll that

video and you can you can you can talk

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.890 
video and you can you can you can talk
us<00:00:13.559> through<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:14.160> what's<00:00:14.400> happening<00:00:14.759> here<00:00:14.910> so

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
us through it what's happening here so

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.590 
us through it what's happening here so
that's<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.740> thing<00:00:16.949> about<00:00:17.150> Rockets<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.359> that

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
that's the thing about Rockets is that

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.599 
that's the thing about Rockets is that
that<00:00:19.199> they're<00:00:19.529> all<00:00:19.710> expandable<00:00:20.369> or<00:00:20.520> all

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
that they're all expandable or all

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:21.710 
that they're all expandable or all
rockets<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.029> fly<00:00:21.180> today<00:00:21.330> are<00:00:21.510> fully

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
rockets that fly today are fully

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.480 
rockets that fly today are fully
expendable<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.710> Space<00:00:22.920> Shuttle<00:00:22.949> was<00:00:23.340> an

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
expendable the Space Shuttle was an

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.250 
expendable the Space Shuttle was an
attempt<00:00:23.939> at<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.119> reusable<00:00:24.420> rocket<00:00:24.570> but<00:00:24.990> even

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
attempt at a reusable rocket but even

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.689 
attempt at a reusable rocket but even
the<00:00:25.350> main<00:00:25.529> tank<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.099> Space<00:00:26.369> Shuttle<00:00:26.400> was

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
the main tank of the Space Shuttle was

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.880 
the main tank of the Space Shuttle was
thrown<00:00:26.939> away<00:00:27.060> every<00:00:27.300> time<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.260> parts

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
thrown away every time and the parts

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.339 
thrown away every time and the parts
that<00:00:28.920> were<00:00:29.130> reusable<00:00:29.580> took<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.630> ten-thousand

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
that were reusable took a ten-thousand

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.069 
that were reusable took a ten-thousand
person<00:00:31.800> group<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.669> nine-month<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.809> refurbish

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
person group a nine-month to refurbish

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.990 
person group a nine-month to refurbish
for<00:00:34.380> flight<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.309> Space<00:00:35.520> Shuttle<00:00:35.550> ended<00:00:35.940> up

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
for flight so the Space Shuttle ended up

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.049 
for flight so the Space Shuttle ended up
costing<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.420> billion<00:00:36.719> dollars<00:00:36.960> per<00:00:37.170> flight

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
costing a billion dollars per flight

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:39.799 
costing a billion dollars per flight
obviously<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.210> doesn't<00:00:39.660> work<00:00:39.780> very

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
obviously that that doesn't work very

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.350 
obviously that that doesn't work very
well<00:00:40.079> for<00:00:40.530> what<00:00:40.710> just<00:00:41.219> happened<00:00:41.550> there<00:00:41.670> we

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
well for what just happened there we

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.979 
well for what just happened there we
just<00:00:42.540> saw<00:00:42.629> something<00:00:42.840> land<00:00:43.170> that's<00:00:44.100> right<00:00:44.280> so

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
just saw something land that's right so

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.630 
just saw something land that's right so
it's<00:00:45.989> important<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:47.340> rocket

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
it's important that the the rocket

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.729 
it's important that the the rocket
stages<00:00:47.879> be<00:00:48.210> able<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.510> come<00:00:48.719> back<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.230> be<00:00:49.680> able

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
stages be able to come back to be able

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.920 
stages be able to come back to be able
to<00:00:49.860> return<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.640> launch<00:00:50.789> site<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.420> be

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
to return to the launch site and be

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.510 
to return to the launch site and be
ready<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.379> launch<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.800> game<00:00:52.980> within<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.399> matter

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
ready to launch a game within a matter

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.840

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
of hours Wow reusable rocket yes and so

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.360

the<00:01:02.520> cost<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.000> fuel<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.600> propellant

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
the cost of the fuel of the propellant

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.770 
the cost of the fuel of the propellant
is<00:01:04.320> very<00:01:04.769> small<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.220> much<00:01:05.430> like<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.909> jet<00:01:06.270> so

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
is very small it's much like on a jet so

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.810 
is very small it's much like on a jet so
the<00:01:06.869> cost<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.189> propellant<00:01:08.700> is

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
the cost of the of the propellant is

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.440 
the cost of the of the propellant is
about<00:01:09.030> 0.3%<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.380> cost<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.860> rocket<00:01:11.450> so

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
about 0.3% of the cost of the rocket so

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.060 
about 0.3% of the cost of the rocket so
it's<00:01:12.570> possible<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.140> achieve<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.860> say

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
it's possible to achieve that say

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.950 
it's possible to achieve that say
roughly<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.520> hundred<00:01:14.729> fold<00:01:15.150> improvements<00:01:15.869> in

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
roughly a hundred fold improvements in

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.899 
roughly a hundred fold improvements in
the<00:01:16.049> cost<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.439> spaceflight<00:01:16.680> if<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.729> can

effectively reuse the rocket that that's

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.130 
effectively reuse the rocket that that's
why<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.270> important<00:01:21.720> every<00:01:21.930> mode<00:01:22.110> of

definitely<00:01:45.070> more<00:01:45.400> expensive<00:01:45.940> so<00:01:46.120> that's<00:01:46.240> so

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
definitely more expensive so that's so

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.000 
definitely more expensive so that's so

the way for your dream to actually take

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.550 
the way for your dream to actually take
at<00:01:54.940> some<00:01:55.090> point<00:01:55.300> to<00:01:55.390> take<00:01:55.600> humanity<00:01:55.870> to<00:01:56.350> Mars

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
at some point to take humanity to Mars

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.070 
at some point to take humanity to Mars
at<00:01:57.100> scale<00:01:57.570> yeah<00:02:00.540> yeah<00:02:01.540> exactly

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
at scale yeah yeah exactly

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.260 
at scale yeah yeah exactly

SpaceX or some combination of companies
and<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:04.840> government's<00:02:05.410> need<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.890> make

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
and and government's need to make

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.790 
and and government's need to make
progress<00:02:06.790> in<00:02:07.120> the<00:02:07.180> direction<00:02:07.300> of<00:02:07.780> making<00:02:08.440> life

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
progress in the direction of making life

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.460 
progress in the direction of making life
multiplanetary<00:02:09.009> and<00:02:09.700> establishing<00:02:10.300> a<00:02:10.929> base

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
multiplanetary and establishing a base

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.070 
multiplanetary and establishing a base
on<00:02:11.920> on<00:02:12.760> another<00:02:13.000> planet<00:02:13.330> on<00:02:13.450> Mars<00:02:13.660> being<00:02:13.990> the

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
on on another planet on Mars being the

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.410 
on on another planet on Mars being the
only<00:02:14.230> realistic<00:02:14.680> option<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.940> building<00:02:16.330> that

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
only realistic option and building that

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.480 
only realistic option and building that
that<00:02:16.630> base<00:02:16.840> up<00:02:17.080> until<00:02:17.380> it<00:02:17.500> with<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.280> true

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
that base up until it with a true

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.570 
that base up until it with a true
multi-planet<00:02:19.030> species<00:02:19.330> so<00:02:20.110> progress<00:02:20.980> on<00:02:21.430> this

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
multi-planet species so progress on this

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.970 
multi-planet species so progress on this
let's<00:02:22.239> make<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.510> reusable<00:02:22.780> how<00:02:23.290> is<00:02:23.680> that<00:02:23.800> going

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
let's make it reusable how is that going

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.699 
let's make it reusable how is that going
that<00:02:24.160> was<00:02:24.220> just<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.459> simulation<00:02:24.880> video<00:02:25.810> so

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
that was just a simulation video so

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.920 
that was just a simulation video so
how's<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.070> going<00:02:27.459> we're<00:02:28.450> actually<00:02:28.540> we've

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
how's it going we're actually we've

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.420 
how's it going we're actually we've
we've<00:02:29.170> been<00:02:29.380> making<00:02:29.500> some<00:02:30.160> good<00:02:30.280> progress

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
we've been making some good progress

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.340 
we've been making some good progress
recently<00:02:31.000> with<00:02:31.660> something<00:02:31.930> called<00:02:32.200> the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
recently with something called the

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.380 
recently with something called the
grasshopper<00:02:33.100> test<00:02:33.340> project<00:02:33.760> where<00:02:34.270> we're

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
grasshopper test project where we're

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.660 
grasshopper test project where we're
testing<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.930> vertical<00:02:35.260> landing<00:02:35.620> portion<00:02:36.580> of

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
testing the vertical landing portion of

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.030 
testing the vertical landing portion of
the<00:02:37.270> like<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.020> sort<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.230> terminal<00:02:38.650> portion

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
the like the sort of terminal portion

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.300 
the like the sort of terminal portion
which<00:02:39.370> is<00:02:39.400> quite<00:02:39.820> tricky<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.800> that's

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
which is quite tricky and and that's

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.340 
which is quite tricky and and that's
we've<00:02:42.640> had<00:02:42.760> some<00:02:42.910> good<00:02:43.030> tests<00:02:43.480> we<00:02:43.780> see<00:02:44.170> that

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
we've had some good tests we see that

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.860 
we've had some good tests we see that
yeah<00:02:44.910> so<00:02:45.910> that's<00:02:46.150> just<00:02:46.239> to<00:02:46.360> give<00:02:46.390> a<00:02:46.510> sense<00:02:46.720> of

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
yeah so that's just to give a sense of

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.539 
yeah so that's just to give a sense of
scale<00:02:46.930> we<00:02:47.410> dressed<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.769> cowboy<00:02:48.100> as<00:02:48.250> Johnny

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
scale we dressed the cowboy as Johnny

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.100 
scale we dressed the cowboy as Johnny
Cash<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:48.820> bolted<00:02:49.330> thematic<00:02:49.630> into<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:49.959> rock

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
Cash and bolted thematic into the rock

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.470 
Cash and bolted thematic into the rock
in

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.300 

all<00:02:53.200> right<00:02:53.349> let's<00:02:53.590> let's<00:02:53.830> see<00:02:53.950> that<00:02:54.099> video

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
all right let's let's see that video

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.559 
all right let's let's see that video
then<00:02:54.489> because<00:02:55.000> this<00:02:55.120> is<00:02:55.239> this<00:02:55.420> is<00:02:55.510> actually

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
then because this is this is actually

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:56.880 
then because this is this is actually
amazing<00:02:56.110> when<00:02:56.200> you<00:02:56.260> think<00:02:56.290> about<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:56.739> you've

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
amazing when you think about it you've

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:57.960 
amazing when you think about it you've
never<00:02:57.159> seen<00:02:57.459> this<00:02:57.580> before

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
never seen this before

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.240 
never seen this before
a<00:02:58.090> rocket<00:02:58.540> blasting<00:02:59.409> off<00:02:59.560> and<00:03:00.340> then<00:03:01.620> yes<00:03:02.620> the

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
a rocket blasting off and then yes the

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.830 
a rocket blasting off and then yes the
rocket<00:03:03.580> is<00:03:03.670> about<00:03:03.879> the<00:03:04.030> size<00:03:04.239> of<00:03:04.330> a<00:03:04.390> 12<00:03:04.629> story

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
rocket is about the size of a 12 story

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:17.730 
rocket is about the size of a 12 story
building

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.000 

so<00:03:18.340> now<00:03:18.490> it's<00:03:18.820> it's<00:03:19.150> hovering<00:03:19.500> at<00:03:20.500> about<00:03:20.590> 40

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
so now it's it's hovering at about 40

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.610 
so now it's it's hovering at about 40
meters<00:03:21.130> and<00:03:21.850> it's<00:03:22.210> constantly<00:03:22.900> adjusting<00:03:23.380> the

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
meters and it's constantly adjusting the

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.620 
meters and it's constantly adjusting the
angle<00:03:24.430> of<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:24.880> pitch<00:03:25.030> in<00:03:25.060> you<00:03:25.240> of<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:25.480> main

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
angle of the pitch in you of the main

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.650 
angle of the pitch in you of the main
engine<00:03:26.320> and<00:03:27.160> maintaining<00:03:27.940> roll<00:03:28.090> with<00:03:28.270> Nicole

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
engine and maintaining roll with Nicole

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:36.710 
engine and maintaining roll with Nicole
gas<00:03:28.900> thrusters

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:45.699 

okay

how have you done this these projects

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.960 
how have you done this these projects
are<00:03:48.870> so<00:03:49.190> these<00:03:50.190> PayPal<00:03:51.170> SolarCity<00:03:52.970> Tesla

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
are so these PayPal SolarCity Tesla

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.580 
are so these PayPal SolarCity Tesla
space<00:03:54.330> that's<00:03:54.690> so<00:03:54.870> spectacularly<00:03:55.470> different

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
thank you well I I think there is I do

thank you well I I think there is I do
think<00:05:06.750> there's<00:05:06.960> a<00:05:07.020> good<00:05:07.560> good<00:05:08.010> framework<00:05:08.280> for

thinking it is physics you know the sort
of<00:05:10.620> first<00:05:10.830> principles<00:05:11.039> reasoning<00:05:11.789> but

of first principles reasoning but

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.800 
of first principles reasoning but
generally<00:05:12.479> that<00:05:12.630> I<00:05:12.840> think<00:05:13.050> there<00:05:14.660> what<00:05:15.660> I<00:05:15.690> mean

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
generally that I think there what I mean

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.400 
generally that I think there what I mean
by<00:05:15.900> that<00:05:16.020> is<00:05:16.550> boil<00:05:17.550> things<00:05:17.729> down<00:05:17.880> to<00:05:18.210> their

by that is boil things down to their

by that is boil things down to their

variations and you have to do that

otherwise it's it's mentally you

but when you when you want to do

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.070 
but when you when you want to do
something<00:05:38.280> new<00:05:38.490> you<00:05:38.820> you<00:05:39.060> have<00:05:39.300> to<00:05:39.479> you<00:05:40.050> have

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
something new you you have to you have

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.680 
something new you you have to you have
to<00:05:40.260> apply<00:05:40.440> the<00:05:41.010> the<00:05:41.669> physics<00:05:42.000> approach<00:05:42.120> good

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
to apply the the physics approach good

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.210 
to apply the the physics approach good
physics<00:05:43.020> is<00:05:43.139> really<00:05:43.410> sort<00:05:43.800> of<00:05:43.830> figured<00:05:44.130> out

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
physics is really sort of figured out

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.770 
physics is really sort of figured out
how<00:05:44.430> to<00:05:44.490> discover<00:05:44.970> new<00:05:45.240> things<00:05:45.270> that<00:05:45.690> are

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
how to discover new things that are

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.480 
how to discover new things that are
counterintuitive<00:05:46.110> like<00:05:46.680> quantum<00:05:47.039> mechanics

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
counterintuitive like quantum mechanics

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.420 
counterintuitive like quantum mechanics
it's<00:05:47.729> really<00:05:47.970> counterintuitive<00:05:48.500> so<00:05:49.500> I<00:05:49.860> think

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
it's really counterintuitive so I think

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.920 
it's really counterintuitive so I think
I<00:05:50.639> think<00:05:50.820> that's<00:05:50.970> an<00:05:51.120> important<00:05:51.510> thing<00:05:51.539> to<00:05:51.780> do

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
I think that's an important thing to do

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:52.650 
I think that's an important thing to do
and<00:05:52.110> then

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
and then

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.560 
and then
so<00:05:52.950> to<00:05:53.950> really<00:05:54.730> pay<00:05:54.910> attention<00:05:54.940> to<00:05:55.420> negative

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
so to really pay attention to negative

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.140 
so to really pay attention to negative
feedback<00:05:56.040> and<00:05:57.040> solicit<00:05:57.520> it<00:05:57.610> particularly

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
feedback and solicit it particularly

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.140 
feedback and solicit it particularly
from<00:05:58.270> friends<00:05:59.070> this<00:06:00.070> may<00:06:00.250> sound<00:06:00.490> like<00:06:00.550> sort<00:06:01.120> of

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
from friends this may sound like sort of

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.020 
from friends this may sound like sort of
simple<00:06:01.840> advice<00:06:02.050> but<00:06:02.380> it's<00:06:02.620> hardly<00:06:03.520> anyone

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
simple advice but it's hardly anyone

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.710 
simple advice but it's hardly anyone
does<00:06:04.060> that<00:06:04.420> and<00:06:04.690> it's<00:06:05.110> incredibly<00:06:06.070> helpful

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
does that and it's incredibly helpful

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.870 
does that and it's incredibly helpful
