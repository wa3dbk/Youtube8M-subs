00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
30 second or so clip the bike tester

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.760 
30 second or so clip the bike tester
managed<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.480> flip<00:00:51.810> the<00:00:52.020> bike<00:00:52.230> before<00:00:52.500> he'd

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
managed to flip the bike before he'd

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.980 
managed to flip the bike before he'd
even<00:00:52.860> got<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.280> out<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.550> pit<00:00:53.700> lane<00:00:53.810> now<00:00:54.810> that

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:54.990 
even got it out of pit lane now that

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.870 
even got it out of pit lane now that
highlighted<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.770> fact<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.580> a<00:00:56.610> bike

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
highlighted the fact that this is a bike

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.330 
highlighted the fact that this is a bike
with<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.150> lot<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.480> horsepower<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.260> it's<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.130> bike

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
with a lot of horsepower and it's a bike

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.950 
with a lot of horsepower and it's a bike
to<00:00:59.490> be<00:00:59.580> reckoned<00:00:59.910> with<00:00:59.940> both<00:01:00.270> by<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.570> rider

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
to be reckoned with both by the rider

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.950 
to be reckoned with both by the rider
and<00:01:01.290> also<00:01:01.950> KTM<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.490> competitors<00:01:03.120> now<00:01:03.510> maybe<00:01:03.750> it

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
and also KTM is competitors now maybe it

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.110 
and also KTM is competitors now maybe it
was<00:01:04.140> just<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.410> case<00:01:04.590> of<00:01:04.790> too<00:01:05.790> much<00:01:05.940> enthusiasm

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
was just a case of too much enthusiasm

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.510 
was just a case of too much enthusiasm
and<00:01:06.930> not<00:01:07.110> enough<00:01:07.380> talent<00:01:07.650> but<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.160> just<00:01:08.340> goes

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
and not enough talent but it just goes

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.420 
and not enough talent but it just goes
to<00:01:08.700> show<00:01:08.730> that<00:01:08.910> this<00:01:09.600> bike<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.260> one<00:01:10.830> serious

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
to show that this bike is one serious

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.969 
to show that this bike is one serious
naked<00:01:11.880> contender<00:01:15.080> but<00:01:16.080> there's<00:01:16.320> also<00:01:16.500> another

long<00:01:31.110> distances<00:01:31.790> so<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.030> test<00:01:33.300> for<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:33.840> bike

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
long distances so the test for this bike

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.640 
long distances so the test for this bike
in<00:01:34.290> my<00:01:34.470> mind<00:01:34.830> was<00:01:35.479> not<00:01:36.479> when<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.900> was<00:01:37.080> riding<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
in my mind was not when I was riding the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.710 
in my mind was not when I was riding the
bike<00:01:37.680> as<00:01:38.520> fast<00:01:38.910> as<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.180> could<00:01:39.420> when<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.630> was

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
bike as fast as I could when I was

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.480 
bike as fast as I could when I was
twisting<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.650> throttle<00:01:40.680> as<00:01:41.010> hard<00:01:41.190> as<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.340> could

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
twisting the throttle as hard as I could

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.700 
twisting the throttle as hard as I could
or<00:01:41.700> tipping<00:01:41.970> into<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.360> corner<00:01:42.750> were<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.530> its

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
or tipping into the corner were on its

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.530 
or tipping into the corner were on its
side<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.250> hard<00:01:44.430> brakes<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.970> real<00:01:45.210> test

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
side and the hard brakes the real test

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.180 
side and the hard brakes the real test
of<00:01:45.660> this<00:01:45.750> bike<00:01:45.990> was<00:01:46.200> going<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.440> be<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.830> see<00:01:47.039> how

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
of this bike was going to be to see how

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:59.370 
of this bike was going to be to see how
it<00:01:47.340> performed<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.149> real<00:01:48.390> world

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.840 

so<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.650> designers<00:02:01.070> come<00:02:01.220> up<00:02:01.310> with<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.549> goods

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
so the designers come up with the goods

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.730 
so the designers come up with the goods
well<00:02:02.299> the<00:02:02.420> biggest<00:02:02.630> improvement<00:02:03.320> I<00:02:03.380> can<00:02:03.560> see

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
well the biggest improvement I can see

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.890 
well the biggest improvement I can see
over<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.100> previous<00:02:04.610> Super<00:02:04.880> Duke<00:02:05.090> R<00:02:05.240> is<00:02:05.479> a<00:02:05.510> fuel

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
over the previous Super Duke R is a fuel

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.590 
over the previous Super Duke R is a fuel
