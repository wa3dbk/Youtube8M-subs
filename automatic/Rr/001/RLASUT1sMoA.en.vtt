00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
pretty good because they have haste and

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.729 
pretty good because they have haste and
if<00:00:34.230> there's<00:00:34.530> an<00:00:34.770> editor<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:36.110> red<00:00:37.110> creature<00:00:37.500> on

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
if there's an editor a red creature on

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.040 
if there's an editor a red creature on
the<00:00:37.860> field<00:00:38.010> they<00:00:38.370> get<00:00:38.489> +1<00:00:38.760> this<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.870> only

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
the field they get +1 this is only

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.470 
the field they get +1 this is only
counting<00:00:40.530> four<00:00:40.559> one<00:00:41.210> so<00:00:42.210> if<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.570> had<00:00:44.270> these<00:00:45.270> guys

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
counting four one so if I had these guys

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.580 
counting four one so if I had these guys
out<00:00:46.160> there<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.340> same<00:00:47.489> card<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.450> these<00:00:49.260> both

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
out there the same card so these both

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.930 
out there the same card so these both
would<00:00:49.860> have<00:00:49.890> 22<00:00:50.430> because<00:00:51.180> they're<00:00:51.690> red<00:00:52.020> inches

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
would have 22 because they're red inches

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.420
