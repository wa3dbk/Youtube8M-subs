Monday<00:00:43.129> through<00:00:43.160> Thursday<00:00:43.539> the<00:00:44.539> program<00:00:44.960> is

00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:45.109 
Monday through Thursday the program is

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:46.330 
Monday through Thursday the program is
made<00:00:45.289> up<00:00:45.469> of<00:00:45.590> actually<00:00:45.980> three<00:00:46.309> different

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
made up of actually three different

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.900 
made up of actually three different
areas<00:00:46.879> modules<00:00:47.809> one<00:00:48.079> two<00:00:48.350> and<00:00:48.500> three<00:00:48.910> module

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
areas modules one two and three module

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.520 
areas modules one two and three module
one<00:00:50.030> is<00:00:50.149> kind<00:00:50.359> of<00:00:50.420> an<00:00:50.539> overview<00:00:50.750> of<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:51.350> whole

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
one is kind of an overview of the whole

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.489 
one is kind of an overview of the whole
industry<00:00:51.829> that<00:00:52.460> includes<00:00:52.820> safety<00:00:53.329> and<00:00:53.719> basic

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:54.499 
industry that includes safety and basic

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:55.720 
industry that includes safety and basic
things<00:00:54.739> that<00:00:54.890> you<00:00:55.010> need<00:00:55.129> to<00:00:55.219> know<00:00:55.280> to<00:00:55.399> be<00:00:55.640> an

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
things that you need to know to be an

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.049 
things that you need to know to be an
auto<00:00:55.969> body<00:00:56.089> or<00:00:56.539> a<00:00:56.570> pink<00:00:57.140> and<00:00:57.320> collision<00:00:57.710> guy

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
auto body or a pink and collision guy

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.389 
auto body or a pink and collision guy
now<00:00:59.059> module<00:00:59.629> 2<00:00:59.749> gets<00:01:00.440> actually<00:01:00.859> into

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
now module 2 gets actually into

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.970 
now module 2 gets actually into
refinishing<00:01:02.210> it<00:01:02.809> teaches<00:01:03.019> how<00:01:03.320> to<00:01:03.350> detail<00:01:03.920> a

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
refinishing it teaches how to detail a

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.160 
refinishing it teaches how to detail a
car<00:01:04.309> prep<00:01:05.000> it<00:01:05.150> to<00:01:05.239> get<00:01:05.390> ready<00:01:05.570> to<00:01:05.750> paint<00:01:05.960> it<00:01:06.080> and

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
car prep it to get ready to paint it and

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.740 
car prep it to get ready to paint it and
actually<00:01:06.860> how<00:01:07.159> to<00:01:07.220> paint<00:01:07.520> now<00:01:08.180> there's<00:01:08.420> entry

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
actually how to paint now there's entry

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.420 
actually how to paint now there's entry
level<00:01:09.080> remember<00:01:09.530> because<00:01:09.950> it<00:01:10.100> does<00:01:10.220> take<00:01:10.400> a

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
level remember because it does take a

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.490 
level remember because it does take a
long<00:01:10.580> time<00:01:10.850> to<00:01:10.909> be<00:01:11.150> a<00:01:11.180> journeyman<00:01:11.659> pinger<00:01:11.990> but

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
long time to be a journeyman pinger but

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.109 
long time to be a journeyman pinger but
it<00:01:12.620> will<00:01:12.740> get<00:01:12.890> you<00:01:13.070> the<00:01:13.189> use<00:01:13.369> of<00:01:13.399> the<00:01:13.670> paint<00:01:13.909> gun

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
it will get you the use of the paint gun

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.999 
it will get you the use of the paint gun
and<00:01:14.270> how<00:01:14.360> to<00:01:14.420> spray<00:01:14.869> and<00:01:15.079> get<00:01:15.500> all<00:01:15.619> the<00:01:15.799> three

different coats on the car and make a

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.139 
different coats on the car and make a
look<00:01:17.390> nice<00:01:17.600> a<00:01:17.960> third<00:01:18.799> module<00:01:19.070> is<00:01:19.460> a<00:01:19.820> module

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
look nice a third module is a module

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:21.730 
look nice a third module is a module
that<00:01:20.299> is<00:01:20.540> used<00:01:20.750> to<00:01:20.899> do<00:01:21.049> collision<00:01:21.590> work

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
that is used to do collision work

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.219 
that is used to do collision work
straightening<00:01:22.700> out<00:01:22.790> panels<00:01:23.390> putting<00:01:24.110> on

bondo all that kind of good stuff that
you<00:01:26.479> see<00:01:26.659> when<00:01:26.810> these<00:01:26.990> cars<00:01:27.229> are<00:01:27.350> all<00:01:27.469> been<00:01:27.740> out

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
you see when these cars are all been out

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.859 
you see when these cars are all been out
there<00:01:28.040> on<00:01:28.189> the<00:01:28.280> freeway<00:01:28.610> this<00:01:29.210> class<00:01:29.479> or<00:01:29.689> try

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
there on the freeway this class or try

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.289 
there on the freeway this class or try
out<00:01:30.020> a<00:01:30.049> street<00:01:30.439> and<00:01:30.560> back<00:01:30.799> out<00:01:31.040> now<00:01:32.000> you<00:01:32.060> have<00:01:32.240> a

out a street and back out now you have a

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.030 
out a street and back out now you have a
choice<00:01:32.540> you<00:01:32.930> can<00:01:33.200> either<00:01:33.320> take<00:01:33.590> all<00:01:33.770> nine

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
choice you can either take all nine

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.370 
choice you can either take all nine
hundred<00:01:34.430> hours<00:01:34.549> of<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:35.000> program<00:01:35.450> or<00:01:36.110> you<00:01:36.229> can

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
hundred hours of the program or you can

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.260 
hundred hours of the program or you can
just<00:01:36.500> take<00:01:36.710> maybe<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.159> paint<00:01:37.490> side<00:01:37.729> or<00:01:38.090> the

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
just take maybe the paint side or the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.480 
just take maybe the paint side or the
collision<00:01:38.719> side<00:01:38.990> both<00:01:39.829> of<00:01:39.979> those<00:01:40.039> go<00:01:40.280> along

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
collision side both of those go along

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.730 
collision side both of those go along
with<00:01:40.700> module<00:01:41.149> one<00:01:41.360> that<00:01:42.200> shortens<00:01:42.649> our

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
with module one that shortens our

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.550 
with module one that shortens our
program<00:01:43.100> up<00:01:43.280> to<00:01:43.399> six<00:01:43.640> hundred<00:01:43.939> dollars<00:01:43.990> so<00:01:44.990> 600

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
program up to six hundred dollars so 600

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.410 
program up to six hundred dollars so 600
hours<00:01:45.649> you<00:01:45.950> can<00:01:46.070> get<00:01:46.159> yourself<00:01:46.369> a<00:01:46.670> sellable

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
hours you can get yourself a sellable

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.440 
hours you can get yourself a sellable
skill<00:01:47.750> now<00:01:48.619> it's<00:01:48.770> thinking<00:01:49.100> about<00:01:49.250> skills<00:01:49.610> the
