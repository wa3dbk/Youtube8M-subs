00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
additions for Minecraft so that is xbox

one<00:00:33.450> ps4<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.590> PSVita<00:00:34.950> so<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.760> means<00:00:35.940> first

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
one ps4 and PSVita so that means first

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.580 
one ps4 and PSVita so that means first
of<00:00:36.270> all<00:00:36.360> they<00:00:36.480> have<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.660> release<00:00:37.020> them<00:00:37.320> as<00:00:37.440> we

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
of all they have to release them as we

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.380 
of all they have to release them as we
know<00:00:37.739> they're<00:00:38.040> already<00:00:38.219> insert<00:00:38.820> testing<00:00:39.239> so

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
know they're already insert testing so

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.970 
know they're already insert testing so
they'll<00:00:39.540> be<00:00:39.629> released<00:00:39.930> anytime<00:00:40.410> soon<00:00:40.710> but

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
they'll be released anytime soon but

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.160 
they'll be released anytime soon but
also<00:00:41.190> 4j<00:00:41.940> I'm<00:00:42.000> not<00:00:42.149> going<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.480> start<00:00:42.780> working

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
also 4j I'm not going to start working

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.200 
also 4j I'm not going to start working
on<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.440> features<00:00:43.860> update<00:00:44.280> until<00:00:44.820> they<00:00:45.030> have

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
on the features update until they have

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.270 
on the features update until they have
fully<00:00:45.480> bug<00:00:45.750> fixed<00:00:46.170> all<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.559> these<00:00:46.710> additions

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
fully bug fixed all of these additions

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.340 
fully bug fixed all of these additions
so<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.670> imagine<00:00:48.059> they'll<00:00:48.510> have<00:00:48.719> different<00:00:48.930> bugs

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
so I imagine they'll have different bugs

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.650 
so I imagine they'll have different bugs
the<00:00:49.590> ps4<00:00:49.860> will<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.430> their<00:00:50.820> own<00:00:50.969> bugs<00:00:51.329> and

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
the ps4 will have their own bugs and

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.600 
the ps4 will have their own bugs and
Xbox<00:00:52.079> one<00:00:52.170> will<00:00:52.440> have<00:00:52.559> their<00:00:52.710> own<00:00:52.829> bugs<00:00:53.100> most

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
Xbox one will have their own bugs most

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.520 
Xbox one will have their own bugs most
of<00:00:53.760> them<00:00:53.879> will<00:00:54.030> probably<00:00:54.059> not<00:00:54.570> be<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.899> same<00:00:55.140> so

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
of them will probably not be the same so

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.260 
of them will probably not be the same so
that<00:00:55.710> means<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.250> that's<00:00:56.430> double<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.910> amount

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
that means that that's double the amount

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.760 
that means that that's double the amount
of<00:00:57.390> work<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.870> they<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.289> do<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:58.649> that's

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
of work that they have to do so that's

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.709 
of work that they have to do so that's
more<00:00:59.039> bug<00:00:59.309> fixing<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.030> could<00:01:00.270> take<00:01:00.480> maybe

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
more bug fixing that could take maybe

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.080 
more bug fixing that could take maybe
twenty<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.350> thirty<00:01:01.770> days<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.399> after<00:01:02.789> that

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
twenty to thirty days and after that

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.420 
twenty to thirty days and after that
period<00:01:03.449> after<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.080> finished<00:01:04.470> bug<00:01:04.710> fixing<00:01:05.189> and

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
period after the finished bug fixing and

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.070 
period after the finished bug fixing and
they've<00:01:05.610> totally<00:01:06.060> finished<00:01:06.390> developing<00:01:06.930> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
they've totally finished developing the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.990 
they've totally finished developing the
next<00:01:07.350> generations<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.950> Minecraft<00:01:08.460> then<00:01:08.760> they

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
next generations of Minecraft then they

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.490 
next generations of Minecraft then they
will<00:01:09.180> begin<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.510> work<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.170> update<00:01:10.470> that

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
will begin to work on the update that

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.010 
will begin to work on the update that
brings<00:01:10.890> all<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.280> features<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.390> yeah<00:01:12.810> in

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
brings all the features to it so yeah in

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.469 
brings all the features to it so yeah in
my<00:01:13.140> last<00:01:13.320> video<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.979> speculated<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.330> will

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
my last video I speculated that it will

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.149 
my last video I speculated that it will
come<00:01:15.720> out<00:01:15.750> straight<00:01:16.229> after<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.650> release<00:01:16.920> of

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
come out straight after the release of

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.710 
come out straight after the release of
the<00:01:17.400> next-gen<00:01:17.759> versions<00:01:18.240> but<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.600> is

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
the next-gen versions but that is

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.300 
the next-gen versions but that is
actually<00:01:19.049> wrong<00:01:19.290> because<00:01:19.500> they<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:20.070> not

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
actually wrong because they have not

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.580 
actually wrong because they have not
started<00:01:20.670> working<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.420> yet<00:01:21.720> as<00:01:21.930> seen<00:01:22.320> by<00:01:22.560> a

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
started working on it yet as seen by a

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.830 
started working on it yet as seen by a
different<00:01:23.130> tweets<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:24.030> minecraft<00:01:24.540> on<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
different tweets so minecraft on the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.630 
different tweets so minecraft on the
next-gen<00:01:25.229> consoles<00:01:25.650> will<00:01:25.860> probably<00:01:26.189> be

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
next-gen consoles will probably be

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.429 
next-gen consoles will probably be
released<00:01:26.790> around<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.330> fifth<00:01:27.659> or<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.020> sixth

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
released around the fifth or the sixth

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.530 
released around the fifth or the sixth
of<00:01:28.500> September<00:01:28.770> then<00:01:29.490> they'll<00:01:29.670> be<00:01:29.850> bug<00:01:30.060> fixing

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
of September then they'll be bug fixing

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
the end and stuff like that

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.620 
the end and stuff like that
all<00:01:41.130> those<00:01:41.280> title<00:01:41.640> updates<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.119> looked<00:01:42.420> back

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
all those title updates I looked back

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.810 
all those title updates I looked back
and<00:01:42.840> each<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.470> them<00:01:43.649> took<00:01:43.860> around<00:01:44.070> about<00:01:44.460> three

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
and each of them took around about three

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.609 
and each of them took around about three
months<00:01:45.030> time<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.630> finish<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.200> that's<00:01:46.350> quite<00:01:46.560> a

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
months time to finish so that's quite a

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.380 
months time to finish so that's quite a
long<00:01:46.860> time<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.759> adds<00:01:47.880> quite<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.180> lot<00:01:48.360> of

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
long time and it adds quite a lot of

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.450 
long time and it adds quite a lot of
features<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.560> what<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.770> think<00:01:49.890> will

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
features so that is what I think will

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.850 
features so that is what I think will
happen<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:51.060> time<00:01:51.299> as<00:01:51.479> well<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.960> think<00:01:52.290> 4j<00:01:52.710> are

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
happen this time as well I think 4j are

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.889 
happen this time as well I think 4j are
going<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.159> start<00:01:53.430> working<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:53.909> two<00:01:54.090> u18<00:01:54.659> it's

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
going to start working on two u18 it's

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.120 
going to start working on two u18 it's
gonna<00:01:54.990> take<00:01:55.259> them<00:01:55.380> around<00:01:55.470> about<00:01:55.770> three

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
gonna take them around about three

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.889 
gonna take them around about three
months<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.460> finish<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.210> leaves<00:01:57.570> us

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
months to finish and that leaves us

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.740 
months to finish and that leaves us
sometime<00:01:58.710> around<00:01:59.100> about<00:01:59.520> December<00:02:00.390> or

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
sometime around about December or

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.749 
sometime around about December or
January<00:02:00.890> so<00:02:01.890> that's<00:02:02.070> right<00:02:02.189> we<00:02:02.430> won't<00:02:02.640> be

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
January so that's right we won't be

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.490 
January so that's right we won't be
seeing<00:02:02.969> two<00:02:03.180> u18<00:02:03.689> until

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
seeing two u18 until

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.980 
seeing two u18 until
around<00:02:04.710> December<00:02:04.890> or<00:02:05.580> January<00:02:05.630> or<00:02:06.630> maybe<00:02:06.840> even

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
around December or January or maybe even

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.840 
around December or January or maybe even
February<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.950> just<00:02:08.130> depends<00:02:08.520> how<00:02:08.640> much

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
February it just depends how much

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.280 
the 2nd or 3rd update so you know does
that<00:03:41.640> mean<00:03:41.760> it<00:03:42.000> will<00:03:42.090> be<00:03:42.180> cool<00:03:42.360> to<00:03:42.570> you<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:43.049> or

December or November if we're very

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.080 
December or November if we're very
hopeful<00:03:50.070> but<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.459> main<00:03:50.579> point<00:03:50.790> in<00:03:50.850> this<00:03:50.910> video

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
hopeful but the main point in this video

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.990 
hopeful but the main point in this video
is<00:03:51.540> just<00:03:51.570> think<00:03:52.170> about<00:03:52.380> what<00:03:53.070> time<00:03:53.280> it<00:03:53.430> is<00:03:53.459> now

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
is just think about what time it is now

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.850 
is just think about what time it is now
