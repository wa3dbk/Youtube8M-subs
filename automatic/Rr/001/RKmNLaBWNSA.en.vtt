 that pick up the codes in that template put 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.030
 inside the game had to talk to the 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.890
 guy talking O we enjoyed the idea is 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.739
 that this idea within the game pay the 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.019
 face money and make real squid 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.960

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.820
 is this dies inside the game the staff 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.399
 For those who are kicking, thinking that this 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.259
 character here that I am 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:12.009

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.670
 I will not even talk much about him 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.530
 It's because I want you to see that 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.899
 the eyes themselves how this mode 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.539
 It works, I do not know until now how 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:26.649
 rockstar did not think about it, man lets 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:29.369
 enter here in buggy 1.0 that looks like a 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:32.289
 week will be good 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.910
 now was the following personal pro mod 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.880
 I need to be with 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.470
 least one star level is of 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.259
 or you have to call the 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.789
 police attention then that mold the 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.970
 he does is simply the following 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:48.250
 it takes off in a way that I 'm going to show 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.560
 For you it is still at a level of 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.700
 that he had only one 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.789
 star is 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.670
 I'm going to use the native trainer here to 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.259
 add a level of wanted to be 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.289
