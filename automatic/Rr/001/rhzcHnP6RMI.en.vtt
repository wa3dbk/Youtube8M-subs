00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
their own selfish reasons and you can't

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.520 
their own selfish reasons and you can't
get<00:00:38.969> away<00:00:39.090> from<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.780> think<00:00:40.050> everyone<00:00:40.440> in

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
get away from that I think everyone in

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.290 
get away from that I think everyone in
the<00:00:40.620> room<00:00:40.739> has<00:00:40.950> their<00:00:41.160> selfish<00:00:41.550> motivations

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
the room has their selfish motivations

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.450 
the room has their selfish motivations
and<00:00:42.600> actually<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.230> want<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.620> because<00:00:44.219> you

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
and actually you want that because you

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.190 
and actually you want that because you
want<00:00:44.640> them<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.940> have<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.329> ambition<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:46.050> be

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
want them to have that ambition to be

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.040 
want them to have that ambition to be
singularly<00:00:46.829> focused<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.420> something<00:00:48.930> they

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
singularly focused on on something they

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.170 
singularly focused on on something they
desperately<00:00:49.530> want<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.920> achieve<00:00:50.309> but<00:00:51.030> at<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
desperately want to achieve but at the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.180 
desperately want to achieve but at the
same<00:00:51.420> time<00:00:51.750> they<00:00:52.350> need<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:52.920> able<00:00:52.949> to

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
same time they need to be able to

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.100 
same time they need to be able to
subjugate<00:00:53.730> their<00:00:53.969> personal<00:00:54.480> ambition<00:00:54.899> for

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
subjugate their personal ambition for

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.840 
subjugate their personal ambition for
the<00:00:55.230> sake<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.710> team<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.100> getting<00:00:56.760> that

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
the sake of the team and getting that

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.670 
the sake of the team and getting that
balance<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.170> balance<00:00:58.620> between

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
balance and it's this balance between

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.639 
balance and it's this balance between
selfishness<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.910> selflessness<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.840> if<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
selfishness and selflessness and if the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.210 
selfishness and selflessness and if the
the<00:01:02.100> selfishness<00:01:04.010> overcomes<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
the selfishness overcomes the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.740 
the selfishness overcomes the
selflessness<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:06.060> need<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.330> be<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.450> part<00:01:06.510> of

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
selflessness you need to be a part of

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.910 
selflessness you need to be a part of
the<00:01:06.840> team<00:01:07.020> well<00:01:07.170> actually<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.560> don't<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:07.890> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
the team well actually you don't have a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.219 
the team well actually you don't have a
time<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.909> being<00:01:09.150> able<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.570> somehow<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:09.990> think

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
time so being able to somehow I think

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.929 
time so being able to somehow I think
that's<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.470> trickiest<00:01:10.920> balance<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.610> getting

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
that's the trickiest balance in getting

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.830 
that's the trickiest balance in getting
a<00:01:12.030> team<00:01:12.270> right<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:13.200> being<00:01:13.650> able<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.040> balance

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
a team right is being able to balance

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.770 
a team right is being able to balance
individual<00:01:16.189> ambition<00:01:17.189> with<00:01:17.970> team<00:01:18.270> ambition

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
individual ambition with team ambition

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.690 
individual ambition with team ambition
and<00:01:18.900> how<00:01:19.290> do<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.619> let's<00:01:20.100> say<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.369> have<00:01:20.670> a

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
member of your team of Australia who's

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.770 
member of your team of Australia who's
incredibly<00:01:23.159> egotistical<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.150> gets<00:01:24.330> an<00:01:24.450> awful

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
incredibly egotistical and gets an awful

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.630 
incredibly egotistical and gets an awful
lot<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.900> attention<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.830> for<00:01:26.220> rugby<00:01:26.369> fans

David<00:01:26.939> Campese<00:01:27.829> how<00:01:28.829> do<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.400> manage<00:01:29.670> that

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
David Campese how do you manage that

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.149 
David Campese how do you manage that
person<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.110> do<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.409> sometimes<00:01:31.740> have<00:01:32.100> to

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
person and do you sometimes have to

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.880 
person and do you sometimes have to
think<00:01:32.490> well<00:01:32.729> yes<00:01:33.630> he<00:01:33.659> gives<00:01:34.290> off<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.619> error

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
think well yes he gives off this error

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.039 
think well yes he gives off this error
of<00:01:35.070> supreme<00:01:35.460> confidence<00:01:35.729> but<00:01:36.450> actually<00:01:36.840> once

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
of supreme confidence but actually once

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.480 
of supreme confidence but actually once
in<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.290> while<00:01:37.409> he<00:01:37.560> probably<00:01:37.799> needs<00:01:38.189> an<00:01:38.340> arm

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
in a while he probably needs an arm

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.740 
in a while he probably needs an arm
around<00:01:38.579> his<00:01:38.850> shoulder<00:01:38.880> metaphorically

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
around his shoulder metaphorically

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.630 
around his shoulder metaphorically
speaking<00:01:39.990> yeah<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:40.860> think<00:01:41.340> it's<00:01:41.430> about

speaking yeah I think it's about

speaking yeah I think it's about
understanding<00:01:41.820> them<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.680> number<00:01:43.950> one

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
understanding them is the number one

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.160 
understanding them is the number one
thing<00:01:44.399> understanding<00:01:45.240> yeah<00:01:45.450> what<00:01:45.689> makes<00:01:45.960> this

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
thing understanding yeah what makes this

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.380 
thing understanding yeah what makes this
person<00:01:46.649> tick<00:01:46.860> yeah<00:01:47.070> why<00:01:47.250> they<00:01:47.549> like<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.030> and

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.800 
you don't want to you don't want to
really<00:01:52.890> cut<00:01:53.729> off<00:01:53.880> their<00:01:54.090> ambition<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.750> know

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
really cut off their ambition you know

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.179 
really cut off their ambition you know
because<00:01:55.020> that's<00:01:55.200> part<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.590> what<00:01:55.829> gives<00:01:56.070> them

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
because that's part of what gives them

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.670 
because that's part of what gives them
the<00:01:56.340> confidence<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.909> perform<00:01:57.350> but<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.560> also

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
the confidence to perform but you also

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.859 
the confidence to perform but you also
want<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.189> make<00:01:59.610> sure<00:01:59.969> it's<00:02:00.329> curtailed<00:02:00.750> and

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
want to make sure it's curtailed and

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.350 
want to make sure it's curtailed and
it's<00:02:01.049> not<00:02:01.170> going<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.439> distract<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.310> team<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:03.329> I

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
it's not going to distract the team so I

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.690 
it's not going to distract the team so I
think<00:02:03.689> getting<00:02:04.439> getting<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:05.040> balance<00:02:05.310> is

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
think getting getting that balance is

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.150 
think getting getting that balance is
it's<00:02:06.270> never<00:02:06.450> particularly<00:02:07.259> easy<00:02:07.619> but<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:07.950> think

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
it's never particularly easy but I think

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.510 
it's never particularly easy but I think
it<00:02:08.250> starts<00:02:08.610> from<00:02:08.700> understanding<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
it starts from understanding the

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.300 
it starts from understanding the
person<00:02:09.880> and<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:11.050> really<00:02:11.590> get<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:11.890> best<00:02:12.070> out<00:02:12.280> of

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
person and to really get the best out of

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.640 
person and to really get the best out of
a<00:02:12.460> team<00:02:12.670> it's<00:02:12.970> it's<00:02:13.450> about<00:02:13.750> often<00:02:14.470> talk<00:02:14.620> about

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
a team it's it's about often talk about

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.950 
a team it's it's about often talk about
composure<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.460> composure<00:02:15.880> both<00:02:16.690> as<00:02:16.870> an

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580

to<00:02:31.630> what<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:31.900> are<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:32.200> you've<00:02:32.320> got<00:02:32.470> that

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
to what you are and you've got that

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.080 
to what you are and you've got that
faith<00:02:32.860> that<00:02:33.040> confidence<00:02:33.550> when<00:02:33.760> you<00:02:33.850> get<00:02:34.000> on

faith that confidence when you get on
that<00:02:34.210> line<00:02:34.450> but<00:02:35.050> secondly<00:02:35.440> it's<00:02:35.620> about<00:02:35.770> faith

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
that line but secondly it's about faith

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.370 
that line but secondly it's about faith
in<00:02:36.160> your<00:02:36.280> teammates<00:02:36.730> around<00:02:37.000> you<00:02:37.240> and<00:02:37.390> and

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
in your teammates around you and and

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.350 
in your teammates around you and and
that<00:02:38.530> faith<00:02:38.860> means<00:02:39.490> it<00:02:39.820> doesn't<00:02:39.970> mean<00:02:40.180> that

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
that faith means it doesn't mean that

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.450 
that faith means it doesn't mean that
you<00:02:41.200> look<00:02:41.350> across<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.680> huddle<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:42.250> think

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
you look across the huddle and you think

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.950 
you look across the huddle and you think
they're<00:02:42.580> the<00:02:42.610> best<00:02:42.850> player<00:02:43.450> in<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.660> world<00:02:43.720> of

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
they're the best player in the world of

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.690 
they're the best player in the world of
what<00:02:44.110> they<00:02:44.320> you<00:02:44.710> know<00:02:44.740> within<00:02:44.980> their<00:02:45.250> position

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
what they you know within their position

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.760 
what they you know within their position
but<00:02:46.390> it<00:02:46.510> means<00:02:46.600> you<00:02:46.870> actually<00:02:46.990> know<00:02:47.410> them<00:02:47.620> you

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
but it means you actually know them you

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:48.990 
but it means you actually know them you
know<00:02:47.890> them<00:02:48.100> for<00:02:48.220> their<00:02:48.340> strengths<00:02:48.820> and<00:02:48.880> you

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
know them for their strengths and you

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.610 
know them for their strengths and you
know<00:02:49.120> them<00:02:49.300> for<00:02:49.450> their<00:02:49.540> weaknesses<00:02:50.020> and<00:02:50.320> and

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
know them for their weaknesses and and

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.100 
know them for their weaknesses and and
part<00:02:51.370> of<00:02:51.490> that<00:02:51.610> is<00:02:51.670> then<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:52.720> can<00:02:52.900> support

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
part of that is then you can support

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.080 
part of that is then you can support
them<00:02:53.500> where<00:02:53.650> they're<00:02:53.800> weak<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.280> David

campisi was the best player in the world

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.300 
campisi was the best player in the world
in<00:02:58.570> his<00:02:58.780> day<00:02:59.020> and<00:02:59.080> it<00:02:59.470> was<00:02:59.560> a<00:02:59.650> big<00:02:59.860> reason<00:03:00.040> we

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
in his day and it was a big reason we

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.550 
in his day and it was a big reason we
won<00:03:00.490> the<00:03:00.610> 1991<00:03:01.390> World<00:03:01.600> Cup<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:02.350> was<00:03:02.500> the

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
won the 1991 World Cup it was the

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.870 
won the 1991 World Cup it was the
greatest<00:03:02.920> attacking<00:03:03.340> player<00:03:03.520> in<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.700> world

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
greatest attacking player in the world

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.280 
greatest attacking player in the world
he<00:03:04.390> probably<00:03:04.600> wouldn't<00:03:04.870> have<00:03:04.990> been<00:03:05.110> in<00:03:05.260> the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
he probably wouldn't have been in the

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.620 
he probably wouldn't have been in the
top<00:03:05.470> 50<00:03:05.830> defenders<00:03:06.250> in<00:03:06.280> this<00:03:06.490> room<00:03:06.730> yeah<00:03:07.330> and

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
top 50 defenders in this room yeah and

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.410 
top 50 defenders in this room yeah and
it<00:03:07.720> just<00:03:07.930> wasn't<00:03:08.140> his<00:03:08.440> strength<00:03:08.830> but<00:03:09.580> yeah<00:03:10.270> we

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
it just wasn't his strength but yeah we

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.630 
it just wasn't his strength but yeah we
knew<00:03:10.600> that<00:03:10.630> so<00:03:11.110> we<00:03:11.200> could<00:03:11.380> support<00:03:11.710> him<00:03:11.950> where

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
knew that so we could support him where

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.190 
knew that so we could support him where
he<00:03:12.790> wasn't<00:03:13.120> particularly<00:03:13.420> strong<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:14.050> it's

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
he wasn't particularly strong and it's

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.540 
he wasn't particularly strong and it's
interesting<00:03:14.320> because<00:03:14.740> it<00:03:15.010> seems<00:03:15.250> that<00:03:15.400> you

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
interesting because it seems that you

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.780 
interesting because it seems that you
define<00:03:16.000> a<00:03:16.500> difference<00:03:17.500> between<00:03:17.830> liking

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
define a difference between liking

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.550 
define a difference between liking
somebody<00:03:19.240> and<00:03:19.540> trusting<00:03:19.959> somebody<00:03:20.230> and<00:03:20.500> the

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
somebody and trusting somebody and the

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.110 
somebody and trusting somebody and the
important<00:03:20.950> thing<00:03:21.100> is<00:03:21.220> in<00:03:21.340> a<00:03:21.610> team<00:03:21.820> is<00:03:21.970> you

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
important thing is in a team is you

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.490 
important thing is in a team is you
trust<00:03:22.450> each<00:03:22.660> other<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:22.959> don't<00:03:23.080> actually<00:03:23.290> have

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
trust each other you don't actually have

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:06.600 
know that they that moment of honesty to
know<00:05:05.350> that<00:05:05.620> there<00:05:05.770> wasn't<00:05:06.010> more<00:05:06.310> that<00:05:06.520> you

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
know that there wasn't more that you

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.670 
know that there wasn't more that you
could<00:05:06.820> have<00:05:06.880> done<00:05:07.090> that<00:05:07.750> you<00:05:07.900> didn't<00:05:08.139> let<00:05:08.380> you

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
could have done that you didn't let you

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.610 
could have done that you didn't let you
make<00:05:08.919> down<00:05:09.160> not<00:05:09.370> because<00:05:09.400> of<00:05:09.810> ability<00:05:10.810> but

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
make down not because of ability but

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.010 
make down not because of ability but
because<00:05:11.680> of<00:05:12.039> effort<00:05:12.639> and<00:05:12.760> focus<00:05:12.970> and<00:05:13.510> stuff

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
because of effort and focus and stuff

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.180 
because of effort and focus and stuff
like<00:05:14.169> that<00:05:14.229> and<00:05:14.380> I<00:05:14.500> think<00:05:14.530> that's<00:05:14.860> really

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
like that and I think that's really

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.400 
like that and I think that's really
important<00:05:15.880> when<00:05:16.389> you<00:05:16.599> then<00:05:16.810> leave<00:05:17.139> that

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
important when you then leave that

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.719 
important when you then leave that
changing<00:05:17.919> room<00:05:18.070> and<00:05:18.220> you're<00:05:18.310> having<00:05:18.490> to<00:05:18.610> deal

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
changing room and you're having to deal

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:20.100 
changing room and you're having to deal
with<00:05:18.910> the<00:05:19.090> consequences<00:05:19.270> of<00:05:19.750> what<00:05:19.990> has

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
with the consequences of what has

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.020 
with the consequences of what has
happened<00:05:20.139> on<00:05:20.590> the<00:05:20.710> pitch<00:05:20.919> be<00:05:21.160> its<00:05:21.340> success<00:05:21.820> or

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
happened on the pitch be its success or

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.050 
happened on the pitch be its success or
be<00:05:22.180> it<00:05:22.300> failure<00:05:22.740> how<00:05:23.740> do<00:05:23.800> you<00:05:24.160> handle<00:05:24.550> that<00:05:24.849> did

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
be it failure how do you handle that did

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.969 
be it failure how do you handle that did
you<00:05:25.210> have<00:05:25.360> any<00:05:25.539> tricks<00:05:25.900> that<00:05:26.349> would<00:05:26.500> help<00:05:26.680> you

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
you have any tricks that would help you

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.930 
you have any tricks that would help you
through<00:05:27.660> think<00:05:28.660> I<00:05:28.810> the<00:05:29.530> analysis<00:05:30.160> is<00:05:30.190> really

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
through think I the analysis is really

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.189 
through think I the analysis is really
important<00:05:31.360> understanding<00:05:31.599> why<00:05:32.169> you

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:32.199 
important understanding why you

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.469 
important understanding why you
succeeded<00:05:32.979> or<00:05:33.099> why<00:05:33.280> you<00:05:33.340> failed<00:05:33.699> yeah<00:05:34.270> a<00:05:34.330> lot

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
succeeded or why you failed yeah a lot

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.110 
succeeded or why you failed yeah a lot
of<00:05:34.599> the<00:05:34.690> time<00:05:34.870> it's<00:05:35.080> easier<00:05:35.470> to<00:05:35.830> a<00:05:36.130> lot<00:05:37.030> of

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
of the time it's easier to a lot of

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.399 
of the time it's easier to a lot of
people<00:05:37.330> say<00:05:37.449> this<00:05:37.660> like<00:05:37.870> when<00:05:38.020> you're

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:38.409 
people say this like when you're

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:39.870 
people say this like when you're
successful<00:05:38.740> you<00:05:39.039> probably<00:05:39.340> don't<00:05:39.580> look<00:05:39.789> at

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
successful you probably don't look at

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.240 
successful you probably don't look at
why<00:05:40.030> you're<00:05:40.240> successful<00:05:40.900> as<00:05:41.020> much<00:05:41.199> as<00:05:41.440> when

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
why you're successful as much as when

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.560 
why you're successful as much as when
you<00:05:42.280> failed<00:05:42.610> you<00:05:42.880> you're<00:05:43.120> desperately

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
you failed you you're desperately

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.529 
you failed you you're desperately
digging<00:05:43.960> into<00:05:44.110> why<00:05:44.740> you<00:05:44.800> failed<00:05:45.250> and<00:05:45.760> and<00:05:46.030> I

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
digging into why you failed and and I

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:50.070 
digging into why you failed and and I
think<00:05:46.780> success<00:05:47.430> can<00:05:48.430> create<00:05:49.180> short<00:05:49.630> memories

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
think success can create short memories

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.469 
think success can create short memories
short-term<00:05:50.979> memory<00:05:51.310> loss<00:05:51.340> in<00:05:51.760> a<00:05:52.240> lot<00:05:52.389> of

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
short-term memory loss in a lot of

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.510 
short-term memory loss in a lot of
people<00:05:52.630> I<00:05:52.960> remember<00:05:53.590> learning<00:05:53.740> really<00:05:54.220> early

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
people I remember learning really early

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.950 
people I remember learning really early
in<00:05:54.550> my<00:05:54.729> career<00:05:54.789> there<00:05:55.210> was<00:05:55.360> an<00:05:55.449> Australian

in my career there was an Australian

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.659 
in my career there was an Australian
swimming<00:05:56.440> coach<00:05:56.620> actually<00:05:57.099> I<00:05:57.130> couldn't

hardly<00:05:58.030> swim<00:05:58.330> across<00:05:58.570> the<00:05:58.659> pool<00:05:58.960> let<00:05:59.199> alone

00:05:59.339 --> 00:05:59.349 
hardly swim across the pool let alone

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:01.080 
hardly swim across the pool let alone
the<00:05:59.500> length<00:05:59.680> of<00:05:59.830> the<00:05:59.949> pool<00:06:00.099> there's<00:06:00.760> a<00:06:00.820> guy<00:06:00.940> by

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
the length of the pool there's a guy by

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.310 
the length of the pool there's a guy by
the<00:06:01.120> name<00:06:01.210> of<00:06:01.330> Don<00:06:01.570> tell<00:06:01.840> but<00:06:02.020> I<00:06:02.080> think<00:06:02.260> he

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
the name of Don tell but I think he

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.810 
the name of Don tell but I think he
ended<00:06:02.470> up<00:06:02.560> coming<00:06:02.800> over<00:06:03.039> here<00:06:03.250> and<00:06:03.340> doing<00:06:03.610> some

because<00:06:24.490> most<00:06:24.820> comebacks<00:06:25.270> fire<00:06:25.570> is<00:06:26.349> it<00:06:26.560> most

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
because most comebacks fire is it most

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.379 
because most comebacks fire is it most
comebacks<00:06:27.130> failed<00:06:27.490> because<00:06:27.699> people<00:06:28.210> forget

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:28.389 
comebacks failed because people forget

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:30.750 
comebacks failed because people forget
how<00:06:28.840> hard<00:06:29.409> they<00:06:29.620> had<00:06:29.740> to<00:06:29.919> work<00:06:30.250> in<00:06:30.430> the<00:06:30.520> first

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
how hard they had to work in the first

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.670 
how hard they had to work in the first
place<00:06:30.940> to<00:06:31.270> achieve<00:06:31.389> what<00:06:31.779> they<00:06:31.810> achieved<00:06:32.050> and

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 
place to achieve what they achieved and

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.640 
place to achieve what they achieved and
they<00:06:33.130> actually<00:06:33.279> never<00:06:33.639> work<00:06:33.849> that<00:06:34.060> hard<00:06:34.210> again

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
they actually never work that hard again

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.170 
they actually never work that hard again
and<00:06:34.820> I<00:06:35.820> think<00:06:36.090> when<00:06:36.990> you<00:06:37.110> fail<00:06:37.880> being<00:06:38.880> able<00:06:39.000> to

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
and I think when you fail being able to

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.570 
and I think when you fail being able to
to<00:06:39.720> have<00:06:39.900> that<00:06:40.080> that<00:06:40.770> another<00:06:41.130> moment<00:06:41.520> of
