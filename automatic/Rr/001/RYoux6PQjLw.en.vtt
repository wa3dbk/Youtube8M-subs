things we wanted to do in racecars but

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.860 
things we wanted to do in racecars but
could<00:00:38.510> never<00:00:38.629> afford<00:00:39.100> sort<00:00:40.100> of<00:00:40.160> a<00:00:40.870> molded

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.460 
front and rear sway bar adjustment
sequential<00:01:03.170> shifter<00:01:04.449> plenty<00:01:05.449> of<00:01:05.540> grip<00:01:05.720> sharks

car

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.800 

I<00:01:21.590> think<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:22.580> closest<00:01:23.030> thing<00:01:23.240> to<00:01:23.270> compare<00:01:23.720> it

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
I think the closest thing to compare it

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.649 
I think the closest thing to compare it
to<00:01:24.080> would<00:01:24.290> be<00:01:24.320> the<00:01:24.770> odds<00:01:24.920> of<00:01:25.010> racecars<00:01:25.479> we<00:01:26.479> are

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
to would be the odds of racecars we are

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:27.700 
to would be the odds of racecars we are
similar<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.140> them<00:01:27.260> they're<00:01:27.500> probably

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
similar to them they're probably

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.200 
similar to them they're probably
slightly<00:01:28.159> faster<00:01:28.520> in<00:01:28.580> a<00:01:28.640> straight<00:01:28.850> line<00:01:28.880> we're

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
slightly faster in a straight line we're

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.109 
slightly faster in a straight line we're
probably<00:01:29.390> slightly<00:01:29.780> quicker<00:01:29.900> in<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.140> corners

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
probably slightly quicker in the corners

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.640 
probably slightly quicker in the corners
lap<00:01:32.119> times<00:01:32.390> at<00:01:32.570> a<00:01:32.630> track<00:01:32.869> like<00:01:33.140> we've<00:01:33.350> done<00:01:33.500> for

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
lap times at a track like we've done for

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.740 
lap times at a track like we've done for
example<00:01:33.710> on<00:01:34.190> a<00:01:34.220> race<00:01:34.430> day<00:01:34.460> would<00:01:34.850> be<00:01:34.970> 130

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
example on a race day would be 130
