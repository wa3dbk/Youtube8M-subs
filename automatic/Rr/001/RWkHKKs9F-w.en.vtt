00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010 
one thing here so I don't like that a

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.370 
one thing here so I don't like that a
sharp<00:00:21.550> edge<00:00:21.820> from<00:00:22.119> that<00:00:22.360> ground<00:00:22.930> plane<00:00:23.140> that

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
sharp edge from that ground plane that

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.700 
sharp edge from that ground plane that
we<00:00:23.470> have<00:00:23.619> here<00:00:23.830> so<00:00:24.610> to<00:00:25.540> fix<00:00:25.720> that<00:00:25.930> so<00:00:26.380> select

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
we have here so to fix that so select

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.280 
we have here so to fix that so select
the<00:00:26.800> ground<00:00:27.040> plane<00:00:27.250> and<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:28.630> go<00:00:28.930> to<00:00:28.990> the

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
the ground plane and to go to the

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.499 
the ground plane and to go to the
attribute<00:00:29.800> editor<00:00:29.920> and<00:00:30.340> two<00:00:30.700> down<00:00:30.970> here<00:00:31.270> under

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
attribute editor and two down here under

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.530 
attribute editor and two down here under
the<00:00:31.840> military<00:00:32.110> tab<00:00:32.529> you<00:00:33.370> find<00:00:33.790> here<00:00:33.910> final

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
the military tab you find here final

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.900 
the military tab you find here final
gather<00:00:34.780> receive<00:00:35.380> so<00:00:35.890> let's<00:00:36.220> just<00:00:36.579> try<00:00:36.850> that

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
gather receive so let's just try that

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:44.290 
gather receive so let's just try that
off<00:00:37.149> and<00:00:37.739> take<00:00:38.739> a<00:00:38.770> quick<00:00:39.040> render<00:00:39.340> of<00:00:39.489> that

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.250 

yeah<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.600> that's<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.680> result<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.780> like<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.020> I

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
yeah so that's the result I like that I

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.500 
yeah so that's the result I like that I
mean<00:00:49.650> if<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.490> want<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.000> like<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.390> said

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
before you can put in some more lights

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.060 
before you can put in some more lights
to<00:00:54.240> have<00:00:54.450> some<00:00:54.690> more<00:00:54.720> highlights<00:00:55.350> or<00:00:55.710> whatever

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
to have some more highlights or whatever

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.520 
to have some more highlights or whatever
you<00:00:56.220> want<00:00:56.400> to<00:00:56.460> do<00:00:58.340> but<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.640> leave<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.260> like<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.290> is

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
and let me just increase a few steps

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.440 
and let me just increase a few steps
here<00:01:08.300> go<00:01:09.300> to<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.600> render<00:01:09.990> settings<00:01:10.350> here<00:01:10.920> and

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
here go to the render settings here and

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.950 
here go to the render settings here and
I<00:01:12.450> want<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.720> render<00:01:13.620> out<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.330> larger<00:01:15.330> image<00:01:15.630> so

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
I want to render out a larger image so

I want to render out a larger image so
let<00:01:16.229> me<00:01:16.350> just<00:01:17.220> go<00:01:17.370> here<00:01:17.550> to<00:01:17.580> preset<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.270> then

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
let me just go here to preset and then

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.570 
let me just go here to preset and then
say<00:01:18.690> okay<00:01:18.990> 1k<00:01:20.000> that's<00:01:21.000> okay<00:01:21.390> for<00:01:21.450> now<00:01:21.660> and<00:01:22.020> go

say okay 1k that's okay for now and go
ahead<00:01:23.580> with<00:01:23.700> quality<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.770> what<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.800> want<00:01:26.010> to<00:01:26.070> do

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
ahead with quality and what I want to do

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.820 
ahead with quality and what I want to do
is<00:01:26.190> if<00:01:26.910> you<00:01:27.000> look<00:01:27.150> at<00:01:27.270> here<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.260> see<00:01:28.619> this

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
is if you look at here so you see this

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.480 
is if you look at here so you see this
kind<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.760> edge<00:01:29.970> here<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.300> I<00:01:31.170> want<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:31.890> a

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
kind of edge here and I want this a

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.660 
kind of edge here and I want this a
little<00:01:32.910> bit<00:01:33.060> more<00:01:33.240> anti<00:01:33.810> alias<00:01:34.260> so<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.160> fix

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
little bit more anti alias so to fix

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.450 
little bit more anti alias so to fix
that<00:01:35.940> go<00:01:36.270> here<00:01:36.510> to<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:37.440> quality<00:01:37.860> tap<00:01:38.160> and<00:01:38.340> your

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
that go here to the quality tap and your

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.550 
that go here to the quality tap and your
render<00:01:38.729> settings<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.270> say<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:40.080> on<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.320> rate

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
render settings and say here on the rate

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.440 
render settings and say here on the rate
race<00:01:41.690> and<00:01:42.690> leave<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.800> a<00:01:43.880> with<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.030> setting

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
race and leave this a with the setting

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.139 
race and leave this a with the setting
here<00:01:45.600> adaptive<00:01:46.050> sampling<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.680> then<00:01:47.310> drop<00:01:48.119> it

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
here adaptive sampling and then drop it

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.960 
here adaptive sampling and then drop it
up<00:01:48.360> one<00:01:48.929> just<00:01:49.289> one<00:01:49.440> step<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.950> mean<00:01:50.100> if<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.700> dial

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
up one just one step I mean if you dial

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.960 
up one just one step I mean if you dial
it<00:01:51.149> up<00:01:52.399> you<00:01:53.399> will<00:01:53.580> have<00:01:53.910> a<00:01:54.590> tremendous<00:01:55.970> more

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
it up you will have a tremendous more

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.270 
it up you will have a tremendous more
render<00:01:57.330> time<00:01:57.539> with<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.929> so<00:01:58.530> beware<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.009> that

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
render time with that so beware of that

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.080 
render time with that so beware of that
yeah<00:02:01.190> so<00:02:02.750> with<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.899> stuff<00:02:04.289> done<00:02:04.820> yeah<00:02:05.820> let<00:02:06.000> me

yeah so with that stuff done yeah let me
take<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.539> quick<00:02:07.530> render<00:02:08.460> here<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:08.940> i'll<00:02:09.840> be

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
take a quick render here and i'll be

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.700 
take a quick render here and i'll be
back<00:02:10.140> when<00:02:10.380> that's<00:02:10.800> done<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:12.360> yeah<00:02:12.540> this<00:02:13.500> is

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
back when that's done so yeah this is

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.420 
back when that's done so yeah this is
some<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.580> final<00:02:14.910> render<00:02:15.180> mmm

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
some the final render mmm

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.349 
some the final render mmm
and<00:02:17.140> you<00:02:18.140> might<00:02:18.349> don't<00:02:18.650> see<00:02:19.239> something<00:02:20.239> down

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:20.359 
and you might don't see something down

and you might don't see something down
here<00:02:20.420> but<00:02:21.129> yeah<00:02:22.129> you<00:02:22.189> get<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.579> idea<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:24.129> there

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
here but yeah you get the idea so there

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.289 
here but yeah you get the idea so there
are<00:02:25.219> a<00:02:25.400> few<00:02:26.060> issues<00:02:26.269> so<00:02:27.019> that<00:02:27.049> we<00:02:27.409> can<00:02:27.560> fix<00:02:28.299> the

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
are a few issues so that we can fix the

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.660 
are a few issues so that we can fix the
one<00:02:29.420> thing<00:02:29.659> is<00:02:29.900> that<00:02:30.439> the<00:02:30.620> texture<00:02:31.069> here<00:02:31.430> and

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
one thing is that the texture here and

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.509 
one thing is that the texture here and
that<00:02:31.819> material<00:02:32.560> in<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.769> middle<00:02:34.129> of<00:02:34.219> that<00:02:34.400> room

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
that material in the middle of that room

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.119 
that material in the middle of that room
here<00:02:34.760> that's<00:02:35.209> a<00:02:35.569> little<00:02:35.780> bit<00:02:35.870> too<00:02:36.049> bright<00:02:36.319> if

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
here that's a little bit too bright if

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.929

so only check that region and they're
just<00:03:13.819> drag<00:03:14.060> it<00:03:14.090> in<00:03:14.269> and<00:03:14.480> then<00:03:16.180> yeah<00:03:17.180> let's

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
just drag it in and then yeah let's

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:25.700 
just drag it in and then yeah let's
let's<00:03:19.760> just<00:03:20.120> try<00:03:20.629> to<00:03:21.579> do<00:03:22.579> something

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:34.260 

we<00:03:26.250> want<00:03:26.640> to<00:03:26.730> put<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.440> reflectivity<00:03:28.460> 2.2

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.580 

and<00:03:34.900> that<00:03:35.410> doesn't<00:03:35.650> help<00:03:36.900> mmm<00:03:37.900> put<00:03:38.170> down<00:03:38.380> the

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
and that doesn't help mmm put down the

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.490 
and that doesn't help mmm put down the
glossiness<00:03:39.100> do<00:03:40.090> something<00:03:40.510> like<00:03:40.630> point<00:03:41.080> five

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.760 

it<00:03:45.010> doesn't<00:03:45.430> help<00:03:45.550> either<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:46.450> let's<00:03:46.960> maybe

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
it doesn't help either and let's maybe

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.160 
it doesn't help either and let's maybe
want<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.310> dial<00:03:48.490> down<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:48.790> weight<00:03:49.120> here<00:03:49.450> to

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
want to dial down the weight here to

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.880 
want to dial down the weight here to
something<00:03:50.620> like<00:03:50.740> point<00:03:51.130> five<00:03:52.260> that's<00:03:53.260> that

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
something like point five that's that

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:00.930 
something like point five that's that
that<00:03:54.310> helps

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.230 

so<00:04:01.940> okay<00:04:02.180> let's<00:04:02.600> stop<00:04:03.350> that<00:04:03.880> you<00:04:04.880> click<00:04:05.120> on

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
so okay let's stop that you click on

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.280 
so okay let's stop that you click on
that<00:04:05.390> button<00:04:05.450> up<00:04:05.780> here<00:04:05.990> to<00:04:06.320> stop<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:06.740> IPR<00:04:08.290> and

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
that button up here to stop the IPR and

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.420 
that button up here to stop the IPR and
now<00:04:09.620> with<00:04:09.950> that<00:04:10.100> done<00:04:11.470> so<00:04:12.470> you<00:04:12.560> can<00:04:12.680> go<00:04:12.980> in<00:04:13.160> here

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
now with that done so you can go in here

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.320 
now with that done so you can go in here
and<00:04:15.190> leave<00:04:16.190> all<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:16.549> settings<00:04:17.620> as<00:04:18.620> they<00:04:19.010> are

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
and leave all the settings as they are

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:26.510 
and leave all the settings as they are
but

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.969 

so<00:04:27.180> any<00:04:27.449> all<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:28.020> time<00:04:28.199> that<00:04:28.410> we<00:04:28.500> render<00:04:28.860> it's

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
so any all the time that we render it's

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.580 
so any all the time that we render it's
something<00:04:29.340> here<00:04:29.580> that's<00:04:30.060> always<00:04:30.539> been<00:04:30.780> the

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
something here that's always been the

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.899 
something here that's always been the
mesh<00:04:32.340> preview<00:04:33.000> so<00:04:33.960> and<00:04:34.169> you<00:04:34.259> can<00:04:34.490> go<00:04:35.490> in<00:04:35.699> here

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:35.909 
mesh preview so and you can go in here

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:39.260 
mesh preview so and you can go in here
and<00:04:36.289> with<00:04:37.289> the<00:04:37.440> object<00:04:37.949> is<00:04:38.099> selected<00:04:38.220> and<00:04:38.729> I

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
and with the object is selected and I

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.300 
and with the object is selected and I
only<00:04:39.539> want<00:04:39.780> to<00:04:39.840> change<00:04:40.110> this<00:04:40.620> on<00:04:40.919> the<00:04:41.129> main

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
only want to change this on the main

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
inner part and the bolts I mean that's

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.059 
inner part and the bolts I mean that's
that's<00:04:44.940> okay<00:04:45.300> we<00:04:45.449> can<00:04:45.479> leave<00:04:45.629> it<00:04:45.930> so<00:04:46.620> you<00:04:46.860> can

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
say here okay if you go to the smooth

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.770 
say here okay if you go to the smooth
mesh<00:04:51.720> here<00:04:52.050> smooth<00:04:52.979> my<00:04:53.159> preview<00:04:53.550> mmm<00:04:54.330> it's

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
mesh here smooth my preview mmm it's

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.020 
mesh here smooth my preview mmm it's
everything<00:04:55.199> is<00:04:55.440> ok<00:04:55.680> so<00:04:55.740> the<00:04:56.430> subdivision

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
everything is ok so the subdivision

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.080 
everything is ok so the subdivision
levels<00:04:57.389> you<00:04:58.020> can<00:04:58.050> say<00:04:58.409> display<00:04:59.190> subdivisions

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
levels you can say display subdivisions

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.710 
levels you can say display subdivisions
so<00:05:00.360> that's<00:05:00.840> something<00:05:01.169> we<00:05:01.440> don't<00:05:01.590> want<00:05:01.830> and

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
so that's something we don't want and

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.020 
so that's something we don't want and
here<00:05:03.720> you<00:05:03.840> can<00:05:04.050> say<00:05:04.530> use<00:05:04.860> preview<00:05:05.460> level<00:05:05.819> for

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
here you can say use preview level for

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.070 
here you can say use preview level for
rendering<00:05:06.919> mmm<00:05:07.919> we<00:05:08.759> want<00:05:09.030> we<00:05:09.599> don't<00:05:09.630> want<00:05:09.870> that

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
rendering mmm we want we don't want that

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.020 
rendering mmm we want we don't want that
where<00:05:10.620> you<00:05:10.710> want<00:05:10.800> to<00:05:10.919> crank<00:05:11.250> that<00:05:11.340> up<00:05:11.460> maybe

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
where you want to crank that up maybe

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.980 
where you want to crank that up maybe
one<00:05:12.509> step<00:05:12.539> further<00:05:13.020> and<00:05:14.569> let's<00:05:15.569> take<00:05:15.840> another

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
one step further and let's take another

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:26.920 
one step further and let's take another
winner<00:05:16.409> of<00:05:16.620> that

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.650 

so<00:05:27.930> yeah<00:05:28.140> that's<00:05:28.380> that's<00:05:28.860> it<00:05:29.130> that's<00:05:29.790> the<00:05:30.330> room

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
so yeah that's that's it that's the room

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.770
