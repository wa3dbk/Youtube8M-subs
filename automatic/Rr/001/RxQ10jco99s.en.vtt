the handbrake only not break either at
the<00:01:22.320> same<00:01:22.500> time<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:23.520> um<00:01:23.869> I'll<00:01:24.869> be<00:01:24.900> showing<00:01:25.409> you

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
a little bit of gameplay of handbrake

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.800 
a little bit of gameplay of handbrake
drift<00:01:27.270> right<00:01:27.659> now<00:01:28.670> I'll<00:01:29.670> do<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.970> little<00:01:30.119> bit<00:01:30.270> fat

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
drift right now I'll do a little bit fat

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.840 
drift right now I'll do a little bit fat
I'll<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.200> some<00:01:31.380> fast<00:01:31.650> ones<00:01:31.950> I'll<00:01:32.250> do<00:01:32.400> some<00:01:32.579> slow

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
I'll do some fast ones I'll do some slow

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.590 
I'll do some fast ones I'll do some slow
ones<00:01:33.119> I'll<00:01:33.600> do<00:01:33.960> some<00:01:34.140> combination<00:01:34.320> ones<00:01:35.600> but

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
ones I'll do some combination ones but

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.120 
ones I'll do some combination ones but
some<00:01:36.840> once<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.350> press<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.710> you're<00:01:37.860> going<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.040> be

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
some once you press a you're going to be

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.800 
some once you press a you're going to be
holding<00:01:38.280> RT<00:01:38.759> at<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.939> same<00:01:39.150> time<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.689> can

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
holding RT at the same time so you can

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.819 
holding RT at the same time so you can
keep<00:01:39.930> your<00:01:40.110> speed<00:01:40.290> around<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.560> corner

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
keep your speed around the corner

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.080 
keep your speed around the corner
because<00:01:41.009> that's<00:01:41.159> basically<00:01:41.340> what<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.850> drift

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
because that's basically what the drift

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.249 
because that's basically what the drift
what<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> drift<00:01:42.960> means<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:45.140> hopefully<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
what a drift means so hopefully the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.920 
what a drift means so hopefully the
radio<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.770> off<00:01:47.040> yes<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.700> off<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:48.270> don't<00:01:48.840> have

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
radio is off yes it is off I don't have

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.690 
radio is off yes it is off I don't have
my<00:01:49.079> other<00:01:49.229> headset<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:49.740> right<00:01:49.950> now<00:01:50.070> but<00:01:50.369> I'm

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
my other headset on right now but I'm

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.760 
my other headset on right now but I'm
using<00:01:50.970> one<00:01:51.270> for<00:01:51.479> my<00:01:51.600> computer<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.170> can<00:01:52.350> chat

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.719 

it<00:01:55.770> looks<00:01:55.950> pretty<00:01:56.280> good

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
it looks pretty good

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.999 
it looks pretty good
I<00:01:56.759> think<00:01:57.210> LT<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.110> at<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.380> same<00:01:58.560> time<00:01:58.829> is

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
I think LT and a at the same time is

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.580 
I think LT and a at the same time is
good<00:01:59.540> is<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.600> little<00:02:00.869> bit<00:02:00.990> better<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.469> looks

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
good is a little bit better and it looks

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.990 
good is a little bit better and it looks
like<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.799> keeps<00:02:01.920> your<00:02:02.280> speed<00:02:02.520> more<00:02:02.850> but

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
like it keeps your speed more but

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.469 
like it keeps your speed more but
so<00:02:05.720> uh<00:02:05.750> I<00:02:06.230> will<00:02:06.530> stop<00:02:06.800> and<00:02:07.070> show<00:02:07.250> you<00:02:07.310> break<00:02:08.179> and

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
so uh I will stop and show you break and

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.130 
so uh I will stop and show you break and
handbrake<00:02:09.110> drift<00:02:09.440> at<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.100> same<00:02:10.310> time<00:02:10.840> so<00:02:11.840> what

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
handbrake drift at the same time so what

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.360 
handbrake drift at the same time so what
you're<00:02:12.230> going<00:02:12.320> to<00:02:12.380> want<00:02:12.560> to<00:02:12.590> do<00:02:12.710> is<00:02:12.890> judge<00:02:13.190> your

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
you're going to want to do is judge your

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.850 
you're going to want to do is judge your
distance<00:02:13.760> just<00:02:14.030> like<00:02:14.090> last<00:02:14.390> time<00:02:14.620> you<00:02:15.620> want<00:02:15.800> to

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
distance just like last time you want to

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.380 
distance just like last time you want to
get<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:15.980> little<00:02:16.250> bit<00:02:16.370> of<00:02:16.460> speed<00:02:16.670> depending<00:02:17.270> on

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
get a little bit of speed depending on

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.300 
get a little bit of speed depending on
how<00:02:17.510> fast<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:18.470> want<00:02:18.560> your<00:02:18.740> drift<00:02:18.950> how<00:02:19.100> slow

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
how fast you want your drift how slow

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.460 
how fast you want your drift how slow
you<00:02:19.460> want<00:02:19.580> it<00:02:19.760> you're<00:02:20.240> going<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.420> hold<00:02:20.690> LT<00:02:21.170> and

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
you want it you're going to hold LT and

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.380 
you want it you're going to hold LT and
a<00:02:21.890> at<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:22.220> same<00:02:22.430> time<00:02:22.700> while<00:02:23.120> you're<00:02:23.150> turning

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
a at the same time while you're turning

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.550 
a at the same time while you're turning
a<00:02:23.600> corner<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:24.110> then<00:02:24.350> let<00:02:24.530> go<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:24.770> hold<00:02:25.280> RT<00:02:25.700> and

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
a corner and then let go and hold RT and

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.210 
a corner and then let go and hold RT and
that<00:02:27.560> car<00:02:27.860> got<00:02:28.010> in<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.250> way<00:02:28.400> no<00:02:28.760> big<00:02:28.970> deal<00:02:30.220> but

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
that car got in the way no big deal but

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
that car got in the way no big deal but
um<00:02:31.430> slighty<00:02:32.390> cars<00:02:32.690> G<00:02:32.959> just<00:02:33.170> makes<00:02:33.410> it<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:34.240> little

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
um slighty cars G just makes it a little

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.150 
um slighty cars G just makes it a little
bit<00:02:35.420> more<00:02:35.570> slighty<00:02:35.990> and<00:02:36.440> more<00:02:36.770> like<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:36.950> power

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
bit more slighty and more like a power

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.030 
bit more slighty and more like a power
slide<00:02:37.520> but<00:02:37.910> uh<00:02:37.940> as<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:39.470> can<00:02:39.500> see<00:02:39.620> this<00:02:39.890> is

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
slide but uh as you can see this is

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.680 
slide but uh as you can see this is
drift<00:02:40.810> um<00:02:42.640> if<00:02:43.640> you<00:02:43.820> guys<00:02:43.940> want<00:02:44.239> to<00:02:44.300> know<00:02:44.510> where

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
drift um if you guys want to know where

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.900 
drift um if you guys want to know where
to<00:02:44.810> drift<00:02:45.140> just<00:02:45.530> practice<00:02:46.040> right<00:02:46.489> here<00:02:46.730> I'm

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
to drift just practice right here I'm

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.060 
to drift just practice right here I'm
drifting<00:02:47.320> there's<00:02:48.320> a<00:02:48.380> red<00:02:48.500> dot<00:02:48.530> apparently

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
drifting there's a red dot apparently

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.070 
drifting there's a red dot apparently
cuz<00:02:49.190> ran<00:02:49.370> into<00:02:49.610> them<00:02:49.730> but<00:02:49.970> it's<00:02:50.300> a<00:02:50.420> doc<00:02:50.690> it's

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
cuz ran into them but it's a doc it's

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.510 
cuz ran into them but it's a doc it's
pretty<00:02:51.290> good<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.590> drift<00:02:51.890> there's<00:02:52.160> some<00:02:52.280> pretty

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
pretty good to drift there's some pretty

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.340 
pretty good to drift there's some pretty
nice<00:02:52.700> turns<00:02:53.060> but<00:02:53.720> if<00:02:53.840> you<00:02:54.020> want<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.200> practice

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
nice turns but if you want to practice

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.260 
nice turns but if you want to practice
in<00:02:54.800> the<00:02:54.950> city<00:02:55.190> you<00:02:55.370> can<00:02:55.610> but<00:02:55.880> there's<00:02:56.060> too<00:02:56.180> many

as<00:03:33.769> you<00:03:33.920> can<00:03:34.070> see<00:03:34.280> it's<00:03:34.400> a<00:03:34.489> little<00:03:34.730> bit<00:03:34.820> more

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
as you can see it's a little bit more

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.750 
as you can see it's a little bit more
sliding<00:03:35.450> as<00:03:35.570> you<00:03:36.500> can<00:03:36.650> see<00:03:36.890> it's<00:03:37.459> better<00:03:37.670> a

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
sliding as you can see it's better a

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.470 
sliding as you can see it's better a
drifting<00:03:38.269> but<00:03:38.540> uh<00:03:38.920> it's<00:03:39.920> um<00:03:40.280> it's<00:03:41.000> not<00:03:41.269> like

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
drifting but uh it's um it's not like

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.900 
drifting but uh it's um it's not like
real<00:03:41.690> drifting<00:03:42.310> well<00:03:43.310> I<00:03:43.340> guess<00:03:43.549> it's<00:03:43.700> more

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
real drifting well I guess it's more

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.699 
real drifting well I guess it's more
like<00:03:44.120> real<00:03:44.269> drifting<00:03:44.720> but<00:03:44.959> it's<00:03:45.350> better<00:03:45.530> to

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
like real drifting but it's better to

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.319 
like real drifting but it's better to
just<00:03:45.739> without<00:03:46.220> it<00:03:46.370> because<00:03:46.670> you're<00:03:47.180> more

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
just without it because you're more

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.479 
just without it because you're more
legit<00:03:47.690> I<00:03:47.810> think<00:03:48.079> but<00:03:48.680> I'll<00:03:48.829> do<00:03:49.010> some<00:03:49.190> slutty

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
legit I think but I'll do some slutty

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.250 
legit I think but I'll do some slutty
cars<00:03:49.820> drifting<00:03:50.390> right<00:03:50.540> now<00:03:50.720> for<00:03:51.019> a<00:03:51.049> little<00:03:51.140> bit

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
cars drifting right now for a little bit

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.650 
cars drifting right now for a little bit
I<00:03:51.380> guess<00:03:51.640> but<00:03:52.640> you<00:03:52.700> keep<00:03:53.090> your<00:03:53.239> speed<00:03:53.480> a<00:03:53.510> little

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
I guess but you keep your speed a little

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.789 
I guess but you keep your speed a little
bit<00:03:53.780> more<00:03:54.170> well<00:03:54.739> not<00:03:54.920> exactly<00:03:55.280> but<00:03:56.620> it<00:03:57.620> just

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
bit more well not exactly but it just

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.530 
bit more well not exactly but it just
seems<00:03:58.130> like<00:03:58.459> it's<00:03:58.640> a<00:03:58.730> little<00:03:58.910> bit<00:03:59.030> better<00:03:59.150> but

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
seems like it's a little bit better but

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.780 
seems like it's a little bit better but
not<00:03:59.600> really<00:04:00.049> I<00:04:00.230> don't<00:04:00.739> really<00:04:01.010> think<00:04:01.160> so<00:04:01.549> but

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
not really I don't really think so but

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.479 
not really I don't really think so but
uh<00:04:02.440> it's<00:04:03.440> a<00:04:03.470> little<00:04:03.590> bit<00:04:03.799> hard<00:04:04.010> to<00:04:04.070> do<00:04:04.250> with

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
uh it's a little bit hard to do with

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.030 
uh it's a little bit hard to do with
slighty<00:04:04.700> cars<00:04:05.530> pretty<00:04:06.530> big<00:04:06.709> difference

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
slighty cars pretty big difference

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.140 
slighty cars pretty big difference
actually<00:04:07.370> I<00:04:07.430> don't<00:04:07.579> know<00:04:07.640> if<00:04:07.730> it's<00:04:07.850> for<00:04:08.000> all

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
actually I don't know if it's for all

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.690 
actually I don't know if it's for all
cars<00:04:08.450> in<00:04:08.630> the<00:04:08.720> game<00:04:08.870> like<00:04:09.860> the<00:04:09.980> pedestrians<00:04:10.579> or

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
cars in the game like the pedestrians or

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.500 
cars in the game like the pedestrians or
not<00:04:10.820> but<00:04:11.750> um<00:04:12.459> I'll<00:04:13.459> just<00:04:13.520> do<00:04:13.879> some<00:04:14.060> gameplay<00:04:14.390> of

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
not but um I'll just do some gameplay of

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.330 
not but um I'll just do some gameplay of
this<00:04:14.720> and<00:04:15.020> probably<00:04:15.560> a<00:04:15.590> little<00:04:15.709> bit<00:04:15.920> short<00:04:16.250> of

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
this and probably a little bit short of

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.349 
this and probably a little bit short of
gameplay<00:04:16.789> or<00:04:17.150> a<00:04:17.180> short<00:04:17.510> gameplay<00:04:17.720> after<00:04:18.200> this
