00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.730
 then 30 years ago people did not have 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.740
 option to buy your fabrics with your 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.650
 designs then the people who 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.630
 they set up this company they identified in 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.000
 the market that there was a need for 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.560
 that people had their own 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.560
 prints and in less meters 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.470
 we here, we have a 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.740
 trend research 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.870
 we launch collections in certain 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.460
 times of the year that can serve you 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.030
 the companies or the people that come 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.190
 to say good that you're using that 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.200
 is going to use what is the line of 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.780
 more or less trend that comes in the 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.140
 market but each one adapts it to its 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.140
 brand 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.440
 we who work in 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.680
 we print we go to a shopping center 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.180
 in the city or to a supermarket at a 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.490
 large fruit market chain 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.920
 we can always identify things that 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.020
 they were made here in prints when 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.730
 I'm walking down the street and I see a 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.560
 person who has a design that sanz 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.620
 we go to Cadiz communism as a son 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.450
 walking around because the tooth does not like 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.450
 how rich then of minutes 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.600
 we are in three ways 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.810
 different the first one is stamping 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.759
 rotary is with some machines that are 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.259
 large prints by means of 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:41.130
 cylinders and the technique is to write here 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.860
 we can see that the fabric enters white to 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.979
 the machine and here each one of these 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.190
 cylinders is a color that is going 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.490
 stamping 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.760
 the fabric that enters each and leaves dry 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.750
 on the other side 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.300
 to machines that can get to stamp 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.030
 40 meters per minute or less 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.760
 normally it works at 10 meters 12 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.860
 meters per minute of the process 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.190
 stamping on the in the rotary machine 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.500
 the fabrics pass to that machine that is that 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.960
 machine a thermosetting machine that 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.270
 It means that heat is fixed in the middle 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:24.190
 the color well to the fabric so that the fabric 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:26.470
 resist the knife and and that's it 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.060
 comes out rolled up they pack already for 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.060
 dispatch to the client as it is is 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.480
 the other technique is digital printing 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.700
 which is the state of the art in the 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.650
 stamping digital campaigns for 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.900
 the design directly from the computer to 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.800
 the fabric by means of a system of 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.800
 taste injection 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.820
 it is a printer 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.700
 a normal printer in a format 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.830
 large with a conveyor belt 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.170
 fabric where the tensions of 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.820
 The cloth are designed machines 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.820
 especially for textile 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.970
 the vaporizer is a machine where the 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.120
 fabric passes internally get rid of 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.790
 has a Turkish bath get through 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.720
 of steam the ink that was impregnated 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:27.379
 the fabric with the with the first chemical 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:31.670
 process they do a reaction gets more 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:33.569
 alive and the solidity to washing and all this 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.379
 is guaranteed 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:39.719
 do not get out of there washes the fabric eliminates 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:42.989
 the color that did not react in the 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:45.120
 vaporizer and already there comes the dry cloth and 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.769
 is ready to deliver yasa 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.769
 ready to deliver to customers 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.819
 in the covers of portable designs 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.950
 they are by means of hundreds after being a 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.659
 little flatter but printing 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.590
 digital we can make designs 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:03.890
 photographic without limit of colors without 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.500
 size limit that's why it has 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.280
 caught so much force stamping 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.920
 digital in the world for the minimum 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:16.280
 precisely because the designers 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:18.320
 they can make many of the same fabric 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.150
 printing options for your client and 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.580
 those unique if you are a person 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:27.139
 natural a person who wants to stamp 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.389
 some agreements to educate a picture a 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.800
 curtain can go without any problem 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.389
 because digital printing 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.580
 minimum those of instruments no longer 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.580
 we have no restriction 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.229
 the world I think that stamping by 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.750
 more that continues evolving in the subject 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:47.030
 digital that there are already high machines 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.949
 production but digital and that's the 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.350
 stamping rotary stamping 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:53.060
 flat manual stamping are not going to 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.020
 disappear because they all have their 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.020
 market niches
