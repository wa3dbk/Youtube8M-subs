00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.080
 clear 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:17.310
 hello and welcome to this new test around an autopsy 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.329
 today as planned it rages 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:23.429
 the game to conclude his qe2 1985 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:25.499
 of the same bank also 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.960
 gold it's a fighting game a contract in a kind less realistic martial 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.910
 so here no fireball not displease the patches she said 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.160
 the goal of the game is to beat a series of opponents stronger and stronger 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.360
 until the tenth year 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.710
 at each level you have to beat two opponents to score two points 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.380
 there is none left 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.970
 Chinese chakouri to get around the point about the perfection of his 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.100
 execution 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.850
 if all goes well we can spread his opponent blows 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.050
 we are certain that people will be two shots 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.100
 the fight lasts 30 seconds 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.240
 each convoy type range have more or less points a jumped jump 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.670
 for example report all the points so well done while an average scan 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.570
 only reports 103 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.850
 if at the end of the fight neither of the two players got two points he denies in 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.680
 referee block the winner's sites by removing a redder fan than the 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.290
 winner color 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.290
 the number of points is counted at that time in the event of a tie 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.460
 the game has four different decors 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.770
 very nice can according to criteria of the time but are unfortunately 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.130
 still completely fixed 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.960
 so the graphics are very beautiful the animation of the characters very 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.410
 detailed and a great attention to detail because for example both 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.290
 opponents greet each other early in the match 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.290
 and the winner will just have his belt at the end of the fight 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.579
 animations however saint paul sang the very precise maneuverability 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.550
 for this game is so always very enjoyable to play nowadays 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.390
 finally the music denis breant year especially that of the demo are 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.250
 beautiful 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.010
 a little lesson 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.150
 the strength the relays are very impressive for the time 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.049
 since July 19, 2008 where we know that if we are young more 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.100
 so what are the different moves disposition 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.520
 I take my note 6 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.469
 to give you the names 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:10.889
 but official 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.229
 the return of the beautiful days 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:15.229
 we have the famous kick in the mouth 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.379
 then unclog the nose 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:28.509
 then we have the whiplash 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:34.309
 gastroenteritis is a life of the stomach 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:39.419
 the decision maker 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.329
 the sweeper 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.829
 the rear scanner 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.639
 the pure jaw cat 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:02.699
 the belly chime 

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:09.059
 the net Chinese team 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.670
 and then of course we can jump we can hurt we can do a jump 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:14.370
 perilous before 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.719
 at the rear somersault 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.719
 and we can parry the shots of the opponent is back 

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:23.779
 when I leave the place to a friend you can not comment on my 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:25.489
 account 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:26.899
 the mouth 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:29.089
 the fortnight butcher's sleeve 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:32.079
 after two days you're white to lift 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.019
 like right I know it takes the twin brother of the first twenty 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.549
 we sign the old sage that if the opposition during match 1 and if the 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:41.559
 referees 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:44.909
 the victims of a terrible road accident that left him paralyzed from 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:45.909
 five members 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.909
 he can unfortunately no longer beautiful game 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:52.450
 to the violin found in the district of fontvieille 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.149
 only solution for the duel only with the keys of his fund 

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:57.219
 and why 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:00.659
 it's simply because hitting the environment too hard 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:01.979
 all holders 

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.979
 or everyone else to the point of no longer being able to reproduce 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:10.629
 I did not like 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:15.059
 then little fun detail the end of the 4th scenery is the one where prognosis 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.279
 once you've defeated your two opponents soon and you're going 

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:22.210
 on him suffering from the left shoulder 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.830
 to beat him 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.839
 but the fact of succeeding or not of the prada influence on the continuation of the ticket 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.490
 I'm just a little extra bonus 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.439
 so this game I rate it 6 out of 6 

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:40.469
 but for several reasons first because there are lots of good memories 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:41.800
 as far as I'm concerned 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.599
 then it is very well done and ipo and it is very nice to play 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.650
 This is his only fault, perhaps, because of the relative slowness 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.210
 in the animation 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.890
 but it frankly side of the pleasure that have so we feel to go play 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.479
 next to the precision of his control gusset 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.479
 I do not see anything that could push me to put a lower note 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:13.300
 so this is this pokemon sparkling series remains unfolded was 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.300
 explode a sad melbourne upward 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:23.029
 and I leave you with the music of nirvana 

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.330
 Why 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:51.729
 sad
