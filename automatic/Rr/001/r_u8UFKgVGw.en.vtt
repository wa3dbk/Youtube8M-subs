look at the Canon 70d which is a direct

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.680 
look at the Canon 70d which is a direct
replacement<00:00:57.780> for<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.800> 60d<00:00:59.760> it<00:01:00.059> has<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> twenty

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
it a dual pixel CMOS AF sensor so what

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.050

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
new type of sensor means but what it

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.640

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
autofocus this is the first time that

autofocus this is the first time that
something<00:01:23.790> has<00:01:24.030> said<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:24.450> going<00:01:24.630> to

track your image like it was a camcorder

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.060 
track your image like it was a camcorder
because<00:01:27.509> camcorders<00:01:28.140> do<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> great<00:01:28.560> job<00:01:28.799> with

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
because camcorders do a great job with

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.340 
because camcorders do a great job with
autofocus<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.119> we<00:01:30.479> haven't<00:01:30.780> seen<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.140> yet

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
autofocus and we haven't seen this yet

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.160 
autofocus and we haven't seen this yet
in<00:01:31.590> digital<00:01:32.100> SLRs<00:01:32.820> where<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.360> they<00:01:33.509> follow

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
in digital SLRs where that they follow

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.170 
in digital SLRs where that they follow
focus<00:01:34.650> without<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:35.189> having<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.579> do<00:01:35.729> very<00:01:35.970> much

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
focus without you having to do very much

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.240 
focus without you having to do very much
that<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.900> step<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.829> right<00:01:37.979> direction

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
that is a step in the right direction

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.109 
that is a step in the right direction
now<00:01:38.759> I'd<00:01:39.060> like<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.270> think<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:40.430> these<00:01:41.430> DX

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
now I'd like to think that these DX

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.560 
now I'd like to think that these DX
cameras<00:01:42.570> are<00:01:42.720> these<00:01:42.840> AF<00:01:43.290> what<00:01:43.920> AF<00:01:44.430> c--<00:01:44.909> cameras

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.410 
cameras are these AF what AF c-- cameras

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
it works and if it works in this type of

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.209 
it works and if it works in this type of
camera<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.869> think<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.560> may<00:01:55.710> see<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:56.040> in

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
camera I think that you may see it in

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.920 
camera I think that you may see it in

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.590

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
runs the buffer and I think canon wins

runs the buffer and I think canon wins
on<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.570> buffer<00:02:21.960> and<00:02:21.990> because<00:02:22.530> they<00:02:22.680> do<00:02:22.740> better

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.520 
on the buffer and because they do better
video<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:23.910> because<00:02:24.420> they<00:02:24.600> do<00:02:24.660> video<00:02:25.200> very

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530

well<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.890> think<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.310> helps<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.730> buffering<00:02:27.120> on

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
well I think that helps the buffering on

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.630 
well I think that helps the buffering on

them are cross-type sensors cross-type

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.960 
them are cross-type sensors cross-type
is<00:02:58.440> really<00:02:58.710> important<00:02:59.130> because<00:02:59.220> it<00:02:59.490> helps<00:02:59.520> you

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
is really important because it helps you

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.850 
is really important because it helps you
with<00:03:00.390> your<00:03:00.450> autofocus<00:03:01.230> because<00:03:01.440> it's<00:03:01.590> reading

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
with your autofocus because it's reading

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.140 
with your autofocus because it's reading
from<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.100> verticals<00:03:02.520> it's<00:03:02.670> reading<00:03:02.940> from<00:03:03.030> the

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
from the verticals it's reading from the

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.970 
from the verticals it's reading from the
horizontals<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:03.990> that<00:03:04.380> is<00:03:04.590> what<00:03:04.830> you're

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
horizontals and that is what you're

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.410 
horizontals and that is what you're
looking<00:03:05.250> for<00:03:05.430> from<00:03:05.550> what<00:03:05.730> I've<00:03:05.880> read<00:03:06.090> it's<00:03:06.300> the

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
looking for from what I've read it's the

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.400 
looking for from what I've read it's the
same<00:03:07.100> focusing<00:03:08.100> system<00:03:08.430> as<00:03:08.550> what's<00:03:08.820> in<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.420> 7d

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
same focusing system as what's in the 7d

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.020 
same focusing system as what's in the 7d
so<00:03:10.800> I<00:03:10.830> think<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.190> this<00:03:11.310> camera<00:03:11.670> pretty<00:03:11.850> much

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
so I think that this camera pretty much

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.150 
so I think that this camera pretty much
replaces<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.780> 7d<00:03:13.290> even<00:03:13.650> though<00:03:13.710> it's<00:03:13.860> not<00:03:13.980> 8

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
replaces the 7d even though it's not 8

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.490 
replaces the 7d even though it's not 8
frames<00:03:14.400> a<00:03:14.520> second<00:03:14.820> like<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.000> 7d<00:03:15.390> was<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:16.050> 7d

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
frames a second like the 7d was the 7d

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.320 
frames a second like the 7d was the 7d
at<00:03:16.710> this<00:03:16.890> point<00:03:17.190> is<00:03:17.340> probably<00:03:17.490> waiting<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.180> get

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
at this point is probably waiting to get

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.540 
at this point is probably waiting to get
replaced<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:18.960> who<00:03:19.380> knows<00:03:19.620> what<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.130> number

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
replaced and who knows what the number

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.280 
replaced and who knows what the number
system<00:03:20.790> is<00:03:21.060> going<00:03:21.270> to<00:03:21.390> be<00:03:21.570> they<00:03:21.930> need<00:03:22.050> to<00:03:22.170> come

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
system is going to be they need to come

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.050 
system is going to be they need to come
up<00:03:22.410> with<00:03:22.470> some<00:03:22.680> whole<00:03:22.980> new<00:03:23.220> lines<00:03:23.490> of<00:03:23.640> systems

up with some whole new lines of systems

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.670 
up with some whole new lines of systems
because<00:03:24.540> their<00:03:24.690> numbers<00:03:24.990> are<00:03:25.140> all<00:03:25.260> over<00:03:25.590> the

because their numbers are all over the
place<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:26.040> 5d<00:03:26.490> is<00:03:26.550> better<00:03:26.790> than<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.120> 6d<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:28.110> 5

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
place the 5d is better than the 6d the 5

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.000 
place the 5d is better than the 6d the 5
the<00:03:28.800> 6d<00:03:29.250> is<00:03:29.280> maybe<00:03:29.730> better<00:03:29.970> than<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.360> DS<00:03:30.980> 7d<00:03:31.980> d

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
the 6d is maybe better than the DS 7d d

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.890 
the 6d is maybe better than the DS 7d d
are<00:03:32.340> just<00:03:32.580> too<00:03:32.700> many<00:03:32.850> numbers<00:03:33.090> what<00:03:33.750> is

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
are just too many numbers what is

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.440 
are just too many numbers what is
interesting<00:03:34.230> is<00:03:34.530> that<00:03:34.560> it<00:03:34.710> has<00:03:34.800> a<00:03:34.830> 98%

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
interesting is that it has a 98%

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.190 
interesting is that it has a 98%
viewfinder<00:03:36.450> instead<00:03:36.660> of<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.810> hundred<00:03:37.080> percent

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
viewfinder instead of a hundred percent

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.250 
viewfinder instead of a hundred percent
like<00:03:37.800> the<00:03:37.950> 60d<00:03:38.520> had<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:39.000> like<00:03:39.210> the<00:03:39.330> Nikon<00:03:39.750> d70

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
like the 60d had and like the Nikon d70

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.970 
like the 60d had and like the Nikon d70
100<00:03:40.410> has<00:03:40.950> it<00:03:41.430> has<00:03:41.610> only<00:03:42.050> 98%<00:03:43.050> but<00:03:43.290> maybe<00:03:43.710> that's

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
100 has it has only 98% but maybe that's

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.190 
100 has it has only 98% but maybe that's
because<00:03:44.130> it<00:03:44.400> has<00:03:44.640> it<00:03:45.090> has<00:03:45.300> Wi-Fi<00:03:45.540> built-in

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
because it has it has Wi-Fi built-in

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.050 
because it has it has Wi-Fi built-in
maybe<00:03:46.500> they<00:03:46.620> needed<00:03:46.800> to<00:03:46.950> find<00:03:47.190> some<00:03:47.490> some

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
maybe they needed to find some some

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.870 
maybe they needed to find some some
places<00:03:48.960> to<00:03:49.290> put<00:03:49.530> that<00:03:49.740> Wi-Fi<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.490> they<00:03:50.700> had<00:03:50.850> a

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
places to put that Wi-Fi and they had a

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.240 
places to put that Wi-Fi and they had a
sacrifice<00:03:51.450> a<00:03:51.480> viewfinder<00:03:51.840> for<00:03:52.350> that<00:03:52.470> now<00:03:52.830> 98%

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
sacrifice a viewfinder for that now 98%

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.250 
sacrifice a viewfinder for that now 98%
coverage<00:03:53.940> is<00:03:54.060> not<00:03:54.180> terrible<00:03:54.690> but<00:03:54.840> what<00:03:55.140> that

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
coverage is not terrible but what that

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.480 
coverage is not terrible but what that
means<00:03:55.440> is<00:03:55.620> when<00:03:55.770> you're<00:03:55.890> looking<00:03:56.190> through<00:03:56.250> the

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
means is when you're looking through the

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:57.950 
means is when you're looking through the
viewfinder<00:03:56.730> you're<00:03:57.420> not<00:03:57.600> going<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.840> see

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
viewfinder you're not going to see

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.750 
viewfinder you're not going to see
everything<00:03:58.440> that's<00:03:58.770> going<00:03:58.890> to<00:03:59.100> be<00:03:59.250> in<00:03:59.580> the

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
everything that's going to be in the

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.760 
everything that's going to be in the
image<00:03:59.910> so<00:04:00.450> what<00:04:00.690> I<00:04:00.720> used<00:04:01.020> to<00:04:01.170> do<00:04:01.320> is<00:04:01.470> you<00:04:01.620> would

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
image so what I used to do is you would

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.120 
image so what I used to do is you would
touch<00:04:02.570> somebody's<00:04:03.570> top<00:04:03.780> of<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.020> head<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.950> the

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
touch somebody's top of the head to the

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.370 
touch somebody's top of the head to the
top<00:04:05.310> of<00:04:05.460> the<00:04:05.520> viewfinder<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:06.330> that<00:04:06.990> you<00:04:07.140> knew

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
top of the viewfinder and that you knew

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.810 
top of the viewfinder and that you knew
that<00:04:07.530> you<00:04:07.620> had<00:04:07.650> a<00:04:07.770> little<00:04:08.070> bit<00:04:08.220> of<00:04:08.250> extra<00:04:08.580> space

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
that you had a little bit of extra space

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.220 
that you had a little bit of extra space
to<00:04:09.709> spare<00:04:10.709> when<00:04:11.250> you<00:04:11.340> got<00:04:11.490> the<00:04:11.610> image<00:04:11.910> back

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
to spare when you got the image back

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.180 
to spare when you got the image back
when<00:04:13.230> you<00:04:13.320> got<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.590> results<00:04:13.980> it<00:04:14.040> has<00:04:14.160> a

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
when you got the results it has a

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.030 
when you got the results it has a
rotating<00:04:14.459> 3-inch<00:04:15.420> touch<00:04:15.780> screen<00:04:16.380> I<00:04:16.560> actually

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
rotating 3-inch touch screen I actually

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.039 
rotating 3-inch touch screen I actually
really<00:04:17.640> liked<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.209> touch<00:04:18.420> screen<00:04:18.750> that<00:04:18.900> they

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
really liked the touch screen that they

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.620 
really liked the touch screen that they
have<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.680> touch<00:04:19.920> screen<00:04:20.220> works<00:04:20.549> very<00:04:21.090> well<00:04:21.239> in

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
have the touch screen works very well in

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.080 
have the touch screen works very well in
the<00:04:21.810> t3<00:04:22.380> and<00:04:22.530> sorry<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:22.890> t4i<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.669> t5<00:04:24.060> I

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
the t3 and sorry the t4i and the t5 I

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.390 
the t3 and sorry the t4i and the t5 I
its<00:04:24.690> multi-touch<00:04:25.410> I<00:04:25.590> was<00:04:25.800> surprised<00:04:26.220> at<00:04:26.370> how

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
its multi-touch I was surprised at how

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.020 
its multi-touch I was surprised at how
much<00:04:26.729> I

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
much I

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.610 
much I
liked<00:04:27.210> it<00:04:27.360> and<00:04:27.540> it<00:04:27.840> just<00:04:27.870> works<00:04:28.290> it's<00:04:28.500> like

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
liked it and it just works it's like

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.860 
liked it and it just works it's like
using<00:04:28.770> an<00:04:29.010> iPhone<00:04:29.430> or<00:04:29.700> any<00:04:29.850> other<00:04:30.090> touch

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
using an iPhone or any other touch

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.140 
using an iPhone or any other touch
device<00:04:31.290> it<00:04:31.680> works<00:04:32.010> very<00:04:32.310> very<00:04:32.460> well<00:04:32.910> and<00:04:33.030> I<00:04:33.120> was

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
device it works very very well and I was

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.970 
device it works very very well and I was
very<00:04:33.270> happy<00:04:33.870> with<00:04:34.260> the<00:04:34.410> screen<00:04:34.680> that<00:04:34.860> they

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
very happy with the screen that they

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.879 
very happy with the screen that they
used<00:04:35.280> it<00:04:36.060> only<00:04:36.210> has<00:04:36.540> one<00:04:36.570> SD<00:04:37.139> card<00:04:37.410> slot<00:04:37.680> where

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
used it only has one SD card slot where

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.890 
used it only has one SD card slot where
the<00:04:38.100> Nikon<00:04:38.490> is<00:04:38.520> on<00:04:38.700> the<00:04:38.790> other<00:04:38.940> hand<00:04:39.180> have<00:04:39.540> two

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
the Nikon is on the other hand have two

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.090 
the Nikon is on the other hand have two
is<00:04:40.169> this<00:04:40.290> a<00:04:40.350> deal-breaker

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
is this a deal-breaker

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.550 
is this a deal-breaker
not<00:04:41.400> really<00:04:41.940> it's<00:04:42.270> not<00:04:42.450> hard<00:04:42.780> to<00:04:43.020> switch<00:04:43.260> cards

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
not really it's not hard to switch cards

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.920 
not really it's not hard to switch cards
but<00:04:43.770> what<00:04:43.919> I<00:04:43.950> do<00:04:44.040> like<00:04:44.340> two<00:04:44.580> cards<00:04:44.910> for<00:04:45.150> is<00:04:45.360> to

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
but what I do like two cards for is to

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.290 
but what I do like two cards for is to
have<00:04:46.230> that<00:04:46.410> redundancy<00:04:47.160> to<00:04:47.700> have<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:48.000> same

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
have that redundancy to have the same

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.510 
have that redundancy to have the same
raw<00:04:48.690> file<00:04:48.990> written<00:04:49.200> this<00:04:49.440> card<00:04:49.650> one<00:04:49.919> as<00:04:50.130> is

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
raw file written this card one as is

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.430 
raw file written this card one as is
written<00:04:50.700> to<00:04:50.940> card<00:04:51.150> 2<00:04:51.360> so<00:04:51.810> it<00:04:51.870> would<00:04:51.960> be<00:04:52.050> nice<00:04:52.230> to

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
written to card 2 so it would be nice to

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.510 
written to card 2 so it would be nice to
see<00:04:52.590> that<00:04:52.770> it<00:04:52.860> would<00:04:52.919> have<00:04:53.040> been<00:04:53.130> nice<00:04:53.310> for

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
see that it would have been nice for

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.040 
see that it would have been nice for
them<00:04:53.580> to<00:04:53.639> have<00:04:53.820> put<00:04:54.000> that<00:04:54.120> in<00:04:54.300> but<00:04:54.419> it's<00:04:54.540> not<00:04:54.810> a

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
them to have put that in but it's not a

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.940 
them to have put that in but it's not a
deal-breaker

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
deal-breaker

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
and it has a flash whereas the Canon 6d

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.860 
and it has a flash whereas the Canon 6d
didn't<00:05:02.310> have<00:05:02.460> a<00:05:02.490> flash<00:05:02.820> because<00:05:03.060> of<00:05:03.330> the<00:05:03.419> Wi-Fi

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
didn't have a flash because of the Wi-Fi

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.370 
didn't have a flash because of the Wi-Fi
the<00:05:04.380> 70d<00:05:05.190> now<00:05:05.610> has<00:05:05.910> a<00:05:05.940> flash<00:05:06.330> and<00:05:06.570> Wi-Fi

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
the 70d now has a flash and Wi-Fi

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.520 
the 70d now has a flash and Wi-Fi
built-in<00:05:07.890> all<00:05:08.190> for<00:05:08.460> $11.99<00:05:09.140> that's<00:05:10.140> a<00:05:10.260> great

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
built-in all for $11.99 that's a great

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.700 
built-in all for $11.99 that's a great
price<00:05:10.860> and<00:05:11.270> compared<00:05:12.270> to<00:05:12.419> the<00:05:12.510> d70<00:05:13.050> 100<00:05:13.200> I

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
price and compared to the d70 100 I

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.800 
price and compared to the d70 100 I
would<00:05:13.919> venture<00:05:14.460> to<00:05:14.640> say<00:05:14.760> that<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.270> Canon<00:05:15.690> is

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
would venture to say that the Canon is

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.930 
would venture to say that the Canon is
going<00:05:16.050> to<00:05:16.169> do<00:05:16.290> better<00:05:16.500> on<00:05:16.590> the<00:05:16.890> video<00:05:17.220> side<00:05:17.580> and

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
going to do better on the video side and

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.120 
going to do better on the video side and
then<00:05:18.360> and<00:05:18.870> then<00:05:19.050> they'd<00:05:19.350> probably<00:05:19.560> be<00:05:19.919> pretty

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
then and then they'd probably be pretty

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.940 
then and then they'd probably be pretty
even<00:05:20.669> on<00:05:20.820> the<00:05:21.090> stills<00:05:21.419> end<00:05:21.780> now<00:05:22.380> we<00:05:22.440> don't<00:05:22.740> know

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
even on the stills end now we don't know

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.310 
even on the stills end now we don't know
this<00:05:23.100> until<00:05:23.340> we<00:05:23.460> get<00:05:23.640> a<00:05:23.700> 70<00:05:24.360> d<00:05:24.570> in<00:05:24.780> our<00:05:24.960> hands

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
this until we get a 70 d in our hands

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.659 
this until we get a 70 d in our hands
and<00:05:25.410> I<00:05:25.470> will<00:05:25.620> test<00:05:25.860> it<00:05:25.979> out<00:05:26.130> when<00:05:26.310> I<00:05:26.340> get<00:05:26.430> to

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
and I will test it out when I get to

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.460 
and I will test it out when I get to
allens<00:05:27.090> what<00:05:27.479> I<00:05:27.510> can<00:05:27.660> do<00:05:27.750> an<00:05:27.840> unboxing<00:05:28.229> and

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
allens what I can do an unboxing and

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.530 
allens what I can do an unboxing and
sniff<00:05:28.740> test<00:05:28.919> as<00:05:29.130> soon<00:05:29.430> as<00:05:29.550> it<00:05:29.639> comes<00:05:29.850> in<00:05:30.090> you're

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
sniff test as soon as it comes in you're

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.000 
sniff test as soon as it comes in you're
gonna<00:05:30.660> see<00:05:30.870> a<00:05:30.900> lot<00:05:31.080> of<00:05:31.110> people<00:05:31.290> comparing<00:05:31.890> it

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
gonna see a lot of people comparing it

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.610 
gonna see a lot of people comparing it
to<00:05:32.040> the<00:05:32.220> d70<00:05:32.729> 100<00:05:32.880> there's<00:05:33.570> pros<00:05:33.870> and<00:05:33.900> cons<00:05:34.350> to

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
to the d70 100 there's pros and cons to

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.469 
to the d70 100 there's pros and cons to
both<00:05:34.650> whichever<00:05:35.520> one<00:05:35.820> is<00:05:35.940> going<00:05:36.120> to<00:05:36.180> fit<00:05:36.390> in

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
both whichever one is going to fit in

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:38.180 
both whichever one is going to fit in
your<00:05:36.570> hands<00:05:36.810> best<00:05:37.110> it's<00:05:37.290> probably<00:05:37.860> the<00:05:37.979> best

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
your hands best it's probably the best

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.890 
your hands best it's probably the best
solution<00:05:38.640> for<00:05:38.669> you<00:05:38.970> I'm<00:05:39.270> not<00:05:39.510> going<00:05:39.660> to<00:05:39.720> sit

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
solution for you I'm not going to sit

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.480 
solution for you I'm not going to sit
here<00:05:40.050> and<00:05:40.169> say<00:05:40.290> you<00:05:40.320> have<00:05:40.620> to<00:05:40.770> buy<00:05:40.890> Nikon<00:05:41.340> you

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
here and say you have to buy Nikon you

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.670 
here and say you have to buy Nikon you
have<00:05:41.669> to<00:05:41.790> buy<00:05:41.910> Canon<00:05:42.330> try<00:05:42.840> them<00:05:43.050> out<00:05:43.229> we<00:05:43.560> don't

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
have to buy Canon try them out we don't

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.440 
have to buy Canon try them out we don't
know<00:05:43.890> how<00:05:44.010> the<00:05:44.070> canons<00:05:44.520> going<00:05:44.789> to<00:05:44.880> be<00:05:45.060> in<00:05:45.240> low

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
know how the canons going to be in low

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.330 
know how the canons going to be in low
light<00:05:45.660> situations<00:05:46.350> it's<00:05:46.680> a<00:05:46.830> totally<00:05:47.310> new

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
light situations it's a totally new

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.130 
light situations it's a totally new
sensor<00:05:47.940> and<00:05:48.150> we're<00:05:48.330> gonna<00:05:48.450> see<00:05:48.690> how<00:05:48.720> that

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
sensor and we're gonna see how that

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.960 
sensor and we're gonna see how that
happens<00:05:49.740> I'm<00:05:49.979> a<00:05:50.039> big<00:05:50.280> fan<00:05:50.460> of<00:05:50.490> low<00:05:50.760> light

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
happens I'm a big fan of low light

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.640 
happens I'm a big fan of low light
situations<00:05:51.630> and<00:05:51.810> shooting<00:05:52.110> so<00:05:52.440> we're<00:05:52.530> gonna

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
situations and shooting so we're gonna

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.040 
situations and shooting so we're gonna
see<00:05:52.950> how<00:05:52.979> the<00:05:53.190> camera<00:05:53.640> acts<00:05:53.880> in<00:05:54.270> low<00:05:54.690> light<00:05:54.930> and

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
see how the camera acts in low light and

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.409 
see how the camera acts in low light and
then<00:05:55.860> obviously<00:05:56.070> let<00:05:56.430> you<00:05:56.550> know<00:05:56.760> what<00:05:57.270> we

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
then obviously let you know what we

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.469 
then obviously let you know what we
think<00:05:57.450> so<00:05:57.900> really<00:05:58.680> the<00:05:58.919> 7d<00:05:59.430> d<00:05:59.460> seems<00:06:00.270> like<00:06:00.450> a

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
think so really the 7d d seems like a

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:03.590 
think so really the 7d d seems like a
really<00:06:00.960> really<00:06:01.200> good<00:06:01.380> solution<00:06:02.130> at<00:06:02.600> $1,200

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
really really good solution at $1,200

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.260 
really really good solution at $1,200
you<00:06:04.229> can<00:06:04.380> get<00:06:04.500> a<00:06:04.530> battery<00:06:04.890> grip<00:06:05.250> again<00:06:05.910> I<00:06:05.940> put

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
you can get a battery grip again I put

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.750 
you can get a battery grip again I put
good<00:06:06.510> glass<00:06:06.810> on<00:06:07.110> it<00:06:07.140> I'm<00:06:07.950> very<00:06:08.190> interested<00:06:08.400> to

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760 
good glass on it I'm very interested to

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.430 
good glass on it I'm very interested to
see<00:06:08.910> how<00:06:09.030> it<00:06:09.120> works<00:06:09.330> I'm<00:06:09.479> really<00:06:09.810> liking<00:06:10.140> the

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
see how it works I'm really liking the

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.409 
see how it works I'm really liking the
feel<00:06:10.740> and<00:06:11.010> the<00:06:11.100> function<00:06:11.610> of<00:06:11.729> these<00:06:11.970> canons

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419
