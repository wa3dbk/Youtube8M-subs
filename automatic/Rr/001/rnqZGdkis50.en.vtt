00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello people today there is again 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.379
 new video of me because I show you 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.660
 now eight functions of transparent 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:14.760
 Brother on contactless or baby powder 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.039
 I think none of you would like that 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.320
 look or a single product 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.749
 prevents all these make-up wales 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.409
 Product probably what each of you 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:27.300
 in the closet has a transparent brother 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:29.189
 does mean from an assets.de there is 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.989
 but also one in the standard range of 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:37.770
 essens and also from each other 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:39.329
 Any brand most often comes 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.870
 that brother probably with greasy skin 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.430
 commitment 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.949
 You can get oily skin on the one hand 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.469
 counteract such control pad 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.690
 or you use very simple / 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.649
 paper which also leaves the box 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.989
 your skin is pulling 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.480
 the most common is however the use 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.579
 of powder with a brush on 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.190
 Apply entire face and roller 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.690
 Do you have an even skin texture that 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.159
 Incidentally, the same applies to the same 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.159
 save from make up and concealer 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.580
 We all want a nice one 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.890
 magic eye make-up 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.590
 but I would urge everyone 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.810
 recommend the whole country after the base 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.700
 to powder because otherwise can be the 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.490
 Eyeshadow does not blindly blind 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.350
 and there are hard edges to follow 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:46.660
 However, this tip arises 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:48.490
 great look certain parts of the eye 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.920
 not only visually highlight that 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.320
 a highlight but also our powder 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.050
 not so much worse of course 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.880
 and a bit more subtle but one 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.770
 small highlight we can under the 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.300
 eyebrow arch and inside 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.300
 set eyes angle 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.330
 volume for the eyelashes 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.420
 no problem with eyelashes 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.989
 dust some powder and then 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:34.230
 Press and we have something 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:36.720
 expression stronger eyelash none of us 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.640
 would like panda eyes so should ours 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.599
 alone has to stay where the whole day 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.640
 he belongs too 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.459
 especially for the girls among you 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.590
 watched this should tip something is 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:49.470
 remove the eyelid with a brush 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.599
 brother especially in the eyelid and 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.599
 Part one should last the whole day 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:08.700
 we all know is a little too deep in 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.920
 the color pot looked cheeks 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.380
 surface are can be saved 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.069
 our brother with a fluffy brush 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.069
 Apply over it and blend strongly 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.069
 finished 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:37.340
 Lipstick on teeth Lipstick on 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:39.200
 The cup annoying after your your 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.440
 have applied a normal pen 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.380
 put cosmetic towel on your lips and 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.300
 brush off with a brush 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.490
 if you drink now you will see that 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.200
 considerably less color from your lips 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.730
 going 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.130
 who still is not enough of that 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:59.500
 so can the lips off brother again 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.500
 By the way, the whole thing has a nice effect 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.409
 Last but not least we leave the face 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.450
 away to the hairs 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.799
 if you do not have time his hair 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.539
 many people wash their clothes 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.359
 dry shampoo mainz here is from 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:26.419
 batista but what if that is empty 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:27.340
 sprinkle baby powder on the neck and 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.680
 elapse 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.650
 Attention not to take too much else sees 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.479
 So off if man then still a few 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.610
 finished jobs just has that again 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.560
 fluffy brush and our transparent 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.370
 company and also the affected 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.169
 give 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.270
 Of course, the whole thing is not included 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:47.270
 to compare real dry shampoo 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.750
 but an alternative if it is not 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.750
 it works differently 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.219
 that's it from my own 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.020
 Of course I hope that it is you 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:05:00.449
 liked and maybe the one or 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.159
 other tip and track was helpful 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:04.439
 I have shown you now like mine 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:06.419
 make up always stays that way and not like on 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:07.620
 shown at the beginning if you liked it 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.090
 I would raise myself up a thumb 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.039
 I would be happy and then I would 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:17.639
 we'll see each other next time 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:20.150
 again and no lipstick to the 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.150
 fumble
