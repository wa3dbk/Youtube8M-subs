00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
do a duo telestrator segment about that

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.059 
do a duo telestrator segment about that
game<00:00:05.370> of<00:00:05.549> course<00:00:05.790> and<00:00:06.710> early<00:00:07.710> first<00:00:07.890> blood

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
game of course and early first blood

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.400 
game of course and early first blood
aside<00:00:08.340> I<00:00:08.370> think<00:00:08.580> it<00:00:08.820> was<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.300> bit<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:10.080> slower

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
aside I think it was a bit of a slower

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.350 
aside I think it was a bit of a slower
game<00:00:10.740> for<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.010> first<00:00:11.160> 20<00:00:11.460> minutes<00:00:11.730> or<00:00:11.849> so<00:00:11.880> yeah

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
game for the first 20 minutes or so yeah

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.970 
game for the first 20 minutes or so yeah
and<00:00:12.599> then<00:00:12.719> TSM<00:00:13.139> started<00:00:13.469> playing<00:00:13.679> towards

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
and then TSM started playing towards

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.560 
and then TSM started playing towards
their<00:00:14.099> composition<00:00:14.610> strength<00:00:14.969> realizing

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
their composition strength realizing

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.150

that<00:00:15.660> CLG<00:00:16.080> can't<00:00:16.350> really<00:00:16.560> fight<00:00:16.800> them<00:00:17.010> in

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
that CLG can't really fight them in

to improve with these last eight games
well<00:05:05.620> it's<00:05:05.860> a<00:05:05.919> lot<00:05:06.039> like<00:05:06.220> the<00:05:06.340> problem<00:05:06.610> we<00:05:06.729> had

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
well it's a lot like the problem we had

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.570 
well it's a lot like the problem we had
last<00:05:08.080> year<00:05:08.289> in<00:05:08.470> the<00:05:08.500> summer<00:05:08.710> so<00:05:08.979> where<00:05:09.220> we<00:05:09.310> are

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
last year in the summer so where we are

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.159 
last year in the summer so where we are
doing<00:05:09.729> bio<00:05:09.940> on<00:05:10.210> scrims<00:05:10.539> and<00:05:10.780> we're<00:05:10.900> ending

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
doing bio on scrims and we're ending

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.350 
doing bio on scrims and we're ending
games<00:05:11.409> very<00:05:11.710> fast<00:05:11.979> like<00:05:12.190> 37<00:05:12.970> minutes<00:05:13.180> but<00:05:13.270> then

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
games very fast like 37 minutes but then

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.820 
games very fast like 37 minutes but then
when<00:05:13.449> we<00:05:13.539> get<00:05:13.659> on<00:05:13.750> the<00:05:13.870> stage<00:05:14.050> we<00:05:14.259> take<00:05:14.409> 45

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
when we get on the stage we take 45

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.170 
when we get on the stage we take 45
minutes<00:05:15.009> 50<00:05:15.370> minutes<00:05:15.400> to<00:05:15.699> really<00:05:15.940> end<00:05:16.090> the

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
minutes 50 minutes to really end the

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.459 
minutes 50 minutes to really end the
game<00:05:16.300> and<00:05:16.479> we<00:05:16.539> have<00:05:16.690> the<00:05:16.840> same<00:05:17.020> kind<00:05:17.199> of<00:05:17.349> lead

00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:17.469 
game and we have the same kind of lead

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:19.170 
game and we have the same kind of lead
it's<00:05:17.650> just<00:05:17.800> about<00:05:18.340> how<00:05:18.490> we're<00:05:18.669> pushing<00:05:18.880> it<00:05:19.060> in

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
it's just about how we're pushing it in

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.370 
it's just about how we're pushing it in
scrims<00:05:19.479> the<00:05:19.690> other<00:05:19.840> teams<00:05:20.080> when<00:05:20.259> they're

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
scrims the other teams when they're

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.870 
scrims the other teams when they're
behind<00:05:20.590> they<00:05:20.800> still<00:05:21.099> look<00:05:21.340> for<00:05:21.520> place<00:05:21.729> and

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
behind they still look for place and

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.980 
behind they still look for place and
this<00:05:21.940> little<00:05:22.090> try<00:05:22.270> to<00:05:22.330> do<00:05:22.449> things<00:05:22.630> but<00:05:22.840> on

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
this little try to do things but on

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.140 
this little try to do things but on
stage<00:05:23.199> people<00:05:23.469> play<00:05:23.710> very<00:05:24.460> conservative<00:05:25.000> they

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
stage people play very conservative they

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.939 
stage people play very conservative they
like<00:05:25.360> to<00:05:25.479> hug<00:05:25.659> towers<00:05:26.050> and<00:05:26.199> display<00:05:26.469> very<00:05:26.710> safe

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:26.949 
like to hug towers and display very safe

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:28.770 
like to hug towers and display very safe
and<00:05:27.129> look<00:05:27.699> for<00:05:27.819> that<00:05:27.909> super<00:05:28.210> scaling<00:05:28.539> so<00:05:28.690> we

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
and look for that super scaling so we

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.990 
and look for that super scaling so we
need<00:05:28.900> to<00:05:28.990> be<00:05:29.610> translating<00:05:30.610> like<00:05:30.789> the<00:05:30.880> way

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
need to be translating like the way

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.129 
need to be translating like the way
we're<00:05:31.180> ending<00:05:31.419> games<00:05:31.659> really<00:05:31.930> and<00:05:32.050> I<00:05:32.110> think

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
we're ending games really and I think

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:33.870 
we're ending games really and I think
that's<00:05:32.409> the<00:05:32.500> biggest<00:05:32.650> problem<00:05:32.800> San<00:05:33.520> torn<00:05:33.729> how

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
that's the biggest problem San torn how

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.730 
that's the biggest problem San torn how
would<00:05:34.030> you<00:05:34.180> say<00:05:34.360> you<00:05:34.419> go<00:05:34.960> about<00:05:35.139> fixing<00:05:35.440> that

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
would you say you go about fixing that

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.469 
would you say you go about fixing that
right<00:05:35.979> we<00:05:36.130> we<00:05:36.490> need<00:05:36.610> to<00:05:36.699> be<00:05:36.789> more<00:05:36.909> decisive<00:05:37.180> but

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
right we we need to be more decisive but

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:39.420 
right we we need to be more decisive but
where<00:05:37.599> does<00:05:37.690> that<00:05:37.750> start<00:05:38.259> is<00:05:38.440> that<00:05:38.650> with<00:05:38.889> the

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
where does that start is that with the

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.399 
where does that start is that with the
individual<00:05:40.030> is<00:05:40.270> that<00:05:40.449> with<00:05:40.599> the<00:05:40.690> team<00:05:40.900> mindset

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
individual is that with the team mindset

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:43.860 
individual is that with the team mindset
and<00:05:41.889> so<00:05:42.490> we've<00:05:42.819> decided<00:05:43.210> to<00:05:43.509> pick<00:05:43.630> up<00:05:43.750> more

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
and so we've decided to pick up more

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.480 
and so we've decided to pick up more
aggressive<00:05:44.319> junglers<00:05:44.680> because<00:05:45.009> we<00:05:45.219> want<00:05:45.400> to

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
aggressive junglers because we want to

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.010 
aggressive junglers because we want to
be<00:05:45.580> able<00:05:45.639> to<00:05:45.789> in<00:05:45.880> game<00:05:46.060> so<00:05:46.360> we're<00:05:46.779> going<00:05:46.900> to

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
be able to in game so we're going to

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.809 
be able to in game so we're going to
play<00:05:47.500> more<00:05:47.680> aggressive<00:05:48.219> style<00:05:48.460> where<00:05:48.669> I'm

diving wheeler head so na is like a very
passive<00:06:13.539> region<00:06:13.659> so<00:06:13.960> we've<00:06:14.110> tried<00:06:14.319> to<00:06:14.349> upscale

it where every time we see an
opportunity<00:06:16.630> where<00:06:17.020> we<00:06:17.590> kind<00:06:17.770> of<00:06:17.889> think<00:06:17.979> we

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:18.099 
opportunity where we kind of think we

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:19.740 
opportunity where we kind of think we
can<00:06:18.219> dive<00:06:18.370> maybe<00:06:18.580> it's<00:06:18.699> a<00:06:18.759> 50-50<00:06:19.300> will<00:06:19.449> go<00:06:19.569> for
