very<00:01:26.030> question<00:01:27.490> so<00:01:28.490> one<00:01:28.609> of<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:28.759> things<00:01:28.969> we

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
very question so one of the things we

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.569 
very question so one of the things we
have<00:01:29.240> to<00:01:29.359> do<00:01:29.479> first<00:01:29.719> is<00:01:30.049> is<00:01:30.259> literally<00:01:30.679> put<00:01:31.460> the

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
have to do first is is literally put the

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.969 
have to do first is is literally put the

it's<00:02:01.579> it's<00:02:01.850> connected<00:02:02.389> at<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:02.600> angle<00:02:03.079> that

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
it's it's connected at the angle that

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.410 
it's it's connected at the angle that
most<00:02:03.439> people<00:02:03.710> would<00:02:04.009> speak<00:02:04.219> with<00:02:04.399> and<00:02:04.639> inside

the phone is making a call

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.280 
the phone is making a call
after<00:02:14.030> a<00:02:14.060> period<00:02:14.270> of<00:02:14.390> time<00:02:14.629> this<00:02:14.840> device<00:02:15.140> is

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
after a period of time this device is

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.170 
after a period of time this device is
going<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:15.500> come<00:02:15.650> over<00:02:15.680> here<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.220> start<00:02:17.000> to

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
going to come over here and start to

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.600 
going to come over here and start to
measure<00:02:17.540> radiation<00:02:18.379> at<00:02:19.010> all<00:02:19.190> sorts<00:02:19.550> of

different points in the brain after that

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
different points in the brain after that
they're<00:02:21.800> going<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:21.950> take<00:02:22.099> all<00:02:22.400> of<00:02:22.430> those

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
they're going to take all of those

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.640 
they're going to take all of those
numbers<00:02:23.150> basically<00:02:23.840> put<00:02:24.290> it<00:02:24.379> on<00:02:24.470> a<00:02:24.500> computer

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
numbers basically put it on a computer

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.800 
numbers basically put it on a computer
screen<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.430> tell<00:02:25.940> us<00:02:26.060> where<00:02:26.209> the<00:02:26.269> hot<00:02:26.480> spots

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
screen and tell us where the hot spots

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.949 
screen and tell us where the hot spots
are<00:02:26.989> than<00:02:27.560> just<00:02:27.830> how<00:02:27.980> high<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.310> levels<00:02:28.819> got<00:02:29.060> my

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
are than just how high the levels got my

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.050 
are than just how high the levels got my
cell<00:02:30.260> phone<00:02:30.470> measured<00:02:30.890> within<00:02:31.099> FCC<00:02:31.700> limits

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
cell phone measured within FCC limits

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.690 
cell phone measured within FCC limits
but<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.750> whole<00:02:33.080> process<00:02:33.410> was<00:02:33.980> well

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
but the whole process was well

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.479 
but the whole process was well
surprisingly<00:02:35.420> low-tech<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.470> what<00:02:37.220> about

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
surprisingly low-tech and what about

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.300 
surprisingly low-tech and what about
different<00:02:38.000> sized<00:02:38.180> skulls<00:02:38.599> or<00:02:39.319> children<00:02:40.040> and

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
different sized skulls or children and

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.330 
different sized skulls or children and
children<00:02:41.140> there<00:02:42.140> are<00:02:42.170> skull<00:02:42.650> is<00:02:42.860> thinner

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
children there are skull is thinner

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.039 
children there are skull is thinner
there's<00:02:43.879> scalp<00:02:44.209> is<00:02:44.420> thinner<00:02:44.660> so<00:02:44.900> the

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
there's scalp is thinner so the

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.710 
there's scalp is thinner so the
microwave<00:02:45.739> radiation<00:02:46.310> can<00:02:46.549> penetrate<00:02:46.970> deeper

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
microwave radiation can penetrate deeper

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.229 
microwave radiation can penetrate deeper
into<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:48.019> brain<00:02:48.230> of<00:02:48.580> children<00:02:49.580> and<00:02:50.090> young

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
into the brain of children and young

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.220 
into the brain of children and young
adults<00:02:50.569> and<00:02:51.640> their<00:02:52.640> cells<00:02:53.360> are<00:02:53.630> dividing<00:02:54.110> and

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
adults and their cells are dividing and

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.080 
adults and their cells are dividing and
a<00:02:54.319> much<00:02:54.470> faster<00:02:54.739> rate<00:02:54.980> so<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.400> impact<00:02:55.849> of<00:02:56.000> the

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
a much faster rate so the impact of the

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.020 
a much faster rate so the impact of the
microwave<00:02:56.450> radiation<00:02:56.780> can<00:02:57.290> be<00:02:57.319> much<00:02:57.560> larger

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
microwave radiation can be much larger

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.550 
microwave radiation can be much larger
but<00:02:59.030> there<00:02:59.209> have<00:02:59.299> been<00:02:59.329> no<00:02:59.690> studies<00:02:59.750> on

but there have been no studies on

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.430 
but there have been no studies on
children<00:03:01.459> in<00:03:01.610> cellphone<00:03:02.120> safety<00:03:02.599> and<00:03:03.260> here's

children in cellphone safety and here's
something<00:03:03.650> else<00:03:03.950> that<00:03:04.280> might<00:03:04.489> surprise<00:03:04.700> you
