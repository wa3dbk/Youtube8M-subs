00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:17.080
 the oven if it comes out is the one I'm going to make 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:20.529
 is going to be lined up all around with 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.650
 refractory bricks here I have a 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:26.500
 bunch of them are about 40 and both 50 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.810
 At least then I have them 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.669
 planned to place them in a way 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:37.379
 determined all around 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:41.810
 and get a good show for the 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:43.540
 oven some of those I also have here 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.020
 and those that rotate on the top 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.020
 that are a little 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.850
 let's finish it 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:59.130
 about the difference between a brick and 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:01.460
 another does not weigh two kilos 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.449
 to the middle more or less 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:09.100
 and the other about two kilos then there's 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.100
 a pretty difference 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.410
 i 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.210
 this is in relation to the material then 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.550
 carry 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.940
 materials trace and carry cement 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.090
 sand possibly or the same I do it with 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.480
 anchors because it will be the same 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.660
 a little more convener 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:35.260
 well another thing that I'm going to 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:38.620
 need to make the cover and everything 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.050
 of the oven are sheets 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.840
 these plates in particular are of an air 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:48.890
 conditioning have almost 2 millimeters 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.500
 thick I have a lot of them 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.340
 and then what I'm going to do is 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.380
 reuse what will be the 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.640
 side of the oven 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.390
 well 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:06.390
 I have decided to resume the works of the 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:10.920
 oven if it comes out and here I have some badges 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.020
 of organized rock recycling 2 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.500
 meters for 1 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.210
 and now what I'm going to do is 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.700
 to take advantage of bending them and putting them 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.910
 to be able to start covering anything 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.390
 normal 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.060
 hooked on the world 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.140
 painting where these security 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.850
 to be able to transport them 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.790
 good 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:43.360
 Well, we are already 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:46.420
 diverted and now I hope that 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.370
 serve to line 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.599
 what is the oven 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:57.590
 here I have a series of irons that will go 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:03:01.000
 on the bottom and then my idea 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.000
 is to put some wheels here 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.480
 and another one we would say in the other part of 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.840
 way that 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.920
 the oven has been transportable so 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.920
 can carry from one place to another 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:22.120
 I'm going to need many kinds of 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:25.510
 of iron then between them by 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.600
 example these we could use them 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:33.300
 for the legs we'll see if we use 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.300
 this or this one that was going on 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:44.070
 whether it is good or whether the other is 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:48.150
 enough to increase the weight of the 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:52.890
 oven once finished everything depends and 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:55.910
 on the fly we'll see how 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.910
 let's put these are the squads 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.010
 with which I'm going to 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.910
 to put on the sides that go to 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.570
 endure what the whole structure is 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:10.480
 all the all the bricks we're going to is 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.610
 a little idea that I already have about 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.900
 the march we will see 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:19.650
 I will give more iron more class to weld a 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.650
 lots of things 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:26.900
 this is the recycling of the irons that 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.520
 they're going to go down the sides and they're going 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.230
 uniting what is the interior supporting 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.460
 the bricks 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.460
 you do not see the whole structure 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:43.510
 as they will not be of almost 180 others 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:48.270
 79 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.270
 and these other little ones of 59 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.460
 well we continue to use pieces of 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:05.360
 recycling in this case we are going to make 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.360
 a sheet cut a piece of the 79 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:14.130
 by 59 that will be the basis of where they are going 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.130
 to go the oven 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:21.590
 ok this is the video although I've 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:23.780
 purchased is stainless steel and is the 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.210
 that we will put for the oven not what 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.650
 I'll have to play because it's pretty 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.479
 big 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.210
 I've been lucky to find him but 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:33.740
 come on, it has cost me too I'm not 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.360
 I 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.360
 and then what I have to do 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:44.699
 put it inside the cavity of all 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:48.000
 the bricks and once you're already 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:49.760
 I think got going operation 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.570
 To be 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:55.850
 superior because it is stainless steel 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.860
 It has almost one millimeter of a centimeter 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.460
 thick 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.460
 for me 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.849
 but eight yes 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.439
 like what 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:08.200
 the material I think it's going to be 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:10.870
 perfect 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.350
 and then we'll have to do more things for him 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.350
 inside but 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:17.910
 that I was lucky to find this 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:21.830
 video friend 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.830
 I hope I can make a piece of oven 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:27.720
 I have wheels here that are special 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.740
 and who have 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:34.510
 and they endure enough then 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:37.470
 disarm them here all 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:41.550
 in the system 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:45.530
 that has a spinner then it's left 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.530
 simply in what is the wheel
