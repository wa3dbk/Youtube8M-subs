00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
score points so this sounds like a good

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.830

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
basically his team deathmatch with a

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.940 
basically his team deathmatch with a
twist<00:02:50.030> players<00:02:50.450> will<00:02:50.690> now<00:02:50.870> drop<00:02:51.170> that<00:02:51.230> dog

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
twist players will now drop that dog

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.300 
twist players will now drop that dog
tags<00:02:52.310> upon<00:02:52.730> death<00:02:53.090> in<00:02:53.720> order<00:02:54.110> to<00:02:54.380> score<00:02:54.739> it<00:02:54.890> you

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
tags upon death in order to score it you

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.030 
tags upon death in order to score it you
will<00:02:55.459> have<00:02:55.610> to<00:02:55.820> kill<00:02:56.420> your<00:02:56.750> enemy<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.320> pick<00:02:57.860> up

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
will have to kill your enemy and pick up

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.650 
will have to kill your enemy and pick up
their<00:02:58.190> dog<00:02:58.370> tag<00:02:58.700> before<00:02:58.910> their<00:02:59.209> team<00:02:59.480> make

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
their dog tag before their team make

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.900 
their dog tag before their team make
picks<00:02:59.930> up<00:03:00.110> their<00:03:00.260> dog<00:03:00.410> tag<00:03:00.709> if<00:03:00.950> you<00:03:01.430> kill<00:03:01.670> the

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
picks up their dog tag if you kill the

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.570 
picks up their dog tag if you kill the
enemy<00:03:02.300> and<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.810> teammate<00:03:03.290> recovers<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.280> dog

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
enemy and the teammate recovers the dog

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.280 
enemy and the teammate recovers the dog
tag<00:03:04.880> you<00:03:05.090> don't<00:03:05.300> get<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.570> points<00:03:05.959> nor<00:03:06.140> the

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
tag you don't get the points nor the

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.890 
tag you don't get the points nor the
keel<00:03:06.530> so<00:03:07.310> basically<00:03:07.970> I<00:03:08.120> guess<00:03:08.420> they're<00:03:08.600> trying

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
keel so basically I guess they're trying

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.020 
keel so basically I guess they're trying
to<00:03:08.959> stop<00:03:09.260> campers<00:03:09.800> and<00:03:09.980> keep<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.610> keep<00:03:11.000> the

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
to stop campers and keep the keep the

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.420 
to stop campers and keep the keep the
mount<00:03:11.390> moving<00:03:11.840> keep<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.230> flow<00:03:12.470> coming<00:03:12.770> you

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
mount moving keep the flow coming you

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.460 
mount moving keep the flow coming you
know<00:03:13.610> that's<00:03:13.910> that's<00:03:14.209> good<00:03:14.570> on<00:03:14.720> that<00:03:14.870> end<00:03:15.110> so<00:03:15.440> I

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
know that's that's good on that end so I

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.590 
know that's that's good on that end so I
guess<00:03:15.650> modern<00:03:16.190> warfare<00:03:16.340> 2<00:03:16.730> will<00:03:16.940> not<00:03:17.150> be<00:03:17.330> bad

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
guess modern warfare 2 will not be bad

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.380 
guess modern warfare 2 will not be bad
this<00:03:17.840> year<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.590> they're<00:03:18.890> bringing<00:03:19.100> back

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.039 
bullet and modern warfare 3 gameplay'
basically<00:03:37.790> looks<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.269> same<00:03:38.510> as<00:03:38.780> modern

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
basically looks the same as modern

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.280 
basically looks the same as modern
warfare<00:03:39.230> 2<00:03:39.650> but<00:03:40.549> I<00:03:40.880> actually<00:03:41.660> don't<00:03:42.049> have

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
warfare 2 but I actually don't have

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.080 
warfare 2 but I actually don't have
nothing<00:03:42.680> wrong<00:03:42.829> with<00:03:43.070> it<00:03:43.220> because<00:03:43.400> running<00:03:43.880> it

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
nothing wrong with it because running it

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.720 
nothing wrong with it because running it
off<00:03:44.209> the<00:03:44.390> same<00:03:44.630> engine<00:03:45.220> modern<00:03:46.220> warfare<00:03:46.370> 2

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
off the same engine modern warfare 2

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.940 
off the same engine modern warfare 2
