you're stretching out the Strand which

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.009 
you're stretching out the Strand which
makes<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.640> weaker<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.359> also<00:01:03.539> makes<00:01:03.899> your

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
all the way at the ends is old hair so

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.730 
all the way at the ends is old hair so
suppose<00:01:12.570> if<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.900> are<00:01:13.049> using<00:01:13.409> something<00:01:13.590> like
