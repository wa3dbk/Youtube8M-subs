you<00:03:30.470> like<00:03:30.710> okay<00:03:35.230> that's<00:03:36.230> pretty<00:03:36.440> much<00:03:36.650> covered

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
you like okay that's pretty much covered

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
my whole face and as you can see if it

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.850 
my whole face and as you can see if it
does<00:03:40.370> get<00:03:40.520> a<00:03:40.580> little<00:03:40.670> bit<00:03:40.880> dirty<00:03:41.380> it<00:03:42.380> also<00:03:42.560> has

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
does get a little bit dirty it also has

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.270 
does get a little bit dirty it also has
this<00:03:43.040> tapered<00:03:43.610> end<00:03:43.790> right<00:03:44.060> here<00:03:45.070> it's<00:03:46.070> kind<00:03:46.190> of

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
this tapered end right here it's kind of

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.300 
this tapered end right here it's kind of
contoured<00:03:46.790> Iran<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.090> middle<00:03:48.070> so<00:03:49.070> it<00:03:49.100> is<00:03:49.280> a

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
contoured Iran the middle so it is a

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.060 
contoured Iran the middle so it is a
little<00:03:49.430> bit<00:03:49.670> easier<00:03:49.850> to<00:03:50.060> grasp<00:03:50.450> then<00:03:51.410> some

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
little bit easier to grasp then some

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.440 
little bit easier to grasp then some
people<00:03:52.190> have<00:03:52.460> said<00:03:52.610> about<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:52.940> other<00:03:53.090> sponge

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
people have said about the other sponge

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.050 
people have said about the other sponge
but<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.290> little<00:03:54.410> pointed<00:03:54.800> end<00:03:55.010> you<00:03:55.550> can<00:03:55.700> get

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
but the little pointed end you can get

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.090 
but the little pointed end you can get
right<00:03:56.300> in<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.510> creases<00:03:56.780> of<00:03:56.930> your<00:03:57.170> nose<00:03:57.380> you
