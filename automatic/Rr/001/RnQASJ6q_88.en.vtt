from those things we should learn from

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.309 
from those things we should learn from
Sandling<00:02:21.519> we<00:02:21.670> should<00:02:21.849> learn<00:02:21.970> from<00:02:22.239> press<00:02:23.019> work

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
Sandling we should learn from press work
