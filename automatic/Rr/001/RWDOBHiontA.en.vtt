lessons 365.com today we're going to
take<00:00:29.590> a<00:00:29.620> look<00:00:29.890> at<00:00:30.130> symmetrical<00:00:30.940> scale<00:00:31.360> licks

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:31.780 
take a look at symmetrical scale licks

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.229 
take a look at symmetrical scale licks
now<00:00:32.290> this<00:00:32.470> kind<00:00:32.620> of<00:00:32.710> technique<00:00:33.100> is<00:00:33.309> used<00:00:33.820> to

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
now this kind of technique is used to

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.450 
now this kind of technique is used to
create<00:00:34.420> kind<00:00:35.170> of<00:00:35.320> an<00:00:35.410> outside<00:00:35.890> of<00:00:36.070> the<00:00:36.190> scale

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
create kind of an outside of the scale

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.740 
create kind of an outside of the scale
outside<00:00:37.420> of<00:00:37.540> the<00:00:37.660> key<00:00:37.870> sound<00:00:38.460> by<00:00:39.750> various

even people like Dave Mustaine you'll
you'll<00:00:47.260> hear<00:00:47.500> this<00:00:47.739> kind<00:00:47.980> of<00:00:48.010> technique<00:00:48.400> done

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
you'll hear this kind of technique done

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.080 
you'll hear this kind of technique done
now<00:00:49.390> what<00:00:49.840> it<00:00:49.960> really<00:00:50.170> is<00:00:50.470> is<00:00:51.100> just<00:00:51.160> the<00:00:51.610> exact

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
now what it really is is just the exact

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.300 
now what it really is is just the exact
same<00:00:52.390> scale<00:00:52.720> fingering<00:00:53.230> taken<00:00:53.830> across<00:00:54.130> the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.310 
same scale fingering taken across the

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.150 
same scale fingering taken across the
strings<00:00:54.640> now<00:00:55.240> obviously<00:00:55.690> there<00:00:56.380> is<00:00:56.590> no<00:00:56.620> really

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
strings now obviously there is no really

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.280 
strings now obviously there is no really
scale<00:00:57.430> that<00:00:57.610> works<00:00:57.880> like<00:00:58.150> that<00:00:58.210> correctly<00:00:58.930> and

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
scale that works like that correctly and

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.990 
scale that works like that correctly and
will<00:00:59.710> stay<00:00:59.920> within<00:01:00.130> the<00:01:00.220> scale<00:01:00.430> so<00:01:00.670> if<00:01:00.730> we<00:01:00.820> just

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
will stay within the scale so if we just

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.969 
will stay within the scale so if we just
said<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:02.320> wanted<00:01:02.739> just<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:05.229> first<00:01:05.530> second

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
said we wanted just the first second

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.710 
said we wanted just the first second
finger<00:01:06.250> at<00:01:06.430> the<00:01:06.580> first<00:01:06.790> second<00:01:07.119> fourth<00:01:07.360> finger

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
finger at the first second fourth finger

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.760 
finger at the first second fourth finger
here<00:01:07.900> just<00:01:08.170> that<00:01:08.320> little<00:01:08.560> scale<00:01:08.770> shape<00:01:09.690> and<00:01:10.770> we

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
here just that little scale shape and we

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.890 
here just that little scale shape and we
just<00:01:12.009> try<00:01:12.160> to<00:01:12.220> take<00:01:12.399> that<00:01:12.610> across<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:13.149> strings

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
just try to take that across the strings

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.250 
just try to take that across the strings

none<00:01:19.220> of<00:01:19.250> those<00:01:19.430> notes<00:01:19.640> are<00:01:19.820> going<00:01:19.940> to<00:01:20.000> stay

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
none of those notes are going to stay

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.990 
none of those notes are going to stay
within<00:01:20.420> a<00:01:20.780> key<00:01:21.080> really<00:01:23.830> but<00:01:24.830> what<00:01:25.580> you<00:01:25.670> do<00:01:25.820> is

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
within a key really but what you do is

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.410 
within a key really but what you do is
if<00:01:26.120> you<00:01:26.240> wrap<00:01:26.480> that<00:01:26.510> around<00:01:26.780> a<00:01:27.440> melody<00:01:28.430> so<00:01:29.060> a

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
if you wrap that around a melody so a

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.180 
if you wrap that around a melody so a
lot<00:01:29.660> of<00:01:29.780> these<00:01:29.870> when<00:01:30.530> you'll<00:01:30.920> see<00:01:31.040> them

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
lot of these when you'll see them

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.680 
lot of these when you'll see them
they'll<00:01:31.400> be<00:01:31.520> playing<00:01:31.760> like<00:01:31.910> a<00:01:31.940> melodic<00:01:32.480> lick

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
they'll be playing like a melodic lick

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.330 
they'll be playing like a melodic lick
right<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:33.230> they'll<00:01:33.380> be<00:01:33.500> just<00:01:33.650> doing<00:01:34.160> some

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
right and they'll be just doing some

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.150 
right and they'll be just doing some
simple<00:01:34.670> Solon<00:01:35.000> and<00:01:37.660> then<00:01:38.660> they'll<00:01:38.900> jump<00:01:39.620> into

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
simple Solon and then they'll jump into

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.570 
simple Solon and then they'll jump into
a<00:01:40.900> lick<00:01:41.900> that<00:01:42.080> is<00:01:42.350> symmetrical<00:01:43.220> across<00:01:43.340> the

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
a lick that is symmetrical across the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.910 
a lick that is symmetrical across the
string<00:01:43.910> so<00:01:44.060> it's<00:01:44.180> very<00:01:44.570> easy<00:01:44.840> to<00:01:45.050> play<00:01:45.260> and<00:01:45.740> get

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
string so it's very easy to play and get

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.990 
string so it's very easy to play and get
your<00:01:46.040> hand<00:01:46.190> across<00:01:46.340> you<00:01:46.550> basically<00:01:46.880> can<00:01:46.970> take

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
your hand across you basically can take

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.850 
your hand across you basically can take
one<00:01:48.490> pattern<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:49.880> just<00:01:53.380> but<00:01:54.380> it<00:01:54.500> works

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
one pattern and just but it works

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.240 
one pattern and just but it works
musically<00:01:55.670> because<00:01:55.970> it<00:01:56.510> is<00:01:57.040> surrounded<00:01:58.040> it's

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
musically because it is surrounded it's

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.400 
musically because it is surrounded it's
really<00:01:58.760> how<00:01:58.910> you<00:01:58.970> begin<00:01:59.390> and<00:01:59.600> how<00:01:59.780> you<00:01:59.840> end<00:02:00.140> you

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
really how you begin and how you end you

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.950 
really how you begin and how you end you
go<00:02:00.740> into<00:02:01.040> it<00:02:01.190> out<00:02:01.370> of<00:02:01.550> a<00:02:01.610> melody<00:02:01.940> or<00:02:02.180> some<00:02:02.780> kind

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
go into it out of a melody or some kind

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.270 
go into it out of a melody or some kind
of<00:02:02.990> a<00:02:03.140> lot<00:02:03.290> of<00:02:03.320> content<00:02:03.740> something<00:02:03.980> that<00:02:04.190> is

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
of a lot of content something that is

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.770 
of a lot of content something that is
within<00:02:04.550> a<00:02:04.730> key<00:02:04.970> and<00:02:05.210> then<00:02:05.780> you<00:02:06.080> throw<00:02:06.470> in<00:02:06.770> that

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
within a key and then you throw in that

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.350 
within a key and then you throw in that
crazy<00:02:09.130> symmetrical<00:02:10.130> scale<00:02:10.369> line<00:02:10.700> it<00:02:11.180> doesn't

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
crazy symmetrical scale line it doesn't

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.120 
crazy symmetrical scale line it doesn't
have<00:02:11.570> to<00:02:11.630> be<00:02:11.720> faceted<00:02:12.140> obviously<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.040> effect

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
have to be faceted obviously the effect

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.800 
have to be faceted obviously the effect
is<00:02:13.490> usually<00:02:13.790> better<00:02:14.000> when<00:02:14.210> it's<00:02:14.360> fast<00:02:14.570> because

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
is usually better when it's fast because

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.660 
is usually better when it's fast because
it's<00:02:14.960> just<00:02:15.050> like<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.230> blur<00:02:15.500> of<00:02:15.530> notes<00:02:15.890> but<00:02:16.550> it

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
it's just like a blur of notes but it

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
it's just like a blur of notes but it
gives<00:02:16.880> you<00:02:17.000> that<00:02:17.120> impression<00:02:17.360> of<00:02:19.450> just<00:02:20.450> kind

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
gives you that impression of just kind

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.199 
gives you that impression of just kind
of<00:02:20.750> unpredictability<00:02:21.970> coming<00:02:22.970> through<00:02:23.090> out

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
of unpredictability coming through out

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.400 
of unpredictability coming through out
of<00:02:23.330> your<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:23.660> you're<00:02:23.900> in<00:02:23.990> the<00:02:24.050> middle<00:02:24.260> of<00:02:24.290> your

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
solo stuff like this you'll see any van

solo stuff like this you'll see any van
Halen<00:02:27.440> especially<00:02:27.800> it's<00:02:27.890> like<00:02:27.950> he'll<00:02:28.130> take<00:02:28.310> a

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
something like this so get a one on one

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.350 
something like this so get a one on one
string<00:02:36.890> he'll<00:02:37.459> just<00:02:37.640> have<00:02:37.790> like<00:02:37.970> here's<00:02:38.180> the

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
string he'll just have like here's the

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.600 
string he'll just have like here's the
sixth<00:02:38.660> fret<00:02:38.870> 10th<00:02:39.320> fret<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.890> then<00:02:40.130> tapping<00:02:40.370> at

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
sixth fret 10th fret and then tapping at

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.220 
sixth fret 10th fret and then tapping at
the<00:02:40.730> 13th<00:02:41.209> so<00:02:41.390> we<00:02:41.510> just<00:02:41.660> got<00:02:41.810> something<00:02:42.110> like

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
the 13th so we just got something like

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.950

probably the most important thing but in

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:21.449 
probably the most important thing but in
between<00:03:19.959> it<00:03:20.349> just<00:03:20.530> creates<00:03:20.859> this<00:03:20.980> impression

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
of where it's going it's just like

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.619

musically<00:03:29.439> the<00:03:29.980> those<00:03:30.879> outside<00:03:31.329> notes
