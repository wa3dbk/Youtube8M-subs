00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.130
 these are the antique san plates 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.710
 Francisco 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.200
 production is 50 percent of 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.710
 humidity 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:18.330
 this exceeds widely has a finish 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.330
 and termination at the time 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.400
 to the cuts with the 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.480
 stove 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.280
 we are doing the completions 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.670
 the top part is missing I'm going to 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.670
 finish 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.399
 we have located how you can see everything 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.180
 the environment because the napa was very 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.710
 very severe strong 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.820
 so we had to do it until the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.790
 the ceiling 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.140
 this strip as I tell you absorb up 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.140
 50 percent humidity 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.579
 It has higher absorption than plaque 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.539
 around what 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.539
 and here we are 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.590
 ending this stage here as you can 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.689
 watch 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.050
 see the wall is degraded the street closed 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.480
 window 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.830
 communicated with the dynamism thing that you 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.830
 of the termination 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:28.329
 of severe humidity 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.290
 has shelled the whole wall is super 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:35.420
 here we are covering everything that is 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.200
 the part of the kitchen we are moving forward 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.200
 can not see 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.670
 we are with the cuts doing the part 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.880
 of the frame 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.110
 can see the degree of humidity there 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.710
 on the wall 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:00.270
 product of the second floor of the bathroom 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.270
 everything was degraded 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.160
 blank sheets 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.140
 you can see this already comes with termination 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.590
 no need to paint is green 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.990
 thermoacoustic is anti-humidity 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.120
 good as you can see 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.540
 it's a job 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.519
 with a nice ending 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.519
 well this work is over 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.569
 as you can see 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:52.170
 the kitchen that had been put on the plate 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.170
 a plate of hard and so it was closed 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.660
 and the cuts 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:04.640
 what of a fairy tale 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.640
 the window that gives the garden 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.750
 how many will be the cuts 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.480
 good is a nice job
