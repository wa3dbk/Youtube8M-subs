00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.300
 ah 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.710
 plus 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.940
 i 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.940
 ah 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.060
 hi people i 'm kylie clipper too 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.130
 known as the first to arrive at 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.689
 Sun and this to show you a 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.950
 pretty interesting pretty trick 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.869
 pimp vale 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.570
 I'm on my climap map that releases the 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.480
 last week if I'm not wrong it's worth it and 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.310
 Well you will have what you have to 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.960
 download in the description if not what 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.760
 you know, we're in front of the pimp 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.590
 true and they are pretty good laughs 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.969
 and the trick that I wrote sir now 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:43.550
 guys is this item frames that rotate and 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.920
 they turn and they do not stop spinning we turn around 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.089
 then nothing happens and if the 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.859
 mountain right does not pass 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.329
 absolutely nothing and you will say what the hell 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.969
 is this killer that you are telling me 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.070
 well it's not a filter use commands and 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.339
 It also uses pistons and the mechanism 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.790
 is behind these letters is worth this what 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.640
 I removed because it causes much 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.140
 online on servers and these same 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.390
 guys now I will explain more 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.700
 in detail how this works 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.610
 that I'm going to my test map and I'll 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.360
 I explain better, come on, well, well, 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.460
 I'm on my test map and as you can see 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.800
 It's cool a lot this is pretty cool 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.540
 and the truth is that it is not simple at all 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.130
 mechanism is taken quite a few hours in 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.500
 guess how the sites worked 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.479
 frames in commands and the truth then 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.610
 It has its grace and it has its pretty 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.560
 quite funny yes quite grace before 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.420
 I'm not going to stop this here, which is 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.700
 what does all this do 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.380
 have been fired air in principle 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.259
 let's see it with this command there 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.659
 here it is valid and now I explain to you how 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.960
 it worked I think there's a frame ballet item 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.970
 and the problem is that this frame item 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.820
 has two coordinates is strange hyper 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.350
 has two coordinates is worth the first 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.759
 when we are going to start with the second 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.039
 for the second coordinate state here 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.080
 where you put here you see the item worth that is 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.360
 the item that the entroido appears in frame 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.310
 and here you have to put these little things 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.570
 I already know that for many it is a little 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.070
 knows but good is for you to copy and 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.769
 hit jce vale this command is in the 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.930
 description enter in a web page what 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.180
 copies and lope guys in your blog 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.670
 notes are valid or if you do not copy it in your 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.560
 world or as you want but if it is in case 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.569
 you want to do it someday, it's worth it 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.030
 like to explain how it works 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.549
 all this good because this was for 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:30.290
 here those coordinates of time x and such the 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:32.150
 minus 54 46 and minus 135 is the 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.080
 coordinates where the item will be 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.319
 frame where will it be 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.690
 this is worth as you see is invulnerable to 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.250
 hit there and nothing happens, it's okay 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.720
 I'm going to show you why 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.120
 they serve the first cuts 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.670
 as we saw these coordinates here where 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.320
 puts tail is worth these coordinates there 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.150
 here are the coordinates where we want 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.750
 that the image of the frame item appears is 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.480
 say are these coordinates the of this 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.040
 wall is worth here I put myself here has 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.350
 the coordinates and I've put them there their 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.600
 little bit of a pain but good to be here is 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.820
 something strange weird and that I do not 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.400
 I knew and I made a mess that flips jce 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.850
 these coordinates of the beginning are 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.040
 here is to say let's explain it well what 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.800
 what he does is at the beginning of all that 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.620
 coordinates here create a frame item 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.020
 here but actually the image of the item 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.790
 frame what is what is seen 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.680
 appears in the second coordinates that 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.820
 are those from there are we going to 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.560
 check this way if now 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.180
 elite think ill there and now you 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.850
 I give the piston as you can see, it's going to 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.860
 destroy the frame item fix you see what 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.709
 destroys and the European one is worth because 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.560
 is placed ghostly here is 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.930
 a rather strange thing look 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.330
 and it destroys it is very cool 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.860
 something quite strange that I did not know 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.260
 that he did in front or this property 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.810
 but well nothing happens then what 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.260
 I have made here so that the item is rotated 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.510
 frame vale is something that is opposite 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.700
 that is generated there is that it is difficult 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.570
 from of tender it is already I know it but good 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.760
 I explain why I have to 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.430
 explain it is worth this frame item that 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.980
 generated here the image will be there 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.739
 ok and where the item really is 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:13.489
 ghost frame is here inside so 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:16.040
 so much this creates it the piston destroys it 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.680
 and create another one here that creates it in that 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.019
 capsule and the piston destroys this of 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.669
 here he creates another one in there and then the 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.310
 piston destroys it and so on 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:28.910
 therefore each of these has a 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.410
 different direction is to say let's see 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.610
 so that it makes sense a little better 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.490
 I think that it is being understood but good 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:38.240
 the first of all has the sword the 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:42.220
 has thus the second has the sword like this 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:46.480
 the third has the sword so it's worth 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.490
 well and the fourth one has the sword as well 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.470
 and then it is repeated successively 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.570
 I guess you understand, in fact we're going 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.430
 to see an example if I remove the lava vale 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.390
 here if I remove installed is the pose 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.160
 so that I do not know how to be in the 7 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.010
 monthly then and now what 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.430
 active you are going to see there are a lot of items 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.710
 you see there are a lot of frames that 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.240
 they break the pallet and that will be 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.500
 running around the good is 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.920
 that of course requires that a 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.420
 mogollón de mogollón de de de items and me 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.010
 I do not want that I do not want any entity 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.630
 because otherwise this will become very much 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.570
 then let's stop this we will 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.710
 put lava because that's how it washes 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.840
 delete all the items that are here 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.190
 then place the lava here and 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.450
 it's that simple 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.950
 I think it's understood pretty well 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.870
 I do not think there's any doubt the subject is 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.090
 which is difficult to understand is worth if 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.520
 Interested are these things as man 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.669
 it's not bad at all I really have 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.130
 curiosity about this and well I have 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:41.190
 thought and the truth is that quite by 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.810
 example exists opposite there is here 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.000
 and if it's still created because 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:48.210
 probably that's the first one if I do not 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.030
 I'm wrong then if I give it here a little 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.010
 from chicha to the piston you probably see 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.190
 disappears because it is generated 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:58.740
 there in is actually generated there 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.750
 but the image is projected here is 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.600
 complicated here at home yes but no 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.490
 fashion much much much much much 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.290
 a lot and good you know that to me 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.810
 like to explain you this kind of thing 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:12.720
 strangely and sincerely he is not 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:15.240
 nothing wrong then I will explain 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.590
 also how I have done this is worth what 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.270
 I have done is first I got into the 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:23.490
 capsule one I have taken the coordinates 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:27.840
 here for example minus 154 47 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:30.720
 and minus 175 I copied them controls and 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.870
 control ce and now I come so that the 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.230
 attachment to the beginning is worth the game here 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:38.440
 A) Yes 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:40.090
 and there I have it and then I go to the 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.220
 coordinates where you want the item frame and 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.620
 I put them here, it's a little bit 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.410
 collazo because he has to put the x 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.840
 separated him and separately here and the 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:53.110
 zeta separately but good does not happen 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.130
 absolutely nothing and nothing guys that's 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.290
 all the tutorial I hope that I have 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.810
 liked to me the truth gives me enough 

00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:01.450
 advertising this mile and well then 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:04.210
 I have enough to do it so give it 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:06.250
 like if you liked it and see you in 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.930
 the 7000 and whatever it is worth not 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:11.480
 forget and what has a greeting that you 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:15.700
 grow and peace 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.700
 like because nothing
