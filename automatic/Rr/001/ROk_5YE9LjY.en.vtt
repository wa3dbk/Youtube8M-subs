it's polished and built just another

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.130 
it's polished and built just another
example<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:35.030> another<00:00:36.030> part<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.720> we<00:00:36.840> built

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
example of another part that we built

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.110 
example of another part that we built
here<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.440> house<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.399> control<00:00:38.910> the

put this in a box now put the canvas in

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.889 
put this in a box now put the canvas in
a<00:01:24.530> box<00:01:24.770> ship<00:01:25.670> this<00:01:25.909> thing<00:01:25.970> where<00:01:26.420> is<00:01:26.540> it<00:01:26.690> all

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
around it with two connectors on each

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.450 
around it with two connectors on each
side<00:01:44.330> and<00:01:45.080> so<00:01:45.259> all<00:01:45.289> you<00:01:45.530> do<00:01:45.710> every<00:01:45.920> time<00:01:46.220> you
