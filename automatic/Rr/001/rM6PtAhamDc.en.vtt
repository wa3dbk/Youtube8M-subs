doing a front camera test with my new LG
flex<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.780> this<00:00:10.650> is<00:00:10.830> in<00:00:10.980> 1080p<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.820> this<00:00:12.090> is

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
flex to this is in 1080p and this is

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.390 
flex to this is in 1080p and this is
actually<00:00:12.750> pretty<00:00:13.200> much<00:00:13.290> identical<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:14.309> the

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
actually pretty much identical to the

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.000 
actually pretty much identical to the
camera<00:00:14.670> on<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.910> LG<00:00:15.210> g3<00:00:15.480> but<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.650> never<00:00:16.830> know

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
camera on the LG g3 but you never know

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.260 
camera on the LG g3 but you never know
there<00:00:17.220> could<00:00:17.310> be<00:00:17.400> differences<00:00:18.000> in<00:00:18.180> the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
there could be differences in the

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.760 
there could be differences in the
microphone<00:00:18.720> I'm<00:00:19.050> so<00:00:19.289> check<00:00:19.500> out<00:00:19.619> the

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
microphone I'm so check out the

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.060 
microphone I'm so check out the
microphone<00:00:20.310> also<00:00:20.970> how<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:22.320> resolution<00:00:22.890> looks

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
microphone also how the resolution looks

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.640 
microphone also how the resolution looks
with<00:00:23.670> 1080p<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.359> got<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> little<00:00:24.900> bit<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.109> indoor

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
with 1080p I got a little bit of indoor

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.339 
with 1080p I got a little bit of indoor
lighting<00:00:25.920> here<00:00:26.279> um<00:00:26.779> looks<00:00:27.779> pretty<00:00:27.990> good<00:00:28.289> I

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
lighting here um looks pretty good I

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.140 
lighting here um looks pretty good I
think<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.740> should<00:00:28.920> be<00:00:28.949> out<00:00:29.010> nearly<00:00:29.369> identical

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
think it should be out nearly identical

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.030 
think it should be out nearly identical
with<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.630> LG<00:00:30.900> g3<00:00:31.080> one<00:00:31.710> thing<00:00:31.830> that's

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
with the LG g3 one thing that's

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.610 
with the LG g3 one thing that's
disappointing<00:00:32.730> with<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.570> LG<00:00:33.750> G<00:00:33.809> flex<00:00:33.840> 2<00:00:34.200> is

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
disappointing with the LG G flex 2 is

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.979 
disappointing with the LG G flex 2 is
that<00:00:34.920> they<00:00:35.160> didn't<00:00:35.730> put<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.000> 1440p<00:00:36.600> screen

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
that they didn't put the 1440p screen

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.650 
that they didn't put the 1440p screen
they<00:00:37.649> put<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.920> 1080p<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.579> also<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.270> camera

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
they put the 1080p and also the camera

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.170 
they put the 1080p and also the camera
is<00:00:39.899> just<00:00:40.379> as<00:00:40.500> good<00:00:40.710> as<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.040> think<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.430> g3<00:00:41.879> but

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
is just as good as I think the g3 but

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.000 
is just as good as I think the g3 but
it's<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.690> same<00:00:42.899> camera<00:00:43.320> they<00:00:43.469> didn't<00:00:43.710> improve

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
it's the same camera they didn't improve

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.950 
it's the same camera they didn't improve
upon<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.789> don't<00:00:45.300> know<00:00:45.360> why<00:00:45.510> they<00:00:45.719> did<00:00:45.930> that

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
upon it I don't know why they did that

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.319 
upon it I don't know why they did that
maybe<00:00:46.469> they<00:00:46.770> ran<00:00:47.219> out<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.430> time<00:00:47.670> for<00:00:47.910> something

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
maybe they ran out of time for something

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.110 
maybe they ran out of time for something
but<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.780> did<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.289> wish<00:00:49.800> they<00:00:50.010> upped<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.579> like

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
but I did I wish they upped it to like

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.810 
but I did I wish they upped it to like
16<00:00:51.600> megapixel<00:00:52.140> maybe<00:00:52.320> 20<00:00:52.739> megapixel<00:00:53.309> that

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
16 megapixel maybe 20 megapixel that

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.819 
16 megapixel maybe 20 megapixel that
would<00:00:53.969> have<00:00:54.059> made<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.750> lot<00:00:55.230> more<00:00:55.289> cooler

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
would have made it a lot more cooler

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.880 
would have made it a lot more cooler

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.300 
it's pretty decent but you know I was
really<00:01:18.450> excited<00:01:18.689> with<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.110> Snapdragon<00:01:19.740> upon

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
really excited with the Snapdragon upon

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.210 
really excited with the Snapdragon upon
doing<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.700> 22<00:01:21.210> it's<00:01:21.450> really<00:01:22.409> not<00:01:22.590> performing

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
doing in 22 it's really not performing

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.920 
doing in 22 it's really not performing
that<00:01:23.340> well<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.700> also<00:01:23.820> I'm<00:01:24.030> noticing<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.659> lot<00:01:24.750> of

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
that well and also I'm noticing a lot of

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.230 
that well and also I'm noticing a lot of
like<00:01:25.110> but<00:01:25.950> these<00:01:26.340> are<00:01:26.520> my<00:01:26.759> initial

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
like but these are my initial

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.240 
like but these are my initial
impressions<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.829> know<00:01:28.920> there<00:01:29.070> may<00:01:29.220> be

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
impressions and you know there may be

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.249 
impressions and you know there may be
software<00:01:29.790> updates<00:01:30.150> or<00:01:30.329> maybe<00:01:30.509> some<00:01:30.750> bucks<00:01:31.049> or

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
software updates or maybe some bucks or

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.870 
software updates or maybe some bucks or
something<00:01:31.409> because<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:32.100> just<00:01:32.340> came<00:01:32.549> out<00:01:32.729> in

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
something because it just came out in

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.999 
something because it just came out in
Korea<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.420> all<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.110> Korean<00:01:34.380> manufacturers

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
Korea and all the Korean manufacturers

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.859 
Korea and all the Korean manufacturers
they<00:01:35.159> do<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:35.790> they<00:01:35.939> can<00:01:36.150> actually<00:01:36.570> take

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
they do that so they can actually take

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.469 
they do that so they can actually take
the<00:01:37.049> bugs<00:01:37.259> out<00:01:37.439> I'll<00:01:37.890> use<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> Korean<00:01:38.700> people<00:01:39.240> as

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
the bugs out I'll use a Korean people as

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.359 
the bugs out I'll use a Korean people as
their<00:01:40.049> beta<00:01:40.320> testers<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:40.979> then<00:01:41.130> when<00:01:41.340> they

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
their beta testers and then when they

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.090 
their beta testers and then when they
launched<00:01:42.530> internationally<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.770> US
