00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.400
 interesting sitting minecraft poket edishn 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.580

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.859
 officially he, too, how would I work 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:24.019
 official and just created this world 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:31.410
 sit if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:34.700
 143 188 218, all I must write in seed 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.260
 description and you can him 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.739
 copy to mine in minecraft 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.239
 edishn 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:45.329
 here we are the bedroom all exactly here on this 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.670
 cross it can be called so and how 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.260
 see there we have the village is the first plus 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.780
 this sid as you can see here 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.420
 Here we have such a small river which 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.309
 goes to the ocean in the ocean too 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.219
 small 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:05.070
 prikolyuha but more on that later 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.869
 see there is some kind of passage then I 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.420
 first noticed 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:15.060
 let's see what is there and so that 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.900
 so incomprehensible but oh well then to me 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.560
 nothing seems so special and 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:28.110
 we see that we still have to sit down or so 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.540
 we go go we go along this path and how 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.079
 We see we've got something strange and 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.590
 is it our cave caverns for a reason 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.930
 usual and if we like 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:44.420
 let's go let's go let's go here 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:49.130
 quite a big descent if you don't have 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:52.920
 special equipment ie picks 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:57.210
 then you hardly get here 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:01.590
 and here we are at this place here as 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.130
 see we have different stuff 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.700
 types 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.200
 from the portal to hell more precisely him 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:13.720
 ask av 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:16.310
 edge and you can see here 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.180
 indulge eat want here like 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.660
 see spawner slugs and a lot of things 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:28.670
 different items have one outlet to the ocean 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:32.290
 from the ocean you can get to this cave 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.690
 without resorting to this 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:40.330
 to this cave that is, we can 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:43.220
 get myself here is the temple without resorting to 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.100
 the cave will be like this 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.320
 see chests for their discovery i'm not 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.500
 I can because I play in creative 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.350
 this is another small sadness 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:58.700
 so we come back here we can 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:00.490
 I travel a lot here 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:07.700
 played hard 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:11.090
 damn shorter survival and I'm there for us now 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:15.370
 even demonstrate what it found as 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.150
 see all sorts of different nyashka buns and 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:22.630
 much more 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:24.730
 let me go out of our world now and 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.989
 we will find 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:32.090
 survival damn I'm out here for some reason and 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:37.489
 I want to demonstrate that there is 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:40.700
 there I found 11 diamonds more precisely 11 I am still 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:46.010
 found for a pickaxe for the sword of this we 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:49.760
 plus 5 we have 16 diamonds which is quite 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:53.180
 not bad there we have this whole temple 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.570
 he is surrounded by stones that is, we can 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.000
 walk around this temple there truth 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:03.050
 not everything is clear but still very 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:09.800
 funny as you see on the same sitting he 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:11.810
 was created when I was playing in the build 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.860
 the twelfth and as you can see well 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.410
 migrated to the official version I 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.830
 somehow got 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:24.400
 from under the water here but I don't remember how I kind of 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:26.920
 put some beacon like there are two 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:31.720
 torch or something like that but to 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:35.590
 Sorry for some reason I did not find my 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:39.690
 beacon and unfortunately could not get 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:45.280
 to my cave but i still came back 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:48.010
 through the food the temple through the cave and we 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:52.450
 I came here and so I am very cool 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:56.140
 got there and in general, then so happy 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:59.260
 here in this village is nothing special 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:03.880
 there are so many landings you can 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:08.560
 stock up on potatoes and carrots and much 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:11.620
 other provisions probably in general 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:16.050

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.050
