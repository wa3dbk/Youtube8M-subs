00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:11.190 
his father yet to win a game at the
crucible<00:02:05.709> this<00:02:05.830> year<00:02:08.729> two<00:02:09.729> weeks<00:02:10.030> I<00:02:10.360> mean

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
crucible this year two weeks I mean

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.479 
crucible this year two weeks I mean
there<00:02:11.379> was<00:02:11.440> a<00:02:11.500> lot<00:02:11.620> of<00:02:11.650> kicks<00:02:11.890> out<00:02:12.069> there<00:02:12.280> today

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
there was a lot of kicks out there today

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:13.890 
there was a lot of kicks out there today
and<00:02:12.879> I<00:02:12.940> think<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.180> table<00:02:13.360> rolled<00:02:13.690> off<00:02:13.870> a

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
and I think the table rolled off a

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.470 
and I think the table rolled off a
fraction<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:15.340> humidity<00:02:15.819> levels<00:02:16.120> weren't

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
fraction the humidity levels weren't

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.660 
fraction the humidity levels weren't
good<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:16.959> a<00:02:17.650> lot<00:02:17.950> of<00:02:17.980> movement<00:02:18.160> in<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.430> crowd

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
good and a lot of movement in the crowd

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.850 
good and a lot of movement in the crowd
well<00:02:19.360> I<00:02:19.390> think<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.959> best<00:02:20.170> player<00:02:20.379> won<00:02:20.620> and

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
well I think the best player won and

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.020 
well I think the best player won and
there<00:02:21.099> was<00:02:21.190> no<00:02:21.310> way<00:02:21.459> I<00:02:21.489> was<00:02:21.580> gonna<00:02:21.640> lose<00:02:21.879> to
