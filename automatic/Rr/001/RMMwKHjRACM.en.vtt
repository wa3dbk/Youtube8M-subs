00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
John Cena went to TNA would that make

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.440 
John Cena went to TNA would that make
the<00:02:01.649> adjustments<00:02:02.490> would<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.759> do<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.210> proper

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
the adjustments would that do the proper

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.410 
the adjustments would that do the proper
uh<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:04.409> know<00:02:04.560> way<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.130> making<00:02:05.549> TNA<00:02:05.909> stick<00:02:06.240> out

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
uh you know way of making TNA stick out

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.330 
uh you know way of making TNA stick out
and<00:02:06.630> making<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.930> stand<00:02:07.140> out<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.530> think<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.129> would

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
and making it stand out I think it would

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.680 
and making it stand out I think it would
but<00:02:08.849> it's<00:02:09.000> don't<00:02:09.239> go<00:02:09.390> would've<00:02:09.569> done

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
but it's don't go would've done

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.110 
but it's don't go would've done
something<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.080> back<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.770> say<00:02:11.120> 2001

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
something like that back and say 2001

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.610 
something like that back and say 2001
yes<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:12.840> would<00:02:12.959> have<00:02:13.050> provided

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
yes it would have provided

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.740

huge<00:02:13.830> boost<00:02:14.099> to<00:02:14.370> WCW<00:02:14.970> but<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:15.540> did<00:02:15.720> not

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
huge boost to WCW but that did not

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.199 
huge boost to WCW but that did not
happen<00:02:16.140> but<00:02:16.890> if<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.099> take<00:02:17.280> John<00:02:17.610> Cena<00:02:18.000> who<00:02:18.180> is

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
happen but if you take John Cena who is

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.479 
happen but if you take John Cena who is
what<00:02:18.659> is<00:02:18.780> in<00:02:19.049> who<00:02:19.230> is<00:02:19.379> current<00:02:19.799> day<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.190> you

a<00:02:22.440> world<00:02:22.739> of<00:02:22.890> difference<00:02:23.010> for<00:02:23.340> Tina<00:02:23.519> because<00:02:23.849> a

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
a world of difference for Tina because a

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.970 
a world of difference for Tina because a
lot<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.090> John<00:02:24.390> Cena<00:02:24.690> fans<00:02:24.989> would<00:02:25.349> follow<00:02:25.620> John

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
lot of John Cena fans would follow John

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.490 
lot of John Cena fans would follow John
