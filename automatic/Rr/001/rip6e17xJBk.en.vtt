00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:29.800 
in that's that's the part where we have
more<00:02:26.989> expertise<00:02:27.620> than<00:02:27.620> anybody<00:02:28.400> else<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:29.000> it

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
more expertise than anybody else and it

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.360 
more expertise than anybody else and it
would<00:02:29.989> take<00:02:30.230> what<00:02:30.709> we<00:02:30.859> call<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.189> whole

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
would take what we call the whole

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.209 
would take what we call the whole
control<00:02:32.299> strategy<00:02:32.900> if<00:02:33.409> this<00:02:33.650> is<00:02:33.799> truly<00:02:34.099> the

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:34.219 
control strategy if this is truly the

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:36.819 
control strategy if this is truly the
future<00:02:34.639> why<00:02:35.209> are<00:02:35.359> we<00:02:35.420> not<00:02:35.599> seeing<00:02:35.840> more<00:02:36.170> more

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
future why are we not seeing more more

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.649 
future why are we not seeing more more
attempts<00:02:37.280> to<00:02:37.430> develop<00:02:37.549> this<00:02:37.909> instead<00:02:38.359> of<00:02:38.420> just

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
attempts to develop this instead of just

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:43.000 
attempts to develop this instead of just
in<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:38.870> concept<00:02:39.290> part<00:02:39.590> well<00:02:40.310> I<00:02:40.579> think<00:02:41.889> what<00:02:42.889> is

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
in a concept part well I think what is

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.960 
in a concept part well I think what is
really<00:02:43.040> surprised<00:02:43.790> everybody<00:02:44.500> was<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.970> rapid

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
really surprised everybody was the rapid

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.899 
really surprised everybody was the rapid
advancement<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:48.730> lithium-ion<00:02:49.730> technology

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 
advancement and lithium-ion technology

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.069 
advancement and lithium-ion technology
and<00:02:51.849> try<00:02:52.849> to<00:02:52.909> do<00:02:53.120> it<00:02:53.299> with<00:02:53.329> nickel<00:02:53.900> metal

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
and try to do it with nickel metal

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.899 
and try to do it with nickel metal
hydride<00:02:54.230> batteries<00:02:55.419> is<00:02:56.419> really<00:02:56.900> tough<00:02:57.909> and

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
hydride batteries is really tough and

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.059 
hydride batteries is really tough and
nickel<00:02:59.450> metal<00:02:59.599> hydride<00:02:59.750> because<00:03:00.620> of<00:03:00.769> the<00:03:00.859> fact

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
nickel metal hydride because of the fact

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.690 
nickel metal hydride because of the fact
that<00:03:01.219> they<00:03:01.459> contain<00:03:01.939> nickel<00:03:02.419> which

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
that they contain nickel which

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.240 
that they contain nickel which
material<00:03:04.300> you<00:03:04.510> never<00:03:05.290> really<00:03:05.650> can<00:03:05.830> get<00:03:06.069> the

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
material you never really can get the

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.280 
material you never really can get the
cost<00:03:06.489> down<00:03:06.610> there<00:03:07.510> was<00:03:07.599> the<00:03:07.720> same<00:03:07.930> thing<00:03:08.140> with

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
cost down there was the same thing with

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.990 
cost down there was the same thing with
nickel<00:03:08.620> cadmium<00:03:08.830> which<00:03:09.370> on<00:03:09.580> top<00:03:09.849> of

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
nickel cadmium which on top of

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.360 
nickel cadmium which on top of
everything<00:03:10.269> else<00:03:10.480> is<00:03:10.780> pretty<00:03:11.140> toxic<00:03:11.500> but

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
everything else is pretty toxic but

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.210 
everything else is pretty toxic but
lithium<00:03:13.000> shows<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.349> promise<00:03:15.010> because

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
lithium shows the promise because

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.550 
lithium shows the promise because
lithium<00:03:15.819> is<00:03:15.970> plentiful<00:03:16.360> and<00:03:16.720> it's<00:03:16.959> cheap<00:03:17.290> and

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
lithium is plentiful and it's cheap and

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.650 
lithium is plentiful and it's cheap and
it's<00:03:17.739> environmentally<00:03:18.489> safe<00:03:19.000> you're

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
it's environmentally safe you're

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.530 
it's environmentally safe you're
diversifying<00:03:20.349> so<00:03:21.010> much<00:03:21.220> in<00:03:21.400> fuels<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:22.420> know

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
diversifying so much in fuels you know

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.400 
diversifying so much in fuels you know
hydrogen<00:03:23.290> fuels<00:03:24.120> biodiesel<00:03:25.120> why<00:03:25.959> not<00:03:26.170> invest

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
hydrogen fuels biodiesel why not invest

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.280 
hydrogen fuels biodiesel why not invest
in<00:03:26.860> one<00:03:27.130> and<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:28.510> seems<00:03:28.750> like<00:03:28.810> you're<00:03:29.019> over

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
in one and it seems like you're over

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.309 
in one and it seems like you're over
diversifying<00:03:30.010> we<00:03:30.610> will<00:03:30.880> use<00:03:31.209> any<00:03:31.599> fuel<00:03:32.080> that's

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
diversifying we will use any fuel that's

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.830 
diversifying we will use any fuel that's
available<00:03:32.650> to<00:03:33.160> us<00:03:33.280> in<00:03:33.310> it<00:03:33.629> batteries<00:03:34.629> are<00:03:34.660> a

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
available to us in it batteries are a

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.720 
available to us in it batteries are a
better<00:03:35.110> feel<00:03:35.440> than<00:03:35.470> anything<00:03:36.130> else<00:03:36.340> will<00:03:36.549> use

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
better feel than anything else will use

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.509 
better feel than anything else will use
it<00:03:36.940> and<00:03:37.120> right<00:03:37.330> now<00:03:37.569> I<00:03:38.099> personally<00:03:39.099> convinced

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
it and right now I personally convinced

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.059 
it and right now I personally convinced
that<00:03:40.420> batteries<00:03:40.930> on<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:41.140> way<00:03:41.410> to<00:03:41.470> batteries

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
that batteries on the way to batteries

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.640 
that batteries on the way to batteries
around<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.400> way<00:03:42.579> to<00:03:42.670> being<00:03:42.880> a<00:03:43.349> really<00:03:44.349> really

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
around the way to being a really really

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.339 
around the way to being a really really
good<00:03:45.040> propulsion<00:03:45.730> source<00:03:45.910> for<00:03:46.239> cars<00:03:46.480> but<00:03:46.810> two

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
good propulsion source for cars but two

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:48.780 
good propulsion source for cars but two
years<00:03:47.380> ago<00:03:47.680> I<00:03:47.860> would<00:03:48.099> have<00:03:48.130> told<00:03:48.400> you<00:03:48.519> they're

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
years ago I would have told you they're

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.240 
years ago I would have told you they're
not<00:03:48.940> with<00:03:49.810> Chrysler<00:03:50.200> announcing<00:03:50.620> an<00:03:50.860> updated

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
not with Chrysler announcing an updated

is<00:03:53.620> G<00:03:53.829> I'm<00:03:53.950> going<00:03:54.099> to<00:03:54.160> get<00:03:54.280> into<00:03:54.489> a<00:03:54.519> horsepower

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
is G I'm going to get into a horsepower

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.229 
is G I'm going to get into a horsepower
race<00:03:55.150> with<00:03:55.390> Chrysler<00:03:56.200> yeah<00:03:56.560> probably<00:03:57.239> the

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
race with Chrysler yeah probably the

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.590 
race with Chrysler yeah probably the
