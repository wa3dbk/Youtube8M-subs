00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
didn't need the key we exploded it with

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.380 
didn't need the key we exploded it with
the<00:03:11.750> CMT<00:03:12.260> you<00:03:13.130> can<00:03:13.310> open<00:03:13.609> it<00:03:13.700> with<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:13.940> colon

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
the CMT you can open it with the colon

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.300 
the CMT you can open it with the colon
key<00:03:14.630> or<00:03:14.989> explode<00:03:15.470> it<00:03:15.650> like<00:03:15.799> that<00:03:16.040> with<00:03:16.220> the

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
key or explode it like that with the

key or explode it like that with the
team

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
team

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.350 
team
