00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
600 I'm sure that's enough to power this

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.730 
600 I'm sure that's enough to power this
phone<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.780> should<00:01:24.990> be<00:01:25.020> enough<00:01:25.320> for<00:01:25.560> your

doing some gaming I believe that the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.060 
doing some gaming I believe that the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
Snapdragon even that s4 pro should suit

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.580 
Snapdragon even that s4 pro should suit
your<00:01:35.220> need<00:01:35.430> anyways<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:36.360> also<00:01:36.570> does<00:01:36.900> include

a<00:01:37.829> couple<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.369> software<00:01:38.820> tweaks<00:01:39.000> that

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
a couple of software tweaks that

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.999 
a couple of software tweaks that
includes<00:01:39.720> like<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.900> dual<00:01:40.229> record<00:01:40.770> function

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
includes like a dual record function

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.580 
includes like a dual record function
which<00:01:41.850> uses<00:01:42.240> both<00:01:42.479> camera<00:01:42.990> cameras

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
which uses both camera cameras
