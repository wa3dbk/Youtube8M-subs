software secondly they all have open
operating<00:00:52.570> systems<00:00:53.020> and<00:00:53.230> that<00:00:53.650> allows<00:00:53.920> you<00:00:54.100> to

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
perhaps most obvious is the design

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.770 
perhaps most obvious is the design
structure<00:01:04.570> they<00:01:04.750> all<00:01:04.839> share<00:01:06.450> we<00:01:07.450> call<00:01:07.600> it<00:01:07.630> the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
structure they all share we call it the

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.350 
structure they all share we call it the
human<00:01:08.439> curvature<00:01:09.100> design<00:01:09.610> framework<00:01:09.909> and

human curvature design framework and

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.969 
human curvature design framework and
it's<00:01:10.509> it's<00:01:10.750> very<00:01:11.049> apparent<00:01:11.409> if<00:01:11.710> you<00:01:11.770> take<00:01:11.950> a

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
it's it's very apparent if you take a

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.380 
it's it's very apparent if you take a
look<00:01:12.189> at<00:01:12.310> the<00:01:12.430> film's<00:01:12.759> where<00:01:12.939> you<00:01:13.030> see<00:01:13.210> the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
look at the film's where you see the

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.830 
look at the film's where you see the
curvature<00:01:13.659> and<00:01:14.170> lines<00:01:14.560> and<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:16.479> will<00:01:16.690> be

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
curvature and lines and this will be

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.260 
curvature and lines and this will be
consistent<00:01:17.799> throughout<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.520> portfolio<00:01:19.030> for
