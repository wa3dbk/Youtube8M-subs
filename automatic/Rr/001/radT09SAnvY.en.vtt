00:00:08.434 --> 00:00:10.434
 Dear friends, everyone, today is New Year’s Eve. 

00:00:10.434 --> 00:00:11.874
 We have already had a holiday! 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.440
 But a few days ago we published a test film for Ford Kuga TDCi. 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.980
 At the end of the film there is a section of the electric tailgate that cannot be closed. 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.140
 It’s like buying a mobile phone 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.834
 Mobile phones will also buy machine king 

00:00:26.955 --> 00:00:28.955
 Buy a car will buy a car king! 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.700
 Ford Motors especially stressed that only the one test ride is flawed. 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.676
 Is problematic 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.400
 Because Kuga TDCi has not started to deliver the car, these are the first batch of trial cars. 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.700
 In the evening, all the trials north of Taichung will be taken. 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.135
 This is the row of Kuga behind me. 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.720
 All dragged to Taipei 

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:49.849
 The results are qualified after our tests. 

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:51.560
 Go car is in the process of commissioning 

00:00:51.854 --> 00:00:53.854
 What kind of feeling does the vehicle bring to me? 

00:00:54.227 --> 00:00:56.227
 I will tell every consumer very faithfully. 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.200
 But it does not mean that we do not complain to the original factory. 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.780
 So on today's New Year's Eve 

00:01:02.874 --> 00:01:04.334
 I will have a reunion dinner later. 

00:01:04.334 --> 00:01:05.913
 Maybe everyone sees this movie at the same time 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.460
 It should be eating New Year’s Eve. 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.880
 We still work overtime to test for everyone. 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.920
 The four Ford Kuga TDCi behind me 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.614
 then 

00:01:17.614 --> 00:01:19.334
 All the keys are here 

00:01:19.334 --> 00:01:20.908
 There are four keys 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.740
 Yesterday, I met with Ford executives until midnight. 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.635
 If today........ 

00:01:26.635 --> 00:01:28.540
 If there is a tailgate that cannot be closed 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.870
 Next to the Keelung River 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.700
 I will throw the car directly into the river to let the consumers go! ? 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.542
 Then let's test the first time 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.820
 it is good! 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.980
 I have now opened all the tailgates. 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.680
 Four keys in my hand 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.260
 The last time I tried the car, I realized that the Kuga closed door does not need to press the tailgate button. 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.748
 It is also possible to play with! 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.680
 Still have to be again? ? 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.400
 We are good again, this is with the remote control 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.860
 Which one is that? 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.760
 That one! 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.200
 This time I will test again directly with the remote control. 

00:02:42.334 --> 00:02:44.334
 Test the electric tailgate closed 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.400
 I don't know about that one! 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.740
 it is good! Four Ford Kuga TDCI 

00:03:04.803 --> 00:03:06.803
 After our two tests 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.380
 On the same slope, angle and location 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.860
 Maybe here will be a sightseeing spot for everyone to test the electric tailgate in the future! ! 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.820
 Tested twice and qualified 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.120
 The car king we tested on the day was there! 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.380
 This car king wants to go back to the original factory to repair 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.160
 These four Kugas have passed the test. 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.975
 So it also represents 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.440
 Our last test drive can also be said 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.700
 may....... 

00:03:30.136 --> 00:03:32.136
 Ford's eight-character light! 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.020
 Just give us a car king with a problem with the electric tailgate! 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.860
 After our test today, these four cars 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.380
 Test drive in all exhibition rooms north of Taichung 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.154
 Not specially modified 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.860
 If the Kuga TDCi is handed to you in the future 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.800
 Also encountered problems during the last test drive 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.320
 You can go back to the original factory and ask the original factory to repair the warranty. 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.740
 Then we are working overtime today. 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.960
 Is to test the electric tailgate of these four cars. 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.160
 After a year, I have been away from Taiwan for some time. 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.500
 Will participate in the Geneva Motor Show and overseas test activities 

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:07.789
 If you have a chance to return to Taiwan 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.840
 Many netizens hope that we can test the fuel consumption of Kuga TDCi. 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.420
 At that time, we will arrange the fuel consumption performance of this car. 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.240
 Finally, I wish everyone a happy new year.
