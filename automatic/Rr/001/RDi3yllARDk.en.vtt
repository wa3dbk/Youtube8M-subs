stopped<00:01:29.950> moving<00:01:30.130> it<00:01:30.460> was<00:01:30.549> almost<00:01:30.700> impossible

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
stopped moving it was almost impossible

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:33.719 
stopped moving it was almost impossible

I<00:04:01.830> think<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.460> management<00:04:02.730> programs<00:04:03.240> are

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.330 
I think the management programs are
really<00:04:03.630> starting<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:03.960> work<00:04:04.200> people<00:04:05.160> are

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
really starting to work people are

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.280 
really starting to work people are
starting<00:04:05.550> to<00:04:05.640> let<00:04:05.760> these<00:04:05.910> deer<00:04:06.090> go<00:04:06.330> when
