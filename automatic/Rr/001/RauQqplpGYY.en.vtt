00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:21.590
 hi the saplings or so today we 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:23.480
 will learn the package in bed that you 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:29.210
 will be able to make new 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:31.640
 tricks go we left then for the 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.340
 package in bed same principle as for the 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.130
 in bed but the placement of dirty feet 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.200
 and place them as for the all in it's 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.960
 to say a little below the 10 or at the 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.690
 half of the skateboard and the bias exactly 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.360
 same on the theme then at the 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.380
 difference is that for the holy slammed 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.090
 rub it raining here it's going to be the same 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.180
 thing but rolling in the other direction 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.150
 aside from the slamming leg is going 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.940
 to be projected forward it's up to 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:06.140
 to say that at this level for the holy one 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:09.979
 slap one rubs and one tends towards this side 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.590
 to go in that direction for 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.210
 the high school interview the slamming leg 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.250
 who will give the direction 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.359
 that is, at the moment of snapping 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.399
 we will slam and throw the leg towards 

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:25.069
 this side 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:27.109
 remember to keep the weight back 

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:29.090
 because seen like me in this 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:31.579
 direction if you keep the weight at 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.219
 on it we believe molly you go 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:37.880
 jump forward and the tench she's going 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:41.590
 stay on the back so think well of 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:46.090
 roll slammed project the front leg 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:50.109
 while keeping the body on the reille 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.109
 we go to the example of wolves 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.010
 and here are the loulous I hope you 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.200
 will understand everything if you have 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.370
 worries or anything 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.100

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.530
