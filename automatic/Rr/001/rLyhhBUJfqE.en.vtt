I'm<00:00:06.420> trying<00:00:06.690> out<00:00:06.839> some<00:00:07.170> new<00:00:07.200> studio<00:00:07.799> lighting

I'm trying out some new studio lighting

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.799 
I'm trying out some new studio lighting
today<00:00:08.429> that<00:00:08.730> should<00:00:08.910> be<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.150> pretty<00:00:09.599> vast

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
today that should be a pretty vast

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.200 
today that should be a pretty vast
improvement<00:00:10.559> over<00:00:10.830> what<00:00:11.070> we've<00:00:11.309> used<00:00:11.940> in<00:00:12.179> the

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
improvement over what we've used in the

so<00:00:12.870> hopefully<00:00:13.530> this<00:00:13.860> will<00:00:13.920> make<00:00:14.309> the

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
so hopefully this will make the

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.400 
so hopefully this will make the
components<00:00:15.240> for<00:00:15.780> talking<00:00:16.139> about<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.379> little

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
components for talking about a little

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.370 
components for talking about a little
bit<00:00:16.650> easier<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.100> see<00:00:17.400> as<00:00:17.550> we<00:00:17.699> go<00:00:17.850> along<00:00:18.380> today

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
bit easier to see as we go along today

the<00:01:14.430> case<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:15.030> also<00:01:15.320> rounded<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.950> bit<00:01:17.130> more

their watches

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.090 
their watches
I<00:01:23.939> think<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.570> homage<00:01:24.979> of<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.700> nice<00:01:27.829> design<00:01:28.829> to

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
I think the homage of a nice design to

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.100 
I think the homage of a nice design to
make<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.520> watch<00:01:29.700> were<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.000> little<00:01:30.299> flatter<00:01:30.840> on

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
make the watch were a little flatter on

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.249 
make the watch were a little flatter on
the<00:01:31.229> wrist<00:01:31.470> but<00:01:31.829> still<00:01:32.990> providing<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.079> good

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
the wrist but still providing a good

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.050 
the wrist but still providing a good
presence<00:01:34.770> for<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.549> walk<00:01:37.430> the<00:01:38.430> movement<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.030> a

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
presence for the walk the movement is a

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.499 
presence for the walk the movement is a
new<00:01:39.329> piece<00:01:39.720> 203<00:01:40.560> movement<00:01:41.009> which<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.509> the

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
new piece 203 movement which is the

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.530 
new piece 203 movement which is the
in-house<00:01:43.520> automatic<00:01:45.799> DMT<00:01:46.799> movement<00:01:47.360> is<00:01:48.360> very

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
in-house automatic DMT movement is very

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.469 
in-house automatic DMT movement is very
nicely<00:01:48.810> finished<00:01:49.170> but<00:01:49.590> kind<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.189> modern

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
nicely finished but kind of a modern

it not only nice to behold but fairly

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.730 
it not only nice to behold but fairly
simple<00:02:08.360> to<00:02:08.950> read<00:02:10.360> nomenclature<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:11.740> presents

a nice visual present the most

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.730 
a nice visual present the most
interesting<00:02:16.640> thing<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:16.910> me<00:02:17.180> about<00:02:17.630> this<00:02:18.410> watch

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
interesting thing to me about this watch

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.770 
interesting thing to me about this watch
is<00:02:19.070> just<00:02:19.280> how<00:02:19.430> they<00:02:19.610> tailored<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:20.360> movement

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
is just how they tailored the movement

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.100 
is just how they tailored the movement
operations<00:02:23.890> if<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:25.670> think<00:02:25.970> about<00:02:26.210> how<00:02:26.630> most

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
operations if you think about how most

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.030 
operations if you think about how most
watch<00:02:27.950> mechanisms<00:02:28.850> work<00:02:29.620> one<00:02:30.620> of<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:30.800> more

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
watch mechanisms work one of the more

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.770 
watch mechanisms work one of the more
tedious<00:02:31.310> parts<00:02:31.880> is<00:02:32.060> always<00:02:32.420> kind<00:02:32.630> of

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
tedious parts is always kind of

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.630 
tedious parts is always kind of
resetting<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:35.500> seconds<00:02:36.500> hand<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.890> zero<00:02:37.130> when

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
resetting the seconds hand to zero when

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.700 
resetting the seconds hand to zero when
you<00:02:37.730> go<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:37.970> set<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.480> watch<00:02:38.690> against<00:02:39.320> the

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
you go to set the watch against the

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.460 
you go to set the watch against the
atomic<00:02:40.190> clock<00:02:40.430> somewhere<00:02:41.200> but<00:02:42.200> in<00:02:42.350> this

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
atomic clock somewhere but in this

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.200 
atomic clock somewhere but in this
particular<00:02:42.740> case<00:02:43.190> they've<00:02:43.640> done<00:02:43.850> something

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
particular case they've done something

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.110 
particular case they've done something
which<00:02:44.540> i<00:02:44.750> think<00:02:44.810> is<00:02:45.080> very<00:02:45.110> unique<00:02:45.640> if<00:02:46.640> you<00:02:46.850> pull

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
which i think is very unique if you pull

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.310 
which i think is very unique if you pull
a<00:02:47.150> crown<00:02:47.510> out<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:48.020> the<00:02:48.140> second<00:02:48.530> position<00:02:49.270> which

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
a crown out to the second position which

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.740 
a crown out to the second position which
resets<00:02:51.320> the<00:02:51.680> entire<00:02:52.040> movement<00:02:52.610> you<00:02:53.270> can<00:02:53.450> see

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
resets the entire movement you can see

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.410 
resets the entire movement you can see
that<00:02:54.050> the<00:02:54.170> sub-second<00:02:54.800> hand<00:02:55.420> automatically

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
that the sub-second hand automatically

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.000 
that the sub-second hand automatically
snaps<00:02:56.960> back<00:02:57.320> to<00:02:57.770> zero<00:02:58.610> position<00:02:59.410> so<00:03:00.410> you<00:03:00.500> can

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
snaps back to zero position so you can

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.160 
snaps back to zero position so you can
set<00:03:01.520> the<00:03:03.790> entire<00:03:04.790> movement<00:03:05.150> against<00:03:06.050> the

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
set the entire movement against the

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.760 
set the entire movement against the
atomic<00:03:06.590> clock<00:03:06.800> just<00:03:07.220> by<00:03:07.430> positioning<00:03:08.209> the

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
atomic clock just by positioning the

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.620 
atomic clock just by positioning the
hand<00:03:09.770> that<00:03:10.100> whatever<00:03:10.400> minute<00:03:10.790> your<00:03:11.090> objective

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
hand that whatever minute your objective

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.050 
hand that whatever minute your objective
is<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:12.110> then<00:03:12.310> knowing<00:03:13.310> that<00:03:13.459> it's<00:03:13.700> already

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
is and then knowing that it's already

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
the seconds are already zero you can use

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.500 
the seconds are already zero you can use
wait<00:03:15.860> for<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.700> moment<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.120> come<00:03:17.270> along

wait for the the moment to come along

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.260 
wait for the the moment to come along
and<00:03:17.840> press<00:03:18.080> the<00:03:18.260> crown<00:03:18.470> in<00:03:18.770> to<00:03:19.270> reach

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
and press the crown in to reach

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.120 
and press the crown in to reach
centrally<00:03:20.750> but<00:03:21.170> kind<00:03:21.380> of<00:03:21.440> a<00:03:21.500> nice<00:03:21.709> feature<00:03:21.950> I

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
centrally but kind of a nice feature I

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
centrally but kind of a nice feature I
wish<00:03:22.400> a<00:03:22.430> lot<00:03:22.700> of<00:03:22.820> other<00:03:22.970> people<00:03:23.360> would<00:03:23.480> use

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
wish a lot of other people would use

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.030 
wish a lot of other people would use
this<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.660> MIDI<00:03:27.050> MP<00:03:27.320> feature<00:03:27.560> on<00:03:27.770> that<00:03:27.920> is

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
this the MIDI MP feature on that is

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.550 
this the MIDI MP feature on that is
really<00:03:28.280> nice<00:03:28.370> it's<00:03:28.640> got<00:03:28.790> a<00:03:28.820> couple<00:03:29.090> of

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
really nice it's got a couple of

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.240 
really nice it's got a couple of
functional<00:03:30.560> components<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:32.540> 24-hour<00:03:33.320> AM<00:03:34.040> and

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
functional components the 24-hour AM and

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.009 
functional components the 24-hour AM and
PM<00:03:34.280> indicator<00:03:36.160> is<00:03:37.160> the<00:03:37.430> constant<00:03:38.019> 24-hour

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
PM indicator is the constant 24-hour

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.410 
PM indicator is the constant 24-hour
mobile<00:03:39.380> movement<00:03:40.010> kind<00:03:40.700> of<00:03:40.790> allows<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.300> to

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
mobile movement kind of allows you to

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.860 
mobile movement kind of allows you to
set<00:03:41.690> at<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:41.900> home<00:03:42.050> time<00:03:42.640> but<00:03:43.640> if<00:03:43.850> you<00:03:44.090> then

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
set at the home time but if you then

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.759 
set at the home time but if you then
push<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.980> crown<00:03:46.250> in<00:03:47.260> once<00:03:48.260> you<00:03:48.350> get<00:03:48.560> obviously

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
push the crown in once you get obviously

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.030 
push the crown in once you get obviously
once<00:03:49.160> you<00:03:49.190> get<00:03:49.340> it<00:03:49.459> set<00:03:49.610> to<00:03:49.760> home<00:03:49.910> time<00:03:50.890> if<00:03:51.890> you

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
once you get it set to home time if you

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.199 
once you get it set to home time if you
push<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.550> crown<00:03:52.790> in<00:03:53.060> by<00:03:53.750> one<00:03:54.019> notch<00:03:54.320> I<00:03:55.030> can<00:03:56.030> do

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
push the crown in by one notch I can do

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.810 
push the crown in by one notch I can do
this

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
this

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.320 
this
the<00:03:59.740> second<00:04:00.740> hand<00:04:00.950> resumed<00:04:01.700> movement

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
the second hand resumed movement

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.420 
the second hand resumed movement
whatever<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:02.990> specific<00:04:03.620> time<00:04:03.800> as<00:04:04.040> you<00:04:04.190> said

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
whatever the specific time as you said

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.480 
whatever the specific time as you said
it<00:04:04.580> and<00:04:05.240> the<00:04:05.900> hour<00:04:06.050> hand<00:04:06.500> and<00:04:06.890> begins<00:04:07.280> to

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
it and the hour hand and begins to

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.030 
it and the hour hand and begins to
function<00:04:08.650> independently<00:04:09.650> for<00:04:10.460> setting<00:04:10.880> or

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
function independently for setting or

your travel time or you know on-site

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.240 
your travel time or you know on-site
time<00:04:14.540> but<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.380> neat<00:04:15.530> thing<00:04:15.560> about<00:04:15.740> it<00:04:15.890> is<00:04:16.070> I'm

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
time but the neat thing about it is I'm

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.099 
time but the neat thing about it is I'm
sure<00:04:16.280> you<00:04:16.519> can<00:04:16.700> you<00:04:16.850> see<00:04:17.120> when<00:04:17.510> I<00:04:17.540> move<00:04:17.840> the

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
sure you can you see when I move the

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.979 
sure you can you see when I move the
hour<00:04:18.260> hand<00:04:18.410> away<00:04:18.859> from<00:04:19.160> home<00:04:19.340> time<00:04:19.720> we<00:04:20.720> still

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
hour hand away from home time we still

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.500 
hour hand away from home time we still
have<00:04:21.260> another<00:04:21.830> hand<00:04:22.220> indicator<00:04:22.880> for<00:04:23.480> the

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
have another hand indicator for the

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.680 
have another hand indicator for the
12-hour<00:04:24.140> position<00:04:24.770> of<00:04:25.430> current<00:04:25.970> home<00:04:26.120> time<00:04:26.390> so

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
12-hour position of current home time so

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.660 
12-hour position of current home time so
now<00:04:26.870> we<00:04:26.930> have<00:04:27.260> a<00:04:27.290> 12-hour<00:04:28.690> scale<00:04:29.800> for<00:04:30.800> home

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
now we have a 12-hour scale for home

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.790 
now we have a 12-hour scale for home
time<00:04:31.970> and<00:04:32.210> we<00:04:32.270> also<00:04:32.420> still<00:04:32.870> have<00:04:33.080> the<00:04:33.230> 24-hour

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
time and we also still have the 24-hour

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.370 
time and we also still have the 24-hour
AM<00:04:34.310> and<00:04:34.460> PM<00:04:34.490> indicator<00:04:36.730> which<00:04:37.730> is<00:04:38.140> really<00:04:39.140> kind

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
AM and PM indicator which is really kind

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.200 
AM and PM indicator which is really kind
of<00:04:39.440> a<00:04:39.560> neat<00:04:39.770> feature<00:04:40.040> and<00:04:40.400> I<00:04:40.460> think<00:04:40.730> for<00:04:41.090> those

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
of a neat feature and I think for those

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.300 
of a neat feature and I think for those
of<00:04:41.420> us<00:04:41.570> who<00:04:41.750> use<00:04:41.990> a<00:04:42.020> watch<00:04:42.410> and<00:04:42.680> travel<00:04:43.100> across

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
of us who use a watch and travel across

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.020 
of us who use a watch and travel across
time<00:04:43.730> zones<00:04:44.140> a<00:04:45.140> very<00:04:45.860> unique<00:04:46.280> feature<00:04:46.490> a<00:04:46.760> nice

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
time zones a very unique feature a nice

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.560 
time zones a very unique feature a nice
way<00:04:47.270> to<00:04:47.300> layout<00:04:47.690> to<00:04:47.870> die<00:04:49.120> anyway<00:04:50.120> all<00:04:50.330> in<00:04:50.420> all

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
way to layout to die anyway all in all

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.470 
way to layout to die anyway all in all
just<00:04:50.780> I<00:04:50.900> think<00:04:51.110> that's<00:04:51.290> super<00:04:51.440> launch<00:04:52.480> one

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
just I think that's super launch one

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.970 
just I think that's super launch one
that<00:04:53.600> I<00:04:53.720> would<00:04:53.870> be<00:04:53.990> proud<00:04:54.230> to<00:04:54.440> own<00:04:54.470> and<00:04:54.800> where

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
that I would be proud to own and where

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.190 
that I would be proud to own and where
one<00:04:55.130> can<00:04:55.310> find<00:04:55.520> very<00:04:55.850> utilitarian<00:04:56.150> for<00:04:56.840> travel

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
one can find very utilitarian for travel
