00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
seems like it does definitely need to be

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.520 
seems like it does definitely need to be
stirred<00:02:10.240> up<00:02:10.420> it's<00:02:10.690> pretty<00:02:10.869> thick<00:02:11.230> in<00:02:11.260> the

they<00:02:45.700> stayed<00:02:45.910> do<00:02:46.030> a<00:02:46.060> second<00:02:46.510> coat<00:02:46.630> after<00:02:47.019> about

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
they stayed do a second coat after about

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.970 
they stayed do a second coat after about
an<00:02:47.380> hour<00:02:47.500> so<00:02:49.200> it's<00:02:50.200> what<00:02:50.350> it<00:02:50.410> looks<00:02:50.620> like<00:02:50.739> so

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
an hour so it's what it looks like so

00:02:50.980 --> 00:03:00.509 
an hour so it's what it looks like so
far<00:02:55.830> so<00:02:56.830> I'm<00:02:57.010> pretty<00:02:57.640> much<00:02:57.790> done<00:02:58.180> with<00:02:58.209> my<00:02:59.519> rest

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
far so I'm pretty much done with my rest

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.910 
far so I'm pretty much done with my rest
dalian<00:03:01.060> truck<00:03:01.950> bed<00:03:02.950> liner<00:03:04.470> have<00:03:05.470> to<00:03:05.650> do<00:03:05.769> this

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
dalian truck bed liner have to do this

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.039 
dalian truck bed liner have to do this
area<00:03:06.280> again<00:03:06.489> I<00:03:06.519> decided<00:03:07.000> not<00:03:07.239> to<00:03:07.299> remove<00:03:07.840> the

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
area again I decided not to remove the

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.420 
area again I decided not to remove the
console<00:03:08.590> because<00:03:08.799> it<00:03:08.950> was<00:03:09.040> going<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.310> be<00:03:09.400> a

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
console because it was going to be a

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.390 
console because it was going to be a
pain<00:03:09.730> and<00:03:10.000> I'll<00:03:10.410> never<00:03:11.410> really<00:03:11.739> need<00:03:11.950> it<00:03:12.100> under

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
pain and I'll never really need it under

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.610 
pain and I'll never really need it under
there<00:03:12.610> so<00:03:13.090> left<00:03:13.720> that<00:03:13.959> in<00:03:14.200> but<00:03:14.350> I<00:03:14.380> did

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
there so left that in but I did

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.870 
there so left that in but I did
everything<00:03:14.860> else<00:03:15.100> I<00:03:15.310> think<00:03:15.459> it<00:03:15.549> looks<00:03:15.730> pretty

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
everything else I think it looks pretty

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.110 
everything else I think it looks pretty
good<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:17.440> reason<00:03:17.709> I<00:03:17.860> wanted<00:03:18.190> to<00:03:18.250> do<00:03:18.459> this<00:03:18.700> is<00:03:18.970> I

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
good the reason I wanted to do this is I

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.440 
good the reason I wanted to do this is I
wanted<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.420> be<00:03:19.510> able<00:03:19.570> to<00:03:20.430> have<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:21.610> tougher

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
wanted to be able to have a tougher

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.539 
wanted to be able to have a tougher
surface<00:03:23.230> in<00:03:23.470> here<00:03:23.709> for<00:03:23.980> when<00:03:24.100> I<00:03:24.160> take<00:03:24.519> my

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
surface in here for when I take my

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.000 
surface in here for when I take my
carpet<00:03:25.150> out<00:03:25.269> cuz<00:03:25.570> on<00:03:25.840> my<00:03:25.989> other<00:03:26.140> JK<00:03:26.650> I<00:03:26.680> didn't

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
carpet out cuz on my other JK I didn't

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.160 
carpet out cuz on my other JK I didn't
take<00:03:27.160> my<00:03:27.190> carpet<00:03:27.760> out<00:03:27.910> a<00:03:27.940> lot<00:03:28.329> and<00:03:28.660> it<00:03:28.780> got<00:03:28.930> kind

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
take my carpet out a lot and it got kind

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.960 
take my carpet out a lot and it got kind
of<00:03:29.230> trashed<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:29.799> also<00:03:30.010> also<00:03:30.280> with<00:03:30.519> my<00:03:30.700> dogs

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
of trashed and also also with my dogs

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.520 
of trashed and also also with my dogs
it'd<00:03:31.269> be<00:03:31.360> nice<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.570> have<00:03:31.780> no<00:03:31.959> carpet<00:03:32.350> because

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
it'd be nice to have no carpet because

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.140 
it'd be nice to have no carpet because
the<00:03:32.650> hair<00:03:32.860> just<00:03:33.070> gets<00:03:33.250> into<00:03:33.489> everything<00:03:33.910> so

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
the hair just gets into everything so

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.740 
the hair just gets into everything so
that's<00:03:34.870> what's<00:03:35.110> looking<00:03:35.440> like<00:03:35.680> I<00:03:36.480> think<00:03:37.480> I<00:03:37.600> may

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
that's what's looking like I think I may

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.440 
that's what's looking like I think I may
eventually<00:03:38.140> go<00:03:38.709> do<00:03:38.950> it<00:03:39.160> in<00:03:39.370> that<00:03:40.060> one<00:03:40.239> right

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
eventually go do it in that one right

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.740 
eventually go do it in that one right
there<00:03:40.660> at<00:03:40.750> you<00:03:41.579> because<00:03:42.579> the<00:03:42.760> carpet<00:03:43.329> and<00:03:43.630> that

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
there at you because the carpet and that

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.870 
there at you because the carpet and that
I<00:03:44.200> think<00:03:44.680> spydra's<00:03:45.070> all<00:03:45.220> and<00:03:45.370> this<00:03:45.489> just<00:03:45.700> got

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
I think spydra's all and this just got

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.610 
I think spydra's all and this just got
so<00:03:46.269> much<00:03:46.510> dog<00:03:46.900> hair<00:03:47.230> woven<00:03:47.829> into<00:03:48.160> it<00:03:48.340> so<00:03:49.620> huh

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
so much dog hair woven into it so huh

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.680 
so much dog hair woven into it so huh
probably<00:03:51.310> than<00:03:51.549> that<00:03:51.700> it<00:03:51.910> actually<00:03:52.359> didn't

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
probably than that it actually didn't

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.440 
probably than that it actually didn't
even<00:03:52.780> take<00:03:53.200> a<00:03:53.640> full<00:03:54.640> can<00:03:54.940> and<00:03:55.269> they<00:03:55.359> were

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
even take a full can and they were

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.390 
even take a full can and they were
saying<00:03:55.840> that<00:03:56.079> it<00:03:56.230> would<00:03:56.350> probably<00:03:56.620> take<00:03:56.799> a

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
saying that it would probably take a

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.430 
saying that it would probably take a
truck<00:03:57.820> bed<00:03:58.000> might<00:03:58.239> take<00:03:58.480> one<00:03:58.720> or<00:03:58.870> two<00:03:58.900> I<00:03:59.079> mean

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
truck bed might take one or two I mean

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.470 
truck bed might take one or two I mean
that's<00:03:59.650> that's<00:04:00.250> a<00:04:00.430> pretty<00:04:00.609> big<00:04:00.880> area<00:04:01.120> but<00:04:01.390> it

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
that's that's a pretty big area but it

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.140 
that's that's a pretty big area but it
hasn't<00:04:01.630> even<00:04:01.810> taken<00:04:01.959> a<00:04:02.200> full<00:04:02.380> can<00:04:02.650> yet<00:04:03.000> so<00:04:04.000> when

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
hasn't even taken a full can yet so when

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.759 
hasn't even taken a full can yet so when
the<00:04:04.209> jaqen<00:04:04.600> limited<00:04:05.049> you'll<00:04:05.170> probably<00:04:05.320> be<00:04:05.500> ok

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
the jaqen limited you'll probably be ok

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:35.590 
the jaqen limited you'll probably be ok
with<00:04:06.870> probably<00:04:07.870> one<00:04:07.930> can

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:54.869 

I<00:04:39.190> go<00:04:40.190> in<00:04:40.430> it

real dirty as you can see and then I

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.809 
real dirty as you can see and then I
rinsed<00:05:05.120> it<00:05:05.240> out<00:05:05.800> but<00:05:06.800> I<00:05:06.830> realized<00:05:07.400> if<00:05:07.669> you're

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:07.819 
rinsed it out but I realized if you're

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:11.320 
rinsed it out but I realized if you're
gonna<00:05:08.000> use<00:05:08.240> this<00:05:08.360> truck<00:05:08.659> bedliner<00:05:08.930> and<00:05:10.330> rinse

gonna use this truck bedliner and rinse
out<00:05:11.539> your<00:05:13.090> JK<00:05:14.090> like<00:05:14.360> this<00:05:15.189> definitely

00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:16.189 
out your JK like this definitely

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:18.189

obviously<00:05:16.669> remove<00:05:16.969> the<00:05:17.150> plugs<00:05:17.479> but<00:05:17.840> then<00:05:18.050> you

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 
obviously remove the plugs but then you

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:22.420 
obviously remove the plugs but then you
also<00:05:18.409> need<00:05:18.919> to<00:05:19.039> drill<00:05:19.879> out<00:05:20.150> these<00:05:20.949> cup<00:05:21.949> holders

also need to drill out these cup holders

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.800 
also need to drill out these cup holders
because<00:05:22.580> they<00:05:22.789> get<00:05:22.969> full<00:05:23.150> of<00:05:23.180> water<00:05:23.449> so<00:05:23.719> that's

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
because they get full of water so that's

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.300 
because they get full of water so that's
what<00:05:24.020> I'm<00:05:24.110> gonna<00:05:24.229> do<00:05:24.439> right<00:05:24.620> now<00:05:24.830> but<00:05:25.099> it<00:05:25.219> was
