side fishing it's originally a redfish
fly<00:02:19.640> but<00:02:20.180> I<00:02:20.690> found<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.800> be<00:02:21.830> one<00:02:22.040> of<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:22.220> most

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
fly but I found it to be one of the most

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.540 
fly but I found it to be one of the most
effective<00:02:23.330> for<00:02:23.980> northern<00:02:24.980> pike<00:02:25.070> on<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.400> Rio

they<00:02:37.629> have<00:02:37.840> three<00:02:38.170> major<00:02:38.319> food<00:02:38.680> sources<00:02:39.220> I

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
they have three major food sources I

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.210 
they have three major food sources I
would<00:02:40.060> say<00:02:40.269> the<00:02:40.930> first<00:02:41.170> is<00:02:41.290> crawfish<00:02:41.860> the

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
would say the first is crawfish the

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.860 
would say the first is crawfish the
second<00:02:42.549> would<00:02:42.670> be<00:02:42.700> suckers<00:02:43.239> and<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.569> third

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
second would be suckers and the third

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
to get on the bottom so we can kind of

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.339 
to get on the bottom so we can kind of

Pike on the Rio Grande any time of year

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.750 
Pike on the Rio Grande any time of year
but<00:03:14.170> we<00:03:14.500> definitely<00:03:14.680> like<00:03:15.099> January<00:03:15.400> and

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
but we definitely like January and

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.369 
but we definitely like January and
February<00:03:15.790> because<00:03:16.450> we<00:03:16.629> find<00:03:16.870> them<00:03:16.989> in<00:03:17.049> larger

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
February because we find them in larger

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.539 
February because we find them in larger
concentrations<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:19.950> water<00:03:20.950> seems<00:03:21.250> to<00:03:21.340> be<00:03:21.519> a

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
concentrations and water seems to be a

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.680 
concentrations and water seems to be a
little<00:03:21.819> clearer<00:03:22.769> it's<00:03:23.769> the<00:03:23.950> breeding<00:03:24.159> season

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
little clearer it's the breeding season

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.569 
little clearer it's the breeding season
so<00:03:25.690> that<00:03:25.720> means<00:03:26.709> that<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.129> fish<00:03:27.370> are<00:03:27.489> gonna

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
so that means that the fish are gonna

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.899 
so that means that the fish are gonna
congregate<00:03:28.329> more<00:03:28.629> than<00:03:28.810> they<00:03:28.959> ordinarily<00:03:29.139> do

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909 
congregate more than they ordinarily do

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.699 
congregate more than they ordinarily do
this<00:03:30.909> is<00:03:31.030> an<00:03:31.150> ambush<00:03:31.659> predator<00:03:31.690> so<00:03:32.560> they

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
this is an ambush predator so they

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.390 
this is an ambush predator so they
usually<00:03:33.900> keep<00:03:34.900> to<00:03:34.930> themselves<00:03:35.290> more<00:03:36.099> or<00:03:36.129> less

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
usually keep to themselves more or less

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.089 
usually keep to themselves more or less
and<00:03:36.760> then<00:03:37.109> you<00:03:38.109> know<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:38.319> get<00:03:38.590> this<00:03:38.799> time<00:03:39.069> of

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
and then you know you get this time of

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.770 
and then you know you get this time of
year<00:03:39.519> and<00:03:40.169> fish<00:03:41.169> are<00:03:41.379> more<00:03:41.919> tolerant<00:03:42.760> of<00:03:43.180> each

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
year and fish are more tolerant of each

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.159 
year and fish are more tolerant of each
other's<00:03:44.169> company

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
other's company

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:48.509 
other's company
so<00:03:47.169> we're<00:03:47.319> crossing<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.709> river<00:03:47.949> here<00:03:48.190> at<00:03:48.280> John

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
so we're crossing the river here at John

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.430 
so we're crossing the river here at John
Donne<00:03:48.730> bridge<00:03:49.000> we<00:03:49.299> spent<00:03:49.629> the<00:03:49.780> first<00:03:49.959> part<00:03:50.260> of

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
Donne bridge we spent the first part of

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.379 
Donne bridge we spent the first part of
the<00:03:50.530> morning<00:03:50.680> sight<00:03:51.489> fishing<00:03:51.879> for<00:03:52.060> northern

the morning sight fishing for northern

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:55.289 
the morning sight fishing for northern
pike<00:03:52.419> and<00:03:52.989> we<00:03:53.829> were<00:03:53.889> pretty<00:03:54.160> successful<00:03:54.340> so

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
pike and we were pretty successful so

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.059
