when we're in performance weeks it's a

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.030 
when we're in performance weeks it's a
bit<00:01:43.730> different<00:01:43.910> from<00:01:44.240> that<00:01:44.390> we<00:01:44.710> get<00:01:45.710> up<00:01:45.860> a

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
bit different from that we get up a

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.850 
bit different from that we get up a
little<00:01:46.280> later<00:01:46.690> we<00:01:47.690> have<00:01:47.810> more<00:01:48.020> of<00:01:48.050> a<00:01:48.200> nocturnal

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860
