more<00:00:47.610> about<00:00:47.670> later<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.510> has<00:00:48.770> 728<00:00:49.770> high<00:00:50.579> quality

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000

more about later it has 728 high quality
video<00:00:52.309> dubious<00:00:53.309> on<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.820> but<00:00:54.120> I'll<00:00:54.360> say<00:00:54.570> this

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
video dubious on that but I'll say this

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.860 
video dubious on that but I'll say this
is<00:00:54.960> it's<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.320> good<00:00:55.469> good<00:00:56.219> quality<00:00:57.149> relative<00:00:57.629> to

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
is it's a good good quality relative to

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.040 
is it's a good good quality relative to
the<00:00:58.020> other<00:00:58.170> IP<00:00:58.770> cameras<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.579> I've<00:00:59.699> seen<00:01:00.050> so

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
the other IP cameras that I've seen so

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.290 
the other IP cameras that I've seen so
just<00:01:01.289> quick<00:01:01.680> shot<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.129> box<00:01:02.399> talks<00:01:03.059> about

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
just quick shot of the box talks about

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.149 
just quick shot of the box talks about
their<00:01:03.449> iPad<00:01:03.809> apps<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.559> all<00:01:04.650> those<00:01:04.799> different

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
their iPad apps and all those different

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
quality during the day but I would say

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.720 
quality during the day but I would say
them<00:04:03.330> it's<00:04:03.510> quality<00:04:03.900> better<00:04:04.140> at<00:04:04.350> night<00:04:06.080> the

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
them it's quality better at night the

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
complaining about the setup I didn't

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260 
complaining about the setup I didn't
have<00:04:16.380> any<00:04:16.530> issues<00:04:16.680> at<00:04:17.100> all<00:04:17.190> I<00:04:17.250> find<00:04:17.970> it<00:04:18.150> that

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
have any issues at all I find it that

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.770 
have any issues at all I find it that

better than other cameras that I have

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.270 
better than other cameras that I have
and<00:04:36.300> what<00:04:36.450> I<00:04:36.480> mean<00:04:36.720> by<00:04:36.900> that<00:04:36.930> is<00:04:37.320> most<00:04:37.590> motion

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
and what I mean by that is most motion

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.130 
and what I mean by that is most motion
sensing<00:04:38.820> itself<00:04:39.330> has<00:04:39.600> a<00:04:39.630> hard<00:04:39.960> time

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140

distinguishing between something that

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.220 
distinguishing between something that
you<00:04:42.780> want<00:04:43.050> to<00:04:43.140> capture<00:04:43.410> a<00:04:43.680> positive<00:04:44.340> reporting

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.320 
you want to capture a positive reporting

activity this you know one frame picture
and<00:05:04.650> there's<00:05:04.919> a<00:05:04.979> lot<00:05:05.130> of<00:05:05.250> activity<00:05:05.790> and

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
and there's a lot of activity and

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.330 
and there's a lot of activity and
it<00:05:07.039> changes<00:05:07.520> between<00:05:07.669> frames<00:05:08.270> and<00:05:09.340> the

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
it changes between frames and the

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.429 
it changes between frames and the
distance<00:05:10.759> is<00:05:10.909> going<00:05:11.060> to<00:05:11.180> change<00:05:11.389> so<00:05:11.659> if<00:05:12.050> any<00:05:12.289> on

00:05:12.429 --> 00:05:12.439 
distance is going to change so if any on

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:14.950 
distance is going to change so if any on
your<00:05:12.650> motion<00:05:12.860> sensing<00:05:13.490> setting<00:05:13.849> a<00:05:13.939> level<00:05:14.300> it

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
your motion sensing setting a level it

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.269 
your motion sensing setting a level it
could<00:05:15.319> trigger<00:05:15.710> it<00:05:15.860> to<00:05:16.099> record<00:05:17.770> and<00:05:18.770> then<00:05:18.800> see

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:19.279 
could trigger it to record and then see

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:21.159 
could trigger it to record and then see
like<00:05:19.520> if<00:05:19.669> this<00:05:19.759> didn't<00:05:20.270> really<00:05:20.300> happen<00:05:20.659> except

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
like if this didn't really happen except

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.969 
like if this didn't really happen except
the<00:05:21.349> winds<00:05:21.529> blowing<00:05:21.860> and<00:05:23.349> so<00:05:24.349> again<00:05:24.560> this

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
the winds blowing and so again this

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:26.800 
the winds blowing and so again this
camera<00:05:25.340> doesn't<00:05:25.520> necessarily<00:05:26.150> do<00:05:26.330> any<00:05:26.479> better

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
camera doesn't necessarily do any better

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.200 
camera doesn't necessarily do any better
or<00:05:27.319> worse<00:05:27.650> than<00:05:28.039> other<00:05:28.310> cameras<00:05:28.789> I've<00:05:28.969> had

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
or worse than other cameras I've had

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.739 
or worse than other cameras I've had
such<00:05:29.659> as<00:05:29.840> the<00:05:29.960> trend<00:05:30.229> that's<00:05:31.569> you<00:05:32.569> can

00:05:32.739 --> 00:05:32.749 
such as the trend that's you can

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:36.600 
such as the trend that's you can
certainly<00:05:33.199> reduce<00:05:33.740> your<00:05:34.159> motion<00:05:34.659> sensing

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
certainly reduce your motion sensing

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.029 
certainly reduce your motion sensing
detection<00:05:37.610> sensitivity<00:05:38.500> but<00:05:39.500> then<00:05:39.710> when<00:05:39.919> you

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
detection sensitivity but then when you

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.159 
detection sensitivity but then when you
do<00:05:40.189> that<00:05:40.460> I<00:05:40.789> mean<00:05:41.000> this<00:05:41.120> is<00:05:41.300> a<00:05:41.599> fine<00:05:41.900> balance

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
do that I mean this is a fine balance

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:43.899 
do that I mean this is a fine balance
when<00:05:42.590> you<00:05:42.710> do<00:05:42.949> that<00:05:43.189> you're<00:05:43.430> going<00:05:43.550> to<00:05:43.610> miss

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:43.909 
when you do that you're going to miss

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:47.070 
when you do that you're going to miss
the<00:05:44.300> important<00:05:44.870> things<00:05:45.199> that<00:05:45.439> you<00:05:46.219> may<00:05:46.370> want

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
the important things that you may want

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.240 
the important things that you may want
so<00:05:48.080> just<00:05:48.439> a<00:05:48.740> quick<00:05:49.009> example<00:05:49.449> here<00:05:50.979> during<00:05:51.979> the

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
so just a quick example here during the

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.700 
so just a quick example here during the
day<00:05:53.680> it's<00:05:54.680> an<00:05:54.889> OK<00:05:55.460> camera<00:05:56.150> I<00:05:56.180> wish<00:05:57.050> that<00:05:57.439> they

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
day it's an OK camera I wish that they

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.329 
day it's an OK camera I wish that they
these<00:05:58.610> IP<00:05:59.509> cameras<00:06:00.139> in<00:06:00.259> general<00:06:00.620> had<00:06:00.830> a<00:06:01.009> little

00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:01.339 
these IP cameras in general had a little

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:04.629 
these IP cameras in general had a little
bit<00:06:01.520> better<00:06:01.550> image<00:06:02.120> quality<00:06:03.580> there's<00:06:04.580> a

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
bit better image quality there's a

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.890 
bit better image quality there's a
nighttime<00:06:05.180> example<00:06:05.870> it<00:06:07.360> you<00:06:08.360> can<00:06:08.509> tell<00:06:08.719> from

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
nighttime example it you can tell from

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.040 
nighttime example it you can tell from
all<00:06:09.050> the<00:06:09.229> graininess<00:06:10.509> that<00:06:11.509> it's<00:06:11.750> hard<00:06:11.960> to

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
all the graininess that it's hard to

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:21.460 
all the graininess that it's hard to
detect<00:06:12.439> image<00:06:13.389> images

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.530
