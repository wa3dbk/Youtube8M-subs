00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.230
 Hi, I'm the architect Manuel del Rivero 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:15.800
 of study 51 1 and dean of the school 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:18.320
 architecture educate architecture in 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.340
 general in the world is in a moment 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.609
 very interesting has passed a period 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.189
 of euphoria where he has approved all kinds 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.380
 of materials all kinds of ideas to a 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.680
 moment of crisis in which the 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.930
 budgets were cut that already 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.980
 start to be vulgar and spend 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:43.250
 too much energy money or resources in 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.020
 a building in peru the situation has 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.059
 been like upside down when everyone 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.640
 I was in a crisis and we have 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.770
 been in a boom in the last 10 years 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.410
 it has been built almost everywhere 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.690
 no time to think and architecture 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.660
 in Peru perhaps it reaches a state of 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.699
 maturity in which we already know what the 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.000
 problems that knows everything we have 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.830
 for doing how to make us turn to 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.410
 love our city how can we 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.780
 do for what it is to live in cities like 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.630
 Lima as Arequipa as Cusco 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:20.000
 of a pleasure and I can not imagine a moment 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:22.570
 clearer to start rethinking how 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.790
 make architecture 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.360
 the teaching of architecture in the 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.490
 Peru has several decades and the 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.170
 problem that has always been there is that the 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.020
 school of architecture has entered 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.930
 universities that have letters or 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.450
 sciences or arts architecture is a 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.150
 discipline that is right in the 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.840
 intersection of those three then each 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:49.090
 new attempt to and update the 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.860
 architect's training has been like 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.560
 when you have on your phone a 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.399
 operating system that helium comes out that 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:01.149
 7 and from there comes the version with the patch 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:03.009
 7.1 from point 2 point 3 and it is the 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.720
 no time to put a patch over port 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:11.240
 but a kind of clean start 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:15.890
 design handles and rails floors 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:18.660
 buildings squares neighborhoods cities 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.220
 regions to the no planet 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.980
 the architecture is imagine 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.160
 generously the future already we passed the 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.190
 crisis and then also the boom are left 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.820
 now great challenges where there are not only 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.520
 than building buildings and cities but 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.610
 above all citizenship the world change 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.670
 so much that it's time to rethink everything, it's not 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.190
 a revolution is not an evolution in the 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.220
 architecture we can just focus 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.130
 clearly what is relevant not 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:54.120
 to make a spectacular architecture 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:56.550
 but strategic smart there was never 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.040
 so many opportunities to innovate 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.700
 and it was never more necessary as it is 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.260
 now and that's what we're going to do in 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.260
 the school of local architecture
