00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.970
 and 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.410
 hello and welcome to video standby 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.180
 for this new podcast 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.890
 we will continue our series on 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.660
 hygiene and maintenance of the animal 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.670
 we had last seen the 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.350
 brushing dogs and cats and we 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.000
 let's talk today about the big bath 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.980
 question that the down should wash his 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.489
 dog must he go his cat we are going 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.320
 try to know a little more of potÃ© 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.090
 wash your dog yes if your vet 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.430
 has prescribed treatment in form 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.290
 of shampoo and yes if the hair of your 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.440
 animal is soiled by dust 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.360
 dirt mud however it does not 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.820
 do not abuse the shampoo because 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.290
 the action of water has the effect of removing 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.630
 the layer of sebum that is a layer 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.940
 protective coat and skin of 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.100
 the animal against the temptation of the environment 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.860
 outside parasites mushrooms etc 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.360
 the frequency of washing a dog for 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.160
 a dog for the short and in general of 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.080
 two to three times a year and it can be 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.610
 every two to three months for a dog 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.060
 long hair that is more likely to 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.530
 smear 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.590
 so now let's see in 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.509
 practice how she had her dog 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.020
 so we're lucky it's nice we have 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.060
 a garden 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.710
 so the best way to wash your dog is 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.510
 the earth in the garden next if you 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.680
 like a little dog a bowl to 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.070
 inside the house or in the 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.930
 bath 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.890
 it is quite possible it will be necessary 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.900
 provide them with a quarter slip mat 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.530
 the dog slips with season in the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.310
 bathtub and that can scare her then 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.050
 material point of view 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.150
 you will take a commercial shampoo 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.550
 special dog or cat attention does not 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.650
 do not take a shampoo for humans in 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.180
 effect we do not have the same toll of 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.070
 pau that animals and at that time 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.300
 take a suitable shampoo to go 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.570
 create lesions on the skin of your 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.940
 animal like soft shampoo for 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.950
 baby will not agree then he 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.979
 dry shampoo that requires 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.959
 no water they are rather to avoid because 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.600
 in fact there is no mechanical action 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.860
 of water to remove the dirt and they 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.630
 ultimately result in more than one 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.370
 plating bonding of all the hairs so 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.570
 better to avoid them it's really not 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.459
 good and then a last small remark 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:30.060
 plan a suitable outfit because it happens 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:31.709
 that we wet first step onu 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.730
 mini fitou the coat of the animal with 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.410
 the water of your judo 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.180
 if you are inside take a 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.989
 warm water about 35 degrees 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.989
 in the east nothing 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.840
 elsewhere 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.159
 at least on track 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.689
 we do not forget below 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.680
 the dog must be wet everywhere 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.420
 apply the shampoo evenly 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.200
 unseen obviously the eyes and 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.200
 inside the ears 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.170
 and we subscribe 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.170
 next point 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.920
 we 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.710
 a little bit of shampoo 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.280
 I know well 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.870
 this is ryan covered with moss not the 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.099
 hardly let it sit for three 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.959
 hours we can go directly to a 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.959
 wise pretty good everywhere 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.530
 for rinsing we start with 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.569
 the back and we go back in 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.739
 ending with the head because as soon as the 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.349
 dog in the water on the head 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:26.580
 the reflex of these balls is better 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:30.590
 finish than that we not forget 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.590
 restart the packs below 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.229
