not a hipster update before was actually

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.520 
not a hipster update before was actually
released<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.780> they<00:01:18.840> didn't<00:01:19.110> want<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.320> run<00:01:19.439> the

actually released so maybe they just

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.499 
actually released so maybe they just
didn't<00:01:23.549> want<00:01:23.670> put<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.880> whole<00:01:23.970> description<00:01:24.210> in

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
believe that because it's a pack it's

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.960 
believe that because it's a pack it's
something<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.920> maybe<00:01:47.100> for<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.520> limited<00:01:47.700> time

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
something that maybe for a limited time

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.300 
something that maybe for a limited time
whereas<00:01:48.509> like<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.020> high<00:01:49.140> life<00:01:49.380> update<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
update those are updates this is merely

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.389 
update those are updates this is merely
a<00:01:54.240> pack<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.500> because<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.860> maybe<00:01:56.159> we're<00:01:56.310> to

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
a pack so because of that maybe we're to

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.880 
a pack so because of that maybe we're to
have<00:01:56.490> limited<00:01:57.119> times<00:01:57.630> items<00:01:58.200> we<00:01:58.290> can<00:01:58.469> get<00:01:58.649> just

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
sure but that's just the conclusion that

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.040 
sure but that's just the conclusion that
i<00:02:11.310> came<00:02:11.610> up<00:02:11.760> with<00:02:11.879> because<00:02:12.060> it's<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.569> pack

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
i came up with because it's a pack

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.480 
i came up with because it's a pack
it's<00:02:13.170> not<00:02:13.290> update<00:02:13.800> like<00:02:13.950> we've<00:02:14.100> seen<00:02:14.310> recently

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.730 
it's not update like we've seen recently
usually<00:02:15.300> updates<00:02:15.720> have<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.960> lot<00:02:16.230> more<00:02:16.410> things

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
usually updates have a lot more things

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.160 
usually updates have a lot more things
and<00:02:16.950> packs<00:02:17.280> we've<00:02:17.610> seen<00:02:17.880> really<00:02:18.840> have<00:02:18.960> with

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
and packs we've seen really have with

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.450 
and packs we've seen really have with
just<00:02:19.320> small<00:02:19.620> things<00:02:19.860> it's<00:02:20.130> for<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.340> limited

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
just small things it's for a limited

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.190 
just small things it's for a limited
time<00:02:20.730> I'm<00:02:21.180> really<00:02:21.390> excited<00:02:21.600> for<00:02:21.780> this<00:02:21.930> now

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
time I'm really excited for this now

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.900 
time I'm really excited for this now
somebody<00:02:22.560> brought<00:02:22.830> up<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.070> whole<00:02:23.130> idea<00:02:23.400> well

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
somebody brought up the whole idea well

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.910 
somebody brought up the whole idea well
it<00:02:24.480> makes<00:02:24.600> no<00:02:24.810> sense<00:02:24.840> for<00:02:25.080> them<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.290> release<00:02:25.530> a

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
it makes no sense for them to release a

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.920 
it makes no sense for them to release a
DLC<00:02:26.670> pack<00:02:26.910> for<00:02:27.180> independence<00:02:27.570> day<00:02:27.690> because

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
religions not only that the game is

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.250 
religions not only that the game is
based<00:02:41.220> in<00:02:41.430> Los<00:02:41.730> Angeles<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.630> if<00:02:42.870> there's<00:02:43.050> one

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
based in Los Angeles and if there's one

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.780 
based in Los Angeles and if there's one
place<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:43.590> celebrates<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.160> fourth<00:02:44.460> of<00:02:44.520> July

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
place that celebrates the fourth of July

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.300 
place that celebrates the fourth of July
it's<00:02:45.150> definitely<00:02:45.450> LA<00:02:46.170> so<00:02:46.830> you<00:02:46.980> get<00:02:47.100> remember

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
it's definitely LA so you get remember

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.620 
it's definitely LA so you get remember
that<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.580> game<00:02:47.700> takes<00:02:47.940> place<00:02:48.000> in<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.330> United

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
that the game takes place in the United

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.030 
that the game takes place in the United
States<00:02:48.690> so<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.230> kind<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.470> makes<00:02:49.650> sense<00:02:49.830> for

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
States so it kind of makes sense for

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.680 
States so it kind of makes sense for
them<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.190> actually<00:02:50.400> have<00:02:50.760> this<00:02:50.910> and<00:02:51.120> last<00:02:51.510> but

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
them to actually have this and last but

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.240 
them to actually have this and last but
not<00:02:51.870> least<00:02:51.930> I<00:02:52.350> think<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.590> only<00:02:52.830> makes<00:02:52.980> sense

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
not least I think it only makes sense

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.770 
not least I think it only makes sense
for<00:02:53.580> them<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.760> actually<00:02:54.030> have<00:02:54.330> fireworks

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
for them to actually have fireworks

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.420 
for them to actually have fireworks
going<00:02:55.140> on<00:02:55.260> all<00:02:55.530> throughout<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.070> day<00:02:56.250> or<00:02:56.400> the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
going on all throughout the day or the

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.070 
going on all throughout the day or the
couple<00:02:56.760> days<00:02:56.910> at<00:02:57.060> this<00:02:57.180> whole<00:02:57.390> independence

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
couple days at this whole independence

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.740 
couple days at this whole independence
