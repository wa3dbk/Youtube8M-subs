in it but I use the heavy cream in the
recipe<00:01:00.840> before<00:01:01.199> then<00:01:01.980> I'm<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:02.250> making

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
recipe before then I'm just making

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.969 
recipe before then I'm just making
buttermilk<00:01:02.879> here<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.500> butter<00:01:04.680> melt

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
buttermilk here and so the butter melt

buttermilk here and so the butter melt
if<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.460> already<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:05.970> buttermilk<00:01:06.270> I'm<00:01:06.510> just

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
if you already have buttermilk I'm just

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.649 
if you already have buttermilk I'm just
adding<00:01:06.900> some<00:01:07.229> vanilla<00:01:08.040> extract<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:09.240> giving

her<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> stir<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.790> then<00:01:11.790> we<00:01:12.600> are<00:01:12.750> just<00:01:12.780> going<00:01:12.990> to

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
her a stir and then we are just going to

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.789 
her a stir and then we are just going to
make<00:01:13.290> sure<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.439> it's<00:01:13.619> nice<00:01:13.740> and

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
make sure that it's nice and

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:14.630 
make sure that it's nice and
incorporated

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
incorporated

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.940 
incorporated
before<00:01:15.299> we<00:01:15.450> set<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:16.290> tin<00:01:16.890> aside<00:01:18.650> now<00:01:19.650> we're

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
before we set that tin aside now we're

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.460 
before we set that tin aside now we're
going<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.340> measure<00:01:20.670> out<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.270> flour<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:24.540> flour

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
going to measure out a flour the flour

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.740 
going to measure out a flour the flour
if<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.369> don't<00:01:26.640> have<00:01:26.850> self<00:01:27.090> raising<00:01:27.210> flour<00:01:27.420> you

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
if you don't have self raising flour you

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.800 
if you don't have self raising flour you
can<00:01:27.900> just<00:01:28.080> use<00:01:28.460> baking<00:01:29.460> powder<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.479> plain

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
can just use baking powder and plain

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.140 
can just use baking powder and plain
flour<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.460> will<00:01:32.460> still<00:01:32.700> have<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.970> same

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
flour it will still have the same

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.969 
flour it will still have the same
texture<00:01:33.540> but<00:01:34.170> you're<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.470> going<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.710> need<00:01:34.950> to

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
texture but you're just going to need to

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.410 
texture but you're just going to need to
use<00:01:35.189> more<00:01:35.850> baking<00:01:36.299> powder<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.750> make<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.020> rise

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
use more baking powder to make it rise

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.030 
use more baking powder to make it rise
so<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.780> know<00:01:39.900> I'm<00:01:40.020> just<00:01:40.200> transferring<00:01:40.470> my

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
so you know I'm just transferring my

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.120 
so you know I'm just transferring my
flour<00:01:41.280> from<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.640> jug<00:01:42.000> into<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:43.619> large<00:01:43.829> bowl

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
flour from the jug into the large bowl

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.830 
flour from the jug into the large bowl
and<00:01:45.649> to<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.799> large<00:01:47.009> bowl<00:01:47.220> I'm<00:01:47.399> adding

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
and to that large bowl I'm adding

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.200 
and to that large bowl I'm adding
bicarbonate<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:49.110> soda<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.130> will<00:01:51.030> just

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
bicarbonate of soda and that will just

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.050 
bicarbonate of soda and that will just
be<00:01:51.390> more<00:01:52.290> help<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.920> make<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.340> rise<00:01:53.549> bit<00:01:53.880> more

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
be more help to make it rise bit more

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.290 
be more help to make it rise bit more
and<00:01:54.270> I'm<00:01:54.990> just<00:01:55.020> adding<00:01:55.380> one<00:01:56.100> tea

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.200 

so<00:02:01.190> once<00:02:02.190> you've<00:02:02.700> added<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.780> your<00:02:04.470> bicarb<00:02:05.010> soda

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
so once you've added in your bicarb soda

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.450 
so once you've added in your bicarb soda
then<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.510> want<00:02:06.690> to<00:02:06.900> measure<00:02:07.740> out<00:02:07.920> your<00:02:08.040> sugar

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
then you want to measure out your sugar

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.290 
then you want to measure out your sugar
and<00:02:08.840> I<00:02:09.840> found<00:02:10.440> this<00:02:10.649> like<00:02:10.860> massive<00:02:11.400> circle

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
and I found this like massive circle

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.920 
and I found this like massive circle
like<00:02:12.800> thing<00:02:13.800> of<00:02:14.100> sugar<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:15.540> just<00:02:15.720> want<00:02:15.900> to

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
like thing of sugar and you just want to

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.410 
like thing of sugar and you just want to
break<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.260> up<00:02:16.380> it's<00:02:16.830> like<00:02:17.250> not<00:02:17.580> need<00:02:17.790> not
