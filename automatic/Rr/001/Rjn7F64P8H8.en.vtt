00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.600
 little butter a little trickle of oil so that spa was starting 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.600

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:14.889
 we've been a bit of a colorectal cancer sample 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:19.759

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.289
 to be just a little bit colorful the seven 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:29.319

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.319
 so is the iced with the pink everton club 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:40.689
 for the rosÃ© flock babou color slightly with the sauce not give you 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:44.709
 this little piece of red fruit that is very very nice with the 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.709
 meat power added a little white wine 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.169
 and we will leave tp it's a little bit of sauce 

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:55.629
 we are a little bit like Greece 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.309
 liver or mountain campaign during slice holidays like that 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:03.409
 the two cases we will put the tournedos of the ofen with the liver in may a little bit 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:04.899
 of Espelette pepper 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:06.669
 to flavor the sauce 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:09.429

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:10.909
 a piece 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:13.909

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:17.439
 take some 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:20.439

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.959
 for all third countries the sauce 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.109
 give a little taste 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.109
 to lower the heat a little and then let it simmer 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.159

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.069

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:52.189
 tons of water 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.489
