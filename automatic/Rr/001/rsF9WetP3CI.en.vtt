00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.900 

so<00:00:04.020> if<00:00:04.350> we<00:00:04.380> wanted<00:00:04.770> to<00:00:04.830> add<00:00:04.920> that<00:00:05.460> little<00:00:05.670> bit

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
so if we wanted to add that little bit

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.120 
so if we wanted to add that little bit
more<00:00:05.940> interest<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:06.870> this<00:00:07.290> little<00:00:07.529> sound<00:00:07.890> we've

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
more interest to this little sound we've

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.070 
more interest to this little sound we've
got<00:00:08.309> happening<00:00:08.760> we<00:00:09.330> can<00:00:09.510> use<00:00:09.540> one<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:09.929> our

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
got happening we can use one of our

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.499 
got happening we can use one of our
modifiers<00:00:10.620> we<00:00:11.490> might<00:00:11.670> actually<00:00:11.820> go<00:00:12.210> for<00:00:12.420> an

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
modifiers we might actually go for an

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.220 
modifiers we might actually go for an
LFO<00:00:13.130> just<00:00:14.130> check<00:00:14.340> that<00:00:14.490> one<00:00:14.670> in<00:00:14.790> there<00:00:15.230> and

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
LFO just check that one in there and

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.560 
LFO just check that one in there and
what<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.470> allows<00:00:16.529> us<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:17.190> do<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.670> put<00:00:18.420> an

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
what this allows us to do is to put an

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.320 
what this allows us to do is to put an
LFO<00:00:19.080> on<00:00:19.439> one<00:00:19.830> or<00:00:19.920> more<00:00:20.039> different<00:00:20.310> controls<00:00:20.910> of

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
LFO on one or more different controls of

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.750 
LFO on one or more different controls of
the<00:00:21.689> other<00:00:21.840> modules<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.310> we<00:00:23.369> can<00:00:23.519> get<00:00:23.699> a

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
the other modules so that we can get a

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.500 
the other modules so that we can get a
bit<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.090> movement<00:00:24.359> or<00:00:25.230> automation<00:00:26.130> in<00:00:26.250> there

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
bit of movement or automation in there

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.300 
bit of movement or automation in there
so<00:00:27.510> what<00:00:27.960> we'll<00:00:28.080> do<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.260> we'll<00:00:28.650> just<00:00:28.859> grab<00:00:28.949> hold

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
so what we'll do is we'll just grab hold

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.730 
so what we'll do is we'll just grab hold
of<00:00:29.429> Al<00:00:29.640> assign<00:00:30.210> button<00:00:30.449> we're<00:00:31.439> going<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.590> put

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
of Al assign button we're going to put

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.639 
of Al assign button we're going to put
that<00:00:31.890> one<00:00:32.040> on<00:00:32.070> our<00:00:32.279> cross<00:00:32.550> fader<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.649> we'll

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
that one on our cross fader and we'll

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:44.600 
that one on our cross fader and we'll
see<00:00:34.829> how<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.040> sounds<00:00:35.670> as<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:35.969> is

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.970 

to<00:00:45.610> adjust<00:00:45.910> how<00:00:46.840> much<00:00:47.080> it's<00:00:47.350> affecting<00:00:47.500> a

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
to adjust how much it's affecting a

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.770 
to adjust how much it's affecting a
crossfade<00:00:48.520> we<00:00:48.910> can<00:00:49.060> open<00:00:49.240> up<00:00:49.450> our<00:00:49.600> little

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
crossfade we can open up our little

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.310 
crossfade we can open up our little
targets<00:00:50.350> box<00:00:50.620> and<00:00:51.150> we<00:00:52.150> can<00:00:52.330> either<00:00:53.050> adjust

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
targets box and we can either adjust

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.370 
targets box and we can either adjust
either<00:00:54.130> a<00:00:54.250> positive<00:00:54.550> or<00:00:54.850> a<00:00:55.120> negative<00:00:55.380> level

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
either a positive or a negative level

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.800 
either a positive or a negative level
layer<00:00:56.730> depending<00:00:57.730> on<00:00:57.730> how<00:00:58.240> you<00:00:58.300> want<00:00:58.450> it<00:00:58.660> to

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.810 
layer depending on how you want it to

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.870 
layer depending on how you want it to
work<00:00:58.960> so<00:00:59.320> we<00:00:59.440> might<00:00:59.620> go<00:00:59.800> for<00:00:59.950> something<00:01:00.190> just<00:01:00.760> a

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
work so we might go for something just a

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.630 
work so we might go for something just a
little<00:01:00.910> bit<00:01:01.270> more<00:01:01.420> subtle<00:01:01.720> and<00:01:02.340> see<00:01:03.340> how<00:01:03.489> that

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
little bit more subtle and see how that

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:13.130 
little bit more subtle and see how that
one<00:01:03.790> sounds

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.899 

so<00:01:14.140> as<00:01:14.560> you<00:01:14.830> can<00:01:14.920> hear<00:01:15.130> just<00:01:15.400> adding<00:01:15.760> that

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
so as you can hear just adding that

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.170 
so as you can hear just adding that
extra<00:01:16.060> bit<00:01:16.479> of<00:01:16.540> movement<00:01:16.840> between<00:01:17.229> the<00:01:17.470> sounds

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
extra bit of movement between the sounds

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.660 
extra bit of movement between the sounds
we've<00:01:19.180> also<00:01:19.420> got<00:01:19.780> some<00:01:20.440> various<00:01:21.280> different

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
we've also got some various different

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.960 
we've also got some various different
presets<00:01:22.150> available<00:01:22.270> as<00:01:23.490> well<00:01:24.490> as<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:24.880> ability

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
presets available as well as the ability

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.070 
presets available as well as the ability
to<00:01:25.509> adjust<00:01:25.810> our<00:01:26.350> rate<00:01:26.890> of<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.250> LFO<00:01:28.080> we've

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
to adjust our rate of the LFO we've

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.350 
to adjust our rate of the LFO we've
currently<00:01:29.380> got<00:01:29.560> it<00:01:29.800> set<00:01:30.009> up<00:01:30.130> to<00:01:30.159> be<00:01:30.640> synced<00:01:31.210> to

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
currently got it set up to be synced to

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.080 
currently got it set up to be synced to
the<00:01:31.390> tempo<00:01:31.930> of<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.500> host<00:01:32.770> so<00:01:33.700> that<00:01:33.850> it<00:01:33.940> matches

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
the tempo of the host so that it matches

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.139 
the tempo of the host so that it matches
the<00:01:34.390> tempo<00:01:34.750> of<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.380> guitars<00:01:35.740> now<00:01:36.310> if<00:01:36.700> we<00:01:36.940> turn

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
the tempo of the guitars now if we turn

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.300 
the tempo of the guitars now if we turn
that<00:01:37.299> one<00:01:37.479> off<00:01:37.600> we<00:01:38.440> can<00:01:38.649> adjust<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.130> rate

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
that one off we can adjust the rate

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.160 
that one off we can adjust the rate
control<00:01:39.729> independently<00:01:40.509> which<00:01:40.780> is<00:01:40.930> quite

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
control independently which is quite

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.920 
control independently which is quite
handy<00:01:41.759> you've<00:01:42.759> also<00:01:42.940> got<00:01:43.270> a<00:01:43.479> pile<00:01:43.899> of

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
handy you've also got a pile of

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.840 
handy you've also got a pile of
different<00:01:44.409> waveforms<00:01:44.590> which<00:01:45.250> you<00:01:45.369> can<00:01:45.490> select

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
different waveforms which you can select

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.150 
different waveforms which you can select
between<00:01:46.289> so<00:01:47.289> you<00:01:47.350> can<00:01:47.500> get<00:01:47.619> all<00:01:47.679> sorts<00:01:47.979> of

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
between so you can get all sorts of

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:59.510 
between so you can get all sorts of
different<00:01:48.220> sounds<00:01:48.670> happening

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.340 

you<00:02:00.520> can<00:02:00.640> also<00:02:00.760> adjust<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.360> start<00:02:01.720> phase<00:02:02.020> of

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
you can also adjust the start phase of

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.130 
you can also adjust the start phase of
the<00:02:02.680> waveform<00:02:02.920> which<00:02:03.820> is<00:02:04.030> quite<00:02:04.240> handy<00:02:04.300> or

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
the waveform which is quite handy or

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.380 
the waveform which is quite handy or
invert<00:02:05.650> its<00:02:05.860> polarity<00:02:06.250> by<00:02:06.909> clicking<00:02:07.150> the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
invert its polarity by clicking the

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.310 
invert its polarity by clicking the
polarity<00:02:07.810> button<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.729> as<00:02:10.060> we<00:02:10.240> can<00:02:10.330> see<00:02:10.390> getting

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
polarity button so as we can see getting

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.370 
polarity button so as we can see getting
a<00:02:11.590> fairly<00:02:11.980> complex<00:02:12.370> sound<00:02:12.790> quite<00:02:13.330> easily<00:02:13.540> just

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
a fairly complex sound quite easily just

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.930 
a fairly complex sound quite easily just
using<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.740> few<00:02:14.980> different<00:02:15.070> components<00:02:15.820> of
