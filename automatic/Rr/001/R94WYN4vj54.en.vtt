00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
in the seam between the two ceilings and

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.260 
in the seam between the two ceilings and
I<00:02:19.000> basically<00:02:19.270> I<00:02:20.130> took<00:02:21.130> a<00:02:21.160> piece<00:02:21.730> and<00:02:21.970> put<00:02:22.240> it

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
I basically I took a piece and put it

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.330 
I basically I took a piece and put it
through<00:02:22.510> my<00:02:22.630> table<00:02:23.020> saw<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.440> cut<00:02:23.620> it<00:02:23.770> down<00:02:23.920> to

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
through my table saw I cut it down to

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.280 
through my table saw I cut it down to
get<00:02:25.030> off<00:02:25.210> to<00:02:25.510> get<00:02:25.630> rid<00:02:25.780> of<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.930> tongue<00:02:26.110> in<00:02:26.230> the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
get off to get rid of the tongue in the

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.670 
get off to get rid of the tongue in the
groove<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:26.800> then<00:02:27.070> I<00:02:27.130> cut<00:02:27.730> it<00:02:27.760> at<00:02:27.940> 18<00:02:28.330> degrees

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
groove and then I cut it at 18 degrees

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.130 
groove and then I cut it at 18 degrees
which<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.790> saw<00:02:31.090> will<00:02:31.450> only<00:02:31.570> tip<00:02:31.810> it's<00:02:31.959> played

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
which the saw will only tip it's played

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.940 
which the saw will only tip it's played
45<00:02:32.709> so<00:02:33.190> you<00:02:34.060> have<00:02:34.239> to<00:02:34.330> do<00:02:34.450> at<00:02:34.570> 18<00:02:34.930> and<00:02:35.230> bring<00:02:35.830> the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
45 so you have to do at 18 and bring the

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.030 
45 so you have to do at 18 and bring the
board<00:02:36.130> through<00:02:36.430> vertically<00:02:37.180> which<00:02:37.680> is<00:02:38.680> just

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
board through vertically which is just

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.310 
board through vertically which is just
kind<00:02:39.220> of<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.459> mess<00:02:39.700> because<00:02:40.270> that<00:02:41.200> you're

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
kind of a mess because that you're

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.020 
kind of a mess because that you're
trying<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.620> do<00:02:41.770> is<00:02:41.920> you're<00:02:42.070> trying<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.370> cut<00:02:42.610> the

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
trying to do is you're trying to cut the

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.630 
trying to do is you're trying to cut the
board<00:02:43.330> off<00:02:43.570> like<00:02:43.840> this<00:02:44.110> but<00:02:44.170> your<00:02:44.890> bottom<00:02:45.370> edge

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
board off like this but your bottom edge

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.500 
board off like this but your bottom edge
kind<00:02:46.239> of<00:02:46.420> runs<00:02:47.290> out<00:02:47.500> of<00:02:47.650> stuff<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:47.920> sit<00:02:48.880> on<00:02:48.910> so

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
kind of runs out of stuff to sit on so

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.350 
kind of runs out of stuff to sit on so
you<00:02:50.290> have<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.620> leave<00:02:50.800> a<00:02:50.830> little<00:02:50.950> bit<00:02:51.370> of<00:02:52.150> an

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
you have to leave a little bit of an

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.500 
you have to leave a little bit of an
edge<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:52.750> once<00:02:52.959> I<00:02:53.110> did<00:02:53.320> that<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:54.730> set<00:02:55.209> it<00:02:55.300> down<00:02:55.330> I

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
edge so once I did that I set it down I

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.199 
edge so once I did that I set it down I
used<00:02:55.870> my<00:02:56.110> block<00:02:56.470> plane<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:57.160> I<00:02:57.220> just<00:02:57.250> planed<00:02:57.880> a

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
used my block plane and I just planed a

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.740 
used my block plane and I just planed a
micro<00:02:58.630> bevel<00:02:58.840> on<00:02:59.170> either<00:02:59.920> side<00:03:00.459> so<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:01.420> it's

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
micro bevel on either side so that it's

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.880 
micro bevel on either side so that it's
not<00:03:01.959> sharp<00:03:03.930> because<00:03:04.930> people<00:03:05.380> are<00:03:05.470> gonna<00:03:05.530> be<00:03:05.769> up

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
not sharp because people are gonna be up

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.580 
not sharp because people are gonna be up
here<00:03:06.160> and<00:03:06.400> touching<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.120> ceiling<00:03:07.360> I<00:03:07.750> want<00:03:08.470> it

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
here and touching the ceiling I want it

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.840 
here and touching the ceiling I want it
you<00:03:08.800> know<00:03:09.130> not<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:09.519> be<00:03:09.550> dangerous<00:03:10.180> or<00:03:10.540> sharp

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
you know not to be dangerous or sharp

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.210 
you know not to be dangerous or sharp
so<00:03:12.850> anyway<00:03:13.440> I'm<00:03:14.440> gonna<00:03:14.530> stay<00:03:14.739> in<00:03:14.769> those<00:03:14.950> holes

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
so anyway I'm gonna stay in those holes

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.340 
so anyway I'm gonna stay in those holes
and<00:03:15.489> then<00:03:15.610> I'm<00:03:16.330> gonna<00:03:16.450> start<00:03:16.690> prepping<00:03:17.170> these

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
and then I'm gonna start prepping these

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.520 
and then I'm gonna start prepping these
walls<00:03:17.769> for<00:03:18.220> some<00:03:18.850> sort<00:03:19.120> of<00:03:19.150> a<00:03:19.269> wall<00:03:19.450> car

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.110 

okay<00:03:23.530> so<00:03:23.590> what<00:03:23.950> I<00:03:23.980> just<00:03:24.040> did<00:03:24.430> is<00:03:24.700> installed

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
okay so what I just did is installed

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.790 
okay so what I just did is installed
this<00:03:25.300> 2x4<00:03:26.040> along<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.220> top<00:03:27.430> of<00:03:27.790> this<00:03:28.750> wall<00:03:29.080> what

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
this 2x4 along the top of this wall what

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.229 
this 2x4 along the top of this wall what
that's<00:03:29.980> kind<00:03:30.160> of<00:03:30.190> do<00:03:30.340> is<00:03:30.489> allow<00:03:30.730> me<00:03:30.940> to<00:03:31.030> mount

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
that's kind of do is allow me to mount

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.410 
that's kind of do is allow me to mount
plywood<00:03:31.950> starting<00:03:32.950> where<00:03:33.370> this<00:03:33.520> piece<00:03:33.730> is<00:03:34.000> all

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
plywood starting where this piece is all

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.960 
plywood starting where this piece is all
the<00:03:34.569> way<00:03:34.690> up<00:03:34.810> to<00:03:35.319> here<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:36.040> that'll<00:03:36.640> give<00:03:36.790> me<00:03:36.819> a

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
the way up to here and that'll give me a

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.170 
the way up to here and that'll give me a
wall<00:03:37.209> surface<00:03:37.840> on<00:03:38.260> which<00:03:38.739> to<00:03:38.980> put<00:03:39.190> a<00:03:39.459> wall

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
wall surface on which to put a wall

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.020 
wall surface on which to put a wall
covering<00:03:40.860> it'll<00:03:41.860> also<00:03:41.980> give<00:03:42.310> me<00:03:42.459> a<00:03:42.489> place<00:03:42.790> to

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
covering it'll also give me a place to

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.259 
covering it'll also give me a place to
set<00:03:43.720> my<00:03:43.959> sill<00:03:44.290> board<00:03:44.590> and<00:03:45.600> secure<00:03:46.600> it<00:03:47.130> I

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
set my sill board and secure it I

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.339 
set my sill board and secure it I
could've<00:03:49.269> easily<00:03:49.390> put<00:03:49.720> that<00:03:49.870> in<00:03:50.019> when<00:03:50.140> I<00:03:50.200> was

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
could've easily put that in when I was

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.390 
could've easily put that in when I was
building<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.769> garage<00:03:51.000> but<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.900> priority

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
building the garage but the priority

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.180 
building the garage but the priority
building<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.489> garage<00:03:54.610> was<00:03:55.600> not<00:03:55.810> how<00:03:56.110> to

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
building the garage was not how to

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.500 
building the garage was not how to
perfectly<00:03:57.190> figure<00:03:57.550> out<00:03:57.700> how<00:03:57.940> to<00:03:58.000> frame<00:03:58.330> the

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
perfectly figure out how to frame the

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.979 
perfectly figure out how to frame the
windows<00:03:58.980> it<00:03:59.980> was<00:04:00.220> to<00:04:00.519> get<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.269> roof<00:04:01.420> on<00:04:01.569> so

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
windows it was to get the roof on so

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.750 
windows it was to get the roof on so
stuff<00:04:02.920> like<00:04:03.100> this

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
stuff like this

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.050 
stuff like this
I<00:04:03.790> moved<00:04:04.750> past<00:04:05.110> I<00:04:05.590> also<00:04:05.890> had<00:04:06.340> no<00:04:06.610> idea<00:04:06.880> what

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
I moved past I also had no idea what

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.449 
I moved past I also had no idea what
size<00:04:07.390> windows<00:04:07.840> I<00:04:07.959> was<00:04:08.049> gonna<00:04:08.200> put<00:04:08.440> in<00:04:08.799> where

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
size windows I was gonna put in where

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.160 
size windows I was gonna put in where
they<00:04:09.610> were<00:04:09.700> gonna<00:04:09.790> start<00:04:10.180> any<00:04:10.569> of<00:04:10.750> that<00:04:10.870> so

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
they were gonna start any of that so

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.259 
they were gonna start any of that so
that's<00:04:11.920> why<00:04:12.069> I<00:04:12.100> left<00:04:12.370> a<00:04:12.640> lot<00:04:12.819> of<00:04:12.940> this<00:04:13.060> stuff

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
that's why I left a lot of this stuff

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.600 
that's why I left a lot of this stuff
like<00:04:13.510> building<00:04:14.019> a<00:04:14.080> window<00:04:14.290> frame<00:04:14.530> to<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.459> end

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
like building a window frame to the end

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.330 
like building a window frame to the end
and<00:04:15.850> that's<00:04:15.940> not<00:04:16.919> technically<00:04:17.919> a<00:04:18.040> window

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
and that's not technically a window

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.130 
and that's not technically a window
frame<00:04:18.970> but<00:04:19.570> anyway<00:04:20.380> so<00:04:20.680> what<00:04:20.799> I'm<00:04:20.889> doing
