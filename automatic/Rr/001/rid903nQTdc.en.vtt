00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.910 
plainly play that way and they don't
tell<00:04:53.660> me<00:04:53.780> they<00:04:53.900> probably<00:04:54.170> play<00:04:54.410> like<00:04:54.650> a<00:04:54.680> few

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
tell me they probably play like a few

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.470 
tell me they probably play like a few
games<00:04:55.130> and<00:04:55.280> probably<00:04:55.670> don't<00:04:55.880> even<00:04:56.000> finish<00:04:56.330> the

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
games and probably don't even finish the

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.610 
games and probably don't even finish the
placement<00:04:56.990> matches<00:04:57.190> which<00:04:58.190> I<00:04:58.820> think<00:04:59.360> it's<00:04:59.620> the

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
placement matches which I think it's the

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.620 
placement matches which I think it's the
placement<00:05:01.040> matches<00:05:01.160> is<00:05:01.400> a<00:05:01.430> good<00:05:01.640> idea<00:05:01.670> I<00:05:02.240> think

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
placement matches is a good idea I think

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.780 
placement matches is a good idea I think
like<00:05:02.810> you<00:05:03.350> know<00:05:03.470> I've<00:05:03.560> played<00:05:03.890> some<00:05:04.250> starcraft

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
like you know I've played some starcraft

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.550 
like you know I've played some starcraft
2<00:05:05.120> and<00:05:05.330> I<00:05:05.390> feel<00:05:05.570> like<00:05:05.600> that<00:05:05.870> kind<00:05:06.080> of<00:05:06.140> works<00:05:06.350> in

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
2 and I feel like that kind of works in

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.440 
2 and I feel like that kind of works in
a<00:05:06.620> good<00:05:06.800> way<00:05:06.980> you<00:05:07.040> kind<00:05:07.340> of<00:05:07.490> your<00:05:07.820> kind<00:05:07.970> of<00:05:08.060> you
