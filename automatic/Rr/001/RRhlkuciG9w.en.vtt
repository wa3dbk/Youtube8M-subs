letting that be passable now I've done a

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.059 
letting that be passable now I've done a
graveyard<00:03:05.370> classic<00:03:06.000> series<00:03:06.359> they<00:03:07.200> are<00:03:07.349> at<00:03:07.620> I

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
graveyard classic series they are at I

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.129 
graveyard classic series they are at I
think<00:03:08.129> three<00:03:08.819> or<00:03:08.969> four<00:03:09.269> different<00:03:09.540> volumes

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
think three or four different volumes

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.020 
think three or four different volumes
it's<00:03:10.919> a<00:03:11.010> cool<00:03:11.189> little<00:03:11.310> idea<00:03:11.489> but<00:03:11.939> the

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
it's a cool little idea but the

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.849 
it's a cool little idea but the
executions<00:03:12.599> not<00:03:12.780> good<00:03:13.019> and<00:03:13.229> this<00:03:13.349> is<00:03:13.409> not<00:03:13.650> good

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
executions not good and this is not good

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.949 
executions not good and this is not good
here<00:03:14.040> either<00:03:14.159> the<00:03:14.510> execution<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.629> really<00:03:15.870> the

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
here either the execution is really the

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.839 
here either the execution is really the
problem<00:03:16.349> it<00:03:16.530> sounds<00:03:17.310> like<00:03:17.459> it<00:03:17.579> should<00:03:17.760> be

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
problem it sounds like it should be

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.640 
problem it sounds like it should be
passable<00:03:18.269> it<00:03:18.659> really<00:03:18.959> does<00:03:19.109> musically

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
passable it really does musically

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.770 
passable it really does musically
speaking<00:03:19.799> I<00:03:20.159> have<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.459> say<00:03:20.669> it<00:03:20.729> is<00:03:21.000> probably<00:03:21.449> a

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
speaking I have to say it is probably a

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.229 
speaking I have to say it is probably a
little<00:03:22.169> bit<00:03:22.409> better<00:03:22.889> off<00:03:23.190> than<00:03:23.609> the<00:03:23.819> vocals

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
little bit better off than the vocals

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.110 
little bit better off than the vocals
because<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:24.689> vocals<00:03:25.079> are<00:03:25.889> just<00:03:26.159> really<00:03:26.729> kind

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
because the vocals are just really kind

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.610 
because the vocals are just really kind
of<00:03:27.269> up<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.810> down<00:03:28.109> this<00:03:28.439> is<00:03:28.590> very<00:03:28.889> much<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.430> very

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
of up and down this is very much a very

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.990

some points in time Chris sounds like

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.759 
some points in time Chris sounds like
he's<00:03:35.579> a<00:03:35.609> halfway<00:03:36.209> competent<00:03:36.780> vocalist<00:03:37.319> but<00:03:37.560> a

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:47.759 
it's not something where this is being

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:49.909 
it's not something where this is being
done<00:03:48.000> for<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.209> variety<00:03:48.359> sake<00:03:49.049> either<00:03:49.349> it's<00:03:49.680> one

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
done for a variety sake either it's one
