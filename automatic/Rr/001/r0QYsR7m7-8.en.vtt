I<00:00:00.560> am<00:00:01.560> going<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.860> start<00:00:02.370> this<00:00:02.730> piece<00:00:03.230> with<00:00:04.230> a

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
I am going to start this piece with a

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.179 
I am going to start this piece with a
cradle<00:00:05.310> board<00:00:05.879> what<00:00:06.660> I've<00:00:06.810> done<00:00:07.049> first

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
cradle board what I've done first

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.200 
cradle board what I've done first
is<00:00:08.309> I've<00:00:08.580> stained<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.690> sides<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.500> it<00:00:10.650> and<00:00:11.210> the

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
is I've stained the sides of it and the

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.599 
is I've stained the sides of it and the
back<00:00:13.099> and<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:15.000> first<00:00:15.269> thing<00:00:15.630> that<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.900> do<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.609> I

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
back and the first thing that I do is I

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.759 
back and the first thing that I do is I
put<00:00:18.029> down<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.539> layer<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.199> medium<00:00:19.880> and<00:00:21.230> I<00:00:22.230> do<00:00:22.289> that

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
put down a layer of medium and I do that

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:30.500 
put down a layer of medium and I do that
in<00:00:23.779> order<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:28.609> put<00:00:29.609> it's<00:00:29.849> like<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.119> binder

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
in order to put it's like a binder

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.380 
in order to put it's like a binder
between<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.380> board<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.550> first<00:00:32.790> layer<00:00:33.090> of

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
between the board and the first layer of

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.869 
between the board and the first layer of
pigmented<00:00:34.320> wax<00:00:35.510> so<00:00:36.510> I've<00:00:36.989> heated<00:00:37.469> up<00:00:37.879> some

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
pigmented wax so I've heated up some

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.030 
pigmented wax so I've heated up some
medium<00:00:39.540> here<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:41.090> I<00:00:42.090> have<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> brush<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.840> I've

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
medium here and I have a brush that I've

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.069 
medium here and I have a brush that I've
labeled<00:00:44.040> medium<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.570> don't<00:00:45.780> put<00:00:45.930> other

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
labeled medium so I don't put other

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.459 
labeled medium so I don't put other
color<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:48.800> I'm<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:49.910> going<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.379> put<00:00:52.379> it

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
color on it and I'm just going to put it

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.040 
color on it and I'm just going to put it
on<00:00:52.620> like<00:00:52.800> I'm<00:00:52.980> painting<00:00:55.910> the<00:00:56.910> hotter<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.809> have

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
on like I'm painting the hotter you have

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.479 
on like I'm painting the hotter you have
your<00:00:58.289> wax<00:00:58.789> the<00:00:59.789> more<00:01:00.000> liquid<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:01.370> but<00:01:02.370> you

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
your wax the more liquid it is but you

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.340 
your wax the more liquid it is but you
have<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.730> temper<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.149> with<00:01:03.480> safety<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.260> you

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
have to temper that with safety so you

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.380 
have to temper that with safety so you
don't<00:01:04.500> want<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.799> too<00:01:05.070> hot<00:01:07.760> so<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.820> do<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.240> to

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
don't want it too hot so you do have to

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.859 
don't want it too hot so you do have to
work<00:01:09.600> fairly<00:01:10.020> fast<00:01:13.070> but<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.310> first<00:01:14.520> layer

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
work fairly fast but this first layer

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.760 
work fairly fast but this first layer
doesn't<00:01:15.869> matter<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.229> want<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.560> make<00:01:16.740> sure

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
doesn't matter I want to make sure

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.670 
doesn't matter I want to make sure
there's<00:01:17.250> enough<00:01:17.310> wax<00:01:17.820> that's<00:01:18.299> absorbed<00:01:19.020> into

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
there's enough wax that's absorbed into

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.140 
there's enough wax that's absorbed into
the<00:01:20.220> wood<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:21.650> start<00:01:22.650> off<00:01:22.830> by<00:01:23.100> painting<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
the wood I start off by painting the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.170 
the wood I start off by painting the
board<00:01:24.450> one<00:01:24.689> way<00:01:25.580> and<00:01:27.110> then<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.380> come<00:01:28.710> back<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.310> I

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
board one way and then I come back and I

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:40.899 
board one way and then I come back and I
cover<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.979> the<00:01:31.979> other<00:01:32.130> way

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.340 

and<00:01:41.540> I<00:01:41.630> just<00:01:41.990> want<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.229> make<00:01:42.409> sure<00:01:42.439> I<00:01:44.350> get

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
and I just want to make sure I get

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.080 
and I just want to make sure I get
enough<00:01:45.380> down<00:01:45.829> doesn't<00:01:46.340> matter<00:01:46.579> that<00:01:46.729> there's

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
enough down doesn't matter that there's

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.010 
enough down doesn't matter that there's
texture<00:01:47.539> that<00:01:47.960> it's<00:01:48.140> smooth<00:01:49.570> I've<00:01:50.570> got<00:01:50.810> some

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
texture that it's smooth I've got some

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.870 
texture that it's smooth I've got some
little<00:01:51.200> goobers<00:01:51.680> in<00:01:51.860> here<00:01:52.220> don't<00:01:52.640> worry<00:01:52.820> about

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
little goobers in here don't worry about

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.340 
little goobers in here don't worry about
it<00:01:53.240> you're<00:01:53.390> gonna<00:01:53.509> get<00:01:53.750> a<00:01:53.810> lot<00:01:54.079> of<00:01:54.229> little

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
it you're gonna get a lot of little

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.749 
it you're gonna get a lot of little
goobers<00:01:56.799> think<00:01:57.799> of<00:01:57.890> it<00:01:57.950> as<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.220> charm<00:01:58.520> of<00:01:58.670> the

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
goobers think of it as the charm of the

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.660 
goobers think of it as the charm of the
medium<00:02:02.229> now<00:02:03.229> one<00:02:03.560> of<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.770> critical<00:02:04.399> things

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
medium now one of the critical things

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
medium now one of the critical things
about<00:02:04.990> encaustic<00:02:05.990> is<00:02:06.649> fusing<00:02:07.450> every<00:02:08.450> layer<00:02:09.250> so

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
about encaustic is fusing every layer so

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.550 
about encaustic is fusing every layer so
first<00:02:11.690> thing<00:02:11.900> and<00:02:12.080> you're<00:02:12.230> going<00:02:12.349> to<00:02:12.380> get<00:02:12.500> a

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
first thing and you're going to get a

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.020 
first thing and you're going to get a
lot<00:02:12.709> of<00:02:12.739> drips<00:02:13.069> on<00:02:13.250> your<00:02:13.370> area<00:02:13.640> around<00:02:13.819> it

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
lot of drips on your area around it

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.990 
lot of drips on your area around it
that's<00:02:14.299> why<00:02:14.480> I've<00:02:14.690> got<00:02:14.900> newsprint<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.160> this

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
that's why I've got newsprint and this

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.940 
that's why I've got newsprint and this
old<00:02:17.209> cardboard<00:02:17.599> just<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.530> protect<00:02:18.769> my

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
old cardboard just to protect my

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.559 
old cardboard just to protect my
tabletop<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:20.810> now<00:02:21.019> I'm<00:02:21.170> going<00:02:21.349> to<00:02:21.440> fuse<00:02:22.569> this

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
tabletop so now I'm going to fuse this

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:30.070 
tabletop so now I'm going to fuse this
layer<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:28.370> what<00:02:28.760> you<00:02:28.910> need<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.120> do<00:02:29.450> when

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
layer and what you need to do when

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.380 
layer and what you need to do when
you're<00:02:30.290> using<00:02:30.680> any<00:02:31.250> kind<00:02:31.340> of<00:02:31.670> heated<00:02:32.060> heat

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
you're using any kind of heated heat

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.130 
you're using any kind of heated heat
source<00:02:32.780> you<00:02:33.530> want<00:02:33.709> to<00:02:33.799> keep<00:02:33.920> it<00:02:34.099> moving

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
source you want to keep it moving

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.020 
source you want to keep it moving
Here<00:02:36.140> I<00:02:36.410> am<00:02:36.470> using<00:02:36.890> sort<00:02:37.340> of<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:37.489> circular

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
Here I am using sort of a circular

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.059 
Here I am using sort of a circular
motion<00:02:40.599> and<00:02:41.599> I'm<00:02:41.870> heating<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.530> surface<00:02:43.040> just

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
motion and I'm heating the surface just

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:52.080 
motion and I'm heating the surface just
until<00:02:43.970> I<00:02:44.000> can<00:02:44.269> see<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.630> wax<00:02:44.870> is<00:02:45.170> molten

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.119 

it<00:02:52.660> doesn't<00:02:53.080> even<00:02:53.140> matter<00:02:53.470> that<00:02:53.650> the

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
it doesn't even matter that the

00:02:54.129 --> 00:03:01.410 
it doesn't even matter that the
brushstrokes<00:02:54.760> are<00:02:55.000> still<00:02:55.269> visible<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:01.120> you

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
brushstrokes are still visible and you

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.130 
brushstrokes are still visible and you
see<00:03:01.629> those<00:03:01.780> little<00:03:01.900> pin<00:03:02.349> pricks<00:03:02.680> come<00:03:03.069> up

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
see those little pin pricks come up

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.360 
see those little pin pricks come up
those<00:03:05.140> are<00:03:05.260> air<00:03:05.410> bubbles<00:03:05.800> that<00:03:05.890> are<00:03:06.069> coming

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
those are air bubbles that are coming

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:14.850 
those are air bubbles that are coming
out<00:03:06.550> from<00:03:06.910> both<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.239> wax<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.629> the<00:03:07.750> board<00:03:13.500> so<00:03:14.500> I

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
out from both the wax and the board so I

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.750 
out from both the wax and the board so I
think<00:03:14.920> I<00:03:15.160> got<00:03:15.310> that<00:03:15.519> pretty<00:03:15.849> evenly<00:03:16.239> I<00:03:17.760> have

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
think I got that pretty evenly I have

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.360 
think I got that pretty evenly I have
been<00:03:19.150> letting<00:03:19.510> this<00:03:19.540> board<00:03:20.260> cool<00:03:20.709> just<00:03:21.220> a

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
been letting this board cool just a

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.420 
been letting this board cool just a
little<00:03:21.640> bit<00:03:22.739> that<00:03:23.739> can<00:03:23.860> be<00:03:23.950> a<00:03:23.980> good<00:03:24.099> thing<00:03:24.160> in

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
little bit that can be a good thing in

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.970 
little bit that can be a good thing in
between<00:03:24.880> layers<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:26.650> what<00:03:27.640> I'm<00:03:27.760> gonna<00:03:27.910> do<00:03:28.980> is

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
between layers and what I'm gonna do is

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.330 
between layers and what I'm gonna do is
just<00:03:30.010> see<00:03:30.670> how<00:03:31.180> much<00:03:31.360> excess<00:03:31.900> wax<00:03:32.170> I<00:03:32.680> have<00:03:33.099> on

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
just see how much excess wax I have on

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.000 
just see how much excess wax I have on
this<00:03:33.549> I<00:03:35.280> don't<00:03:36.280> need<00:03:36.519> to<00:03:36.670> scrape<00:03:36.940> it<00:03:37.120> off<00:03:38.010> but

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
this I don't need to scrape it off but

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.400 
this I don't need to scrape it off but
I'm<00:03:39.220> going<00:03:39.700> to<00:03:39.730> just<00:03:40.569> because<00:03:40.930> I<00:03:41.019> don't<00:03:41.079> need

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
I'm going to just because I don't need

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.819 
I'm going to just because I don't need
it<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:41.680> I<00:03:41.769> can<00:03:41.920> throw<00:03:42.129> it<00:03:42.250> back<00:03:42.430> in<00:03:42.610> my<00:03:42.640> pan<00:03:43.829> it

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
it and I can throw it back in my pan it

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.470 
it and I can throw it back in my pan it
gives<00:03:45.010> me<00:03:45.160> a<00:03:45.190> little<00:03:45.670> more<00:03:45.849> even<00:03:46.209> surface

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
gives me a little more even surface

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:58.110 
gives me a little more even surface
although<00:03:47.049> I'm<00:03:47.140> not<00:03:47.319> worried<00:03:47.650> about<00:03:47.769> that<00:03:57.120> when

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
although I'm not worried about that when

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.569 
although I'm not worried about that when
you're<00:03:58.269> doing<00:03:58.630> this<00:03:58.900> if<00:03:59.200> you<00:03:59.290> scrape<00:03:59.620> down<00:03:59.980> to

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
you're doing this if you scrape down to

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.059 
you're doing this if you scrape down to
the<00:04:00.700> very<00:04:00.940> board<00:04:01.500> don't<00:04:02.500> worry<00:04:02.709> about<00:04:02.829> it

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
the very board don't worry about it

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.520 
the very board don't worry about it
because<00:04:03.310> you<00:04:03.430> can<00:04:03.459> add<00:04:03.900> some<00:04:04.900> more<00:04:04.930> medium<00:04:05.380> on

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
because you can add some more medium on

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.470 
because you can add some more medium on
top<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:06.100> then<00:04:06.310> fuse<00:04:06.609> it<00:04:06.760> again<00:04:09.060> but<00:04:10.060> it's<00:04:10.209> just

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
top and then fuse it again but it's just

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:18.060 
top and then fuse it again but it's just
a<00:04:10.660> good<00:04:10.959> way<00:04:11.200> to<00:04:11.680> prime<00:04:12.040> your<00:04:12.599> support<00:04:17.070> pretty

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
a good way to prime your support pretty

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:27.580 
a good way to prime your support pretty
good

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.999 

you'll<00:04:28.590> also<00:04:28.770> get<00:04:29.220> some<00:04:30.060> drips<00:04:30.360> down<00:04:30.599> the<00:04:30.659> side

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009 
you'll also get some drips down the side

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:33.740 
you'll also get some drips down the side
having<00:04:32.009> stained<00:04:32.430> at<00:04:32.610> first<00:04:32.940> those<00:04:33.449> should

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
having stained at first those should

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.100 
having stained at first those should
come<00:04:33.960> off<00:04:34.139> very<00:04:34.169> easily<00:04:35.060> using<00:04:36.060> an<00:04:36.180> exacto<00:04:36.599> or

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
come off very easily using an exacto or

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.550 
come off very easily using an exacto or
scraper<00:04:38.690> that's<00:04:39.690> one<00:04:39.870> of<00:04:39.960> the<00:04:40.020> reasons<00:04:40.349> that<00:04:40.500> I

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
scraper that's one of the reasons that I

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.669 
scraper that's one of the reasons that I
do<00:04:40.680> that<00:04:41.009> beforehand
