00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
relationships with them that we've built

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.070 
relationships with them that we've built
over<00:01:31.760> the<00:01:31.790> years<00:01:31.880> so<00:01:32.150> I<00:01:32.210> think<00:01:32.270> that<00:01:32.660> because

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
over the years so I think that because

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.460 
over the years so I think that because
we<00:01:33.830> have<00:01:34.070> this<00:01:34.400> this<00:01:34.790> this<00:01:35.570> amazing<00:01:36.170> fan<00:01:36.440> base

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
we have this this this amazing fan base

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.860 
we have this this this amazing fan base
that<00:01:36.650> is<00:01:36.920> that<00:01:37.490> they<00:01:37.820> just<00:01:38.060> they<00:01:38.630> spread

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
that is that they just they spread

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.719 
that is that they just they spread
everything<00:01:39.200> by<00:01:39.290> word<00:01:39.470> of<00:01:39.590> mouth<00:01:39.650> do<00:01:39.979> we<00:01:40.130> have

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
everything by word of mouth do we have

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.370 
everything by word of mouth do we have
to<00:01:40.820> ask<00:01:40.970> him<00:01:41.150> to<00:01:41.240> do<00:01:41.330> that<00:01:41.450> I<00:01:41.540> think<00:01:41.570> because<00:01:42.020> we

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
to ask him to do that I think because we

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.690 
to ask him to do that I think because we
have<00:01:42.500> such<00:01:42.680> a<00:01:42.710> close<00:01:42.920> relationship<00:01:42.979> people

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
have such a close relationship people

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.260 
have such a close relationship people
just<00:01:43.850> naturally<00:01:44.050> do<00:01:45.050> that
