00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
welcome back settling here I've got a

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.800 
welcome back settling here I've got a
new<00:00:02.280> version<00:00:02.429> of<00:00:02.700> my<00:00:02.760> subway<00:00:03.120> steel<00:00:03.389> minecart

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
new version of my subway steel minecart

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.800 
new version of my subway steel minecart
station<00:00:04.220> this<00:00:05.220> time<00:00:05.430> it's<00:00:05.670> got<00:00:05.819> a<00:00:06.240> lot<00:00:06.569> less

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
station this time it's got a lot less

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.709 
station this time it's got a lot less
stuff<00:00:07.049> showing<00:00:07.319> above-ground<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:08.330> I've<00:00:09.330> also

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
stuff showing above-ground and I've also

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.120 
stuff showing above-ground and I've also
cleaned<00:00:09.929> up<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.110> Redstone<00:00:10.469> wiring<00:00:10.500> quite<00:00:11.099> a

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
cleaned up the Redstone wiring quite a

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.999 
cleaned up the Redstone wiring quite a
bit<00:00:11.309> so<00:00:11.460> it's<00:00:11.580> very<00:00:11.700> simple<00:00:12.590> so<00:00:13.590> basically

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
bit so it's very simple so basically

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.709 
bit so it's very simple so basically
just<00:00:14.370> like<00:00:14.639> my<00:00:14.759> previous<00:00:14.940> version<00:00:15.450> it's<00:00:15.599> got

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
just like my previous version it's got

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.019 
just like my previous version it's got
the<00:00:15.839> sole<00:00:16.109> sign<00:00:16.320> here<00:00:16.650> so<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.490> can't

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
the sole sign here so that I can't

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.660 
the sole sign here so that I can't
really<00:00:18.150> mess<00:00:18.390> up<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.570> cart<00:00:18.900> by<00:00:19.279> by<00:00:20.279> pushing<00:00:20.490> it

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
really mess up the cart by by pushing it

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.290 
really mess up the cart by by pushing it
around<00:00:21.949> the<00:00:22.949> card<00:00:23.189> stays<00:00:23.460> at<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.730> station<00:00:24.090> for

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
around the card stays at the station for

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.830 
around the card stays at the station for
a<00:00:24.330> second<00:00:24.750> long<00:00:25.050> enough<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.439> just<00:00:25.619> get<00:00:25.740> out<00:00:25.949> and

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
a second long enough to just get out and

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.029 
a second long enough to just get out and
get<00:00:27.840> out<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.109> way<00:00:28.199> for<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.470> car<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.740> depart

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
get out of the way for the car to depart

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.460 
get out of the way for the car to depart
you<00:00:29.939> notice<00:00:30.210> as<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.390> got<00:00:30.539> out<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.779> cart<00:00:31.019> this

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
you notice as I got out of the cart this

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.350 
you notice as I got out of the cart this
whole<00:00:31.650> sand<00:00:31.890> made<00:00:32.730> sure<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.180> cart

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
whole sand made sure that the cart

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.049 
whole sand made sure that the cart
didn't<00:00:33.660> get<00:00:33.750> pushed<00:00:33.989> around<00:00:34.640> so<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.760> current

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
didn't get pushed around so the current

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.299 
didn't get pushed around so the current
stayed<00:00:36.930> where<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.170> was<00:00:37.290> supposed<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.800> I

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
stayed where it was supposed to and I

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:38.780 
stayed where it was supposed to and I
kept<00:00:38.489> going

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
kept going

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.290 
kept going
so<00:00:39.600> I've<00:00:39.660> cleaned<00:00:39.809> up<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.020> wiring<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.350> lot<00:00:41.300> you

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
so I've cleaned up the wiring a lot you

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.260 
so I've cleaned up the wiring a lot you
see<00:00:42.480> there's<00:00:42.660> four<00:00:43.350> colored<00:00:43.800> blocks<00:00:44.100> here<00:00:44.489> the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
see there's four colored blocks here the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.729 
see there's four colored blocks here the
green<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.780> green<00:00:45.809> colored<00:00:46.200> blocks<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.559> just

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
green the green colored blocks is just

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.450 
green the green colored blocks is just
the<00:00:46.920> track<00:00:47.399> section<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.090> top<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:51.210> blue<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:52.460> is

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
the track section on top the blue is is

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.889 
the track section on top the blue is is
all<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.059> stuff<00:00:54.270> that's<00:00:54.480> triggered

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
all the stuff that's triggered

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.200 
all the stuff that's triggered
immediately<00:00:55.680> when<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.949> car<00:00:56.190> drives<00:00:56.879> over<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
immediately when the car drives over the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.099 
immediately when the car drives over the
sensor<00:00:57.420> plate<00:00:57.690> here<00:00:59.000> the<00:01:00.000> black<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.510> delay

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
sensor plate here the black is the delay

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.860 
sensor plate here the black is the delay
mechanism<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:03.059> controls<00:01:03.420> how<00:01:03.629> long

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
mechanism so that that controls how long

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.300 
mechanism so that that controls how long
how<00:01:04.559> long<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> delay<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.689> and<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:07.710> yellow<00:01:08.070> is

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
how long the delay is and the yellow is

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.310 
how long the delay is and the yellow is
all<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.580> stuff<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:08.820> happens<00:01:09.330> after<00:01:10.020> the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
all the stuff that happens after the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.250 
all the stuff that happens after the
delay<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:12.299> first<00:01:12.540> thing<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.750> we<00:01:12.930> want<00:01:13.140> to

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
delay so the first thing that we want to

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.359 
delay so the first thing that we want to
happen<00:01:13.409> when<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.830> cart<00:01:14.010> rolls<00:01:14.159> over<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
happen when the cart rolls over the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.719 
happen when the cart rolls over the
Center<00:01:14.850> plate<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.540> we<00:01:15.630> want<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:16.140> sensor

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
Center plate is that we want this sensor

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.340 
Center plate is that we want this sensor
there<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:18.030> section<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.420> powered<00:01:18.840> rail<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
there this section of powered rail and

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.289 
there this section of powered rail and
this<00:01:19.950> block<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.310> get<00:01:20.460> pushed<00:01:20.610> up<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
this block to get pushed up so that the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.749 
this block to get pushed up so that the
cart<00:01:21.540> will<00:01:21.810> roll<00:01:22.200> out<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.560> soul<00:01:23.100> sand<00:01:23.340> and

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
cart will roll out of the soul sand and

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.700 
cart will roll out of the soul sand and
won't<00:01:24.000> overshoot<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.750> then<00:01:25.320> after<00:01:25.619> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
won't overshoot it and then after the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.270 
won't overshoot it and then after the
delay<00:01:25.950> we<00:01:26.729> want<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.750> block<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.680> go<00:01:28.829> up<00:01:29.009> and

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
delay we want this block to go up and

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.120 
delay we want this block to go up and
these<00:01:29.460> two<00:01:30.290> powered<00:01:31.290> rails<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.799> come<00:01:31.950> into

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
these two powered rails to come into

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.179 
these two powered rails to come into
place<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.259> the<00:01:34.259> cart<00:01:34.619> will<00:01:34.740> get<00:01:34.860> pushed

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
place so that the cart will get pushed

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.130 
place so that the cart will get pushed
off<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.909> can<00:01:36.090> see<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.659> action<00:01:36.990> right

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
off and you can see that in action right

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.350 
off and you can see that in action right
here<00:01:37.380> these<00:01:38.189> two<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.790> then<00:01:38.909> these<00:01:39.329> three<00:01:39.840> so

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
here these two and then these three so

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.179 
here these two and then these three so
so<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.479> blue<00:01:42.600> cloth<00:01:42.840> here<00:01:43.170> again<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.590> what<00:01:44.070> was

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
so the blue cloth here again is what was

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.940 
so the blue cloth here again is what was
happening<00:01:44.579> before<00:01:44.960> all<00:01:45.960> right<00:01:46.020> right<00:01:46.560> as<00:01:46.710> the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
happening before all right right as the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.520 
happening before all right right as the
cart<00:01:47.250> rolled<00:01:47.399> over<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.700> track<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:49.170> can<00:01:49.200> see

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
cart rolled over the track you can see

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.469 
cart rolled over the track you can see
it<00:01:50.420> it<00:01:51.420> just<00:01:51.659> immediately<00:01:52.470> powers<00:01:53.479> this

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
it it just immediately powers this

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.600 
it it just immediately powers this
piston

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
piston

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.880 
piston
and<00:01:55.760> I'll<00:01:56.360> show<00:01:56.510> you<00:01:56.600> again<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:57.410> also<00:01:57.560> this

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
and I'll show you again and also this

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.850 
and I'll show you again and also this
stuff<00:01:58.160> down<00:01:58.340> here<00:02:00.370> and<00:02:01.750> and<00:02:02.750> so<00:02:03.080> this<00:02:03.500> blue

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
stuff down here and and so this blue

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.530 
stuff down here and and so this blue
cloth<00:02:04.130> goes<00:02:04.430> up<00:02:04.670> goes<00:02:05.090> over<00:02:05.360> onto<00:02:06.160> this<00:02:07.160> this

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
cloth goes up goes over onto this this

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.390 
cloth goes up goes over onto this this
piston<00:02:08.540> which<00:02:08.720> pushes<00:02:08.869> it<00:02:09.110> up<00:02:09.229> so<00:02:09.890> that's<00:02:10.130> the

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
piston which pushes it up so that's the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.620 
piston which pushes it up so that's the
that's<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.850> stuff<00:02:11.270> that<00:02:11.420> happens

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
that's the stuff that happens

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.480 
that's the stuff that happens
immediately<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:12.590> black<00:02:12.800> is<00:02:13.010> just<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.250> bunch<00:02:13.400> of

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
immediately the black is just a bunch of

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.670 
immediately the black is just a bunch of
repeaters<00:02:14.030> you<00:02:14.960> could<00:02:15.080> you<00:02:15.350> could<00:02:15.500> extend

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
repeaters you could you could extend

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.200 
repeaters you could you could extend
this<00:02:15.830> out<00:02:15.980> if<00:02:16.160> you<00:02:16.250> wanted<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.520> longer<00:02:16.760> delay

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
this out if you wanted to longer delay

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.970 
this out if you wanted to longer delay
actually<00:02:17.930> this<00:02:18.020> delays<00:02:18.320> a<00:02:18.350> bit<00:02:18.560> short<00:02:18.770> so<00:02:18.860> you

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
actually this delays a bit short so you

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.440 
actually this delays a bit short so you
probably<00:02:19.250> would<00:02:19.430> want<00:02:19.550> a<00:02:19.700> longer<00:02:20.030> delay<00:02:20.150> and

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
probably would want a longer delay and

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.510 
probably would want a longer delay and
then<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.410> yellow<00:02:21.500> is<00:02:21.950> all<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.340> stuff

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
then the yellow is all the stuff

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.610 
then the yellow is all the stuff
afterwards<00:02:23.390> so<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.080> very<00:02:24.230> first<00:02:24.470> thing<00:02:24.590> you

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
afterwards so the very first thing you

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.040 
afterwards so the very first thing you
can<00:02:24.830> see<00:02:24.890> is<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:25.670> will<00:02:25.970> push<00:02:26.240> up<00:02:26.450> this<00:02:26.750> block

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
can see is it will push up this block

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.260 
can see is it will push up this block
and<00:02:27.260> then<00:02:27.380> it<00:02:27.500> comes<00:02:27.710> around<00:02:27.970> here<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:30.130> and

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
and then it comes around here and and

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.480 
and then it comes around here and and
and<00:02:32.270> pushes<00:02:32.980> pushes<00:02:33.980> these<00:02:34.250> two<00:02:34.520> Pistons<00:02:35.230> so

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
and pushes pushes these two Pistons so

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.470 
and pushes pushes these two Pistons so
it's<00:02:37.490> how<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:37.700> works

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
it's how it works

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.630 
it's how it works
wiring<00:02:39.170> is<00:02:39.260> actually<00:02:39.500> quite<00:02:39.680> simple<00:02:42.640> that's

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
wiring is actually quite simple that's

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.080 
wiring is actually quite simple that's
about<00:02:43.760> it

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
about it

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.570 
about it
thanks<00:02:44.420> for<00:02:44.510> watching
