what<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.259> find<00:01:40.560> very<00:01:40.650> interesting<00:01:41.009> about<00:01:41.310> Anna

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610

is<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.240> think<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.630> her<00:01:42.750> dialogue<00:01:43.290> with

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
is that I think that her dialogue with

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.679 
is that I think that her dialogue with
other<00:01:43.590> characters<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.430> actually<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.180> lot<00:01:45.479> more

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
other characters is actually a lot more

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.389 
other characters is actually a lot more
intelligent<00:01:46.229> than<00:01:46.350> her<00:01:46.500> internal<00:01:46.950> monologue

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
intelligent than her internal monologue

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.889 
intelligent than her internal monologue
