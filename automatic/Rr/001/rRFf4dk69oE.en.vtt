00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.210
 hi do you think you can 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.639
 use the river Tom as 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.470
 racing track you can if in your hands 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.970
 there is such special equipment 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.970
 snow seal is not yours 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.779
 we already urine 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.510
 Chief Designer of the seal Mikhail Mikhail 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.010
 good afternoon hello tell me how do you 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.350
 I got the idea to create one 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.600
 unusual technique we many years 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.170
 development led in this direction 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.879
 just as if they are the invention of our 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.100
 Russian 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.469
 before they were mass-produced actively 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.409
 used by us in the north and therefore 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.330
 got the idea of â€‹â€‹a tradition to renew itself 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.220
 it was difficult to do it on and once they 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.409
 put a diesel engine because 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.000
 very heavy himself to us its nobody else 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.950
 never used diesel moving 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.470
 from our development such well yes it is on 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.090
 in fact, an hour of unique design 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.179
 no parents will never accept not 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.490
 put on time they and the second point is this 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:23.289
 that we taught aerosun swimming now 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.720
 we made universal transport 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:28.390
 means it is possible and on water to go and not 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.560
 afraid to get on the river from thawed patches in 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.479
 ice drift can go 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.520
 why all the same and since they need them where 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.280
 they can be used throwing 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.270
 necessary and needed very much for the north 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.849
 for the tundra to transport goods to people 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.319
 remote sites 

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:47.259
 that is, in principle, competition 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:49.810
 by helicopter when compared by price 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:53.039
 helicopter and operation times they have it 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.039
 about 10 times 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.160
 management of Odessa and it is very simple 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.280
 there is a steering wheel and gas pedal and brakes 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.709
 No , but how to conduct fraternity in 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.390
 gas times they stop here themselves 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.900
 Need to of course have a small skill 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.459
 because to understand how fast 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.420
 before an obstacle there you can drop 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:30.050
 and so on 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.050
 easy to learn 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.410
 as we all drive a car that's on there 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.319
 manage well the same thing only 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.569
 that there is a slight difference here is this 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.930
 that when she turn it is necessary to gas 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.660
 add to the attack yes and most like 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.060
 would that first time sit in touch 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.430
 on the contrary, they see obstacles 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.080
 I take it to turn them off they drop gas and 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.120
 try to steer on the steering wheel and 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.360
 only work in the air stream 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.050
 propeller that's diesel times they and they 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.319
 water 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:07.260
 such here since March of organization they are heavier 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.959
 a little there about 200 kilograms 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.019
 they have a maximum speed 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:15.380
 67 in the water to 70 that is in shallow water 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.380
 can 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.530
 and here we are without depreciation 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.780
 And I do at times they also ski boat 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.300
 Only there is no depreciation is basically the 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.670
 applies the off season over water 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:35.850
 shallow water tonic miss speed 5 meters 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:37.860
 per hour with 50 percent load then 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.950
 There is this in principle characteristics 75 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:44.430
 contour this hour but not bad at 40 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.900
 liters per hour here is very pleased 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.910
 economy we approached by 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.910
 economy to the airbag 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.320
 will when and once they are operated 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.570
 then on the rivers powder that is open 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.720
 large field terrain some kind of open and 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.240
 because it is impossible to ride them there 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.250
 between the trees is not just a snowmobile 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.959
 they they are very overall in the snow they 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.420
 turnstiles are also differently controlled 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.120
 can be very straight on the spot 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.250
 take place somewhere a certain snow 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.230
 there is fluff but will not be so big 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.150
 turning radius on of course they are 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:36.110
 designed for open space 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:38.390
 in principle, our north of siberia are you open 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.020
 river spaces here are natural 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.290
 the road 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.510
 snow and ice in winter 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:49.970
 on which you can reach speeds up to 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:52.760
 133 private on the water here it does not matter there 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:56.000
 shallow deep water can go there 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.890
 along the coast and no longer wonder where 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.380
 there is a fairway where the depth 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.750
 that is, this is of course this one 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.060
 technique exploited he falls in love 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.780
 it's in the carcass in such freedom that the downturn 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:13.060
 you look there you go yes that is it 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.060
 Of course such a unique feeling gives 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:23.189
 you 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:31.150
 it was not your special equipment snowmobile 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.150
 seals bye
