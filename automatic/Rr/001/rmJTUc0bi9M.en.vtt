00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
because this thing cost me almost every

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.300 
because this thing cost me almost every
single<00:01:48.899> point<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.530> had<00:01:49.770> on<00:01:49.950> Club<00:01:50.159> Nintendo

single point I had on Club Nintendo

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.520 
single point I had on Club Nintendo
which<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.240> pretty<00:01:51.600> crazy<00:01:51.869> when<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.229> think<00:01:52.259> of

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
which is pretty crazy when you think of

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.450 
which is pretty crazy when you think of
it<00:01:52.649> getting<00:01:53.430> any<00:01:53.520> one<00:01:54.000> single<00:01:54.509> item<00:01:54.630> for<00:01:55.049> about

it getting any one single item for about

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.520 
it getting any one single item for about
1500<00:01:56.460> points<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.090> lot<00:01:57.450> especially<00:01:57.869> when

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
1500 points is a lot especially when

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.709 
1500 points is a lot especially when
it's<00:01:58.680> just<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.950> figurine<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.700> it's<00:02:00.060> not<00:02:00.299> some

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
number so I didn't realize that these

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.939 
number so I didn't realize that these
would<00:05:33.180> be<00:05:33.210> numbered<00:05:33.630> but<00:05:33.900> it<00:05:34.020> looks<00:05:34.199> like<00:05:34.409> that

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
would be numbered but it looks like that

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:37.969 
would be numbered but it looks like that
there<00:05:35.190> is<00:05:35.460> only<00:05:35.940> 5000<00:05:36.930> of<00:05:37.020> these<00:05:37.139> incredible<00:05:37.800> I

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
got number 2305 out of 5000 but this is

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.820 
got number 2305 out of 5000 but this is
2013<00:05:43.460> B<00:05:44.460> B<00:05:45.419> that's<00:05:45.690> a<00:05:45.780> little<00:05:45.930> strange<00:05:46.199> I<00:05:46.500> know

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
2013 B B that's a little strange I know

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.409 
2013 B B that's a little strange I know
they<00:05:47.099> were<00:05:47.190> also<00:05:47.340> available<00:05:47.639> in<00:05:47.880> Europe<00:05:48.210> so<00:05:48.389> I

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 
they were also available in Europe so I

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.350 
they were also available in Europe so I
would<00:05:49.229> let<00:05:49.710> I'm<00:05:49.919> thinking<00:05:50.669> I<00:05:50.760> think<00:05:50.820> a<00:05:51.120> was

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
would let I'm thinking I think a was

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.270 
would let I'm thinking I think a was
probably<00:05:51.659> for<00:05:51.900> Europe<00:05:52.199> B's<00:05:52.680> probably<00:05:53.130> for

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
probably for Europe B's probably for

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.500 
probably for Europe B's probably for
North<00:05:53.430> America<00:05:53.849> that<00:05:53.940> would<00:05:54.060> make<00:05:54.210> sense<00:05:54.360> to

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
North America that would make sense to

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.450 
North America that would make sense to
me<00:05:54.720> again<00:05:55.320> this<00:05:55.440> is<00:05:55.590> made<00:05:55.770> in<00:05:55.919> China<00:05:56.190> and<00:05:56.400> it

figurine<00:06:00.389> does<00:06:00.780> look<00:06:01.020> really<00:06:01.349> cool<00:06:01.560> I'm

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
figurine does look really cool I'm

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.080 
figurine does look really cool I'm
pretty<00:06:02.039> impressed<00:06:02.190> with<00:06:02.460> that<00:06:02.669> I<00:06:02.849> didn't

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
pretty impressed with that I didn't

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.640 
pretty impressed with that I didn't
think<00:06:03.180> it<00:06:03.330> would<00:06:03.389> look<00:06:03.539> as<00:06:03.720> upstanding<00:06:04.380> as<00:06:04.500> it

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
think it would look as upstanding as it

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.520 
think it would look as upstanding as it
does<00:06:04.860> height<00:06:05.849> wise<00:06:06.090> I<00:06:06.389> think<00:06:06.419> it's<00:06:06.690> probably<00:06:06.960> 4

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530 
does height wise I think it's probably 4

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.890 
does height wise I think it's probably 4
to<00:06:07.680> 5<00:06:07.889> inches<00:06:08.220> tall<00:06:08.550> Luigi<00:06:09.360> himself<00:06:09.750> is

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
to 5 inches tall Luigi himself is

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.140 
to 5 inches tall Luigi himself is
probably<00:06:10.199> only<00:06:10.380> 3<00:06:11.039> inches<00:06:11.340> tall<00:06:11.639> though<00:06:11.880> and

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
probably only 3 inches tall though and

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.879 
probably only 3 inches tall though and
this<00:06:12.539> thing<00:06:12.750> really<00:06:12.900> does<00:06:13.139> look<00:06:13.320> incredible

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889 
this thing really does look incredible

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:15.230 
this thing really does look incredible
and<00:06:14.009> it's<00:06:14.099> probably<00:06:14.340> worth<00:06:14.550> quite<00:06:14.880> a<00:06:14.940> bit<00:06:15.120> of

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
and it's probably worth quite a bit of

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.899 
and it's probably worth quite a bit of
money<00:06:15.360> if<00:06:15.690> you're<00:06:16.440> looking<00:06:17.220> to<00:06:17.370> probably<00:06:17.669> pick

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:17.909 
money if you're looking to probably pick

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:20.510
