really<00:02:07.250> clever<00:02:07.550> i<00:02:07.670> was<00:02:07.880> trying<00:02:08.509> to<00:02:08.630> come<00:02:08.780> up

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
really clever i was trying to come up

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.530 
really clever i was trying to come up
with<00:02:08.929> a<00:02:09.080> game<00:02:09.290> type<00:02:09.500> like<00:02:09.679> this<00:02:09.920> but<00:02:10.310> my<00:02:11.120> works

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
with a game type like this but my works

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.090 
with a game type like this but my works
differently<00:02:12.050> and<00:02:12.320> i<00:02:12.500> couldn't<00:02:12.800> really<00:02:12.950> figure

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
differently and i couldn't really figure

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.949 
differently and i couldn't really figure
out<00:02:13.250> at<00:02:13.459> work<00:02:13.610> but<00:02:14.269> this<00:02:14.390> is<00:02:14.570> actually<00:02:14.870> an

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
out at work but this is actually an

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.479 
out at work but this is actually an
incredibly<00:02:15.410> clever<00:02:15.650> game<00:02:15.920> type<00:02:16.190> it's<00:02:16.400> a

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
incredibly clever game type it's a

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:17.949 
incredibly clever game type it's a

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
inside of a hill and the basic goal is

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.130 
inside of a hill and the basic goal is
to<00:02:21.650> stick<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.519> golf<00:02:22.730> balls<00:02:23.060> with<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.900> sticky

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
to stick the golf balls with the sticky

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.289 
to stick the golf balls with the sticky
detonator<00:02:24.560> shots<00:02:24.860> then<00:02:25.370> launch<00:02:25.850> them<00:02:26.090> over<00:02:26.239> to

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
detonator shots then launch them over to

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:27.640 
detonator shots then launch them over to
the<00:02:26.390> other<00:02:26.450> side<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:26.900> kill<00:02:27.140> your<00:02:27.290> enemies

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
with the gravity hammers and it's it's a

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.729 
with the gravity hammers and it's it's a
very<00:02:31.280> very<00:02:31.910> basic<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:32.570> very<00:02:32.660> simple<00:02:33.140> idea<00:02:33.260> and

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
very very basic and very simple idea and

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.340 
very very basic and very simple idea and
it's<00:02:34.459> not<00:02:34.700> overly<00:02:35.180> complicated<00:02:35.750> but<00:02:35.900> on<00:02:36.170> the

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
it's not overly complicated but on the

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.870 
it's not overly complicated but on the
ones<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:36.650> aren't<00:02:36.860> overly<00:02:37.100> complicated<00:02:37.700> are

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
ones that aren't overly complicated are

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.729 
ones that aren't overly complicated are
usually<00:02:38.239> in<00:02:38.330> my<00:02:38.450> opinion<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.900> most<00:02:39.049> fun<00:02:39.500> and

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
usually in my opinion the most fun and

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.270 
usually in my opinion the most fun and
clever<00:02:39.950> minigames<00:02:40.640> available<00:02:41.420> in<00:02:41.630> halo<00:02:42.280> so

clever minigames available in halo so

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.000 
clever minigames available in halo so

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
your perspective every single round so

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.729 
your perspective every single round so
that's<00:03:11.299> what<00:03:11.390> that<00:03:11.420> was<00:03:11.540> all<00:03:11.690> about<00:03:11.750> but<00:03:12.560> an

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
that's what that was all about but an

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.170 
that's what that was all about but an
issue<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:13.010> have<00:03:13.220> with<00:03:13.250> this<00:03:13.459> map<00:03:13.670> is<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.970> fact

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
issue I have with this map is the fact

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.660 
issue I have with this map is the fact
that<00:03:14.299> if<00:03:14.630> you<00:03:14.780> walk<00:03:14.989> too<00:03:15.170> far<00:03:15.380> back<00:03:16.100> or<00:03:16.459> to<00:03:16.640> the

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
that if you walk too far back or to the

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.039 
that if you walk too far back or to the
left<00:03:16.760> or<00:03:17.090> to<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.209> right<00:03:17.299> as<00:03:17.660> you<00:03:17.690> can<00:03:17.870> see<00:03:17.959> you

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
left or to the right as you can see you

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.539 
left or to the right as you can see you
can<00:03:18.109> see<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.470> little<00:03:18.590> walls<00:03:18.859> of<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.070> hill<00:03:19.220> you

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
can see the little walls of the hill you

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:20.890 
can see the little walls of the hill you
can<00:03:19.579> actually<00:03:19.820> walk<00:03:20.090> outside<00:03:20.540> of<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.750> hill

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
can actually walk outside of the hill

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.600 
can actually walk outside of the hill
and<00:03:21.109> prematurely<00:03:21.709> in<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.130> round

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
and prematurely in the round

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.760 
and prematurely in the round
which<00:03:22.670> is<00:03:22.760> a<00:03:22.790> little<00:03:23.060> bit<00:03:23.150> annoying<00:03:23.390> but<00:03:23.770> it's

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
which is a little bit annoying but it's

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.140 
which is a little bit annoying but it's
not<00:03:24.950> that<00:03:25.130> big<00:03:25.250> of<00:03:25.310> an<00:03:25.460> issue<00:03:25.580> just<00:03:25.700> try<00:03:26.090> to

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
not that big of an issue just try to

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.240 
not that big of an issue just try to
avoid<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.690> walls<00:03:26.900> honestly<00:03:27.830> this<00:03:28.070> is

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
avoid the walls honestly this is

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.040 
avoid the walls honestly this is
probably<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:28.940> best<00:03:29.120> mini<00:03:29.330> game<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:29.570> played<00:03:29.900> on

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050
