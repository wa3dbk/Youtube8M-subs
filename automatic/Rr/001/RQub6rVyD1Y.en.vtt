00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
so I'm assuming usually at the Pandora

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.650 
so I'm assuming usually at the Pandora
after<00:03:24.620> like<00:03:24.740> nine<00:03:25.550> or<00:03:25.670> ten<00:03:25.850> skips<00:03:26.209> it<00:03:26.390> stops

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
after like nine or ten skips it stops
