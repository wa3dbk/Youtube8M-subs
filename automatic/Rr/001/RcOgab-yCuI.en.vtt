00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.420
 may 2011 austria opened the borders 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.519
 for workers from east and west 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.570
 Central europe 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.420
 in the media was the 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.270
 Labor market opening strongly discussed and 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.590
 partly stoked fears 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.510
 the big onslaught on the 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.029
 Although Austrian labor market is 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.949
 Nevertheless, it has been fluctuating ever since 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.189
 many employees 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.040
 especially in the daily or weekly rhythm 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.170
 from the border regions of slovakia 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.960
 hungary and czech republic to vienna and 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.399
 in the wiener environs 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.890
 but who are these people and in 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.260
 which industries do you work with and which ones 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.219
 impact had the opening of the border for 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.850
 the Austrian labor market 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.500
 actually respond to this question 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.300
 now provides a current 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.510
 research project at the institute for 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.520
 sociology of the University of Vienna 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.960
 migration is understood in 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.910
 traditional classical understanding 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.219
 as the permanent shift of the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.030
 center of food that 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.000
 Cross-border commuting is one 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.220
 new shape people wander every day 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.780
 maybe every day in the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.460
 Weekly rhythm or only for a few days 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.570
 in the week and that is of course totally 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.280
 exciting therefore and because the commute in 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.320
 so far little attention has been paid to research 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.210
 roland still found the topic 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.030
 taken up together with his 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.420
 Employees have 2500 persons 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.490
 from hungary czech republic and slovakia 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.320
 who interviewed in the border region work 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.119
 So our study shows that the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.990
 dealers significantly higher 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.950
 to have life satisfaction as 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.930
 people who do not hinder you 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.690
 Persons who belong to these countries 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.270
 live and work mainly 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.430
 that will be the income increase for it 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.810
 blamed so that in the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:55.220
 comparison to the situation at home or in 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:02:00.090
 much more to the countries of origin 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:02.240
 deserves to earn in Austria 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.430
 surveyed commuters 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.290
 an average of eight euros per hour 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.970
 in their countries of origin, the 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.450
 average wage just once the 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.820
 half 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.850
 Therefore, the commute is indeed with a 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.670
 higher quality of life but often with 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.430
 connected to a career change there 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.570
 partly not acquired qualifications 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.330
 be acknowledged 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.190
 The interviewed persons work before 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.050
 Everything in the construction industry in the 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.120
 gastronomy and trade 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.100
 despite the collective agreement, they earn 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.320
 significantly less than Austrians 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.880
 in the same industry if you have the 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.100
 income within the industries 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.070
 compares of commuters from austria 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.640
 commuters earn commuters approximately 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.770
 the half 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.080
 we explain that so that be 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.880
 strongly segmented the labor market is 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.019
 that means the low wage sector very much 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.269
 heavily staffed for commuters and 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.390
 commuters and that many experiences 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.040
 Professional experience made abroad 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.519
 they were not counted for one 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.959
 collective agreements and industry 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.180
 speak experts partly from dubious 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.239
 machinations that is healed 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.100
 properly according to collective agreement 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.959
 paid out the next day 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.959
 worker with a envelope with finds 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.190
 go back to euro 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.920
 this tension between 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.500
 higher quality of life and professional 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.260
 Analyzing reorientation is one 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.780
 the focus of the project is why 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.410
 it's important 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.120
 socio-political phenomena 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.739
 to study scientifically 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.920
 Austria is a country in the heart 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.989
 Europe and the European ones 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.030
 Processes are severely affected 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.350
 the labor market is a topic that always concerns us 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.910
 busy and the labor market in 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.370
 in austria especially in vienna has become 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.930
 changed a lot like a lot 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.820
 attractive city for migrants 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.480
 migrants for immigrants for commuters 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.490
 for centuries probably and the 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.530
 share of people with one 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.780
 Migration background is very big and 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.920
 also grown in recent years as 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.660
 also a topic always in the 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.590
 The public is therefore contested 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.790
 three topics european integration 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.530
 labor market migration at the 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.200
 interface, the project is moving 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.190
 these are just more political issues with 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.120
 a high socio-political 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.160
 relevance though the project of 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.980
 University of Vienna is still running 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.140
 already say the Slovak 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.240
 technical or hungarian commuter and 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.120
 Commuters take the locals 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.600
 not as in many media reports 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.020
 was feared 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.830
 their jobs away because they tend to compete 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.830
 among themselves
