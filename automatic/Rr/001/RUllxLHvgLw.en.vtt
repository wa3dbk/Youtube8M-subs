00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 a pseudo documentary about a 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:12.090
 vampire wg yes so I then 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.190
 Victorian hello together 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.870
 The film factory now gives a lot 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.910
 interesting movie as I think five 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.490
 Room kitchen says is a so-called 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.199
 mockumentary a documentation of this 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.150
 Of course, in the form did not exist 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.439
 because all this is not real what you are 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.359
 sees and there one faces oneself first 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.250
 ask why could it go? 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.109
 I 'll make you a suggestion 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.149
 we are in this movie a vampire wg 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.030
 they were really very much 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.309
 long together the four guys so the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.440
 vampire and just have to deal with the 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.870
 Everyday and with the killing of the 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.760
 tormenting immortality and doing so 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.590
 you have a camera crew what you have 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.020
 accompanied and a documentary yet 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.300
 Not only does that sound crazy? 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.340
 stupid it is completely absurd 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.730
 and how absurd that is this here 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.730
 in the trailer 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:14.750
 wash and garbage bring out that was 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.310
 mainz thick with you is washing up and 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.039
 It has been doing so for five years 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.470
 papers do not play dishes that is 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:24.020
 fully taxed 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.240
 because many papers in a wg together 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.340
 of course there is always one living 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.530
 amount of voltage 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.570
 I should actually rent but pay 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.380
 I do not have to be the cannes of us 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.900
 the rebellious guy he does constantly 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.610
 crazy things say crazy things 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.410
 Are you still a virgin? 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.960
 No I am not I believe we 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.630
 Drink the blood of virgins because that 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:54.380
 sounds cool like so is one 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:58.550
 victorian distance hall of meat 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.250
 maybe a little bit written that is 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:05.800
 my friends came 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.800
 They called me that was loud 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:17.750
 we have to look good once I stand 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.950
 on an air mixture 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:26.470
 is again ready to go 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.470
 and to celebrate was to me 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.940
 if you are a vampire when it is from 6 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.630
 many may become each other now 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.640
 still wonder why so 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.720
 skeptical because I was the trailer 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.750
 but pretty cool 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.560
 and of course the movie is right 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.930
 become cool 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.430
 the thing is you really sit non-stop 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.299
 while watching the movie and thinking 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.090
 only people who have everything 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.920
 taken and smoked must be right 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.170
 have been awesome stuff because the film 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.970
 he himself is so stupid 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.310
 absurd alone in the first ten 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.959
 that I really only a big one 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.140
 lob can pronounce to the makers because 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.580
 they really make it one 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.549
 to build a mood that I just 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.680
 a documentary about a vampire wg 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.720
 look so stupid and over 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.130
 such stupid things are talking about it 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.720
 actually makes no sense if 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.489
 But then you imagine what would be 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.000
 because if there are really vampires 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.620
 would 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.630
 for hundreds of years in a wg 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.670
 then would actually live 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.500
 just say that and do it exactly and that 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.030
 is that what this movie really is 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.700
 makes it special and a small one 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.040
 pearl of the cinemas because one makes 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.450
 just notice that the medium relatively 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.130
 was limited but with an incredible amount 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.410
 attention to detail the whole produced 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.109
 and that's why I say that 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.430
 you movie, lovers out there you have to 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.959
 you watch the movie 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.760
 There is a completely different perspective 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.000
 also filmmaking and I can only 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.139
 say funny without end and really cool 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.819
 made what the film has too 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.560
 at the same time it is that 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.840
 Of course it does not just take pictures from the 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.030
 wg live there are these too 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.500
 typical editorial conversations where 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.970
 they are alone in front of the camera and one 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.660
 tell a little something about yourself too 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.459
 to explain 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.920
 that's it's really completely 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.450
 stupid but I really like it 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.489
 What I think is a pity 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.620
 but afterwards just as the 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.479
 history, you will go so one 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.700
 bit improves and blurs that 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:27.220
 is then somehow still at some 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.570
 are quite intentional but the heart is 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.150
 in the right place and you know that me 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.620
 movies that have just that and with them 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.990
 bring so sympathetic are easy 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.620
 nice to find great and there too 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.270
 heart the filmmaker just feels very much 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.770
 and I think that's actually it 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.600
 most important you look at that 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.130
 you just notice that someone with 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.440
 heartthrob was not just that 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.030
 from the drawing board has taken to script 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.199
 to earn the coal 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.430
 that is not the case here and 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.970
 that's why i can only ask you to look 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.410
 you like this movie like to like 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.000
 even if one or the other 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.620
 has a few weaknesses and not 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.930
 Everything is filmed so horny is mine 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.040
 God in indie project support and from 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.889
 I would like to know you from there 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.410
 you somehow favorite movies the whole 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:09.900
 the simple ones have been shot 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.610
 not really the normal measure 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.580
 to quality in the technical implementation 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.900
 in the cinema would have been great 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.520
 write that please anyway 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.900
 in the comments would be correct 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.010
 then maybe you are interested 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.600
 a few pearls while I still 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.229
 so do not know so in the 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.639
 Comments 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:24.449
 my personal rating would be 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.250
 actually a bit weaker 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.389
 fail because it at the one or 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.919
 others just in the 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:31.020
 narrative structure but weaken a few 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.669
 but there are so horny that the people 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.979
 really made that movie that 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.320
