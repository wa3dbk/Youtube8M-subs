 we are not very 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.300
 the information I'm not sure about this 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.550
 information because they have not talked much 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.370
 of the topic but what I have heard will be 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.990
 so Augustine asks approximately 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.360
 when sandra the game and what are its 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.500
 requirements the game will come out 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.900
 approximately in two years and their 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.340
 requirements will therefore be in the channel I have 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.590
 uploaded a video called you want 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.330
 know if your pc correct crack fein is a 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.310
 video where you created an application with the 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.200
 mini graphic engine tri of a game a 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.590
 I play so to speak where you can 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.200
 see the fps of your game coach and 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.850
 you can see if you're doing well depends on the fps 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.520
 that you go this video is very 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.050
 outdated so soon I think 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.770
 which will be the next video where I'm going to 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:52.880
 make a remake of that video with the 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.740
 new or a map of memories to do 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.860
 to be the pump so just wait for it and 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.470
 You can see if your game 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.510
 if you can run the game my 8 and 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.000

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.619
 they will not ask for any money for free 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.750
 You will be asked for something inside the game 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.640
 it will be for donations the only two 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.340
 donations to improve the game do not go 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.960
 to ask for anything that is with money inside 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.790
 of the game will be totally free 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.850
 for everyone obviously when 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.620
 will come out bout chandler question will you be 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.709
 the worlds of the two seasons I 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.140
 I mean the Indian that is Austin online

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.970
 contain the season of sao the 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.920
 entering floor season is going to 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.500
 have the expansions high and not 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.360

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.640
 they give them the face because they do it but 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.470
 they have still said that they are not going to put 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.840
 nothing will only put the season of 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.760
 zhao jing set his play vice combat 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.709
 will be dynamic will be vessel type only 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.450
 selects the skis will be driven 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.489
 like the game style of it 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.019
 respect called riders for example 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.819
 let's say I 'm with my character 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.650
 and I give a click and down 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.590
 then there are others for the other 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.260
 and then I put the skills and good and what 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.019
 typical of how those shows come out but in 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.489
 an andres game that is said we can 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.709
 study how one does to improve 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.810
 skills for example cooking in facts 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.790
 farms will have player professions 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.680
 let's make them are conversions and I 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.959
 I want to dedicate the goal of the game as well 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.879
 of making the floors as the answer is 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.189
 yes yes they can now different 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.409
 professions including cooking and fishing 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:35.689
 dedicate to make a black beat that we 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:38.299
 respect then means a blacksmith a 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:41.120
 miner a weapon list that means by 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.980
 example the people who are dedicated to 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.319
 create positions using herbs that 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.209
 get in the game can be a 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.609
 map maker is to say that you have 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.010
 a blank map and then peron area 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:54.199
 unknown that nobody has gone and spend the 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.689
 area the drawing of the region and pass it to 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:58.459
 an empty map and then you can sell it to 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:00.379
 price that you want the people that you 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.540
 you want it or put it in a market for 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:05.150
 that people buy it to be a cutter 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.760
 of wood or a wood chopper and a 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.680
 powerful hunter and uncle pledge which 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.660
 will be the main way to get 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.510
 money and how much it will be worth 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.269
 a house the main way to get 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.430
 money will be killing the voices good in 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.860
 actually there is no main way but 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.200
 You bring forth the form where more money thing 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.460
 taking advantage if you take a walk 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.320
 the floors will be killing a boss 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.510
 obviously but let's say that 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.070
 you want to stay in a flat 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.930
 doing other things doing things 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.000
 secondary or alternate things besides 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.250
 pass floors for example you can create your 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.320
 own store you can sell maps it 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.360
 can the professions that I already mentioned 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.070
 previously with all that you can win 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.020
 money you can take advantage of that 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.230
 to get money is like a job in 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:51.170
 real life but let's say you're 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.150
 a rock player and pass the floors also 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.440
 you do not know if you have a profession and it happens 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.260
 the floors you can also take advantage of 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.030
 money you spend on killing a boss and 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.310
 doing it for example is improving your store 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.990
 and how much a house is worth 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.610
 there is no information about that but what 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.890
 yes he can tell you that you can buy a 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.830
 house and turn it into a personal house 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.840
 then it is to live alone or to invite a 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.930
 friend marry you with wives you can 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.760
 turn it into a barracks for you 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.409
 for your clan for your guild and also 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.239
 You can become a 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:23.779
 the only thing they have reported on 

00:05:20.239 --> 00:05:25.489
 houses last question is almost says the 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:28.339
 game interface be equal to that of sao 

00:05:25.489 --> 00:05:30.499
 will be the common like most rpg and 

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:32.839
 how will the graphic style of the game be? 

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:36.229
 say is done or time anime cartoon 

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:38.179
 then the game will be kind to be shader what 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:41.119
 you can search by google the images is 

00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:43.369

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:56.809
 shader and as for the game interface 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:59.089
 it will be as it already shows images of 

00:05:56.809 --> 00:06:00.649
 the previous videos will be like that of 

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:02.179
 sao but once touched to give the 

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:03.919
 factual style fixed because it can not be 

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:06.139
