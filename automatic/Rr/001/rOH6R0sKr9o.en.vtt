00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
in this way you're starting from the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.069 
in this way you're starting from the
middle<00:00:38.129> working<00:00:39.030> forward<00:00:39.329> in<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.780> middle

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
middle working forward in the middle

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.470 
middle working forward in the middle
working<00:00:40.890> back<00:00:41.129> by<00:00:41.460> doing<00:00:41.820> this<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.270> will<00:00:42.420> make

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
working back by doing this it will make

working back by doing this it will make
your<00:00:42.840> application<00:00:43.469> easier<00:00:43.649> rather<00:00:44.129> than

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
your application easier rather than

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.459 
your application easier rather than
trying<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.969> apply<00:00:45.239> from<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> front<00:00:46.079> all<00:00:46.379> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
way up and over to the back so there's a

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.810 
way up and over to the back so there's a
lot<00:00:48.390> less<00:00:48.860> finessing<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.039> film<00:00:50.280> involved

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
yourself a nice straight line for the

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.540 
yourself a nice straight line for the
well<00:03:09.210> let's<00:03:09.450> do<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:09.750> front<00:03:10.280> for<00:03:11.280> the

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
well let's do the front for the

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.110 
well let's do the front for the
quarter-inch<00:03:13.130> you<00:03:14.130> can<00:03:14.280> work<00:03:14.460> off<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.910> gap

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
quarter-inch you can work off the gap

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.699 
quarter-inch you can work off the gap
that's<00:03:15.360> coming<00:03:15.750> off<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.020> paper<00:03:16.230> if<00:03:16.530> you'd

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
that's coming off the paper if you'd

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.130 
that's coming off the paper if you'd
like<00:03:17.300> so<00:03:18.300> you're<00:03:18.450> gonna<00:03:18.540> hold<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.989> material

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
like so you're gonna hold the material

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.210 
like so you're gonna hold the material
firmly<00:03:19.760> keeping<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.850> gap<00:03:21.770> and<00:03:22.770> you<00:03:22.800> just

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
firmly keeping the gap and you just

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.570 
firmly keeping the gap and you just
watch<00:03:23.459> it<00:03:23.670> with<00:03:23.790> your<00:03:23.970> eye<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.510> lay<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.440> down

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
watch it with your eye and lay it down

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.650 
watch it with your eye and lay it down
you<00:03:26.580> can<00:03:26.790> do<00:03:27.180> it<00:03:27.300> again<00:03:27.540> by<00:03:27.780> picking<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.260> up<00:03:29.660> and

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
you can do it again by picking it up and

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.380 
you can do it again by picking it up and
you<00:03:30.750> just<00:03:30.930> simply<00:03:31.140> watch<00:03:31.530> your<00:03:31.770> gap<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:33.030> lay

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
you just simply watch your gap and lay

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.729 
you just simply watch your gap and lay
it<00:03:33.570> down<00:03:34.610> when<00:03:35.610> you<00:03:35.700> get<00:03:35.850> towards<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.270> front

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
it down when you get towards the front

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.790 
it down when you get towards the front
you<00:03:37.739> can<00:03:37.770> do<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.190> same<00:03:38.400> thing<00:03:39.680> keeping<00:03:40.680> your

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
you can do the same thing keeping your

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.270 
you can do the same thing keeping your
gap<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.160> same<00:03:42.170> and<00:03:43.170> then<00:03:43.560> once<00:03:43.800> you<00:03:43.920> have<00:03:44.100> the

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
gap the same and then once you have the

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.979 
gap the same and then once you have the
front<00:03:44.400> installed<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.510> you're<00:03:45.630> basically

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
front installed and you're basically

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.130

the carbon fiber does have a lot of

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.460 
the carbon fiber does have a lot of
forgiveness<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:22.229> it

you can use the edge of your marker and

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.159 
you can use the edge of your marker and

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.210 
then use your squeegee to fold it in and
then<00:05:41.890> do<00:05:42.070> your<00:05:42.280> final<00:05:42.520> trimming<00:05:44.040> so<00:05:45.040> this

more of a professional look on your

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.490 
more of a professional look on your

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
install when you have it completed so

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.380 
install when you have it completed so
that's<00:05:59.979> basically<00:06:00.580> how<00:06:00.700> you<00:06:00.910> would<00:06:01.090> install

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
that's basically how you would install

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.280 
that's basically how you would install
the<00:06:01.870> racing<00:06:02.229> stripes<00:06:02.530> as<00:06:02.919> you<00:06:03.190> can<00:06:03.370> see

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
they're not super difficult to install

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.100
