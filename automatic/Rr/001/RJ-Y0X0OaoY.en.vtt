00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello everyone how good they are I love you 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.020
 comment on two super important things that 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.059
 they spent the first time something happened with 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.730
 my camera then can not record from 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.610
 my camera I am recording from my 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.609
 cellular and well, but we'll still have 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.830
 Sunday of poems and Sunday of 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.740
 writing the second very important thing 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.710
 is that these days last week 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.080
 I received an email from someone who liked it 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.260
 very much this section and he sent me his 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.770
 poem then I think that if you 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.809
 like we can make a fringe inside 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.629
 this same section on Sundays every 15 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.860
 days every month where you can where you 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.480
 we give not only the things that I 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.789
 I write but the things that you 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.829
 so send then yes to you 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.780
 they really liked this idea we can 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.620
 start from next Sunday but 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.210
 I have to write on twitter 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.860
 or in this email to download here below 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.989
 is going to do it just for you or 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.510
 be for this strip if you 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.309
 really like this idea and if it is 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.080
 so you can send me your writings 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.080
 there for me to read them as 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.410
 every kinder 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.750
 today we are going to have a poem is not a 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.810
 poem is a writing talking a 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.690
 little bit of the duel then here 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.000
 I hope you like the poem or the 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.540
 written is called after you when the 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.540
 nostalgia leaves aside the impossible 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.370
 it is more serene the detachment is very much 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.560
 harder to find nostalgia in a 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.210
 moment on the most unlived side of the 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.670
 illusion of witnessing an act 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.860
 wonderful to feel loved not from 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.720
 reminiscences of the past absurd 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.460
 facts that were left behind in 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.100
 the swamp of amnesia in the 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.260
 imperceptible decadence of time I 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.760
 with the evidence in my hands work 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.250
 with the traps that the 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.869
 inconstancy time and so many 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.210
 failed illusions I searched 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.910
 find me with a signal to warn me 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.550
 of a possible emotional strike the role 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.880
 that I have not managed to play the unemployment that 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.310
 answer a prize I need but I am 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.170
 obstinate as the train that starts and leaves 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.860
 from the same place waiting for her to change her 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.600
 destination 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.910
 I want to prevail but I do not 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.350
 reaches the faith I collapsed in a little 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.850
 and yet 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.800
 I'm still here for breaks with 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.600
 intermittence I follow incredibly alone 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.610
 in this fight considering that the 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.210
 changes not only depend on me 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.120
 betting a love maybe failed to a 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.850
 momentary oblivion I keep betting on what 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.340
 that I thought real even if I just follow 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.640
 inventing between dreams the routine that I 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.400
 I would expect to live then I get up 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.319
 incredibly pensive and taciturn 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.489
 empty waiting 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.489
 a possible miracle
