00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.000
 hello everyone today I am not at all 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.340
 standard material and teeth clinics 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.790
 mechanisms and so in his filming me 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.890
 it will help black so here it is 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.240
 we present you a gaming machine which 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.539
 we decided to call 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.490
 17 sticks is a very simple game at the very 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.210
 In fact, there are so many variations in 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.369
 similar games 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.439
 but we decided to dwell on the following 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.109
 we have a virtual chair in front of us 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.719
 the beginning of the game is 17 sticks 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.880
 participants take turns from one 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.070
 up to three sticks and accordingly there is someone 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.870
 will take the last one and won as 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.820
 see here there is a flat two-sided 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.950
 scoreboard with lighting to make it easier 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.989
 navigate as well as two wireless 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.059
 remote on each of which four 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.710
 buttons of the console are taken out separately to 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.899
 again it was easier to navigate 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.910
 the buttons here are simple three buttons 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.250
 allow you to pick up one door and three 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.629
 sticks and one button so you can 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.699
 any moment surrender well on the very 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.920
 the mechanism if someone didn't finish 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.210
 the previous game has a reset button to 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.820
 start the game again 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.070
 well and now let us perhaps spend 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.640
 a couple of trial park to better understand about 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.619
 what is it well what was ready green rock 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.320
 always come in first so i go 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.420
 first and let's say i will take one wand 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.970
 as you can see on the table one stick 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:27.119
 cleaned disappeared and and took away so well 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.850
 continue one by one our task is to bring 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.759
 to the last stick left 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.500
 or say 2 last sticks or third 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.350
 so that you can have them all in one move 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.780
 pick up a black you somehow conceive 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.390
 so one by one yes so well let's estimate 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.329
 we have on the table now what 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.310
 interesting number 13 sticks well let's 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.829
 take it from steam and take three at once 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.909
 I am today a little greedy so you can 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.530
 to attempt 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.360
 well, black 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.250
 I don't even know what tasty is. 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:02.250
 water, too, is also 3 containers and on the window and 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.570
 seems like this time it was a mistake 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.729
 and I won 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.440
 because i take away and then wand input 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.209
 goes black and on the scoreboard we 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.920
 is only four sticks that 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.959
 mean boredom you chopsticks fighting 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.569
 took the minimum she can take one and 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.200
 then leave I will take that is I already 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.420
 won 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:27.269
 well we will finish black or you 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:29.370
 you give up it was clear you could put me 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.080
 one stick oh well basically at the end 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.540
 games can again takes any 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.250
 quantity we take away all that's left 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.470
 let's say i click on 3 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.050
 accordingly it is written that the green player 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.310
 I won in this case and the scoreboard 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.840
 Is restored that is the game 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.239
 automatically restarted 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.970
 and you can start it again well what was 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:52.440
 head another park rematch then 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.510
 start okay this time I will still 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.000
 more greedy and immediately take three sticks 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.519
 and I will again yanchik the same three sticks 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.230
 good three more 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.230
 we will dramatically advance to victory and 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.070
 China yes 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:22.030
 so I did not understand how much there was alone 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:24.430
 that give kakly one too yes it is already 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.890
 I saw but it was unfortunately cognizable 1 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.750
 is only four sticks that 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.430
 means no matter how much I take but 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.860
 since i'm not greedy i will probably leave 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.510
 black three whole sticks and black won 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.340
 i actually even press the button 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.320
 surrender and accordingly issued 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.870
 the message that green gaming has surrendered and 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.270
 victory for the red player as you can see the game 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.790
 very simple fully automatic 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.590
 the mechanism is quite small though not 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.660
 optimized but i'm on it 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.610
 I will not stop this 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.680
 will be another issue in principle to whom 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.750
 I wonder how this type of game works 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.060
 in the description of this video will be a link 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.130
 to download to with this mechanism 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.500
 but on this today everything is big 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.370
 thank you black for her help for helping
