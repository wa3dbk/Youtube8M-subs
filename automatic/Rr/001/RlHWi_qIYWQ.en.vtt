00:00:01.739 --> 00:00:05.740
 you realize that asks who in Altenberger actions first time saw Plus 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.300
 by Carl Zeiss the eyewear manufacturer has arrived in its second revision 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:12.599
 it was already the first one 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.309
 he did not introduce me 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.349
 because they were extremely incompatible with the previous leaders when Sion was 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.380
 I just do it sometimes buys percent the package consists of one of these stores 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.310
 a little on pack with the packaging way 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.270
 so that now the citizens come right to the 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.290
 the essay around 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.910
 is synonymous Akkupack that is, the video will go to the 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.180
 spent on port or iPhone from port 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.390
 There are so many different types of plastic 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.000
 there are quite a few with the half compatible with the iPod Touch 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.130
 iPhone to the iPhone Classic Especially as a pot has Skoda sounds on iPod Reckless 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.400
 Tickets for was 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.520
 otherwise, this little battery pack will lead to 8 hours of playtime 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.760
 you say 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.310
 in practice No, definitely more than two films reached 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.230
 to the small USB port 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.450
 give a no means that one can also a dvd player for example 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.400
 connect 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.630
 um and take the video and then give out on the video glasses 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.889
 little stars ads for 2d and 3d he'll tell me something else 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.420
 and so a little Threat Dalton stops the volume 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.320
 a switch and a line out for headphones if you do not have the 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.450
 around 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.230
 Headphones who want to turn on the glasses are 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.370
 that's the glasses themselves 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.350
 I would have wished for the processing a bit Worcester 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.280
 so it's about 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.670
 This is from the classical theater to the graphics and that 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.230
 that one could not have done better otherwise the heirs can do that though 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.110
 not good it has zoom little small rubber studs here in the ear 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.130
 Clamp and thereby a relatively tight sit the glasses has Robert Kromm down 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.110
 It will not be that hard on the face on the UBP's face 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.300
 addressed headphones can be flexibly set 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.300
 around the tongue small nose holder 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.669
 It can also be changed depending on what Nasemann has and the same 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:17.239
 which can be the sharpness of each image for the left and 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.359
 Right eye jump in 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:23.859
 The whole thing then works so that you can get the iPod Touch in this case 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:27.679
 slides into this device 

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:29.019
 to Dr 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.419
 You look at the state forest of the kit 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:34.610
 and both will be released any video material 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.060
 what the iPod is about 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.139
 m outputs 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:41.129
 or even such stories as per video when you're percent video 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.099
 Metz has around in the cup network, for example 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.160
 then on 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.979
 thereby the video output 

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:50.959
 on the glasses I do not just allow one 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.789
 Play video podcast here now 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:56.629
 the volume can be over this Threats 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.309
 regulate 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:01.489
 and then the trailer will appear 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.789
 ETR Latif around 

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:06.669
 Large picture Ortegas percent 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:11.459
 Picture so if you put the glasses on and looks at the ceiling percent 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.239
 is already as well as a large TV in mind to have already relatively network 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.889
 No to the application fields, according to article still say a lot 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:22.500
 I want the glasses to sit quite well 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.699
 I would have liked better processing 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:29.659
 and by 30 points enteilt relatively heftige 4 euro the bridge can also at 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:34.479
 The test is really source material YouTube is indeed at the forefront of it 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:38.509
 is a few examples of Melzer Verra who the act quite nicely 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.839
 But let's see what the cinema and the percent content providers should be in 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:44.419
 conjure up next time 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.229
 prepared for the Brassens
