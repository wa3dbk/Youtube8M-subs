00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
can't do that on the base game blinds

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.140 
can't do that on the base game blinds
but<00:03:38.540> in<00:03:38.870> this<00:03:39.109> version<00:03:39.949> of<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.400> blinds<00:03:40.790> you

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
but in this version of the blinds you

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.000 
but in this version of the blinds you
can<00:03:41.329> actually<00:03:41.720> see<00:03:41.930> through<00:03:42.319> that<00:03:42.650> we<00:03:42.769> know<00:03:42.979> I

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
can actually see through that we know I

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.460 
can actually see through that we know I
mean<00:03:43.519> the<00:03:43.819> blinds<00:03:44.120> and<00:03:44.359> you<00:03:44.479> can<00:03:44.659> see<00:03:44.840> a<00:03:45.109> little

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
mean the blinds and you can see a little

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.679 
mean the blinds and you can see a little
part<00:03:45.769> of<00:03:45.859> universe<00:03:46.370> as<00:03:46.519> well<00:03:46.669> so<00:03:47.269> I<00:03:47.299> think<00:03:47.419> it

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:47.689 
part of universe as well so I think it

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:49.509 
part of universe as well so I think it

starting doing that I'm a lot of clothes

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.559 
starting doing that I'm a lot of clothes
because<00:04:12.859> you<00:04:12.889> have<00:04:13.159> a<00:04:13.189> lot<00:04:13.519> of<00:04:13.549> Q<00:04:13.909> schemes<00:04:14.299> over

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:20.449 
I also speed up this video very very

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.560 
I also speed up this video very very
slow<00:04:20.870> because<00:04:21.709> this<00:04:22.220> did<00:04:22.699> you<00:04:22.849> turn<00:04:23.210> out<00:04:23.330> to<00:04:23.360> be

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
slow because this did you turn out to be

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.920 
slow because this did you turn out to be
I<00:04:24.080> did<00:04:24.680> this<00:04:24.949> room<00:04:25.610> are<00:04:25.820> really<00:04:25.880> really<00:04:26.630> fast

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
I did this room are really really fast

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.549 
I did this room are really really fast
actually<00:04:27.469> and

00:04:28.549 --> 00:04:28.559 
actually and

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:32.329 
actually and
I<00:04:28.589> I<00:04:29.159> think<00:04:29.819> yeah<00:04:30.409> yeah<00:04:31.409> so<00:04:31.649> I<00:04:31.679> speeded<00:04:32.159> it<00:04:32.219> up

00:04:32.329 --> 00:04:32.339 
I I think yeah yeah so I speeded it up

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:34.669

very<00:04:32.849> very<00:04:33.119> slow<00:04:33.359> I<00:04:33.509> think<00:04:33.809> I'll<00:04:33.929> speed<00:04:34.439> it<00:04:34.469> up

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:34.679 
very very slow I think I'll speed it up

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:36.979 
very very slow I think I'll speed it up
only<00:04:35.719> 200%

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:36.989 
only 200%

00:04:36.989 --> 00:04:38.509 
only 200%
I<00:04:37.019> don't<00:04:37.379> you<00:04:37.499> think<00:04:37.739> I<00:04:38.009> don't<00:04:38.069> really<00:04:38.399> know

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:38.519 
I don't you think I don't really know

actually<00:04:44.699> this<00:04:45.059> is<00:04:45.209> maybe<00:04:45.539> one<00:04:45.869> of<00:04:45.989> the<00:04:46.109> rooms

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
actually this is maybe one of the rooms

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:51.139 
actually this is maybe one of the rooms
I<00:04:46.649> most<00:04:47.249> enjoy<00:04:47.759> because<00:04:48.829> it<00:04:49.829> looks<00:04:50.369> so<00:04:50.699> unique

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:51.149 
I most enjoy because it looks so unique

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:54.229 
I most enjoy because it looks so unique
in<00:04:51.719> a<00:04:51.899> way<00:04:51.929> and<00:04:52.439> I<00:04:52.739> also<00:04:52.949> had<00:04:53.249> some<00:04:53.729> problems

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:54.239 
in a way and I also had some problems

00:04:54.239 --> 00:04:55.909 
in a way and I also had some problems
with<00:04:54.389> the<00:04:54.479> lights<00:04:54.689> if<00:04:55.079> I<00:04:55.289> had<00:04:55.379> to<00:04:55.529> be<00:04:55.589> honest

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
with the lights if I had to be honest

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.219 
with the lights if I had to be honest
because<00:04:56.429> the<00:04:56.669> lights<00:04:56.909> you<00:04:57.089> know<00:04:57.419> it<00:04:57.719> when<00:04:58.049> you

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
because the lights you know it when you

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.219 
because the lights you know it when you
do<00:04:58.439> the<00:04:58.709> lights<00:04:59.129> lights<00:04:59.819> is<00:04:59.999> very<00:05:00.269> important

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
do the lights lights is very important

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.409 
do the lights lights is very important
when<00:05:01.439> you<00:05:01.589> have<00:05:01.619> a<00:05:01.739> photo<00:05:02.039> studio<00:05:02.369> I<00:05:02.759> wanted<00:05:03.359> to

when you have a photo studio I wanted to

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.099 
when you have a photo studio I wanted to
have<00:05:03.569> a<00:05:03.599> perfect<00:05:04.199> light<00:05:04.409> for<00:05:05.279> the<00:05:06.109> photo

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:07.109 
have a perfect light for the photo

00:05:07.109 --> 00:05:09.409 
have a perfect light for the photo
studio<00:05:07.589> and<00:05:07.649> I<00:05:07.949> think<00:05:08.159> I<00:05:08.279> did<00:05:08.579> it<00:05:08.879> turn<00:05:09.149> out<00:05:09.299> to

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
studio and I think I did it turn out to

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.839 
studio and I think I did it turn out to
be<00:05:09.449> really<00:05:09.719> well<00:05:09.959> in<00:05:10.139> and<00:05:10.529> actually<00:05:10.919> I<00:05:11.399> forgot
