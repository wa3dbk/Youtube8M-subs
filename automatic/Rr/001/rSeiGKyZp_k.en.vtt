this is sour check videos hi today I'm
Sanjay<00:00:09.070> videos<00:00:09.640> we're<00:00:09.880> checking<00:00:10.059> out<00:00:10.240> the

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:10.360 
Sanjay videos we're checking out the

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:22.830 
Sanjay videos we're checking out the
cave<00:00:10.650> 504<00:00:19.710> k<00:00:20.710> 504<00:00:21.430> was<00:00:21.640> built<00:00:21.910> in<00:00:22.060> the<00:00:22.090> USA<00:00:22.630> in

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
cave 504 k 504 was built in the USA in

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.760 
cave 504 k 504 was built in the USA in
1960<00:00:23.619> and<00:00:23.830> 1961<00:00:24.670> it<00:00:25.420> comes<00:00:25.660> with<00:00:25.810> 4<00:00:26.080> tubes<00:00:26.380> it's

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
1960 and 1961 it comes with 4 tubes it's

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.279 
1960 and 1961 it comes with 4 tubes it's
about<00:00:26.920> 5<00:00:27.310> watts<00:00:27.730> and<00:00:28.029> has<00:00:28.210> an<00:00:28.359> 8<00:00:28.600> inch<00:00:28.810> speaker

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
about 5 watts and has an 8 inch speaker

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:47.460 
about 5 watts and has an 8 inch speaker
let's<00:00:30.100> just<00:00:30.279> kinda<00:00:30.490> see

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.350 

so<00:00:48.470> these<00:00:48.649> have<00:00:48.890> basic<00:00:49.520> setups<00:00:49.940> like<00:00:50.210> the

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
so these have basic setups like the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.010 
so these have basic setups like the
controls<00:00:50.780> our<00:00:51.079> volume<00:00:52.010> tone<00:00:52.880> and<00:00:53.329> then<00:00:53.840> it<00:00:53.900> has

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
controls our volume tone and then it has

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.200 
controls our volume tone and then it has
a<00:00:54.050> tremolo<00:00:54.620> which<00:00:54.800> has<00:00:55.040> a<00:00:55.070> strength<00:00:55.520> and<00:00:55.760> speed

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
a tremolo which has a strength and speed

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.549 
a tremolo which has a strength and speed
on<00:00:56.420> it<00:00:56.540> so<00:00:56.720> let's<00:00:56.900> just<00:00:57.050> check<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:57.320> tremolo

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
on it so let's just check the tremolo

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.160 
on it so let's just check the tremolo
real<00:00:57.860> quick<00:00:58.070> right<00:00:58.220> here<00:00:58.660> so<00:00:59.660> I'll<00:00:59.750> turn<00:00:59.960> up

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
real quick right here so I'll turn up

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.170 
real quick right here so I'll turn up
the<00:01:00.470> strength<00:01:00.710> quite<00:01:00.980> a<00:01:01.040> bit<00:01:01.309> the<00:01:01.610> speed<00:01:01.940> about

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
the strength quite a bit the speed about

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:27.940 
the strength quite a bit the speed about
mid

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.800 

it<00:01:28.950> sounds<00:01:29.250> great<00:01:29.730> really<00:01:29.970> smooth<00:01:30.300> see<00:01:30.690> what

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
it sounds great really smooth see what

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.880 
it sounds great really smooth see what
it<00:01:30.870> sounds<00:01:30.990> like<00:01:31.140> with<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.380> little<00:01:31.530> more<00:01:31.650> volume

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
it sounds like with a little more volume

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:58.490 
it sounds like with a little more volume
I'll<00:01:32.430> turn<00:01:32.670> up<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.880> volume<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.330> about<00:01:34.640> nine

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.020 

so<00:01:59.500> it's<00:01:59.710> pretty<00:01:59.920> loud<00:02:00.040> I<00:02:00.460> think<00:02:00.760> it<00:02:00.940> sounds

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
so it's pretty loud I think it sounds

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.580 
so it's pretty loud I think it sounds
pretty<00:02:01.180> good<00:02:01.480> let's<00:02:02.140> see<00:02:02.260> what<00:02:02.380> it<00:02:02.470> sounds

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
pretty good let's see what it sounds

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.500 
pretty good let's see what it sounds
like<00:02:02.800> with<00:02:03.040> an<00:02:03.160> overdrive<00:02:03.580> pedal<00:02:03.610> I'm<00:02:04.060> using<00:02:04.210> B

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
like with an overdrive pedal I'm using B

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.780 
like with an overdrive pedal I'm using B
while<00:02:04.720> C's<00:02:05.080> overdrive<00:02:05.620> pedal<00:02:05.950> doesn't<00:02:06.640> really

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
while C's overdrive pedal doesn't really

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.639 
while C's overdrive pedal doesn't really
color<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.450> sound<00:02:07.660> too<00:02:07.840> much<00:02:07.870> it<00:02:08.170> just<00:02:08.350> boosts

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
color the sound too much it just boosts

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.410 
color the sound too much it just boosts
the<00:02:08.860> signal<00:02:09.070> so<00:02:09.520> we<00:02:09.550> can<00:02:09.820> hear<00:02:10.000> what<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.240> to

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
the signal so we can hear what the to

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.730 
the signal so we can hear what the to
sound<00:02:10.810> like<00:02:11.020> out<00:02:11.230> of<00:02:11.290> here<00:02:11.500> when<00:02:11.620> they're

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
sound like out of here when they're

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:55.849 
sound like out of here when they're
boosted

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.559 

I'm<00:02:56.280> just<00:02:56.400> gonna<00:02:56.489> max<00:02:56.819> it<00:02:56.999> on<00:02:57.120> just<00:02:57.329> for<00:02:57.420> the

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
I'm just gonna max it on just for the

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:51.850 
I'm just gonna max it on just for the
heck<00:02:57.659> of<00:02:57.689> it

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.110 

let's<00:03:52.860> put<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.040> little<00:03:53.099> reverb<00:03:53.580> on<00:03:53.760> it<00:03:53.819> just<00:03:54.030> to

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
let's put a little reverb on it just to

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.399 
let's put a little reverb on it just to
see<00:03:54.330> what<00:03:54.450> it<00:03:54.540> sounds<00:03:54.659> like<00:03:54.840> I<00:03:55.080> have<00:03:55.140> this

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409 
see what it sounds like I have this

00:03:55.409 --> 00:04:33.920 
see what it sounds like I have this
reverb<00:03:56.129> to<00:03:56.310> pedal<00:03:56.670> it's<00:03:56.790> really<00:03:56.970> nice

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.570 

right<00:04:34.930> that's<00:04:35.199> just<00:04:35.409> mixed<00:04:35.860> pedals<00:04:36.280> a<00:04:36.340> pair

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
right that's just mixed pedals a pair

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.610 
right that's just mixed pedals a pair
would<00:04:37.300> throw<00:04:37.599> a<00:04:37.629> little<00:04:37.749> distortion<00:04:38.169> with<00:04:38.499> the

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
would throw a little distortion with the

00:04:38.620 --> 00:06:17.779 
would throw a little distortion with the
reverb

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:17.789 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:19.710 

let's<00:06:18.789> take<00:06:18.910> a<00:06:18.940> quick<00:06:19.210> look<00:06:19.360> at<00:06:19.539> this

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
let's take a quick look at this

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.570 
let's take a quick look at this
particular<00:06:19.990> app<00:06:20.530> right<00:06:20.770> here<00:06:20.830> this<00:06:21.069> specific

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
particular app right here this specific

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.450 
particular app right here this specific
and<00:06:22.080> it's<00:06:23.080> mostly<00:06:23.410> original<00:06:23.710> but<00:06:24.220> it<00:06:24.310> does

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
and it's mostly original but it does

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:25.800 
and it's mostly original but it does
have<00:06:24.669> some<00:06:24.880> added<00:06:25.090> things<00:06:25.449> and<00:06:25.660> some

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810 
have some added things and some

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.749 
have some added things and some
different<00:06:26.110> things<00:06:26.139> it<00:06:26.889> has<00:06:27.069> these<00:06:27.250> brass

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:27.759 
different things it has these brass

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:29.189 
different things it has these brass
corner<00:06:28.180> protectors<00:06:28.660> which<00:06:28.840> are<00:06:28.990> really

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 
corner protectors which are really

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:31.020 
corner protectors which are really
really<00:06:29.530> cool<00:06:29.680> I<00:06:29.740> like<00:06:29.979> them<00:06:30.190> a<00:06:30.220> lot<00:06:30.370> I<00:06:30.610> will<00:06:30.880> put

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
really cool I like them a lot I will put

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.779 
really cool I like them a lot I will put
those<00:06:31.150> on<00:06:31.330> anything<00:06:31.740> and<00:06:32.740> then<00:06:32.919> it<00:06:33.009> has<00:06:33.160> in<00:06:33.610> the

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:33.789 
those on anything and then it has in the

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:36.120 
those on anything and then it has in the
back<00:06:34.030> the<00:06:34.419> knobs<00:06:34.690> are<00:06:35.169> chickenhead<00:06:35.860> knobs

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.130 
back the knobs are chickenhead knobs

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.189 
back the knobs are chickenhead knobs
which<00:06:36.550> I<00:06:36.729> am<00:06:36.849> pretty<00:06:37.210> sure<00:06:37.300> are<00:06:37.630> not<00:06:37.810> original

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199 
which I am pretty sure are not original

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:39.659 
which I am pretty sure are not original
I've<00:06:38.259> never<00:06:38.440> seen<00:06:38.650> them<00:06:38.800> on<00:06:38.889> any<00:06:39.099> other<00:06:39.340> cake

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:39.669 
I've never seen them on any other cake

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:42.930 
I've never seen them on any other cake
and<00:06:40.599> then<00:06:40.720> it<00:06:40.810> has<00:06:40.930> a<00:06:40.960> Hammond<00:06:41.910> transformer<00:06:42.910> a

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
and then it has a Hammond transformer a

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.469 
and then it has a Hammond transformer a
new<00:06:43.270> Hammond<00:06:43.960> transformer<00:06:44.970> built<00:06:45.970> into<00:06:46.330> it

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 
new Hammond transformer built into it

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:49.320 
new Hammond transformer built into it
they<00:06:47.080> even<00:06:47.199> had<00:06:47.410> a<00:06:47.440> coal<00:06:47.819> section<00:06:48.819> to<00:06:48.970> make<00:06:49.000> it

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
they even had a coal section to make it

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:50.730 
they even had a coal section to make it
fit<00:06:49.599> because<00:06:49.840> it's<00:06:50.110> a<00:06:50.169> little<00:06:50.409> bigger<00:06:50.620> than

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
fit because it's a little bigger than
