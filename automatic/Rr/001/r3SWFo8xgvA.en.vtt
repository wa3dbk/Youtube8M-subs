00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:09.110
 Hello my name is still 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.179
 Mikhail Baratov 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.160
 I welcome you to the school horizontal bar and our 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.080
 schools still exist thanks 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.800
 Moscow Street Sports Federation 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.779
 subcultures since now workout 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.000
 actively developing the dynamics I decided 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.430
 to dedicate the Turks in principle to him 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.380
 element for the dynamics in the workout also 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.779
 element can be use technology 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.439
 and in jimbory it's 350 degrees and 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.439
 will end 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.120
 I 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.120
 arrange 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:48.030
 array. 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.440
 and today to help not to remove Clement 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.899
 there will be very cool guys 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.339
 Nasonov Kirill and pancakes Leonid looks 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.199
 360 of the stop is pretty simple 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.519
 element however it is very spectacular and in 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.710
 able to diversify your program 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.690
 performances are also training but still 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.580
 the element containing the phase of the flight 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.170
 more screw cannot be easy for 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.049
 one and all may encounter 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.340
 difficulties in studying it 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:14.070
 as with many elements when studying 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.630
 360 people fall into two categories on those 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.869
 who makes the element literally from the first 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.819
 Attempts are not wrong and on those who do 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.310
 800 attempts and only two of them 

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:24.869
 normal straight bases to this element 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.490
 practically non- existent 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.200
 however, there are a number of conditions that 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.159
 it is advisable to perform before 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.630
 study this element 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.640
 since the element is made from front 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.560
 then you need to know how to hit it 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.979
 either teleporting or any other 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.899
 word because in the last phase after 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.209
 flight you find yourself hanging 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.209
 you must have a strong grip 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.549
 excellent and ready but is it still learning 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.140
 this element needs to be enough 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.759
 healthy person for example if you 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.960
 sore feet you should not be taught 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:05.740
 this element and caste sore feet yes 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.420
 ok if all conditions are met 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.459
 couple explore this element 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.340
 the most nutty of you can immediately 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.170
 teach and immediately make them a little afraid 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.120
 start by order start try 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.860
 perform a 360 jump on the ground and 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.690
 decided which way is easier for you 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.400
 perform the same doing on 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.519
 the crossbar because teaching two at once 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.989
 countries in principle are meaningless ways 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.580
 and determine the side of rotation 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.170
 find yourself a horizontal bar but do not rush 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.239
 climb on the first one get for 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.440
 yourself something small either bars either 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.440
 small crossbar 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.209
 the cells do not have this will not work, and so 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.650
 sorting off the rotation in phases 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.540
 First of all, many people think that 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.370
 need to brush exactly for up to the very 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.319
 business while you are on the greeks you are already 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.140
 can rotate 90 degrees 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:53.769
 brush off the neck completely to the sides 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.690
 exactly to the side turning already at 90 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.970
 degrees then have to start abruptly 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.950
 throw a non-supporting hand to yourself 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.930
 back trying to catch the neck for you 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.810
 will inevitably turn on some 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.250
 number of degrees and also if 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.560
 starting from the neck you start to turn 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.870
 tass lift one leg you will have 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.790
 twist even further need 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.420
 only work on the speed of these two 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.980
 movements when you're close for 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.049
 to take the butt as well 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.790
 only your 1 hand will take up the neck you 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.450
 you can still hang on one hand 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.579
 to bring 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.560
 and so you can do the second 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.150
 incomplete 300 degrees and cut for 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.900
 yourself this rotation from one and the other 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.180
 parties 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.829
 I want to note that the rotation is pretty 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.900
 should be done evenly due to and 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.250
 shoulder girdle and legs if something from 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.090
 you will probably get tired of it 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.260
 fall or do not make this element when 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.930
 quite elements should save 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.940
 vertical position you should not 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.160
 wave away and stoop to the side you're not 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.630
 should fall down a stone you should 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.970
 push yourself back up 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.560
 if on a small bar everything went 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.480
 smoothly look for the crossbar 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.830
 slightly higher because on small 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.760
 applied all impossible to do 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:04.130
 purely hook it a great opportunity 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.110
 virtually any element of dynamics 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.240
 require you to sharp from precise movements 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.160
 that is, your swing your rotation should 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.510
 be pretty quick actually than 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.900
 faster you will rotate so 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.790
 the more confident you are to make this element and so 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.440
 smoothly raise the height of the crossbar 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.480
 which you are trying to be in the item 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.370
 the date on which you can perform 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.240
 the element in the hook without catching feet 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.230
 slightly bent knees 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.150
 work this element at that height 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:33.110
 to full stability and then you will be 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.940
 nothing is terrible and now go to 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.710
 debriefing problems and dealing with 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.860
 fear fell no element with which 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.570
 many of you may encounter the first 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.580
 same stupid mistake that people make 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.930
 when studying this element occurs 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.520
 on their little butt not they 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.830
 try instead from maha back 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.050
 ride through the ass at the crossbar 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.970
 and take the fingerboard it can ease 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.440
 for you trying this item however 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.750
 it has nothing to do with 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.140
 do not try to do it real 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.310
 and do not start doing such a move 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.830
 the second mistake is that people are very 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.870
 strongly shrug off the neck and come 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.250
 on the fingerboard ate clinging to his fingers 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.780
 or not at all can catch it in 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.460
 space in any way because 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.810
 located five meters from the crossbars 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.510
 surprisingly afraid of this element 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.190
 can i have already done it a few times 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.140
 I woke up the next day and 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.940
 you are afraid to do it again like 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.370
 achieve stability and fearlessness by 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.140
 spain of this element for this you need 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.550
 set a goal to wave at 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.040
 this item with the least 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.840
 Machs that is, you do let's say 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.150
 paper clip or exit for two and after that 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.370
 try immediately without pause without from 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.200
 maha without touching the fingerboard make this 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.930
 element or at least reduce 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.230
 quantity will push away the crossbar which 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.310
 you commit for from mach 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.770
 when you get to what you can 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.600
 immediately after the clip or immediately after 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.160
 exit make this item to you in 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.380
 principle will be all the same from those conditions 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.210
 perform even if even scraper or 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.710
 the exit did not go quite well 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.510
 then waking up the next day 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.490
 most likely you will calmly relate 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.290
 to this is still a rather interesting thing that 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.150
 depending on your goals this item 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.129
 can be performed either at a pace that is 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.889
 maintaining amplitude after it fell 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:08.689
 son vulture either completely in static 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.360
 position after which you are nowhere 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:13.129
 the Kirov hangs loose it that will execute 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.629
 element tempo you have to brush off 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:16.129
 vulture jump back from him a few 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:18.259
 further in order for your hands 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:19.969
 turned out to be straight even then when you do not 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:21.139
 are exactly under the crossbar then 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:23.330
 high chenet ahead 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:25.069
 if you do not want you to be shaken 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.649
 The way the planet elements exit is to make 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:29.029
 it is practically a hanging position then 

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:30.739
 barely jump away from the neck 

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:31.879
 spin around him and when you 

00:06:30.739 --> 00:06:34.789
 grab the crossbar you 

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:36.619
 almost nowhere turf where that is 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:38.569
 it is such an element that should be given 

00:06:36.619 --> 00:06:40.189
 time to work and confident and good 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:42.589
 then this rather simple element 

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:44.389
 diversifies your program for now 

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:52.729
 try to train spinning and 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:07:01.569
 See the school horizontal bar can and pancakes 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:07:14.949
 Leonid and pancakes Leonid and pancakes Leonid and 

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:14.949
 pancakes Leonid shit there but 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:21.490
 turn away intercept
