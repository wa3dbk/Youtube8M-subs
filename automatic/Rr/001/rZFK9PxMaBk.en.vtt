to<00:00:11.820> start<00:00:12.000> noticing<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.570> I'm<00:00:12.660> in<00:00:12.809> wobbles<00:00:13.620> on

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
to start noticing that I'm in wobbles on

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.519 
to start noticing that I'm in wobbles on
bounced<00:00:14.370> back<00:00:14.580> on<00:00:14.849> my<00:00:15.030> rolls<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.570> night<00:00:15.690> flips

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
bounced back on my rolls and night flips

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.519 
bounced back on my rolls and night flips
and<00:00:16.830> that's<00:00:17.070> due<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.369> besetting<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.439> need<00:00:19.439> to

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
and that's due to a besetting I need to

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.140 
and that's due to a besetting I need to
raise<00:00:19.739> it<00:00:19.980> get<00:00:20.189> rid<00:00:20.339> of<00:00:20.429> that<00:00:20.489> may<00:00:20.789> have<00:00:20.999> that

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
raise it get rid of that may have that

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.450 
raise it get rid of that may have that
snap<00:00:21.480> dialed<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.019> feeling<00:00:22.499> when<00:00:22.679> it<00:00:22.710> looked<00:00:23.249> in

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
snap dialed in feeling when it looked in

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.909 
snap dialed in feeling when it looked in
when<00:00:23.669> you<00:00:23.759> do<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.909> roll<00:00:24.149> or<00:00:24.179> flip<00:00:24.720> bounce<00:00:25.679> back

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
when you do a roll or flip bounce back

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.620 
when you do a roll or flip bounce back
means<00:00:26.159> it's<00:00:26.339> too<00:00:26.519> low<00:00:26.669> need<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.060> raise<00:00:27.239> it<00:00:27.449> i

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
means it's too low need to raise it i

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.109 
means it's too low need to raise it i
also<00:00:28.259> have<00:00:28.499> a<00:00:28.529> high<00:00:28.829> vibrations<00:00:29.489> right<00:00:29.699> here

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
also have a high vibrations right here

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.150 
also have a high vibrations right here
on<00:00:30.300> my<00:00:30.539> pitch<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:30.960> my<00:00:31.109> role<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.710> means<00:00:31.979> my

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
on my pitch in my role and that means my

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.010 
on my pitch in my role and that means my
piece<00:00:32.399> setting<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:32.910> too<00:00:33.149> high<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.720> i<00:00:33.750> need<00:00:33.930> to

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
piece setting is too high and i need to

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.840 
piece setting is too high and i need to
lower<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.770> get<00:00:35.250> rid<00:00:35.400> of<00:00:35.430> those<00:00:35.580> high

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
lower it to get rid of those high

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.240 
lower it to get rid of those high

my<00:00:38.310> yah<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:39.180> if<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.690> haven't<00:00:39.810> done<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.080> you

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
my yah and if you haven't done so you

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.340 
my yah and if you haven't done so you
really<00:00:41.160> need<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.580> adjust<00:00:42.120> your<00:00:42.600> job<00:00:42.930> pit

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
settings if my yop his are locked in but

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.980 
settings if my yop his are locked in but
my<00:00:46.170> rate<00:00:46.470> is<00:00:46.500> too<00:00:46.950> low<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.540> wanted<00:00:48.540> to<00:00:48.660> be<00:00:48.780> much

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:48.990 
my rate is too low I wanted to be much

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.060 
my rate is too low I wanted to be much
snappier<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:50.010> little<00:00:50.490> quicker<00:00:51.740> but<00:00:52.740> once<00:00:52.950> you

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
snappier a little quicker but once you

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.530 
snappier a little quicker but once you
get<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.340> dialed<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.940> makes<00:00:54.329> all<00:00:54.480> the

you<00:00:58.530> need<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.770> do<00:00:58.890> some<00:00:58.920> more<00:00:59.130> adjusting<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.030> I

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.190 

did<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.049> adjustments<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.829> little<00:01:05.129> clip

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
did the adjustments in this little clip

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.929 
did the adjustments in this little clip
it's<00:01:07.200> got<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> much<00:01:07.590> more<00:01:07.799> locked<00:01:08.039> in<00:01:08.189> feeling<00:01:08.729> I

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
it's got a much more locked in feeling I

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.319 
it's got a much more locked in feeling I
feel<00:01:09.119> like<00:01:09.210> I'm<00:01:09.420> flying<00:01:09.719> on<00:01:09.899> Rails<00:01:11.329> getting

rid<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.509> those<00:01:12.600> oscillations<00:01:12.869> they're<00:01:13.560> gone<00:01:13.770> I

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
rid of those oscillations they're gone I

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:16.130 
rid of those oscillations they're gone I
do<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.429> slight<00:01:14.549> wobble<00:01:14.880> right<00:01:15.270> there<00:01:15.509> you

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
do have a slight wobble right there you

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.959 
do have a slight wobble right there you
don't<00:01:16.289> know<00:01:16.350> if<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.469> notice<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.009> pitch<00:01:17.310> but

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
don't know if you notice it on pitch but

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:20.480 
don't know if you notice it on pitch but
that<00:01:18.179> could<00:01:18.329> be<00:01:18.359> due<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.539> wind<00:01:19.159> it<00:01:20.159> also<00:01:20.399> could

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
that could be due to wind it also could

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.459 
that could be due to wind it also could
be<00:01:20.549> due<00:01:20.819> to<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.969> low<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.659> setting<00:01:22.350> I've

slow on it's a wobble to hive i will

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:40.700 
slow on it's a wobble to hive i will
give<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.039> that<00:01:32.270> slow<00:01:33.270> oscillation

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
really shows how well this is tuned is

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.090 
really shows how well this is tuned is
super<00:02:04.270> smooth<00:02:04.540> it's<00:02:04.870> flying<00:02:05.200> great<00:02:05.500> then

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
super smooth it's flying great then

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.590

lot of people try to get that last 2% of

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.640 
lot of people try to get that last 2% of
tuning<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.090> just<00:02:10.270> never<00:02:10.390> happens<00:02:10.899> so<00:02:11.140> good

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
tuning and it just never happens so good

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.850
