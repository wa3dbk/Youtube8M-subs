crystals<00:02:56.230> are<00:02:56.500> super<00:02:57.040> expensive<00:02:57.370> that's<00:02:58.150> one

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
crystals are super expensive that's one

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.270 
crystals are super expensive that's one
of<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.780> reasons<00:02:59.140> why<00:02:59.260> those<00:02:59.500> phone<00:02:59.769> cases<00:03:00.160> are

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
of the reasons why those phone cases are

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.830 
of the reasons why those phone cases are
so<00:03:00.400> expensive<00:03:00.700> because<00:03:00.940> I<00:03:01.239> think<00:03:01.569> they<00:03:01.660> use

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
so expensive because I think they use

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.319 
so expensive because I think they use
all<00:03:02.110> those<00:03:02.620> crystals<00:03:03.160> and<00:03:03.340> they're<00:03:03.819> expensive

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
all those crystals and they're expensive

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:11.129 
all those crystals and they're expensive
and<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:06.720> time<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:08.319> um<00:03:09.600> workmanship<00:03:10.600> that

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.139 
and the time and um workmanship that

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:15.390 
and the time and um workmanship that
goes<00:03:11.560> into<00:03:11.980> these<00:03:12.250> phones<00:03:12.609> is<00:03:12.940> a<00:03:13.810> lot<00:03:14.139> it<00:03:14.470> takes

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
goes into these phones is a lot it takes

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.539 
goes into these phones is a lot it takes
time<00:03:15.700> so<00:03:16.389> I<00:03:16.420> can<00:03:16.630> understand<00:03:17.139> why<00:03:17.350> they<00:03:17.739> charge

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
time so I can understand why they charge

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.780 
time so I can understand why they charge
what<00:03:18.790> they<00:03:18.819> do<00:03:19.000> because<00:03:19.540> if<00:03:20.019> i<00:03:20.260> was<00:03:20.790> taking

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
what they do because if i was taking

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.030 
what they do because if i was taking
orders<00:03:21.970> for<00:03:22.239> people's<00:03:22.569> phones<00:03:22.780> i<00:03:23.049> charge<00:03:23.530> that

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040
