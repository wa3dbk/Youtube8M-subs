that's all we go by and every day we
just<00:01:33.689> live<00:01:34.170> by<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.439> we<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:35.009> anything<00:01:35.189> put

just live by that we can do anything put

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.429 
just live by that we can do anything put
on<00:01:35.579> my<00:01:35.729> set<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.450> uh<00:01:36.479> none<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.320> other

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
on my set to and uh none of the other

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.929 
on my set to and uh none of the other
stuff<00:01:37.650> matters<00:01:37.860> as<00:01:38.130> long<00:01:38.159> as<00:01:38.460> we're<00:01:38.640> back<00:01:38.790> to

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
stuff matters as long as we're back to

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.480 
stuff matters as long as we're back to
back<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.329> think<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.200> my<00:01:40.409> best<00:01:40.710> team<00:01:41.220> all

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
back I think this is my best team all

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.370 
back I think this is my best team all
the<00:01:41.520> way<00:01:41.640> around<00:01:41.820> since<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.360> played<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.170> mean

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
the way around since I played and I mean

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.929 
the way around since I played and I mean
that<00:01:43.560> balance<00:01:44.040> wise<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.490> all<00:01:44.579> offense<00:01:44.820> and

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
that balance wise and all offense and

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.700 
that balance wise and all offense and
defense<00:01:45.299> we've<00:01:45.540> got<00:01:45.840> two<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.560> top

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
defense we've got two of the top

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.319 
defense we've got two of the top
receivers<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.369> area<00:01:47.729> with<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.030> top

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
receivers in the area with the top

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.210 
receivers in the area with the top
quarterback<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.079> area<00:01:49.409> statistically<00:01:50.100> in

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
quarterback in the area statistically in

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.469 
quarterback in the area statistically in
the<00:01:50.310> way<00:01:50.430> he's<00:01:50.579> playing<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.939> think<00:01:51.180> then<00:01:51.360> we've

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the way he's playing I think then we've

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.090 
the way he's playing I think then we've
got<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.689> ground<00:01:52.110> attack<00:01:52.290> but<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.920> biggest

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
got a ground attack but the biggest

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.319 
got a ground attack but the biggest
thing<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.670> think<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:54.000> they're<00:01:54.119> buying

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
thing is I think that they're buying

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.149 
thing is I think that they're buying
into<00:01:54.600> each<00:01:54.689> other<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.110> just<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.439> wonderful<00:01:55.680> mix

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
into each other is just a wonderful mix

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.340 
into each other is just a wonderful mix
of<00:01:56.430> guys<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.090> it's<00:01:57.540> really<00:01:57.750> neat<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.930> see<00:01:58.049> as<00:01:58.320> a

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
of guys and it's really neat to see as a

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.010 
of guys and it's really neat to see as a
coach<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.649> it's<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.219> team<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.759> a<00:02:00.149> hundred<00:02:00.840> guys

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
coach that it's a team of a hundred guys

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.929 
coach that it's a team of a hundred guys
but<00:02:01.649> then<00:02:01.770> when<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.250> look<00:02:02.460> at<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.640> diversity

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
but then when you look at the diversity

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.910 
but then when you look at the diversity
on<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.360> team<00:02:03.570> but<00:02:04.020> yet<00:02:04.170> they're<00:02:04.500> not<00:02:04.710> allowing

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
on the team but yet they're not allowing

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.410 
on the team but yet they're not allowing
it<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.159> be<00:02:05.310> diverse<00:02:05.670> they're<00:02:05.939> allowing<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.360> to

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
it to be diverse they're allowing it to

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.910 
it to be diverse they're allowing it to
be<00:02:06.630> one<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.110> think<00:02:07.380> that's<00:02:07.530> what's<00:02:07.680> making

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
be one and I think that's what's making

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.199 
be one and I think that's what's making
it<00:02:08.069> special<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.520> year<00:02:08.580> they're<00:02:08.849> all<00:02:08.970> buying

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
it special this year they're all buying

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.639 
it special this year they're all buying
into<00:02:09.330> each<00:02:09.599> other<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.050> buying<00:02:10.200> into<00:02:10.440> what<00:02:10.470> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
into each other and buying into what the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.710 
into each other and buying into what the
coaches<00:02:10.950> are<00:02:11.069> asking<00:02:11.400> them<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.610> do<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:11.970> prac

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
coaches are asking them to do in prac

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.140 
coaches are asking them to do in prac
and<00:02:13.020> on<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.770> off<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.040> field<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.940> witness

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
and on and off the field the witness

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.420 
and on and off the field the witness
right<00:02:15.510> now<00:02:15.660> we<00:02:15.720> we<00:02:16.410> just<00:02:16.590> gotta<00:02:16.740> keep<00:02:17.220> playing

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
right now we we just gotta keep playing

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.130 
right now we we just gotta keep playing

our game for and stay together because a

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.840

lot of players sometimes get big-headed

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.270 
lot of players sometimes get big-headed
and<00:02:21.270> I<00:02:22.020> can't<00:02:22.440> do<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:22.590> so<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:22.890> got<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.100> keep<00:02:23.160> my
