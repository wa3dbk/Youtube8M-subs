00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.900
- How many of you watch
"Grey's Anatomy"?

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.233
Anybody, yes?
[cheers and applause]

00:00:03.233 --> 00:00:05.300
[cheers and applause]

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.366
Patrick Dempsey's character
came to the end of the road.

00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:10.200
Actually, technically, he came
to the middle of the road,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.366
and then he got hit by a truck.

00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.800
[audience laughter]

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.666
A lot of people were shocked
and saddened by this,

00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:16.366
because it's hard to say
good-bye to a character

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.766
you've known for a long time.

00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:20.433
Now, on
a totally unrelated note,

00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:22.700
we're having a problem with
our air conditioning,

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.700
and so I asked Gina,
our model from Cat Week,

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.300
to take a look at it.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.400
[audience murmurs and laughs]

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.633
I hope she knows
what she's doing.

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:31.933
Gina is on the roof,
four stories above ground,

00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.533
no safety railing,
in six-inch heels.

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:37.000
I want to see how she's doing.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.833
There she is.
[audience murmurs and laughs]

00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:42.466
Gina, be careful up there.
Okay, don't drink--oh.

00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:43.466
- Whoopsie!

00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:49.133
Whoa...

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.166
[audience laughter]

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:54.066
Aah...

00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.100
[grunt]

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.700
- Oh.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.600
Gina, you okay?

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.533
Oh, her hair came off,
she hit so hard.

00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:01.900
[audience laughter]

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.866
Who could've predicted
that would happen?

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.666
Luckily, I prepared
a montage of Gina

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:08.200
just in case something horrible
would happen to her.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.466
Let's take a look back.

00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:13.833
[Paul Young's
"Every Time You Go Away" plays]

00:01:13.833 --> 00:01:17.833
[singing]
- Every time you go away

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:23.266
You take a piece of me with you

00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:29.466
Every time you go away

00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:35.366
You take a piece of me with you

00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:36.866
Ooh-ooh...

00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:40.166
[audience laughter]

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.933
[cheers and applause]

00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:50.200
- Oh.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.866
I don't know if I can go on.

00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.066
[audience laughter]

00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:54.466
I was wrong.
I can.

00:01:54.466 --> 00:01:55.933
[audience laughter]
It's time to look at some of

00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:57.233
the photos you sent in
for our segment

00:01:57.233 --> 00:01:59.400
"What's Wrong With These
Photos?" Photos.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.533
[funk music]
[cheers and applause]

00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:05.366
These are sent in from
our viewers.

00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:06.466
Thank you for doing that.

00:02:06.466 --> 00:02:09.033
Tammy Lawler
from Rochester, Minnesota:

00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:11.266
"Last month I took my family to
Disney on Ice.

00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:13.433
"It featured all of our favorite
Disney characters,

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:15.866
"especially Dory,
but from the front,

00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:18.766
there was something about Dory
that looked a little wrong."

00:02:19.866 --> 00:02:21.233
(audience) Oh!
[laughter]

00:02:21.233 --> 00:02:26.300
[audience laughter]

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.566
And I changed the tune to

00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:28.933
[singing]
"Just stop staring,

00:02:28.933 --> 00:02:30.533
Just stop staring..."

00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:31.666
[audience laughter]

00:02:31.666 --> 00:02:35.766
Carrie...Wally or Waley,
in Nanaimo? Nanemo?

00:02:35.766 --> 00:02:37.166
(man) Nanaimo.
- Nanaimo.

00:02:37.166 --> 00:02:38.233
Really?

00:02:38.233 --> 00:02:39.533
Nanaimo, British Columbia.

00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:41.266
"This is a photo of me
and my best friend.

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:42.666
"We took it using a self-timer.

00:02:42.666 --> 00:02:46.166
Just so you know,
nobody was seriously injured."

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:54.166
[audience laughter]

00:03:00.733 --> 00:03:04.166
That may be my pho--my favorite
photo I've ever seen,

00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:05.933
in my life.
[audience laughter]

00:03:05.933 --> 00:03:07.333
She says no one
was seriously injured.

00:03:07.333 --> 00:03:09.700
Clearly, somebody was injured.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.966
Ah, boy, that photo
brings back memories.

00:03:11.966 --> 00:03:13.333
[audience laughter]
It reminds me of...

00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:16.100
Gina.
I miss her so much.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.866
(woman's voice)
Oh, thank you, Ellen!

00:03:17.866 --> 00:03:19.733
- What?
Who said that?

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:21.833
- I did.
It's me, Gina, Ellen.

00:03:21.833 --> 00:03:24.300
- Gina?
What hap--are you okay?

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.433
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:31.366
[cheers and applause]

00:03:31.366 --> 00:03:32.366
- You're missing a--
[laughs]

00:03:32.366 --> 00:03:34.700
[cheers and applause]

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.033
You fell off the roof.
How are you okay?

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:38.733
- Something must've cushioned
my fall.

00:03:38.733 --> 00:03:40.333
- Uh huh.
[audience laughter]
