coming<00:01:55.260> from<00:01:55.560> within<00:01:55.800> the<00:01:55.860> problem<00:01:56.280> itself

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
coming from within the problem itself

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.090 
coming from within the problem itself
and<00:01:56.820> we<00:01:57.510> need<00:01:57.660> to<00:01:57.750> scale<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.050> up<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.830> make<00:01:59.010> sure

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
and we need to scale it up to make sure

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.280 
and we need to scale it up to make sure
that<00:01:59.220> it<00:01:59.370> becomes<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.760> success<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.510> we<00:02:01.110> can

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
that it becomes a success and we can

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.560 
that it becomes a success and we can
replicate<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.220> other<00:02:02.400> blighted<00:02:03.180> areas

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
replicate this in other blighted areas

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.740 
replicate this in other blighted areas
from<00:02:04.260> one<00:02:04.470> recycler<00:02:05.100> back<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.460> mid<00:02:05.640> 2012<00:02:06.390> there

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
from one recycler back in mid 2012 there

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.650 
from one recycler back in mid 2012 there
are<00:02:06.869> now<00:02:06.990> 16<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:08.550> award<00:02:08.789> winning<00:02:09.000> project<00:02:09.539> is

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
are now 16 the award winning project is

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.630 
are now 16 the award winning project is
also<00:02:09.959> looking<00:02:10.259> into<00:02:10.440> partnerships<00:02:11.070> to<00:02:11.220> expand

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
also looking into partnerships to expand

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.420 
also looking into partnerships to expand
to<00:02:11.790> other<00:02:11.910> cities<00:02:12.450> they<00:02:13.230> may<00:02:13.410> face<00:02:13.680> heaps<00:02:14.220> of

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
to other cities they may face heaps of

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.370 
to other cities they may face heaps of
challenges<00:02:15.030> but<00:02:15.420> they<00:02:15.570> appear<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.080> be<00:02:16.200> winning

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
challenges but they appear to be winning
