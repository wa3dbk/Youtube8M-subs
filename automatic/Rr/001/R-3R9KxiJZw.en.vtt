the first third of the egg whites in and

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.289 
the first third of the egg whites in and
just<00:01:36.119> give<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.570> quite<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:37.079> good<00:01:37.650> beat<00:01:38.299> because

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
just give that quite a good beat because

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.899 
just give that quite a good beat because
it<00:01:39.420> kind<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.689> basically<00:01:40.110> then<00:01:40.520> allows<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.729> to

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
it kind of basically then allows you to

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.510 
it kind of basically then allows you to
fold<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.450> rest<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.110> mark<00:01:44.009> pause<00:01:44.310> the

third<00:03:00.140> into<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.650> rice<00:03:00.829> pudding<00:03:01.100> mixture

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
third into the rice pudding mixture

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:11.670 
third into the rice pudding mixture
that's<00:03:01.790> been<00:03:01.970> cooked<00:03:02.269> and<00:03:02.510> cooled

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.720 

particularly<00:03:12.680> with<00:03:13.070> this<00:03:13.220> one<00:03:13.370> because<00:03:13.519> it's

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
particularly with this one because it's

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.030 
particularly with this one because it's
obviously<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.180> little<00:03:14.299> bit<00:03:14.450> more<00:03:14.690> fragile

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
obviously a little bit more fragile

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.880 
obviously a little bit more fragile
because<00:03:16.040> of<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.730> density<00:03:17.390> of<00:03:17.420> these<00:03:17.600> grains

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
because of the density of these grains

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.530 
because of the density of these grains
and<00:03:18.890> you're<00:03:19.070> using<00:03:19.280> a<00:03:19.489> lot<00:03:19.730> of<00:03:19.760> pace<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:20.420> egg

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
and you're using a lot of pace to egg

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.000 
and you're using a lot of pace to egg
quite<00:03:20.750> here<00:03:20.959> which<00:03:21.079> is<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.410> think<00:03:21.680> it's<00:03:21.799> great

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
quite here which is I think it's great

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.160 
quite here which is I think it's great
because<00:03:22.160> some<00:03:22.459> souffles<00:03:22.910> are<00:03:23.030> all<00:03:23.239> people

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
because some souffles are all people

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.630 
because some souffles are all people
think<00:03:24.320> they<00:03:24.470> might<00:03:24.680> rise<00:03:24.980> like<00:03:25.310> this<00:03:25.459> they

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
think they might rise like this they

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.819 
think they might rise like this they
look<00:03:25.790> amazing<00:03:26.239> but<00:03:26.630> they<00:03:26.750> all<00:03:26.900> air<00:03:27.380> and<00:03:27.739> it

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
look amazing but they all air and it

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.229 
look amazing but they all air and it
should<00:03:27.980> have<00:03:28.100> a<00:03:28.160> bit<00:03:28.340> of<00:03:28.370> depth<00:03:28.670> and<00:03:28.910> volume

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
should have a bit of depth and volume

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.720 
should have a bit of depth and volume
and<00:03:29.390> flavor<00:03:29.660> to<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:29.930> looks<00:03:30.650> good<00:03:30.859> pan<00:03:31.579> and

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
and flavor to it looks good pan and

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.250
