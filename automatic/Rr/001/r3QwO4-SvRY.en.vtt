00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.890
 what is a wardrobe background I'm glad of 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.750
 that you ask me this question a fund of 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.650
 closet certainly is not the part 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.650
 back of the furniture 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.980
 are those garments or accessories to 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:33.000
 which you can always use 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.160
 they will accompany you for a long time 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.980
 and are those that you will put those days 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.930
 that you have nothing to wear that in 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.930
 reality is that you do not know what to wear 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.190
 the wardrobe bottom should be 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.890
 It built by yourself and should 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.230
 adapt to your style and way of life this 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.870
 is 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.620
 the first commandment of the fund of 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.170
 closet 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.789
 Always remember the following 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.800
 the wardrobe background was created as a 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.780
 lifeguard did not tell you that you used 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.040
 those days when you do not know what 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.270
 put on or in those days when 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.270
 you want to be sure 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.570
 because it was made up of pieces 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.600
 that will never fail you 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.070
 because it will serve to make you with pieces 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.900
 timeless that will be in your closet 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.920
 for a long time and that will be one 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.920
 wonderful quality 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.160
 and because ultimately they will serve to 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.080
 when you do not want to complicate your life or 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.730
 get out of the classic 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:40.220
 so 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.220
 I need in my sea bottom 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.530
 let's start with knowing three rules 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.860
 basic 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.570
 one as I told you the garments that form 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.640
 part of your wardrobe background have to 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.110
 be temporary and the best thing 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.870
 should offer a large number of 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.970
 combinations and here I remind you that the 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.630
 course of costume seeds was something 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.520
 that we left very clear 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.570
 The clothes in the wardrobe are usually 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.570
 be seeds of the current 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.640
 and of course they should be the ones that you 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.830
 feel sadder and here you will have to 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.019
 take hold of the course of body shapes 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.890
 and colors to accept when you 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:22.750
 buy these parts 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:26.140
 welcome to this interesting course 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.020
 the course consists of two parts first 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.180
 party is a wardrobe 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.280
 we all face each morning to 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.050
 our wardrobe to our dressing room and 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.760
 many times we do not know what to wear or 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.890
 we do not know if we really have a 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.410
 closet bottom as defined 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.120
 in the books the first part of the course 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.950
 is going to talk about this what is a 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.150
 closet bottom that are supposed to be 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.280
 those pieces that you have to have 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.190
 always logically adapted to your type 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.960
 and your lifestyle 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.020
 once you know what these are 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.400
 clothes on which you can base your 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.890
 wardrobe you will encounter a problem 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.480
 I do not have them in my closet or I have 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.909
 in my closet it's worth 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.799
 perfect the second part of the course you 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.599
 is going to explain how to deal with that 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.250
 closet once you know what a 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.040
 wardrobe that is not part of 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.290
 behind the furniture once you know what 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.849
 it's a wardrobe background , you're going to analyze your 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.890
 own closet are you going to make her a 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.049
 cleaning and from there you will extract what 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.329
 I call seeds of costume very 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.920
 important the costume seeds are 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.310
 those here the bricks here the 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.459

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.450
 fundamental things you need to 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.610
 When you open your wardrobe, never again 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.470

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:46.380
