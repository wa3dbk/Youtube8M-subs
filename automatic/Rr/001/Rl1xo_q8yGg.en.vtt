this<00:02:30.620> is<00:02:30.829> the<00:02:31.129> stock<00:02:31.909> cooler<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:33.680> have<00:02:34.159> to<00:02:34.280> say

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
this is the stock cooler I have to say

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.349 
this is the stock cooler I have to say
it's<00:02:34.609> it<00:02:34.999> feels<00:02:36.219> heavier<00:02:37.219> and<00:02:37.489> nicer<00:02:37.999> than<00:02:38.150> the

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359 
it's it feels heavier and nicer than the

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:44.140

they<00:02:48.530> look<00:02:48.709> kind<00:02:49.370> of<00:02:49.459> similar<00:02:49.700> I<00:02:49.909> think<00:02:50.000> the

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
they look kind of similar I think the

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.649 
they look kind of similar I think the
fan<00:02:50.510> blades<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:51.109> slightly<00:02:51.409> different<00:02:52.659> most

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.179 
fan blades a slightly different most
notable<00:02:54.049> thing<00:02:54.109> about<00:02:54.290> these<00:02:54.560> two<00:02:54.709> coolers<00:02:55.069> is

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:55.189 
notable thing about these two coolers is

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:57.330 
notable thing about these two coolers is
one<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.669> weights<00:02:55.849> this<00:02:56.269> one<00:02:56.840> on<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:56.989> Left

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
one the weights this one on the Left

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.470 
one the weights this one on the Left
which<00:02:58.340> is<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.579> anniversary<00:02:59.060> edition<00:02:59.090> one

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
which is the anniversary edition one

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.059 
which is the anniversary edition one
feels<00:02:59.689> heavier<00:03:00.049> due<00:03:00.799> to<00:03:01.129> the<00:03:01.629> swinging<00:03:02.629> around

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
feels heavier due to the swinging around

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.220 
feels heavier due to the swinging around
the<00:03:04.069> plastic<00:03:04.389> due<00:03:05.389> to<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.599> copper<00:03:05.810> base<00:03:06.049> if

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
the plastic due to the copper base if

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.539 
the plastic due to the copper base if
you<00:03:06.260> see<00:03:06.469> the<00:03:06.560> anniversary<00:03:07.069> edition<00:03:07.099> has<00:03:07.519> a

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
you see the anniversary edition has a

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.720 
you see the anniversary edition has a
copper<00:03:07.969> base<00:03:08.239> cooler<00:03:09.109> whereas<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.129> Pentium

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
copper base cooler whereas the Pentium

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.470 
copper base cooler whereas the Pentium
standard<00:03:11.449> G<00:03:11.659> 3220<00:03:12.650> has<00:03:12.859> just<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.549> magnum

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
standard G 3220 has just a magnum

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.619 
standard G 3220 has just a magnum
aluminium<00:03:15.019> base<00:03:15.760> there<00:03:16.760> so<00:03:17.299> I'm<00:03:17.359> expecting

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
aluminium base there so I'm expecting

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.569 
aluminium base there so I'm expecting
they're<00:03:18.049> obviously<00:03:18.829> better<00:03:19.069> performance

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
they're obviously better performance

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.429 
they're obviously better performance
from<00:03:19.699> this<00:03:19.819> cooler<00:03:20.090> here<00:03:20.269> I'm<00:03:20.900> gonna<00:03:21.109> use<00:03:21.199> the

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:21.439 
from this cooler here I'm gonna use the

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:23.020 
from this cooler here I'm gonna use the
stock<00:03:21.709> paste<00:03:22.010> with<00:03:22.280> this<00:03:22.430> I<00:03:22.579> didn't<00:03:22.879> when<00:03:23.000> I

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
stock paste with this I didn't when I

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.020 
stock paste with this I didn't when I
installed<00:03:23.599> the<00:03:23.840> Pentium<00:03:24.829> cooler<00:03:25.099> as<00:03:25.609> I<00:03:25.639> count

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
installed the Pentium cooler as I count

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.849 
installed the Pentium cooler as I count
from<00:03:26.629> the<00:03:26.780> life<00:03:26.959> of<00:03:27.109> me<00:03:27.260> they<00:03:27.379> my<00:03:27.530> hands<00:03:27.769> on<00:03:27.829> my

optics over five a pretty weighty cool

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:32.559 
optics over five a pretty weighty cool
of<00:03:30.530> this<00:03:30.680> is<00:03:30.949> actually<00:03:31.310> one<00:03:31.430> of<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.609> from<00:03:32.540> the

better stock a little more sweetly stop

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.879 
better stock a little more sweetly stop
coolers<00:03:35.449> I've<00:03:35.540> actually<00:03:35.659> ever<00:03:35.840> felt<00:03:36.139> I've

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
coolers I've actually ever felt I've

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:38.199 
coolers I've actually ever felt I've
read<00:03:37.189> some<00:03:37.370> pretty<00:03:37.459> good<00:03:37.669> things<00:03:37.879> about<00:03:38.000> this

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
people get cracking overclock for this I

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.760 
people get cracking overclock for this I
really<00:04:31.280> hope<00:04:31.490> that<00:04:31.610> I<00:04:32.060> can<00:04:32.389> do<00:04:33.139> well<00:04:33.289> myself

everything online I thought had a few
scratches<00:04:40.340> on<00:04:40.610> it<00:04:40.729> that's<00:04:41.330> pretty<00:04:41.479> much<00:04:41.570> it

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
scratches on it that's pretty much it

done I just wanted you guys to see the

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.129 
done I just wanted you guys to see the
differences<00:04:43.729> in<00:04:43.880> the<00:04:43.940> coolers<00:04:44.240> as<00:04:44.360> I<00:04:44.510> had<00:04:44.930> seen

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
differences in the coolers as I had seen

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:46.930 
differences in the coolers as I had seen
a<00:04:45.199> review<00:04:45.529> of<00:04:45.650> this<00:04:45.770> and<00:04:46.010> obviously<00:04:46.550> cooler

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
a review of this and obviously cooler

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.659 
a review of this and obviously cooler
was<00:04:47.029> different<00:04:47.419> that<00:04:47.570> again<00:04:47.870> is<00:04:48.050> the

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
was different that again is the
