 April beauty these options here for you 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:25.030
 so how do I know which virus is 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:29.140
 and which is not a very simple virgin 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:32.280
 taking this first option in which 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:38.530
 so called standard 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:42.910
 the others all having x and y extension 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:46.420
 z it may be logical that we too 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.190
 You have to use the logic that 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.680
 programs that I know are 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.940
 installed on my computer so let's 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:58.019
 there we will open Here appears the 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:05.880
 following the pattern has this one here 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:09.880
 advancia system wants 8 he pointed out that 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:13.630
 is to raise it up to here 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:17.950
 the advanced systemcare 186 note it has 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:21.579
 the option point and xz only activate it 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.280
 system wants 8 is a program in which 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.950
 Use here on my computer, okay? 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.910
 seeing in which you have here to install 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.950
 you 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:39.670
 then he discards a second option 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:43.239
 is google chrome high luxury is also com 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:47.470
 chrome dot and xz but google chrome 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:50.739
 is also my default browser for 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.090
 use of the internet so it also 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.950
 I discard 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.870
 notice these young people and have the 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.040
 termination exe z 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:06.129
 only these two have their own names 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:10.840
 advances have either google chrome already 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:13.690
 only these three others here do not have 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:18.130
 men and his determination 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:22.600
 and it is also x le look here by chance is 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:25.600
 the grievance and Venus as the other and hx 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:29.680
 and see me, I do not even know what 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:33.280
 then summarizing when a file that 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:38.169
 it is inside this pastry has the 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:41.860
 termination and it does not have a 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:44.590
 fixed name does not have a proper name and I 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.729
 I do not know I've never seen this file in my 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.660
 computer 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:52.570
 it is the virus you are doing with 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.720
 that my system will stop you as the 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.680
 system slow as the system does not 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.110
 before 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.680
 then the three naughty viruses that I 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.490
 I have these from here and if this one I 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.560
 I do 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:12.340
 right I click delete sure yes 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:18.250
 right click delete and yes sure 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:20.710
 the last one also yes before 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:24.370
 only the default folder in which I do not 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.139
 I can delete the advances have want me 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.840
 I know and I will be in my 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:31.240
 computer and it has its own name and the 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:36.010
 google chrome also to my browser 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:38.349
 standard made this I fucking close 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:42.729
 start my computer so that the 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:46.150
 settings are ready and that 's it 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:48.190
 an easy practice tip that only gives a 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.860
 giant result 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:54.130
 So how do you take the kids out? 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:58.180
 the virus installs itself without using program 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:06:00.669
 antivirus in nothing by hand only 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.900
