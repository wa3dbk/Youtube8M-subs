recently<00:00:02.939> being<00:00:03.210> introduced<00:00:03.750> my<00:00:04.170> question<00:00:04.620> is

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
recently being introduced my question is

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:21.200 
recently being introduced my question is
did<00:00:05.069> toyota<00:00:05.490> let<00:00:05.730> us<00:00:05.819> down<00:00:18.529> so<00:00:19.529> has<00:00:20.070> toyota<00:00:20.760> led

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
did toyota let us down so has toyota led

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.000 
did toyota let us down so has toyota led
us<00:00:21.359> down<00:00:21.689> well<00:00:22.199> as<00:00:22.410> some<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:22.800> guys<00:00:22.949> know

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
us down well as some of you guys know

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.040 
us down well as some of you guys know
this<00:00:23.460> past<00:00:23.760> summer<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.119> had<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.480> opportunity

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
this past summer I had the opportunity

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.550 
this past summer I had the opportunity
to<00:00:25.109> drive<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.680> 2012<00:00:26.630> 4runner<00:00:27.630> trail<00:00:27.960> edition

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
to drive the 2012 4runner trail edition

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.960 
to drive the 2012 4runner trail edition
and<00:00:28.710> frankly<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.279> thought<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.699> thing<00:00:29.939> was

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
and frankly I thought that thing was

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.089 
and frankly I thought that thing was
awesome<00:00:30.150> but<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.779> did<00:00:30.840> have<00:00:31.109> some<00:00:31.349> complaints

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
awesome but I did have some complaints

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.549 
awesome but I did have some complaints
about<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.340> namely<00:00:33.059> as<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.480> applied<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.440> the

in the long run now don't necessarily
agree<00:01:07.950> with<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.280> but<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.610> did<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.299> know<00:01:09.420> throw
