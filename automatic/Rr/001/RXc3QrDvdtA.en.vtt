00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
12s and these it does at least to me

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.630 
12s and these it does at least to me
seemed<00:00:31.619> like<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.920> quality<00:00:32.219> went<00:00:32.399> up<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.610> little

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
seemed like the quality went up a little

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.459 
seemed like the quality went up a little
bit<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.180> mean<00:00:33.390> it's<00:00:33.510> nothing<00:00:33.690> too<00:00:34.110> noticeable

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469
