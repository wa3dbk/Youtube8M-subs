power saving so make sure this you have

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.900 
power saving so make sure this you have
this<00:00:33.329> passing<00:00:33.719> option<00:00:34.050> enabled<00:00:34.500> in<00:00:35.010> case<00:00:35.280> you

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
this passing option enabled in case you

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.360 
this passing option enabled in case you
are<00:00:36.000> not<00:00:36.149> paying<00:00:36.420> me<00:00:36.570> -<00:00:37.020> games<00:00:37.260> or<00:00:37.469> heavy

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
are not paying me - games or heavy

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.670 
are not paying me - games or heavy
applications<00:00:39.059> because<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.840> will<00:00:40.079> do<00:00:40.500> all

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
applications because it will do all

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.369 
applications because it will do all
these<00:00:40.860> things<00:00:40.920> CPU<00:00:41.610> power<00:00:41.730> saving<00:00:42.379> screen

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
these things CPU power saving screen

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.110 
these things CPU power saving screen
power<00:00:43.530> saving<00:00:43.590> background<00:00:44.399> color<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.760> haptic

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
power saving background color and haptic

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.389 
power saving background color and haptic
feedback<00:00:45.350> however<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:46.770> choose<00:00:46.950> any<00:00:47.250> of

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
feedback however you can choose any of

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.760 
feedback however you can choose any of
these<00:00:47.700> not<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.510> including<00:00:48.840> power<00:00:49.050> saving<00:00:49.410> so

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
these not be including power saving so

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.260 
these not be including power saving so
suppose<00:00:50.100> if<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.280> switch<00:00:50.489> off<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.760> per<00:00:50.910> CPU

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
suppose if I switch off this per CPU

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.709 
suppose if I switch off this per CPU
power<00:00:51.390> saving<00:00:51.539> then<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.739> will<00:00:52.890> not<00:00:53.719> downgrade

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
power saving then it will not downgrade

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.319 
power saving then it will not downgrade
your<00:00:54.840> CPU<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.980> save<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.280> power<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.210> is

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
your CPU to save the power so this is

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.209 
your CPU to save the power so this is
one<00:00:57.510> good<00:00:57.719> thing<00:00:57.750> which<00:00:58.140> was<00:00:58.379> not<00:00:58.410> them<00:00:58.800> as<00:00:59.010> -

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
one good thing which was not them as -

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.700 
one good thing which was not them as -
in<00:00:59.340> previous<00:00:59.699> Android<00:00:59.969> phones<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.410> have

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
in previous Android phones so you have

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.529 
in previous Android phones so you have
to<00:01:01.980> make<00:01:02.219> sure<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.670> power<00:01:02.879> saving<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.359> on

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
to make sure that is power saving is on

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.830 
to make sure that is power saving is on
second<00:01:04.439> thing<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.830> use<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.460> features<00:01:06.000> network

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
second thing is use of features network

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.440 
second thing is use of features network
which<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.170> like<00:01:07.350> Bluetooth<00:01:07.890> GPS<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.790> Wi-Fi<00:01:08.909> if

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
which is like Bluetooth GPS and Wi-Fi if

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.210 
which is like Bluetooth GPS and Wi-Fi if
you<00:01:09.780> are<00:01:09.840> not<00:01:10.049> using<00:01:10.290> any<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.650> these<00:01:10.890> switch

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
you are not using any of these switch

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.090 
you are not using any of these switch
them<00:01:11.520> off<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.110> switch<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.320> 2g<00:01:13.619> network<00:01:14.040> if

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
them off and switch to the 2g network if

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.010 
them off and switch to the 2g network if
you<00:01:14.250> are<00:01:14.340> only<00:01:14.490> on<00:01:14.760> sync<00:01:15.060> if<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.720> are<00:01:15.810> doing

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
you are only on sync if you are doing

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.719 
you are only on sync if you are doing
some<00:01:16.200> browsing<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.740> other<00:01:17.040> stuff<00:01:17.430> then<00:01:17.610> you

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
some browsing in other stuff then you

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.330 
some browsing in other stuff then you
should<00:01:17.939> switch<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.240> 3G<00:01:18.720> otherwise<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:20.100> can

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
should switch to 3G otherwise you can

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.670 
should switch to 3G otherwise you can
just<00:01:20.640> move<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.689> 2g<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.080> will<00:01:22.229> show<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.439> how<00:01:22.619> to

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
just move to 2g I will show you how to

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.170 
just move to 2g I will show you how to
do<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.130> need<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.610> go<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.650> wireless<00:01:26.180> you

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
do it you need to go to the wireless you

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.330 
do it you need to go to the wireless you
need<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.420> go<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.750> settings<00:01:28.220> in<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
need to go to the settings in the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.039 
need to go to the settings in the
settings<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.880> then<00:01:30.000> mobile<00:01:30.240> network<00:01:30.780> and

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
settings and then mobile network and

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.069 
settings and then mobile network and
here<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.130> can<00:01:32.369> change<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.210> network<00:01:33.479> move<00:01:33.869> to

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
here you can change the network move to

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.069 
here you can change the network move to
GSM<00:01:35.009> WCDMA<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.970> obviously<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.420> 3G<00:01:36.780> or<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
GSM WCDMA is obviously the 3G or the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.120 
GSM WCDMA is obviously the 3G or the
Autobahn<00:01:37.610> okay<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.710> as<00:01:40.710> far<00:01:40.770> as<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
Autobahn okay so this is as far as the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.370 
Autobahn okay so this is as far as the
main<00:01:41.520> features<00:01:41.939> which<00:01:42.090> are<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.840> can<00:01:43.079> see<00:01:43.229> on

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
main features which are you can see on

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.109 
main features which are you can see on
the<00:01:44.060> main<00:01:45.060> screen<00:01:45.439> ok<00:01:46.439> now<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.890> other<00:01:47.460> big

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
the main screen ok now the other big

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.749 
the main screen ok now the other big
factor<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.810> battery<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.680> display<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.700> you

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
factor in battery is the display so you

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.210
