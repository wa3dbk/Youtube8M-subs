sponsors<00:01:00.090> just<00:01:00.270> once<00:01:00.449> like<00:01:00.690> when<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
sponsors just once like when the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.830 
sponsors just once like when the
contract<00:01:01.620> runs<00:01:01.710> out<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.329> that's<00:01:03.329> not<00:01:03.780> a

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
contract runs out so that's not a

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.200 
contract runs out so that's not a
problem<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.530> really<00:01:04.769> worry<00:01:04.979> about<00:01:05.090> and<00:01:06.090> it

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
problem to really worry about and it

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.270 
problem to really worry about and it
also<00:01:06.330> means<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.720> get<00:01:06.810> all<00:01:07.020> income<00:01:07.439> as<00:01:07.590> up<00:01:07.740> so

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
also means you get all income as up so

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.370 
also means you get all income as up so
you<00:01:08.340> forget<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> bigger<00:01:09.689> finance<00:01:10.140> for<00:01:10.260> your

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
you forget a bigger finance for your

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.000 
you forget a bigger finance for your
team<00:01:10.790> messages<00:01:11.790> as<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.210> see<00:01:12.390> here

they're<00:01:14.010> not<00:01:14.130> really<00:01:14.280> much<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.549> see<00:01:14.880> about

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
they're not really much to see about

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
be rather wrecking him to do rather than

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.930 
be rather wrecking him to do rather than
the<00:02:17.380> juror<00:02:17.620> in<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:17.890> Virata<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:21.550> as<00:02:21.670> you<00:02:21.790> can

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
control for the New Zealanders it's very

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.120 
control for the New Zealanders it's very
decent<00:06:17.260> in<00:06:17.590> Scotland<00:06:18.070> so<00:06:18.300> 75<00:06:19.300> is<00:06:19.479> she<00:06:19.930> good<00:06:20.130> so

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 
decent in Scotland so 75 is she good so

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.400 
decent in Scotland so 75 is she good so
it's<00:06:21.550> not<00:06:21.700> the<00:06:21.910> best<00:06:22.120> for<00:06:22.630> example<00:06:23.050> rodney<00:06:23.260> was

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410

it's not the best for example rodney was
81<00:06:24.040> I<00:06:24.160> think<00:06:24.750> Terry<00:06:25.750> Martin<00:06:25.990> is<00:06:26.200> obviously<00:06:26.440> the

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
81 I think Terry Martin is obviously the

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.100 
81 I think Terry Martin is obviously the
best<00:06:26.710> in<00:06:26.890> the<00:06:26.950> game<00:06:27.130> with<00:06:27.310> 83<00:06:27.790> as<00:06:28.120> he<00:06:28.750> is<00:06:28.810> so

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
best in the game with 83 as he is so

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.930 
best in the game with 83 as he is so
it's<00:06:29.350> the<00:06:29.470> national<00:06:29.830> champion<00:06:30.479> now

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.450 

yeah<00:06:34.940> I<00:06:35.740> don't<00:06:36.740> think<00:06:36.890> I'm<00:06:36.980> gonna<00:06:37.160> play<00:06:37.310> this
