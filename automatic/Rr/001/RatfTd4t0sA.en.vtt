I just started riding the 250f a little
bit<00:02:32.800> recently<00:02:33.800> so<00:02:34.130> this<00:02:35.060> really<00:02:35.330> depends<00:02:35.630> on

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
bit recently so this really depends on

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.009 
bit recently so this really depends on
where<00:02:36.019> we're<00:02:36.140> at<00:02:36.260> with<00:02:36.440> that<00:02:36.650> but<00:02:37.750> yeah<00:02:38.750> I'm
