00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
should have just tried to throw the ball

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.990 
should have just tried to throw the ball
in<00:05:07.300> the<00:05:07.330> air<00:05:07.420> like<00:05:07.870> her<00:05:08.020> just<00:05:08.460> kind<00:05:09.460> of<00:05:09.520> lob<00:05:09.790> it

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
in the air like her just kind of lob it

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.030 
in the air like her just kind of lob it
up<00:05:10.090> there<00:05:10.330> in<00:05:10.450> the<00:05:10.540> air<00:05:10.720> and<00:05:10.930> let<00:05:11.380> Randy<00:05:11.830> come

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
up there in the air and let Randy come

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.340 
up there in the air and let Randy come
down<00:05:12.280> with<00:05:12.460> it<00:05:12.490> but<00:05:12.790> it<00:05:13.090> was<00:05:13.180> just<00:05:13.210> a<00:05:13.420> late<00:05:13.720> late

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
down with it but it was just a late late

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.290 
down with it but it was just a late late
reaction<00:05:14.560> so<00:05:15.190> we<00:05:15.370> did<00:05:15.580> not<00:05:15.760> end<00:05:15.910> up<00:05:16.030> getting<00:05:16.270> a

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
reaction so we did not end up getting a

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.910 
reaction so we did not end up getting a
touchdown<00:05:16.660> we<00:05:16.810> just<00:05:17.170> end<00:05:17.380> up<00:05:17.560> having<00:05:17.830> to

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
touchdown we just end up having to

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.310 
touchdown we just end up having to
settle<00:05:18.250> for<00:05:18.400> a<00:05:19.030> field<00:05:19.120> goal<00:05:19.480> so<00:05:20.020> like<00:05:20.140> I<00:05:20.260> said

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
settle for a field goal so like I said
