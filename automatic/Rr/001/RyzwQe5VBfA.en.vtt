00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.550
 today we make a healthy marmalade 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.639
 of Orange 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.410
 the first thing is to peel the oranges there are two 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.410
 methods we can do it this way 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.230
 the skin has come out all at once as 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.230
 an accordion 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:27.370
 the second way is to peel them with the 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.080
 hands like all life 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.740
 look at us show us the different 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.740
 results 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.410
 we have peeled it by hand and it is with 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.210
 the knife look at that knife 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.430
 harder to remove the white parts 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.710
 that you then bitter the jam in this 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.329
 occasion we have preferred to lose them by hand 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.409
 And this is the result 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:52.000
 We will now carefully cut 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:01:00.010
 with the seeds that do not escape 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:03.329
 no other seed is more comfortable if 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.329
 use oranges without seeds 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.740
 We are putting them in a bowl 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.510
 we go with the lemon we peel the lemon 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.600
 gives the pectin to be preserved 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.600
 best 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.399
 and three quarters of the same careful with 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.600
 the seeds enrique is cutting the 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.600
 lemons and the bowl 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.049
 we already have it in a 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.210
 saucepan over medium heat loose past 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.640
 several minutes they release liquid 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.680
 depending on the type of orange you use 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.770
 maybe you have to add a little 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.810
 water these seeds we escaped to 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.000
 final we have trapped him and we add two 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.429
 spoonfuls of honey if it's natural better 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.770
 you know if it's natural because it gets 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.250
 lasts over time and we dissolve it in the 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.440
 liquid 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.420
 when liquid is sufficient him 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.110
 we add a cinnamon stick and the 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.110
 we submerge 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.790
 we cover it depending on the type of 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.710
 orange and fire let's have them 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.710
 between 45 minutes and one hour 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.910
 when it has this consistency it will already be 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.570
 list keep in mind that when cool it is 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.570
 it will weigh more 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.819
 we remove the cinnamon stick and the 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.430
 we turn away from the fire 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.739
 let's use some sterilized bottles 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.870
 to preserve them we usually do 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.469
 much quantity and lasts more than a year 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.469
 that if sterilizing the preserved 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:41.469
 perfectly 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.709
 we fill it up and close it 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.870
