00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.399
 carrot is america spotlights i 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.190
 anastasia i'm doing my body in mode 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.979
 online and showing you reach figure 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.989
 my dreams oh, these issues seem me 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:04.640
 You already told everything and itâ€™s worth it 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.659
 review previous videos and 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.610
 to wind on a mustache 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.490
 Well, let's try to draw more 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.409
 anything zazik no numbers and because i 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.330
 depression has already begun the same on 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.939
 scales constantly numbers 62 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.549
 but the main thing is that I see the result mirror 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.280
 because I go ck station and shake your 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.590
 muscle salt is white death 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.659
 we all know that he holds water in 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.360
 human body and therefore increase 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.759
 load on the kidneys and heart in this way 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.690
 we can get headaches and swelling 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.899
 extremities 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:39.500
 the fact is that excess salt is not displayed 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:42.590
 which means it holds water and that means 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.610
 that inhibited metabolism is disturbed 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.220
 balance with water in the cells and you do not lose weight 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.369
 although sony accumulate fat herself she 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.590
 interferes with the normal behavior of fat 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.840
 so you say losing weight is better and 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.280
 there is only the same sort of awakens 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.040
 appetite and calf 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.560
 food seems tastier and 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.840
 if you want more, which means you will eat 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.450
 it doesn't mean anymore 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.210
 stop her salt need to limit her 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.810
 quantity either go from stone to 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.050
 sea 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.290
 when you eat bran and get mixed up with 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.270
 sawdust scales often ask me how 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.830
 lose weight everywhere but so that the chest 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.040
 I will answer you 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.520
 no spin is worth of fat and dairy 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.670
 glands 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.550
 so here and we have fat in the same way as 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.220
 does not go locally and does not stay there 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.740
 where we need the process of losing weight and 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.709
 be on the fat goes away but the mammary gland 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.990
 stays and here it turns on 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.780
 ladies individual features if 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.420
 nature has rewarded itself lucky you 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.360
 if the gland is small what can you do 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.959
 so do n't talk about this 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:57.090
 people from this diet all lost birds 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.090
 I stayed a modjo 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:05.959
 well then you leave me and again want 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:08.780
 disappoint you from sports dressed the same 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:12.980
 did not become more just tightened and then 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:15.829
 small chest muscles are even higher 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.900
 worth swing to build a bowl here in 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:20.750
 this area with losing weight here 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.299
 bones appear i don't like it 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.859
 and since fat I don't want this place 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.859
 make me rock 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.410
 it's me 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.469
 remember one phrase losing weight is important 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.620
 nutritional value they are his 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:54.049
 variety of taste psychology has learned that 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.189
 to hide and better take the phrase 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.790
 repeat twice so that's important 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:01.579
 nutritional value 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.109
 they are his variety daily for 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.689
 should receive a certain amount 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.819
 fat carbohydrate protein and dominate 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:10.459
 minerals and so on well i'm for example 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.670
 hymns and simple dishes like buckwheat eggs 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.669
 and did not invent anything supernatural 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:19.160
 I just got used to it by the way 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.699
 asked about the food they say 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.490
 helps 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:24.860
 I have not tried and do not want to bother 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.520
 but I don't eat salad and 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.460

 soups we all mixed that did not get it 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:47.449
 his body after that is very, very 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:49.849
 this is noticeable that the fat men are shy 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.760

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:55.159
