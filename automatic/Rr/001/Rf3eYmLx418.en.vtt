those are the two constants of showed
you<00:00:41.969> know<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.300> correction<00:00:42.780> factors<00:00:43.170> based

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
you know this correction factors based

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.430 
you know this correction factors based
on<00:00:43.530> what<00:00:43.680> RPM<00:00:43.829> you're<00:00:44.370> at<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:45.020> what<00:00:46.020> coolant

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
on what RPM you're at and what coolant

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.740 
on what RPM you're at and what coolant
temperature<00:00:46.710> yeah<00:00:47.039> I'd<00:00:48.030> love<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.420> have<00:00:48.539> this

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
temperature yeah I'd love to have this

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.299 
temperature yeah I'd love to have this
running<00:00:48.989> if<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.410> know<00:00:49.590> how<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.710> tune<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.100> I

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
running if you know how to tune that I

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.369 
running if you know how to tune that I
really<00:00:51.210> be<00:00:51.300> interested<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.899> getting<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.260> to

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
really be interested in getting it to

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.950 
really be interested in getting it to
work<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:53.059> believe<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.239> OEM<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.809> doing

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
work I believe it's the OEM is doing

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.650 
work I believe it's the OEM is doing
acceleration<00:00:55.469> or<00:00:55.500> seven<00:00:55.770> but<00:00:56.399> for<00:00:56.610> now<00:00:56.640> I'd<00:00:57.329> be

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
acceleration or seven but for now I'd be

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.090 
acceleration or seven but for now I'd be
you<00:00:57.899> know<00:00:57.989> pretty<00:00:58.260> happy<00:00:58.649> with<00:00:58.770> just<00:00:58.920> getting

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
you know pretty happy with just getting

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.500 
you know pretty happy with just getting
some<00:00:59.399> basic<00:01:00.859> TPS<00:01:01.859> dot<00:01:02.160> algorithms<00:01:03.090> working

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
some basic TPS dot algorithms working

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.050 
some basic TPS dot algorithms working
just<00:01:03.870> based<00:01:04.049> on<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.500> rate<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.400> change<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
just based on the rate of change of the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.990 
just based on the rate of change of the
throttle<00:01:06.270> position<00:01:06.869> sensor<00:01:07.159> how<00:01:08.159> much<00:01:08.340> to

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
throttle position sensor how much to

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.300 
throttle position sensor how much to
increase<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.689> fuel<00:01:09.990> injector<00:01:10.860> pulse<00:01:11.070> width

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
increase the fuel injector pulse width

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.399 
increase the fuel injector pulse width
so<00:01:11.850> what<00:01:11.939> we<00:01:12.000> have<00:01:12.150> up<00:01:12.180> here<00:01:12.299> we<00:01:12.900> also<00:01:13.049> have

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
so what we have up here we also have

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.710 
so what we have up here we also have
this<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.890> totally<00:01:14.850> disabled<00:01:15.270> right<00:01:15.420> now<00:01:15.540> which

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
this in totally disabled right now which

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.590 
this in totally disabled right now which
is<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.869> super<00:01:16.259> high<00:01:16.380> threshold<00:01:16.740> for<00:01:17.600> for

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
is a super high threshold for for

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.330 
is a super high threshold for for
enabling<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.950> have<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.159> move<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
enabling this so you have to move the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.820 
enabling this so you have to move the
drop<00:01:21.060> position<00:01:21.240> since<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.710> gas

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
drop position since I the the gas

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.240 
drop position since I the the gas
problem<00:01:23.180> 200<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:25.049> know<00:01:25.200> twice<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.619> travel<00:01:25.979> of

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
problem 200 you know twice the travel of

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.090 
problem 200 you know twice the travel of
the<00:01:26.310> gas<00:01:27.000> pedal<00:01:27.270> per<00:01:28.229> second<00:01:28.619> or<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.890> active

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
the gas pedal per second or that active

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.410 
the gas pedal per second or that active
learner<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:29.460> basically<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:29.970> number<00:01:30.329> right

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
learner it's basically this number right

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.990 
learner it's basically this number right
here's<00:01:30.630> means<00:01:30.900> we<00:01:31.380> have<00:01:31.500> all<00:01:32.000> acceleration

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
here's means we have all acceleration

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.350 
here's means we have all acceleration
enrichment<00:01:33.420> disabled<00:01:35.119> hopefully<00:01:36.119> once<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
enrichment disabled hopefully once the

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.330 
enrichment disabled hopefully once the
ve<00:01:36.509> table<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.290> ironed<00:01:37.829> out<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.100> perfectly

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.980 
ve table is ironed out and perfectly
smooth<00:01:38.640> which<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.030> actually<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.540> pretty<00:01:39.600> close

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
smooth which it actually is pretty close

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.440 
smooth which it actually is pretty close
to<00:01:40.049> right<00:01:40.409> now<00:01:40.590> will<00:01:41.460> enable<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.000> have

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
to right now will enable that and have

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.730 
to right now will enable that and have
acceleration<00:01:42.930> measurement<00:01:43.140> working<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.710> I

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
acceleration measurement working and I

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.249 
acceleration measurement working and I
say<00:01:43.890> we'd<00:01:44.009> also<00:01:44.130> like<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:45.049> diesel<00:01:46.049> work

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
say we'd also like to have diesel work

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.580 
say we'd also like to have diesel work
nice<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.710> too<00:01:48.049> alright<00:01:49.049> once<00:01:49.290> we<00:01:49.380> get<00:01:49.470> into

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
nice it too alright once we get into

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.440 
nice it too alright once we get into
extended<00:01:50.130> not<00:01:50.430> too<00:01:50.579> many<00:01:50.729> menus<00:01:50.939> we<00:01:51.180> use<00:01:51.329> in

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
extended not too many menus we use in

too much advanced we got a really
important<00:02:16.310> option<00:02:17.310> right<00:02:17.400> here<00:02:17.459> that's

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
important option right here that's

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.479 
important option right here that's
output<00:02:18.090> test<00:02:18.300> mode<00:02:18.510> it's<00:02:18.599> really<00:02:18.810> useful<00:02:19.489> what

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
output test mode it's really useful what

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.580 
output test mode it's really useful what
you<00:02:20.610> can<00:02:20.730> do<00:02:20.819> is<00:02:20.940> individually<00:02:21.840> control<00:02:22.319> the

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
you can do is individually control the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.280 
you can do is individually control the
coils<00:02:23.069> or<00:02:23.220> injectors<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:24.510> say<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:24.989> flood<00:02:25.260> the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
coils or injectors so say you flood the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.830 
coils or injectors so say you flood the
I<00:02:25.410> say<00:02:26.099> flood<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.400> motor<00:02:26.580> doing<00:02:27.090> doing

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
I say flood the motor doing doing

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.050 
I say flood the motor doing doing
warm-up<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.950> got<00:02:29.069> too<00:02:29.220> much<00:02:29.250> pulse<00:02:29.849> width

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
warm-up and you got too much pulse width

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.280 
warm-up and you got too much pulse width
in<00:02:30.209> there<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.540> so<00:02:30.660> you<00:02:30.750> just<00:02:30.870> fold<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.110> motor

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
in there and so you just fold the motor

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.809 
in there and so you just fold the motor
doesn't<00:02:31.380> start<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:32.190> can't<00:02:32.430> start<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.700> again

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
doesn't start you can't start it again

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.509 
doesn't start you can't start it again
because<00:02:33.090> motors<00:02:33.870> flooded<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.319> fuel<00:02:34.590> you<00:02:35.340> can

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
because motors flooded the fuel you can

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.490 
because motors flooded the fuel you can
just<00:02:35.700> run<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.000> coils<00:02:36.420> by<00:02:36.780> themselves<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.440> not

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
just run the coils by themselves and not

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.130 
just run the coils by themselves and not
the<00:02:37.650> injectors<00:02:38.069> to<00:02:38.220> in<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.340> field<00:02:38.519> pump<00:02:38.730> off

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
the injectors to in the field pump off

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.390 
the injectors to in the field pump off
just<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.230> know<00:02:40.319> plug<00:02:40.709> in<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:40.920> three-second

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
just you know plug in a three-second

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.580 
just you know plug in a three-second
well<00:02:41.549> what<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.790> millisecond<00:02:42.450> well<00:02:42.690> burn<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.350> run

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
well what a millisecond well burn it run

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.860 
well what a millisecond well burn it run
it<00:02:43.709> bump<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.610> starter<00:02:45.060> cycle<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.600> motor<00:02:45.750> over

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
it bump the starter cycle the motor over

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.259 
it bump the starter cycle the motor over
the<00:02:46.230> motor<00:02:46.410> will<00:02:46.590> fire<00:02:46.950> because<00:02:47.790> all<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.060> fuel

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
the motor will fire because all the fuel

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.300 
the motor will fire because all the fuel
in<00:02:48.420> there<00:02:48.569> and<00:02:49.260> saw<00:02:49.410> injecting<00:02:49.890> anymore<00:02:50.190> so

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
in there and saw injecting anymore so

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.009 
in there and saw injecting anymore so
eventually<00:02:50.549> the<00:02:50.849> fire<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.360> then<00:02:51.720> we'll<00:02:51.840> die

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
eventually the fire and then we'll die

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.360 
eventually the fire and then we'll die
out<00:02:52.049> and<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.590> cylinders<00:02:52.920> are<00:02:53.040> back<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.250> normal

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
out and the cylinders are back to normal

out and the cylinders are back to normal
no<00:02:53.910> more<00:02:54.090> fuel<00:02:54.390> fly<00:02:54.569> or<00:02:55.170> you<00:02:55.349> can<00:02:55.470> just<00:02:55.530> run<00:02:55.739> the

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
no more fuel fly or you can just run the

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.259 
no more fuel fly or you can just run the
coil<00:02:56.069> of<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.280> injectors<00:02:56.670> this<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.120> useful

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
coil of the injectors this is useful

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.350 
coil of the injectors this is useful
before<00:02:57.599> when<00:02:57.989> we<00:02:58.069> found<00:02:59.069> weed<00:02:59.280> on<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.819> different

car diagnosed yet a clogged injector we

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.350 
car diagnosed yet a clogged injector we
just<00:03:04.920> pulled<00:03:05.099> the<00:03:05.190> injectors<00:03:05.610> out<00:03:05.760> unsparing

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
just pulled the injectors out unsparing

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.940 
just pulled the injectors out unsparing
the<00:03:06.420> paper<00:03:06.599> towels<00:03:06.840> saw<00:03:07.170> one<00:03:07.380> wasn't<00:03:07.680> sprang

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
the paper towels saw one wasn't sprang

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.479 
the paper towels saw one wasn't sprang

get<00:04:48.750> from<00:04:48.840> this<00:04:48.990> text<00:04:49.860> box<00:04:49.979> PDFs<00:04:53.509> then<00:04:54.509> for<00:04:54.810> a

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
get from this text box PDFs then for a

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.490 
get from this text box PDFs then for a
wideband<00:04:55.169> sensor<00:04:55.620> also<00:04:55.800> calibration<00:04:56.550> data

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
wideband sensor also calibration data

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.170 
wideband sensor also calibration data
and<00:04:59.840> think<00:05:00.840> that's<00:05:01.020> a<00:05:01.320> map<00:05:01.680> sensor<00:05:02.160> stuff<00:05:03.030> like

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
and think that's a map sensor stuff like

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.400 
and think that's a map sensor stuff like
that<00:05:03.210> so<00:05:03.710> but<00:05:04.710> that's<00:05:04.860> uh<00:05:05.070> that's<00:05:05.310> mega<00:05:05.669> tune
