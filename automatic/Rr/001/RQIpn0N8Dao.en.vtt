instantly the minute I dipped my fingers

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.110 
instantly the minute I dipped my fingers
in<00:03:58.199> there<00:03:58.349> and<00:03:58.379> kind<00:03:59.310> of<00:03:59.370> picked<00:03:59.639> some<00:03:59.940> up<00:04:00.090> to

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
in there and kind of picked some up to

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.379 
in there and kind of picked some up to
put<00:04:00.510> in<00:04:00.599> my<00:04:00.720> hair<00:04:00.959> I<00:04:01.430> just<00:04:02.430> remember<00:04:03.269> I<00:04:03.359> just

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
put in my hair I just remember I just

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.750 
put in my hair I just remember I just
remember<00:04:03.930> feeling<00:04:04.109> like<00:04:04.290> I<00:04:04.440> put<00:04:04.799> my<00:04:04.979> hands<00:04:05.549> in

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
remember feeling like I put my hands in

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.969 
remember feeling like I put my hands in
like<00:04:05.970> a<00:04:06.120> tub<00:04:06.359> of<00:04:06.389> butter<00:04:06.750> that's<00:04:07.470> about<00:04:07.799> how

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:07.979 
like a tub of butter that's about how

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:11.330 
like a tub of butter that's about how
thick<00:04:08.400> this<00:04:08.669> product<00:04:09.209> is<00:04:09.500> but<00:04:10.500> you<00:04:10.620> don't<00:04:10.979> need

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
thick this product is but you don't need

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.099 
thick this product is but you don't need
that<00:04:11.639> much<00:04:11.879> it<00:04:12.150> really<00:04:12.269> just<00:04:12.540> depends<00:04:12.870> on<00:04:13.019> your

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
that much it really just depends on your

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.399 
that much it really just depends on your
hair<00:04:13.349> length<00:04:14.180> so<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.209> probably<00:04:15.810> use<00:04:15.989> maybe

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:16.409 
hair length so I probably use maybe

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:18.890 
hair length so I probably use maybe
about<00:04:17.070> that<00:04:17.370> much<00:04:17.639> I<00:04:17.940> scoop<00:04:18.299> up<00:04:18.449> in<00:04:18.570> my<00:04:18.659> hand

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
about that much I scoop up in my hand

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.259 
about that much I scoop up in my hand
and<00:04:19.199> then<00:04:19.620> I<00:04:19.709> just<00:04:19.919> I<00:04:20.159> kind<00:04:20.519> of<00:04:20.669> start<00:04:20.970> in<00:04:21.180> the

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:53.920 
um and so I use this maybe about

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.800 
um and so I use this maybe about
probably<00:05:54.460> about<00:05:54.550> once<00:05:54.880> to<00:05:55.150> two<00:05:55.300> times<00:05:55.600> a<00:05:55.780> week

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
probably about once to two times a week

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.170 
probably about once to two times a week
so<00:05:56.470> I<00:05:56.500> have<00:05:56.950> my<00:05:57.130> regular<00:05:57.580> shampoo<00:05:58.030> and

so I have my regular shampoo and
conditioner<00:05:58.720> and<00:05:58.960> I<00:05:59.710> don't<00:05:59.890> only<00:06:00.040> wash<00:06:00.340> my

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
conditioner and I don't only wash my

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.950 
conditioner and I don't only wash my
hair<00:06:00.760> probably<00:06:01.060> about<00:06:01.150> three<00:06:01.480> times<00:06:01.720> a<00:06:01.930> week

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
hair probably about three times a week

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.760 
hair probably about three times a week
so<00:06:02.320> um<00:06:02.860> every<00:06:03.790> two<00:06:04.510> washes<00:06:04.810> I'll<00:06:05.320> do<00:06:05.560> my

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
so um every two washes I'll do my

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.860 
so um every two washes I'll do my
regular<00:06:05.950> shampoo<00:06:06.520> and<00:06:06.670> conditioner<00:06:07.180> and<00:06:07.390> then

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
regular shampoo and conditioner and then

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.050 
regular shampoo and conditioner and then
on<00:06:08.230> the<00:06:08.470> third<00:06:08.500> wash<00:06:08.890> I'll<00:06:09.190> use<00:06:09.370> this<00:06:09.550> so<00:06:09.910> it's

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
on the third wash I'll use this so it's

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.090 
on the third wash I'll use this so it's
about<00:06:10.270> every<00:06:10.720> one<00:06:11.200> to<00:06:11.440> two<00:06:11.590> times<00:06:11.830> a<00:06:12.070> week

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
about every one to two times a week

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.070 
about every one to two times a week
maybe<00:06:12.550> it<00:06:12.730> just<00:06:12.850> depends<00:06:13.450> on<00:06:13.540> how<00:06:13.690> many<00:06:13.870> times

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
maybe it just depends on how many times

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.190 
maybe it just depends on how many times

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:30.730 
it does that very well it instantly

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.990 
it does that very well it instantly
makes<00:06:31.060> it<00:06:31.210> softer<00:06:31.960> it's<00:06:32.620> silky<00:06:33.400> ER<00:06:33.430> and<00:06:33.790> it's

healthy so I think this

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.180 
healthy so I think this
product<00:06:40.080> lives<00:06:41.080> up<00:06:41.260> to<00:06:41.290> all<00:06:41.470> the<00:06:41.740> claims<00:06:42.010> that

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.130 
they make and it's really it doesn't

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.070 
they make and it's really it doesn't
