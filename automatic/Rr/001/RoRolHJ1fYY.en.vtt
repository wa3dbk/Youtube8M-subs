00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
a lot faster as you can see i added

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.740 
a lot faster as you can see i added
upper<00:00:40.649> seats<00:00:40.920> here<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:42.270> i<00:00:42.300> didn't<00:00:42.629> have

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
upper seats here in that i didn't have

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.479 
upper seats here in that i didn't have
last<00:00:42.989> time<00:00:43.260> because<00:00:43.530> i<00:00:43.559> don't<00:00:43.829> think<00:00:44.040> they

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
last time because i don't think they

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.610 
last time because i don't think they
have<00:00:44.760> those<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.149> don't<00:00:45.329> know<00:00:45.450> anyway<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.410> just

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
have those I don't know anyway I just

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.170 
have those I don't know anyway I just
thought<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.070> would<00:00:47.190> look<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.489> lot<00:00:47.520> cooler<00:00:47.879> if<00:00:48.090> I

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
thought it would look a lot cooler if I

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.700 
thought it would look a lot cooler if I
had<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> kind<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.840> branch<00:00:49.140> out<00:00:49.379> like<00:00:49.590> an

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
had a kind of a branch out like an

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.250 
had a kind of a branch out like an
actual<00:00:50.010> stadium<00:00:50.579> instead<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.750> tall

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
actual stadium instead of just the tall

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.069 
actual stadium instead of just the tall
walls<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.980> stuff<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.899> one<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.050> reasons

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
walls and stuff and one of the reasons

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.600 
walls and stuff and one of the reasons
it<00:00:55.469> went<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:55.800> quick<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.100> because<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.340> didn't

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
it went so quick is because I didn't

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.819 
it went so quick is because I didn't
have<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:56.969> roof<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:58.230> Monday<00:00:58.680> Night

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
have to do a roof and in Monday Night

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.470 
have to do a roof and in Monday Night
Raw<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.070> have<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.309> do<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> roof<00:00:59.640> but<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.300> time

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
Raw you have to do a roof but this time

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.569 
Raw you have to do a roof but this time
we<00:01:00.629> don't<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.500> would<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:01.710> took<00:01:01.920> taken

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
we don't and that would have took taken

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.429 
we don't and that would have took taken
me<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.030> long<00:01:03.059> if<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.570> would<00:01:03.719> have<00:01:03.780> done<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.140> as

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
me so long if I would have done that as

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.620 
me so long if I would have done that as
you<00:01:04.920> can<00:01:05.010> see<00:01:05.159> i<00:01:05.189> would<00:01:05.400> have<00:01:05.489> had<00:01:05.610> plays<00:01:06.299> every

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
you can see i would have had plays every

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.149 
you can see i would have had plays every
block<00:01:06.810> across<00:01:07.080> there<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.560> I'm<00:01:07.680> glad<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.890> didn't

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
block across there so I'm glad I didn't

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.670 
block across there so I'm glad I didn't
have<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.340> do<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:09.170> here's<00:01:10.170> what<00:01:10.500> they

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
have to do that and here's what they

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.910 
have to do that and here's what they
walk<00:01:11.040> down<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.520> ring<00:01:11.760> looks<00:01:12.000> like<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.920> tried

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
walk down to the ring looks like I tried

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.620 
walk down to the ring looks like I tried
I<00:01:14.100> watched<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.640> lot<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.820> videos<00:01:15.210> from<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
I watched a lot of videos from the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.090 
I watched a lot of videos from the
original<00:01:16.020> WrestleMania<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.799> other

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
original WrestleMania and other

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.120 
original WrestleMania and other
minecraft<00:01:17.610> creators<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:19.110> think<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.680> got<00:01:20.100> it

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
minecraft creators and I think I got it

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.219 
minecraft creators and I think I got it
just<00:01:20.460> about<00:01:20.640> as<00:01:20.909> close<00:01:21.090> as<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.659> can<00:01:21.840> beat<00:01:22.020> how

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
just about as close as it can beat how

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.620 
just about as close as it can beat how
it<00:01:22.380> actually<00:01:22.560> was<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.700> I've<00:01:24.119> also<00:01:24.210> got<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
it actually was and I've also got the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.120 
it actually was and I've also got the
snow<00:01:24.960> here<00:01:25.290> as<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.770> ring<00:01:26.100> instead<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.729> the

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
snow here as the ring instead of the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.469 
snow here as the ring instead of the
mushroom<00:01:29.130> stocks<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.850> had<00:01:30.000> last<00:01:30.180> time<00:01:30.360> I

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
mushroom stocks that I had last time I

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.999 
mushroom stocks that I had last time I
thought<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.049> snow<00:01:31.259> looked<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.680> little<00:01:31.829> better

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
thought the snow looked a little better

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.130 
thought the snow looked a little better
it<00:01:32.460> doesn't<00:01:32.759> make<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.119> good<00:01:33.240> sounds<00:01:33.750> like<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
it doesn't make the good sounds like the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.770 
it doesn't make the good sounds like the
stocks<00:01:34.860> did<00:01:35.159> but<00:01:35.369> it's<00:01:35.670> okay<00:01:35.939> now<00:01:36.150> if<00:01:36.630> you're

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
stocks did but it's okay now if you're

sitting up here you can see these TV
screens<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.920> kind<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.040> how<00:01:41.220> they<00:01:41.430> work<00:01:41.670> is

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
screens and kind of how they work is

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.760 
screens and kind of how they work is
just<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.299> project<00:01:42.689> what's<00:01:42.990> happening<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
so they can see it all and that's kind

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.990 
so they can see it all and that's kind
of<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.619> top<00:01:49.860> inside<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.399> ring<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.850> what

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
of the top inside the ring this is what

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.210 
of the top inside the ring this is what
the<00:01:51.119> lighting<00:01:51.450> looks<00:01:51.630> like<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.170> here's<00:01:53.100> the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
the lighting looks like and here's the

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.460 
the lighting looks like and here's the
announcement<00:01:53.399> table<00:01:54.090> I've<00:01:54.329> just<00:01:54.409> instead<00:01:55.409> of

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
announcement table I've just instead of

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.700 
announcement table I've just instead of
three<00:01:55.950> mics<00:01:56.189> I've<00:01:56.490> just<00:01:56.670> gotten<00:01:57.320> more<00:01:58.320> here

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
three mics I've just gotten more here

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.649 
three mics I've just gotten more here
because<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.189> thought<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.880> know<00:02:00.000> WrestleMania

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
because I thought you know WrestleMania

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.929 
because I thought you know WrestleMania
usually<00:02:00.990> has<00:02:01.079> four<00:02:01.469> commentators<00:02:02.399> instead<00:02:02.820> of

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
usually has four commentators instead of

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.350 
usually has four commentators instead of
three<00:02:03.829> regardless<00:02:04.829> though<00:02:05.149> sometimes<00:02:06.149> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
three regardless though sometimes the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.840 
three regardless though sometimes the
stairs<00:02:07.290> glitch<00:02:07.710> out<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.220> in

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
stairs glitch out and in

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.940 
stairs glitch out and in
new<00:02:08.970> snapshot<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.960> some<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.560> these<00:02:10.710> stairs

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
new snapshot so some of these stairs

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.290 
new snapshot so some of these stairs
might<00:02:11.190> look<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.400> little<00:02:11.580> weird<00:02:11.820> since<00:02:12.060> there

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
might look a little weird since there

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.990 
might look a little weird since there
are<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:12.420> many<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.930> them<00:02:13.730> overall<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.760> think

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
are so many of them overall I think

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.810 
are so many of them overall I think
there<00:02:15.300> are<00:02:15.330> over<00:02:15.660> 4,000<00:02:16.500> stairs<00:02:16.800> here<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:17.670> it's

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
there are over 4,000 stairs here so it's

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.820 
there are over 4,000 stairs here so it's
a<00:02:17.880> far<00:02:18.060> cry<00:02:18.090> from<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.540> 70,000<00:02:19.410> that<00:02:19.500> usually

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
a far cry from the 70,000 that usually

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.770 
a far cry from the 70,000 that usually
come<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.040> Wrestlemania<00:02:20.700> but<00:02:20.940> in<00:02:21.150> Minecraft

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
come to Wrestlemania but in Minecraft

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.340 
come to Wrestlemania but in Minecraft
that's<00:02:22.050> pretty<00:02:22.350> good<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:23.900> 4,000<00:02:24.900> villagers

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
that's pretty good so 4,000 villagers

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.440 
that's pretty good so 4,000 villagers
could<00:02:25.620> see<00:02:25.800> here<00:02:26.010> in<00:02:26.070> watch<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.430> match<00:02:26.610> Steve

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
could see here in watch a match Steve

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.780 
could see here in watch a match Steve
