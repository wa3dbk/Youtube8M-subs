00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
the d-pad to make the bar move then

write for the speed and then pay for the
angle<00:00:58.019> what<00:00:59.019> the<00:00:59.109> fuck<00:00:59.320> is<00:00:59.350> this<00:00:59.859> would<00:01:00.489> it

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
angle what the fuck is this would it

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.520 
angle what the fuck is this would it
have<00:01:00.699> been<00:01:00.909> too<00:01:01.119> complicated<00:01:01.600> to<00:01:01.929> program<00:01:02.379> it

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
have been too complicated to program it

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.279 
have been too complicated to program it
like<00:01:02.710> this<00:01:02.920> press<00:01:03.489> a<00:01:03.640> three<00:01:04.239> times<00:01:04.539> in<00:01:04.720> a<00:01:04.809> row<00:01:04.960> I

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:05.289 
like this press a three times in a row I

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:08.820 
like this press a three times in a row I
think<00:01:06.130> so<00:01:06.899> finally<00:01:07.899> the<00:01:08.020> game<00:01:08.200> has<00:01:08.350> begun<00:01:08.500> and

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
think so finally the game has begun and

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.289 
think so finally the game has begun and
the<00:01:08.950> computer<00:01:09.369> has<00:01:09.549> a<00:01:09.580> control<00:01:10.000> or<00:01:10.210> the

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
the computer has a control or the

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:17.850 
the computer has a control or the
question<00:01:15.420> well<00:01:16.420> lucky<00:01:16.929> me<00:01:17.049> he<00:01:17.470> doesn't<00:01:17.770> know

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
question well lucky me he doesn't know

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:26.200 
question well lucky me he doesn't know
the<00:01:17.979> answer<00:01:18.280> so<00:01:18.310> it's<00:01:18.610> my<00:01:18.729> turn

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.920 

I<00:01:26.920> think<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.070> answer<00:01:28.369> is<00:01:28.400> a<00:01:31.150> all<00:01:32.150> right<00:01:32.510> I've

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
I think the answer is a all right I've

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.100 
I think the answer is a all right I've
one<00:01:34.119> actually<00:01:35.119> it's<00:01:35.270> really<00:01:35.540> easy<00:01:35.720> to<00:01:35.840> be<00:01:36.020> the

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
one actually it's really easy to be the

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.690 
one actually it's really easy to be the
computer<00:01:36.500> costs<00:01:36.770> if<00:01:37.070> your<00:01:37.310> general<00:01:37.670> knowledge

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
computer costs if your general knowledge

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.969 
computer costs if your general knowledge
isn't<00:01:38.240> too<00:01:38.510> bad<00:01:38.750> you<00:01:39.229> can<00:01:39.380> easily<00:01:39.590> end<00:01:39.860> the

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
isn't too bad you can easily end the

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.850 
isn't too bad you can easily end the
most<00:01:40.220> of<00:01:40.369> the<00:01:40.460> questions<00:01:41.229> like<00:01:42.229> this<00:01:42.409> one<00:01:42.650> who

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
most of the questions like this one who

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.410 
most of the questions like this one who
designed<00:01:43.190> the<00:01:43.250> post<00:01:43.460> one<00:01:43.670> reason<00:01:44.030> of<00:01:44.210> course

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
designed the post one reason of course

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.330 
designed the post one reason of course
it's<00:01:44.600> portia<00:01:45.700> giving<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.790> few<00:01:46.970> questions<00:01:47.479> now

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
it's portia giving a few questions now

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.560 
it's portia giving a few questions now
which<00:01:49.340> Muppet<00:01:49.610> character<00:01:50.180> list<00:01:50.330> in<00:01:50.509> the
