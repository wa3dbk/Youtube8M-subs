00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.790
 hello dear minecraft country heartily 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.570
 Welcome to a new tutorial 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.800
 row upwards 007 it is you too 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.050
 ever become the ever 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.240
 same blocks can be put together 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.160
 in the end somehow a strange house 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.960
 wood and sound comes out then it is 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.930
 this is just the right one for you 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.800
 the qualification or even with pack 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.010
 so to speak 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.179
 Today , ticket ticket is the word 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.519
 ever sits down together 

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:41.559
 technology and wobbling backert is yes the 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:43.329
 Developer company for the back to where 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.850
 that you certainly still have it all 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.199
 new for my is here can 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.760
 you look at a little video what 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.010
 ticket is but I tell you 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.260
 Of course, so the top there is one 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.510
 small button model is and see here 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.120
 her all mods intact installed 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.170
 have been installed so to speak, too 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.989
 do not do much 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.900
 you see all that right 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.310
 For example, technical watts some 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.250
 bildkraft if god that really is very 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.840
 is very extensive and this mod can 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.329
 you all use by you the 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.130
 Download the technology launcher 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:17.350
 that is right here to find you're loading 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.180
 the whole then for windows mac or 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.070
 linux anyway which one 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.539
 operating system just had down 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.380
 and we really need that 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.140
 download 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.360
 because at music downloaded 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.670
 we have this on the desktop here 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.500
 Let's take it you need it 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.750
 no fear for your minecraft at all 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.969
 have that everything is completely normal 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.320
 technology or ticket even makes one 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:43.450
 own folder is so important if you 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.950
 could run ticket 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.679
 mostly because you do not have the 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.150
 right version of java used and 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:52.070
 although you need java 7 for that 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.590
 the link to it is in the video 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.920
 description banat java 700 if you 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.380
 still java 6 used and on hammer 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.870
 he wants to come later to speak like that 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.180
 you need a real minecraft 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.230
 username to sign up here 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.649
 that makes the ordinary 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:15.410
 have data as always and then with the 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:18.800
 login password yet again 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.900
 and then we still have a profile here 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.420
 select earlier works the whole 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.280
 Not either we choose engineering or 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.790
 how much text and then there is still here 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.140
 a few others tail my vanilla and 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.020
 which is not all we take but 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.910
 tekke because this is the tutorial here 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.100
 and then there are options too 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.580
 you can, for example, the whole game 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.430
 still to share memory 1 gb 2 gb 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.660
 depending on how much RAM 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.130
 computer has my case eight 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.890
 gigabyte so I give the game times 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.050
 two gigabyte that's okay 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.630
 here are more settings 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.030
 possible as you want you can there 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.980
 A little bit around here to look 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.209
 Example, you can decide which 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.620
 versions are used either 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.200
 those that have just been developed or 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.370
 the idea is recommended well that can 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.510
 do it yourself a little bit 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.890
 Of course, I do not want to look 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.890
 say everything so now I have already 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.550
 pressed on ok the whole starts 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.019
 new because we have a few new settings 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.540
 and now we have to 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.980
 sign up again 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.680
 with our normal minecraft 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:30.590
 data the arrow here no idea what 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.850
 tourists so and then we lure us 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.549
 a short time 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.769
 so to speak is connected to 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.290
 minecraft for net and the first one 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.060
 States of this technology lounges takes 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.769
 that's a bit special with mine 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.440
 Internet takes a bit and does 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.060
 is there then just something 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.269
 downloaded all the mods we have here 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.280
 in the model has already seen 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.330
 Let's go 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.620
 a page back on this technique 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.569
 website you can really find 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.459
 quite a lot of different things to 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.830
 for example, how you can get a real one 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.450
 clock server is set but there is that 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.060
 every first part of a tutorial series 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.640
 there will be more tutorials 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.569
 come on because that's not even 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.730
 so easy to make a text server 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.919
 As said your ticket there is a big one 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.350
 and variety of new look me none 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.450
 whole brands inventing whole machines 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.570
 or build nuclear power plants 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.540
 but later in other tutorials 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.850
 even more and now we hope that yourself 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.680
 I downloaded the whole thing once 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.930
 can show you how you are 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.010
 after the engineering folder finds where you 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.990
 then, for example, texture pack 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.970
 installed or whatever 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.520
 wanted pressed door windows button and he wanted 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.040
 is also percent from tata percent 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.100
 you might already minecraft 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.910
 maybe know and then there is here 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.680
 mostly a folder pyrotechnic launcher 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.180
 it does not exist yet because that 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.750
 whole but downloaded 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.520
 then takes a while and then too 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.560
 already is here to be a folder and there 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.590
 can you go to atex apax and whatever 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.550
 her work became point technology here 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.500
 louder rather give not purely 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:13.880
 because that's what he's doing here 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:16.160
 Techniques and standards recording 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.250
 ok and after a felt eternity 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.680
 We finally got ticket 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.470
 has started on the first 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.760
 looks like you 've done something I've done 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.340
 what's wrong why is here now 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.170
 minecraft help that is because the 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.480
 on the top left very small ticket stands 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.360
 not minecraft since here now 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.960
 but developed the whole thing 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.050
 folded 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.190
 you can see it on the left as well because you minecraft 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.560
 have progressively forge installed 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.310
 the installed must go immediately 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:51.620
 time on the model or if the fine 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:55.190
 send corot minecraft items minimap 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:57.110
 and a whole lot more 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.590
 You realize this place really belongs 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:03.080
 immense things and here for example 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:06.680
 we could also pack a texture 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:09.530
 Install download and drag that 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.340
 then here we would have now 120 degrees 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.990
 home home 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.330
 you see we too will now 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.360
 automatically hero manning and then into the 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:20.330
 point technology launcher guides this 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:23.000
 Reconciliation works as we can 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.380
 yes, for a short time , but more seem to be 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.920
 ticket you then learn 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:30.860
 in the next turn 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.160
 they are also quite normal 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.470
 options 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.990
 here is not much different that's just 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.350
 the normal minecraft surface there 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:43.350
 does not change much 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:47.720
 We lure us for a short time 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.720
 World is short of 100 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.730
 so we check again if we 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.290
 have done everything right as well 

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.360
 if it is not with you somehow 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.890
 is that we launcher this technology 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.590
 but you have to do it 

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:03.060
 have that is relatively important and now 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.400
 It was a bit because I was with the 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.710
 receiving enter find wrong program 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.720
 Please do not be surprised and you see 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:11.910
 must be the same as the heli herdt 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.340
 Do the minimap here right above 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:16.950
 is notes on items quite a lot 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:19.410
 options- and what does not work 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:22.830
 more about that later on how you deal with him 

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.670
 so birgit eckert stays first 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.690
 have fun 

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:26.690
 see you later
