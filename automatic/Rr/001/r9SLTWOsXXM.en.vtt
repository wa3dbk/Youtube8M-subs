the reduction of the amount of energy

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.530 
the reduction of the amount of energy
that's<00:02:47.400> transferred<00:02:47.760> during<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.269> crash

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
that's transferred during the crash

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.539 
that's transferred during the crash
event<00:02:48.959> by<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:50.129> ODS<00:02:50.609> technology<00:02:52.370> changing<00:02:53.370> its

position relative to the outside surface

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.909
