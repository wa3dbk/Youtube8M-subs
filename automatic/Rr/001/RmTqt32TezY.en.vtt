00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 pighi itwin after one of ours 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.720
 victories 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.559
 we met more and more aliens 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.440
 forts beat the first ufo and aliens 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.179
 have started a terror campaign 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.480
 we have already pushed very far 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:22.939
 human evolution and tremble at thought 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.939
 where the next step will take us 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.400
 despite the great experience it was not 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.350
 easy for feraxi to approach the remake 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.369
 of hicks with his de france 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.349
 also because the team that created it 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.030
 civilization could not be limited to 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.520
 simply re-propose the classic of 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.100
 1998 updated under the graphic profile 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.720
 for this the jack solomon team 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.000
 applied to the game the same rules that 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.800
 led to six months and shawn 5 where 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.809
 feraxi merged certain 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.760
 redundant features trying to 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.980
 don't lose change in depth 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.500
 main is the time replacement 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.449
 starts with actions during a turn 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.949
 each soldier can perform two actions 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.580
 to choose from among those granted by 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:58.870
 his class 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.030
 this greatly simplifies to 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.010
 planning while keeping unchanged 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.839
 the depth of the gameplay 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.700
 the knicks com nor my grandmother are lost 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.380
 also some foods in cross stione 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.850
 placing more emphasis on 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.159
 growth and skill acquisition 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.560
 specials from soldiers each 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.330
 your man is indeed the only one 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.460
 it means that gaining experience e 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.590
 if they turn from simple recruits 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.630
 to specialized warriors but means 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.360
 also that they will die nation and not 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.890
 be more deployed you will be taken 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.600
 therefore to affection me your i 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.310
 veterans and therefore to fear theirs 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.110
 departed thing not particularly 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.940
 difficult because the levels will be 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.530
 concealed in a fog of war behind the 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.840
 which alien forces will move 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.700
 fortunately undisturbed the 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.350
 repeating the same enemies or di 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.330
 scenario design could increase 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.490
 the feeling of monotony of some 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.440
 indeed missions to the original 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.600
 random map generation was 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.130
 preferred lookout system 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.200
 theoretically the only method 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.940
 to ensure quality map in practice 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.890
 however there are no major changes 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.200
 between one map and another 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.150
 another element that is not very successful is the 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.190
 camera management incapable of 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.080
 effectively manage nation when you 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.190
 plays on different levels or when 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.229
 missions are indoors 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.539
 this is due to own management 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.370
 happy with transparencies in others 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.959
 occasions the automatic camera at 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.700
 place to emphasize actions with 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.590
 spectacular close-ups get stuck 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.940
 awkwardly in the walls 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.220
 if you will be able to turn a blind eye 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.200
 on these beach x.com will be able to 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.060
 rekindle the famous anchor fever 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.950
 another shift and then I stop so dear 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.209
 fur laxis that once again has 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.370
 packaged an exciting game 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.370
 from mechanicals as simple as 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.959
 the magnetic is equally important 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.970
 management phase of the agency 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.680
 unlike the whole original game 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.810
 the x.com activity will be managed through 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.269
 one base here you will have available 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.739
 only 24 capita to fill with 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.239
 and new structures will therefore be 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.769
 fundamental to organize in a manner 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.110
 careful the arrangement of the new ones 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.269
 elements also research and 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.920
 production have been simplified on 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.330
 number of scientists will determine 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.700
 simply the speed with which 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.230
 discovered letters in new technologies 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.640
 while the number of engineers determines 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.829
 what elements will be possible to achieve 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.440
 as well as the cost and speed of 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:07.060
 construction in the geoscape you will also be able to 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.850
 manage your men theirs 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.930
 equipment and their training 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.579
 thanks to official training 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.440
 you can buy new bonuses for the 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.209
 your team while later in the 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.150
 game you may find you have gods 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.410
 soldiers with psychic powers 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.820
 finally there is the aspect of the control of the 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.310
 skies scanning the earth globe 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.230
 you could intercept luxury enemies 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.209
 intent on crossing the nations 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.010
 covered by your satellites in these 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.840
 occasions you will have to send your planes 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.630
 to intercept the break down the disk 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.430
 steering wheel this management phase works 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.110
 also thanks to the presence of three 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.120
 assistants who help to narrate better 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.190
 the evolution of the game by commenting 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.989
 every new discovery introducing them phase 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.700
 of the main mission these 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.160
 connecting elements contribute to 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.230
 make x.com enemy year 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.340
 one of the spectacular strategic of 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.110
 always 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.910
 from the graphic point of view the children of 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.290
 karak is known if they are entrusted to the riall 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.150
 engine 3 to have a tool 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.170
 easily adaptable on the three 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.790
 platforms 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.710
 if from the point of view of the style the 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.810
 pleasant production are different i 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.090
 gleeks and small bugs that disrupt the 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.930
 code and which we hope will be removed 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.370
 soon 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.320
 also the need to return 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.940
 scalable the game engine has pushed 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.290
 developers not to overdo it with i 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.000
 filters or the quality of the models 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.040
 excellent polygonal instead 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.709
 sound accompaniment and dubbing 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.250
 in Italian from the point of view of 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.630
 longevity 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.330
 the campaign can be completed 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.830
 in about 20 hours without however considering the 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.780
 many difficulty levels a 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.640
 provision that they could commit 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.220
 for a long time players looking for 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.170
 unfortunately challenges the lack of 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.550
 randomly generated greater maps 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.810
 narration have forced the 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.970
 developers harness the game 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:44.220
 limiting the unpredictability of each 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:45.600
 new game despite the x.com defects 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.030
 enemy unknown remains an experience 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.140
 magnificent able to restore luster to 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.240
 a historical series 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.680
 feraxi's work if it is not faithful 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.660
 to the original nonetheless it is 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.100
 a valid and modern interpretation 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.020
 of the same spectacular game 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.300
 fiction as few strategic have 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.950
 known how to figure the difficulty in the 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.720
 camera management and some 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.380
 too much imperfection could bore you 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.390
 all clean 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.860
 but who affinity with the genus should not 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.860
 let this barrier slip away
