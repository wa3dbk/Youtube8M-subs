buffering<00:04:36.840> maybe<00:04:37.840> that<00:04:37.960> wasn't<00:04:38.290> such<00:04:38.410> a<00:04:38.530> good

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
buffering maybe that wasn't such a good

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.700 
buffering maybe that wasn't such a good
idea<00:04:39.389> I'm<00:04:40.389> uploading<00:04:40.750> the<00:04:41.050> other<00:04:41.169> video<00:04:41.470> while

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
I'm doing that so that's probably why

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.190

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229
