00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.560
 I have a very fresh recipe today 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.810
 let's do palette and we'll do two 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.519
 unique flavors fun that sure 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.370
 stand out among all the pallets that 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:23.950
 have been taken until today 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:28.400
 and let's go our first secret taste is 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:32.270
 blueberries ginger and basil what 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.489
 if listening afraid of the sea although almost 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.250
 always the window for pasta is 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.379
 Plant can also give you a touch 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.540
 irresistible to sweet recipes first 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.730
 let's mix the water and sugar in 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.940
 a small footprint and make them boil 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.860
 to create a kind of soft honey 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.960
 add their fresh basil leaves and 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.239
 Leave them until they become tiny and 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.809
 You take the rumpled also some 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.879
 lemon juice and ready then make sure 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.710
 to filter your basil leaves with a 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.879
 fork now you have to transform 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.879
 our blueberries in mashed 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:11.950
 before having liquid with the basil 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:16.710
 little ginger mix 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.710
 and you're ready to put it in the mold 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.250
 but let's not forget our second 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.060
 recipe our second taste secrets 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:36.470
 they will be popsicles of lemon strawberry and the band 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.470
 yes or another plant but trust me 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.570
 they give everything they hope to start putting 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.700
 boil milk honey and lavender in 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.470
 a small pot as if they were 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.020
 making a tea when you start to put 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.340
 more lavender coffee extinguish the fire and 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.340
 pour in the liquid in a bowl 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.110
 to drain the leaves now let's 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.840
 give our prey and we will put them 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.660
 the food processor but it's not in 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.890
 we're all going to leave big pieces for 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.890
 taste them better on the palette 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.150
 first your floods 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:22.370
 and now we're going to put them in the 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:22.370
 freezer for 5 to 6 hours 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.200
 they are finally made as you can see 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.689
 I could make pallets with molds 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.489
 improvised I used a cooler and chopsticks 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.989
 of teeth for this and a small 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.939
 glass container and a stick 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.799
 wood for that so the stick gets 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:39.049
 stay in the center can sustain it with 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.790
 aluminum foil so that the pallet comes out 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.430
 of the container just have to pass it 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.870
 for a little hot water our 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.790
 pallets are finally ready to 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.170
