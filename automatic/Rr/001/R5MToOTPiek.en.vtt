00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.440
 Hello my dear, today I'll show you 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.360
 a few hairstyles or hairstyles 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.400
 Variations you with a cap 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.950
 I could wear it and I have it there for 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.549
 such a small knit cap strictly like 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.830
 never and i'll show you how i do that 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.860
 hats or a cap to wear in winter 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.300
 the first thing we target a fairly 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.300
 deep side vertex and results 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.340
 then we start a French 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.030
 to weave 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.190
 but instead of superimposed we put the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.390
 so we love each other 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.390
 challenge by 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.680
 on 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.890
 and then every time you 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.590
 go from the outside down you give 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.280
 again with hair but only ever 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.280
 from one side 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.220
 wanted after that 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.530
 because it's about the same height as yours 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.130
 You're just heading back 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.130
 flee 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.340
 and we do not take hair more than from 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.070
 the whole thing stuck with one 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.290
 transparent hair tie I have the 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.619
 corpse of dm 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:08.910
 so now we can look a bit 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:12.110
 pluck the andi in for more volume 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.110
 come so he is not so flat 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.990
 Counterfeit accident looks 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.600
 and the sapphire the little tail that 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.900
 then we hide 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.940
 behind moore behind the hair and 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.940
 do that with a bobby pins 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.760
 so it does not bother later 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.800
 No 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.100
 to 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.710
 So then your result looks ok now 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.520
 comes the cap i suppose for mine 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:06.170
 cap my mini is against or knitted 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.580
 In any case, rough knit where the 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.110
 nobility can also prevail so now 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:16.180
 not a cloth cap but really the 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:16.180
 knit cap I place first 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.160
 and the hood, even if you do not like that 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.860
 I am a little bit braided 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:32.420
 comes out then it is well hidden 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:37.730
 over the ears and I take to 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:41.409
 little bobby pins and I can 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.409
 through the coarse mesh by 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.360
 pull and then fix on the head 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.540
 so that the cap stays where it is 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.370
 and yes to just have to be sure 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.860
 does not warp or slip or 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.610
 get lost 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.230
 while you do not know that on the 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.160
 christmas market is or is not 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.459
 actually you have to be really practical 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.459
 watch out 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:16.500
 and ever again 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:16.500
 through the wort and on the head 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:27.270
 So now I make three all one above 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.070
 pages a 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.020
 and you can also do one on the back of the head 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.500
 make it clean if you then sure 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:38.039
 so do not fill it with the back 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.039
 high slips 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:50.900
 which stretch through 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.900
 to grasp 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.839
 and it would be the first version 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:03.219
 of my hats look of course you can 

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:05.979
 her the iron day later again 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:08.219
 fix hence there remains where it will be 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.219
 should 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.699
 The length could also attract a trainer 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:23.279
 kick it so you still have more volume 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:23.279
 so it is even more common at topia 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.830
 but do not put the hair 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.330
 behind everything behind free and it is one 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.010
 I find perfect hairstyle for the 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:50.300
 Christmas market is cold and you 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:53.110
 sweet and chic, though 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.110
 you bring with you 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.669
 then we catch every French 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.669
 zoff on 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:20.280
 maybe again at night and from below 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.690
 then always would have 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:27.470
 on one side always on the same 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:27.470
 side strutting with to gamble 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:02.690
 then we'll head in here for a moment 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.690
 after hammerfest 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.289
 and, however, braid a small pot 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.150
 and just wash my head completely 

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:11.930
 normal down without any hair 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.930
 to take to 

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:27.229
 and the zoff 

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:40.350
 then we integrate in the big ones 

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:43.860
 surface free up all again 

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:45.660
 with a pigtail rubber firmly and then 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.430
 could again 

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:53.030
 play and pull on the braid bit 

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:53.030
 has thus become larger 

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:01.020
 and I hope it has you 

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.340
 Please have fun if that 

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.690
 so please give me one please 

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.840
 thumbs up then you get even more 

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:08.640
 to see from me and my videos and 

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.150
 now and then over the channel you miss 

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.800
 speak 

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:13.160
 I wish you a lot of fun and see you 

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.160
 next time
