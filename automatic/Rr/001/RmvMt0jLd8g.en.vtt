00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.490
 found for a new video on 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.640
 battlefield 3 and we find ourselves for a 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.130
 video glitch a video slides that I have 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.359
 found myself and sort the exact same so 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.769
 it is a lack of maxim if you cause 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.630
 vote fn it's magic 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.359
 I will put the link of his chain in the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.740
 description of the video or as before 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.599
 everything to be done if it is that I see 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.990
 this video avi the Czechs and closes the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.270
 market 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.450
 it annoys me big thank you if you 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.430
 take or slip is not to 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.440
 did not exist what will you do 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.090
 of helpful who will succeed in seeing my life 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.360
 invincible to visible something like his 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.950
 Mom is just a funny fun glitch 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.690
 that you realized that your buddies so 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.730
 look at you have to jump to a 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.530
 certain height and you have to activate 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.149
 your parachute a second to chin the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.430
 arteries and there you will die 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.070
 you have to get animated and watch 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.960
 here is the big bug could not turn 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.980
 more than 40 Â° pretty much you'll have a 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.519
 second weapon above your 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.130
 first weapon and what else there is 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.799
 your your character to do on the spot 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.060
 and you will fly when you go 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.159
 for example, you 'd go to bed soon 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.180
 I go to bed I feel it is 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.409
 went balloon for use and it's very 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.430
 complicated that we can not turn by 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.500
 example look I could not turn 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.360
 towards the left 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.990
 look there I'm going to bed hop I 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.670
 steals really huge that's in sight that 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.799
 I found myself not I steal 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.549
 guides anyway it's not my style 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.100
 to steal guides 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.740
 so it's less fun 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.360
 found it on purpose and so between post 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.820
 could really be nice 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.710
 deal so to show you look 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.450
 looking at my feet the mepi does not 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.720
 did not even move I was standing still 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.979
 to show you exactly how 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.280
 do you creep on what do you 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.829

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.200
 rd there I'm going to get killed in no 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.329
 long time 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.040
 here I was killed the enemy had to 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.930
 good laugh when he saw me he 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.070

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.530
 plane so and no need to go too
