00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.369 
internet or burger doesn't really matter
and<00:00:47.100> I'm<00:00:47.820> just<00:00:47.969> saying<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.329> easier<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.899> do<00:00:49.350> a

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
and I'm just saying it's easier to do a

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.290 
and I'm just saying it's easier to do a
change<00:00:49.950> here<00:00:50.250> where<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.520> girl<00:00:50.700> has<00:00:50.940> straight

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
change here where the girl has straight

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.170 
change here where the girl has straight
hair<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.719> lot<00:00:52.379> quicker<00:00:52.879> that's<00:00:53.879> pretty<00:00:54.090> much

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
hair a lot quicker that's pretty much

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.810 
hair a lot quicker that's pretty much
why<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.390> did<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.739> you<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.890> do<00:00:55.980> if<00:00:56.100> any<00:00:56.250> hair<00:00:56.550> but

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
why I did it you can do if any hair but

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.479 
why I did it you can do if any hair but
it's<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> lot<00:00:57.030> easier<00:00:57.770> so<00:00:58.770> we're<00:00:59.100> going<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.370> do

better<00:02:21.019> than<00:02:21.379> this<00:02:21.500> but<00:02:21.739> it's<00:02:21.980> with<00:02:22.069> the

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
better than this but it's with the

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.330 
better than this but it's with the

i'm<00:02:46.280> just<00:02:46.370> going<00:02:46.549> to<00:02:46.579> speed<00:02:46.819> this<00:02:46.849> up<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.180> little

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
i'm just going to speed this up a little

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.440 
i'm just going to speed this up a little
bit<00:02:47.540> now<00:02:48.250> off<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:49.640> also<00:02:49.880> you<00:02:50.060> can<00:02:50.180> leave<00:02:50.329> this

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
bit now off and also you can leave this

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.830 
bit now off and also you can leave this
a<00:02:50.599> risk<00:02:51.610> like<00:02:52.610> that<00:02:52.670> whatever<00:02:53.209> is<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.599> press

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
a risk like that whatever is the press

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:10.130 
a risk like that whatever is the press
on<00:02:53.989> doing<00:02:54.319> it

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.280 

no<00:03:10.860> no<00:03:10.920> like<00:03:11.190> that<00:03:11.660> okay<00:03:12.660> whatever<00:03:12.930> I'm<00:03:13.110> just

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
no no like that okay whatever I'm just

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.570 
no no like that okay whatever I'm just
gonna<00:03:13.410> screw<00:03:13.860> I<00:03:13.890> really<00:03:14.160> don't<00:03:14.310> care<00:03:14.430> now

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
gonna screw I really don't care now

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.380 
gonna screw I really don't care now
let's<00:03:15.510> just<00:03:15.720> get<00:03:15.840> this<00:03:16.080> try<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.470> get<00:03:16.650> this<00:03:16.830> good

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.270 

and<00:03:21.390> also<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:21.930> just<00:03:22.140> keep<00:03:22.380> tacking<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.920> map

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
and also you just keep tacking the map

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.670 
and also you just keep tacking the map
key<00:03:23.580> so<00:03:24.300> I<00:03:24.330> can<00:03:24.450> get<00:03:24.630> like<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.870> corners<00:03:25.260> easier

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
key so I can get like the corners easier

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.170 
key so I can get like the corners easier
because<00:03:25.830> if<00:03:26.100> you<00:03:26.220> screw<00:03:26.490> up<00:03:26.550> you<00:03:26.820> can<00:03:26.970> always

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
because if you screw up you can always

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.540 
because if you screw up you can always
undo<00:03:27.300> that<00:03:27.570> one<00:03:27.810> part<00:03:28.050> and<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.950> want<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.280> redo

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
undo that one part and you want to redo

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.870 
undo that one part and you want to redo
a<00:03:29.580> lot<00:03:29.700> of<00:03:30.090> your<00:03:30.240> stuff<00:03:30.270> is<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.720> big<00:03:30.930> one

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.150 

normally<00:03:35.880> i<00:03:35.910> would<00:03:36.120> get<00:03:36.239> that<00:03:36.510> but<00:03:37.040> it's<00:03:38.040> the

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
normally i would get that but it's the

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.250 
normally i would get that but it's the
tutorial<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:38.730> i<00:03:38.790> really<00:03:39.000> don't<00:03:39.150> care<00:03:42.170> so<00:03:43.170> i
