00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240
 I'm afraid to show you my next evolution 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.280
 now it's time to continue with 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.230
 my revenge had not had time to 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.940
 talk about this movie I wanted to do it 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.590
 since its premiere but until today I had the 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.119
 opportunity to do it and what better 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.220
 excuse that having reached more than 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.930
 10,000 subscribers on my channel 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.300
 thank you very much for being in 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.070
 inspector click to each of you so 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.740
 that lÃ³pez I will leave in the best way 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.529
 it which is giving a review that 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.630
 and many were waiting for just one note I'm going to 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.150
 assume that everyone saw this movie 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.120
 because I will not stop to explain anything of 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.250
 the plot well clarified that we started 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.260
 Many already know that dragon ball z is my 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.060
 favorite anime to date so that 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.920
 it will not be a surprise to you the 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.810
 know how much I liked this 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.060
 movie but what was a surprise 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.860
 for me, this movie does not just 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.900
 he liked it a lot but that's how 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.210
 simple I'll say it 's by far the best 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.340
 dragon ball z movie I've seen 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.560
 to date and I know it sounds pretty 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.910
 exaggerated and disproportionate more as if 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.159
 was a reaction out of pure nostalgia 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.470
 that for another thing but I think rather 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.000
 nostalgia is what people do 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.100
 of all the previous films of 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.570
 dragon ball z as much bigger than 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.670
 what really were the movies 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.530
 be encouraged have always been more a 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.780
 proposal about something you do not see much 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.660
 in the normal series experiments I would say 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.970
 and I've always seen them with those eyes yes 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.170
 it's true that it has a great animation and 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.360
 They have all the features 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.610
 characteristic of the series however 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.130
 mostly out of the fights 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.840
 there's nothing to see in these movies and 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.090
 do not misunderstand me, fascinate me 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.650
 dragon ball z fights but equally 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.200
 I like the developed world in the 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.060
 series just like the characters things 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.550
 that they largely forget in most 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.410
 of your movies so well clarified 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.240
 this is what I like most about the 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.950
 frizer resurrection first 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.990
 I love how well crafted the 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.940
 story I thought there was no way 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.070
 consistent to make fisher an enemy 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.420
 strong again within the series in 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.520
 special when it had already weakened 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.500
 both within the same but this 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.330
 movie I came to prove that a little 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.430
 of writing work is all that 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.200
 I needed to be perfect 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.989
 resurrection of frizer meets two 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.550
 One purpose is to celebrate many 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.040
 of the best parts of dragon ball z 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.380
 like humor fights and tension 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.510
 honoring the most famous villain of the 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.680
 same the other function that it fulfills is 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.780
 complement it 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.819
 movie with a lot of what will be the 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.920
 new future of dragon ball with the new 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.750
 dragon ball series super what is 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.519
 look so funny is that many people 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.709
 they complain about the inconsistency of this 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.750
 movie and the series which is peculiar 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.909
 I do not care because in these movies 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.379
 you never have to be very literal just 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.269
 meet the objective of presenting 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.939
 concepts and see that they continue to work 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.920
 with them in the future so the talks 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.609
 about the leveling of the powers of each 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.889
 character 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:50.019
 the inclusion of another character of a 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:52.060
 Akira Toriyama's Sleeve Blue Hair 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.950
 the super sayayin or because goyanes a 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.530
 wimpy thing that I must admit that 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.480
 I also hate want ice cream in truth and 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.639
 the interesting thing is to focus on all the 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.620
 message that gives the movie behind what 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.810
 I take away from this movie it's a bit 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.120
 much more presumptuous and with many 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.620
 defects a very interesting mix of 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.500
 what was tried in dragon ball 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.389
 gt but much better than executed does 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.849
 a lot that I did not see any attempt at 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:17.739
 make goku a more complete character and 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.900
 I love also I take a 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.150
 very good farewell to freezer that by 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.829
 I certainly loved the detail that only 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.199
 training a little becomes so 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.530
 powerful equally I loved that his 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:29.200
 weak 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.700
 give out again his just arrogance 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.709
 the detail that has led him to his 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.630
 perdition but my favorite part for 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.819
 A lot is like finally 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.830
 Akira Toriyama shows a little love 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.410
 by vegueta that is of my characters 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.540
 favorite tour and same call has admitted 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.190
 vegetating that character Least 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.680
 like and if you can see all the 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.810
 movies before this will see that it is 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.120
 ridiculous how much a vegueta has been 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.100
 minimized many think that dancing 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.489
 of bingo is the worst thing that has happened to 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.000
 character and believe me are not even close in 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.709
 that 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.780
 comparing all the movies against 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.269
 this beauty finally has something of 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.180
 credit and advance to finally approach 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.459
 to surpass aro q for god so much for 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.170
 talk and so little time are we going to do 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.150
 this to celebrate my 100,000 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.920
 subscribers in inspector here I go to 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.810
 talk about each and every one of the 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.000
 dragon ball z movies and what 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.220
 I think of them in this way they will have 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.110
 a better perspective of why this is 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.200
 for me the best dragon ball movie 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.389
 so far it is one by one all the 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.460
 movies to see if they really are so 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:32.500
 good as everyone remembers her or 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.570
 it's just a matter of nostalgia 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.430
 I do not ignore the faults of the resurrection 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.590
 of frizer as the inconsistency of the 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.930
 animation very notorious changes from 2d to 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.390
 3d in the fights a visual style of 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.970
 which I'm not a big fan and this tendency to 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.590
 only focus on goku and vegeta but with 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.660
 everything and everything is still the most 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.070
 highlight and what I have enjoyed the most 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.900
 to date 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.580
 at the end of this series of videos my 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.950
 interest in the cake will be a small 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.780
 super dragon ball review to where 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.850
 I think it's time for me to go up 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.230
 dragon ball boat z a series that 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.940
 I've always wanted to play much 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.830
 inspector ki and finally I see the 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.140
 perfect opportunity to talk a lot 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.360
 of the subject so be aware of the 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.850
 channel that it's time to give goku and his 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.360
 friends the love they deserve so much 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.360
 the next
