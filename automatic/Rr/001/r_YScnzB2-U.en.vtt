00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
goal it's worth noting though the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.929 
goal it's worth noting though the
Butland<00:01:48.689> stats<00:01:48.930> are<00:01:49.170> taken<00:01:49.920> from<00:01:50.100> only<00:01:50.579> three

Butland stats are taken from only three

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.760 
Butland stats are taken from only three
games<00:01:51.149> because<00:01:51.899> that's<00:01:52.049> all<00:01:52.229> he<00:01:52.350> played<00:01:52.590> last

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.440 
games because that's all he played last
season<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.640> they're<00:01:53.790> not<00:01:53.909> going<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.210> be<00:01:54.299> as

sixteen clean sheets just one less than
Chelsea<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.070> I<00:02:35.610> think<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:36.060> my<00:02:36.209> Hill<00:02:36.420> is<00:02:36.660> the

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
Chelsea and I think that my Hill is the

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.740 
Chelsea and I think that my Hill is the
clear<00:02:37.140> favorite<00:02:37.620> for<00:02:37.740> me<00:02:37.860> I<00:02:38.390> even<00:02:39.390> think<00:02:39.600> is

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
clear favorite for me I even think is

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.480 
clear favorite for me I even think is
worth<00:02:39.930> starting<00:02:40.260> off<00:02:40.470> with<00:02:40.590> both<00:02:40.830> Michael<00:02:41.280> and

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
worth starting off with both Michael and

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.550 
worth starting off with both Michael and
foster<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.240> keeping<00:02:42.900> them<00:02:43.020> for<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.260> entire

through<00:02:46.590> last<00:02:46.770> season<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.370> they<00:02:47.730> still

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
through last season and they still

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.270 
through last season and they still
managed<00:02:48.360> 16<00:02:48.750> clean<00:02:48.930> sheets<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:49.770> imagine<00:02:50.040> what

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
managed 16 clean sheets so imagine what

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.590 
managed 16 clean sheets so imagine what
they<00:02:50.400> can<00:02:50.459> do<00:02:50.730> with<00:02:50.760> beauties<00:02:51.150> for<00:02:51.300> a<00:02:51.360> full

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
season amongst it seems that West Brom

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.790 
season amongst it seems that West Brom
kept<00:02:54.239> a<00:02:54.360> clean<00:02:54.540> sheet<00:02:54.570> against<00:02:55.110> last<00:02:55.380> season

United Chelsea Spurs at Everton so

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.979 
United Chelsea Spurs at Everton so
they're<00:03:02.910> clearly<00:03:03.150> not<00:03:03.239> a<00:03:03.360> team<00:03:03.570> that<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:03.810> can

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
they're clearly not a team that you can

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.930 
they're clearly not a team that you can
rotate<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.650> play<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.010> fixtures<00:03:05.459> with<00:03:05.640> and

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
rotate and play the fixtures with and

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.820 
rotate and play the fixtures with and
that's<00:03:06.570> why<00:03:06.720> I<00:03:06.750> think<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.140> best<00:03:07.350> option<00:03:07.470> with

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
that's why I think the best option with

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.800 
that's why I think the best option with
goalkeepers<00:03:08.370> is<00:03:08.550> to<00:03:08.790> start<00:03:09.060> off<00:03:09.180> with<00:03:09.420> my<00:03:09.600> Hill

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
goalkeepers is to start off with my Hill
