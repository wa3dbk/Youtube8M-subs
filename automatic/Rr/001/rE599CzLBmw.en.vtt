00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
have to be perfect circles anyway they

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.500 
have to be perfect circles anyway they
just<00:02:43.680> have<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:44.010> be<00:02:44.159> round<00:02:44.940> ish<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:47.760> perfection

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
just have to be round ish so perfection

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.619 
just have to be round ish so perfection

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.800 
don't damage the nail polish which is
the<00:03:58.769> reason<00:03:58.980> why<00:03:59.340> I<00:03:59.370> put<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.819> top<00:04:00.060> coat<00:04:00.329> before<00:04:00.569> I

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
the reason why I put a top coat before I

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.599 
the reason why I put a top coat before I
started<00:04:01.410> doing<00:04:01.560> this<00:04:01.769> I<00:04:01.919> just<00:04:01.950> wanted<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.459> have

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
started doing this I just wanted to have

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.470 
started doing this I just wanted to have
a<00:04:02.639> really<00:04:02.970> smooth<00:04:03.269> surface<00:04:03.750> to<00:04:03.930> work<00:04:03.959> with<00:04:04.430> so

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
a really smooth surface to work with so

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.849 
a really smooth surface to work with so
that's<00:04:06.480> that's<00:04:06.900> one<00:04:07.169> advantage<00:04:07.290> of<00:04:07.680> doing
