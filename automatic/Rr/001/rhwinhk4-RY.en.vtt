00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
right way because no one can possibly

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.110

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
know until it comes out but in my last

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.330 
know until it comes out but in my last
night<00:00:48.420> or<00:00:48.690> chapter<00:00:49.110> predictions<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.950> claimed

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
night or chapter predictions I claimed

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.910 
night or chapter predictions I claimed
that<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:51.000> believed<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.840> Kakashi<00:00:52.199> could<00:00:52.680> have

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
that I believed that Kakashi could have

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.250 
that I believed that Kakashi could have
a<00:00:52.949> chance<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.699> getting<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.180> EMS<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:54.989> really

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
a chance of getting the EMS and I really

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.920 
a chance of getting the EMS and I really
didn't<00:00:55.530> go<00:00:55.649> into<00:00:55.949> detail<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.760> why<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.510> thought

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
didn't go into detail of why I thought

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.260 
didn't go into detail of why I thought
that<00:00:57.989> or<00:00:58.440> like<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.129> variables<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.820> why<00:01:00.239> I

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
that or like the variables of why I

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.630 
that or like the variables of why I
believe<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.960> can<00:01:01.140> happen<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.100> thought<00:01:02.460> that

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
believe it can happen so I thought that

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.039 
believe it can happen so I thought that
I<00:01:02.730> could<00:01:02.879> clear<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.180> up<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.600> video<00:01:03.870> you

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
I could clear it up in this video you

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.140 
I could clear it up in this video you
know<00:01:04.140> usually<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.799> go<00:01:05.189> into<00:01:05.369> depth<00:01:05.700> with<00:01:05.850> stuff

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
know usually I go into depth with stuff

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.969 
know usually I go into depth with stuff
like<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.540> I'm<00:01:06.869> not<00:01:07.049> sure<00:01:07.229> why<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.439> didn't<00:01:07.860> I

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
like that I'm not sure why I didn't I

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.820 
like that I'm not sure why I didn't I
guess<00:01:08.250> because<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:09.180> idea<00:01:09.570> came<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.900> me<00:01:10.260> as<00:01:10.470> I

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
guess because the idea came to me as I

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.130 
guess because the idea came to me as I
was<00:01:10.979> making<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.430> video<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.299> really<00:01:12.720> did<00:01:12.960> you

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
was making the video so I really did you

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.630 
was making the video so I really did you
know<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.439> time<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.920> prepare<00:01:14.070> what<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.490> was

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
know have time to prepare what I was

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.130 
know have time to prepare what I was
going<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.000> say<00:01:15.180> because<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> lot<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:15.960> people

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
going to say because a lot of people

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.980 
going to say because a lot of people
were<00:01:16.380> confused<00:01:16.920> about<00:01:17.189> what<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.640> said<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.299> how

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
were confused about what I said and how

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.320 
were confused about what I said and how
I<00:01:19.020> said<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.770> he<00:01:20.130> could<00:01:20.310> possibly<00:01:20.670> get<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.000> MS

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
I said that he could possibly get the MS

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.050 
I said that he could possibly get the MS
so<00:01:21.780> I'm<00:01:22.020> going<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.409> clear<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.770> up<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.220> be<00:01:23.759> as

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
so I'm going to clear it up and be as

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.770 
so I'm going to clear it up and be as
detailed<00:01:25.189> as<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.400> possibly<00:01:26.850> can<00:01:27.119> because<00:01:27.420> it

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
detailed as I possibly can because it

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.569 
detailed as I possibly can because it
makes<00:01:27.990> sense<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.530> my<00:01:28.650> mind<00:01:28.890> but<00:01:29.159> sometimes

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
makes sense in my mind but sometimes

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.760 
makes sense in my mind but sometimes
coming<00:01:29.909> out<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.329> say<00:01:30.570> something<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.530> makes

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
coming out to say something that makes

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.679 
coming out to say something that makes
sense<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.579> doesn't<00:01:32.880> make<00:01:33.119> sense<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.479> everyone

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
sense it doesn't make sense to everyone

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.690 
sense it doesn't make sense to everyone
else<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.020> I'm<00:01:34.200> going<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.530> try<00:01:34.740> my<00:01:35.040> best<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.610> make

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
else so I'm going to try my best to make

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.690 
else so I'm going to try my best to make
it<00:01:35.880> sound<00:01:36.630> at<00:01:36.960> least<00:01:37.259> logical<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.460> guys

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.880 
it sound at least logical to you guys
now<00:01:38.909> first<00:01:39.210> off<00:01:39.509> we<00:01:39.810> all<00:01:39.930> know<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.530> Kakashi

and the thing that I said my predictions

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.469 
and the thing that I said my predictions
were<00:01:46.079> since<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:47.070> mangekyo<00:01:47.430> was<00:01:47.909> put<00:01:48.270> into

it's a mangekyo sharingan that they

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.100 
it's a mangekyo sharingan that they
could<00:01:52.979> possibly<00:01:53.189> evolve<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:54.600> there<00:01:54.750> are<00:01:54.869> many

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
could possibly evolve but there are many

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.859 
could possibly evolve but there are many
many<00:01:55.439> more<00:01:55.740> variables<00:01:56.340> than<00:01:56.520> just<00:01:57.060> Marvel

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
many more variables than just Marvel

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.899 
many more variables than just Marvel
being<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.439> og<00:01:58.799> Hawk<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.219> main<00:01:59.399> questions

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
being and og Hawk the main questions

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.600 
being and og Hawk the main questions
that<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.149> saw<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.840> my<00:02:01.110> prediction<00:02:01.439> video<00:02:01.950> was

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
that I saw in my prediction video was

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.340 
that I saw in my prediction video was
how<00:02:02.969> would<00:02:03.210> Kakashi<00:02:03.540> get<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> showing<00:02:04.170> gone

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
how would Kakashi get a showing gone

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.469 
how would Kakashi get a showing gone
back<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.890> mean<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.399> part<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.909> relatively

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
back I mean that part is relatively

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.419 
back I mean that part is relatively
simple<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.259> lot<00:02:07.500> it's<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.920> simplest<00:02:08.310> thing

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
simple a lot it's the simplest thing

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.430 
simple a lot it's the simplest thing
I'll<00:02:08.700> be<00:02:08.849> discussing<00:02:09.149> in<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:09.599> video<00:02:09.929> anyway

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629 
possible because Madara and obito are

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:06.720 
possible because Madara and obito are
not<00:03:05.019> related<00:03:05.620> et<00:03:05.920> cetera<00:03:06.099> et<00:03:06.220> cetera<00:03:06.430> blah

I<00:03:07.269> do<00:03:07.450> agree<00:03:08.109> with<00:03:08.200> that<00:03:08.349> but<00:03:09.040> when<00:03:09.609> you<00:03:09.700> think

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
I do agree with that but when you think

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.559 
I do agree with that but when you think
about<00:03:10.090> it

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
about it

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.250 
about it
moderate<00:03:11.200> does<00:03:11.650> he<00:03:11.980> or<00:03:12.250> does<00:03:12.579> he<00:03:12.849> not<00:03:13.150> have<00:03:13.720> the

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
moderate does he or does he not have the

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.759 
moderate does he or does he not have the
the<00:03:14.560> power<00:03:15.159> of<00:03:15.579> the<00:03:16.120> ancestor<00:03:16.750> of<00:03:16.780> all<00:03:17.109> she<00:03:17.590> hot

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
the power of the ancestor of all she hot

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.039 
the power of the ancestor of all she hot
anyway<00:03:18.129> so<00:03:18.730> really<00:03:19.090> when<00:03:19.269> you<00:03:19.329> think<00:03:19.599> about<00:03:19.660> it

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
anyway so really when you think about it

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.420 
anyway so really when you think about it
it<00:03:20.349> could<00:03:20.590> go<00:03:20.889> either<00:03:21.129> way

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
it could go either way

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.189 
it could go either way
and<00:03:21.669> I<00:03:21.760> remember<00:03:22.090> someone<00:03:22.329> said<00:03:22.750> that<00:03:23.049> he

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:23.199 
and I remember someone said that he

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:25.710 
and I remember someone said that he
doesn't<00:03:23.379> have<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:24.040> chakra<00:03:24.730> or<00:03:24.970> power<00:03:25.180> of<00:03:25.510> hog

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
doesn't have the chakra or power of hog

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.900 
doesn't have the chakra or power of hog
or<00:03:25.900> ammo<00:03:26.109> but<00:03:26.349> of<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.650> ten<00:03:26.889> tails<00:03:27.129> but<00:03:27.730> when

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
or ammo but of the ten tails but when

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.400 
or ammo but of the ten tails but when
you<00:03:28.000> think<00:03:28.269> about<00:03:28.449> it<00:03:28.810> think<00:03:29.109> about<00:03:29.169> this

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
you think about it think about this

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.439 
you think about it think about this
listen<00:03:29.769> very<00:03:30.010> carefully<00:03:30.280> because<00:03:30.669> it<00:03:31.180> could

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:31.449 
listen very carefully because it could

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:33.210 
listen very carefully because it could
sound<00:03:32.079> kind<00:03:32.470> of<00:03:32.530> confusing

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
sound kind of confusing

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.970 
sound kind of confusing
we<00:03:33.519> know<00:03:33.699> that<00:03:33.910> Katya<00:03:34.359> ate<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:35.500> fruit<00:03:35.799> from

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
we know that Katya ate the fruit from

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.220 
we know that Katya ate the fruit from
the<00:03:36.160> god<00:03:36.370> tree<00:03:36.730> and<00:03:37.000> became<00:03:37.329> this<00:03:37.690> this

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
the god tree and became this this

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.159 
the god tree and became this this
all-powerful<00:03:39.040> demon<00:03:39.970> light<00:03:40.180> thing<00:03:40.449> or<00:03:40.690> so<00:03:40.930> we

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
all-powerful demon light thing or so we

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.890 
all-powerful demon light thing or so we
were<00:03:41.319> showing<00:03:41.560> away<00:03:41.919> and<00:03:42.160> then<00:03:42.639> she<00:03:42.970> had<00:03:43.239> hog

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
were showing away and then she had hog

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.920 
were showing away and then she had hog
or<00:03:44.109> mole<00:03:44.349> and<00:03:44.590> his<00:03:44.859> brother<00:03:45.190> so<00:03:45.910> it's<00:03:46.449> safe<00:03:46.750> to

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
or mole and his brother so it's safe to

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.680 
or mole and his brother so it's safe to
say<00:03:46.959> that<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:47.590> trees<00:03:47.889> power<00:03:48.220> is<00:03:48.639> inside<00:03:49.329> of

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
say that the trees power is inside of

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.890 
say that the trees power is inside of
hog<00:03:50.079> or<00:03:50.319> mow<00:03:50.560> so<00:03:51.190> we<00:03:51.699> know<00:03:51.910> that<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.299> tree<00:03:52.629> is

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
hog or mow so we know that the tree is

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.759 
hog or mow so we know that the tree is
210<00:03:53.680> tails<00:03:53.980> so<00:03:54.400> in<00:03:54.760> a<00:03:55.239> sense<00:03:55.629> the<00:03:56.199> ten<00:03:56.500> tails

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
210 tails so in a sense the ten tails

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.699 
210 tails so in a sense the ten tails
power<00:03:57.220> really<00:03:57.940> is<00:03:58.030> hog<00:03:58.750> or<00:03:58.959> most<00:03:59.199> power<00:03:59.409> just

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
power really is hog or most power just

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.559 
power really is hog or most power just
in<00:03:59.859> case<00:04:00.010> I<00:04:00.190> lost<00:04:00.310> some<00:04:00.519> of<00:04:00.609> you<00:04:00.730> guys<00:04:00.909> the

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
in case I lost some of you guys the

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.050 
in case I lost some of you guys the
fruit<00:04:01.930> was<00:04:02.290> eaten<00:04:02.590> by<00:04:02.620> Katya<00:04:03.190> so<00:04:03.579> she<00:04:03.639> has<00:04:03.909> two

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
fruit was eaten by Katya so she has two

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.780 
fruit was eaten by Katya so she has two
trees<00:04:04.269> power<00:04:04.480> it<00:04:04.989> was<00:04:05.139> passed<00:04:05.440> on<00:04:05.680> from<00:04:06.459> birth

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
trees power it was passed on from birth

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.339 
trees power it was passed on from birth
to<00:04:07.090> hog<00:04:07.239> or<00:04:07.419> Moe<00:04:07.569> and<00:04:07.750> his<00:04:07.840> brother<00:04:08.109> and<00:04:08.290> the

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
to hog or Moe and his brother and the

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.920 
to hog or Moe and his brother and the
ten<00:04:08.560> tails<00:04:08.739> is<00:04:09.129> the<00:04:09.729> guide<00:04:09.940> tree<00:04:10.329> essentially

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
ten tails is the guide tree essentially

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.580 
ten tails is the guide tree essentially
so<00:04:11.379> really<00:04:12.069> the<00:04:12.669> tree<00:04:13.030> is<00:04:13.569> hog<00:04:13.989> or<00:04:14.199> most<00:04:14.409> power

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
so really the tree is hog or most power

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.949 
so really the tree is hog or most power
so<00:04:14.859> the<00:04:15.010> ten<00:04:15.280> tails<00:04:15.609> if<00:04:15.940> the<00:04:16.120> tree<00:04:16.449> and<00:04:16.750> the

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
so the ten tails if the tree and the

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.439 
so the ten tails if the tree and the
tree<00:04:16.989> was<00:04:17.769> the<00:04:17.949> source<00:04:18.250> of<00:04:18.549> the<00:04:18.849> original

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
tree was the source of the original

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.980 
tree was the source of the original
Sookie<00:04:20.200> power<00:04:20.739> so<00:04:21.280> yes<00:04:21.549> since<00:04:22.060> obito's

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
Sookie power so yes since obito's

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.670 
Sookie power so yes since obito's
mangekyo<00:04:23.469> sharingan<00:04:23.950> is

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
mangekyo sharingan is

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.520 
mangekyo sharingan is
side<00:04:25.009> of<00:04:25.430> motherís<00:04:26.419> skull<00:04:26.750> it<00:04:27.199> could

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
side of motherís skull it could

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.219 
side of motherís skull it could
transform<00:04:27.919> it<00:04:28.280> to<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.460> EMS<00:04:28.970> because<00:04:29.690> moderate

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
transform it to the EMS because moderate

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.760 
transform it to the EMS because moderate
now<00:04:30.410> has<00:04:30.740> the<00:04:31.039> power<00:04:31.250> of<00:04:31.639> the<00:04:32.570> ancestor<00:04:33.320> of<00:04:33.350> all

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
now has the power of the ancestor of all

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.400 
now has the power of the ancestor of all
she<00:04:34.250> had<00:04:34.430> so<00:04:34.789> that<00:04:34.940> kind<00:04:35.240> of<00:04:35.300> solves<00:04:35.810> the<00:04:36.080> you

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
she had so that kind of solves the you

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.779 
she had so that kind of solves the you
know<00:04:36.530> you<00:04:36.590> have<00:04:36.800> to<00:04:36.919> be<00:04:37.039> a<00:04:37.070> mother<00:04:37.370> for<00:04:37.729> the

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
know you have to be a mother for the

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:39.879 
know you have to be a mother for the
change<00:04:38.270> to<00:04:38.479> the<00:04:38.570> EMS<00:04:38.900> thing<00:04:39.350> but<00:04:39.560> either<00:04:39.740> way

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
change to the EMS thing but either way

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.640 
change to the EMS thing but either way
whether<00:04:40.310> Kakashi<00:04:40.850> gets<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:41.630> EMS<00:04:42.080> back<00:04:42.320> or<00:04:42.560> if

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
whether Kakashi gets the EMS back or if

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.260 
whether Kakashi gets the EMS back or if
you<00:04:42.740> just<00:04:43.039> get<00:04:43.220> just<00:04:43.400> a<00:04:43.430> regular<00:04:43.759> Sharingan

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
you just get just a regular Sharingan

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.330 
you just get just a regular Sharingan
back<00:04:44.509> I'm<00:04:44.900> pretty<00:04:45.199> sure<00:04:45.440> Keisha<00:04:45.770> model<00:04:46.190> won't

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
back I'm pretty sure Keisha model won't

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.870 
back I'm pretty sure Keisha model won't
just<00:04:46.729> leave<00:04:46.970> him<00:04:47.330> blinded<00:04:48.289> and<00:04:48.530> this<00:04:49.370> one<00:04:49.669> eye

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
just leave him blinded and this one eye

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.580 
just leave him blinded and this one eye
for<00:04:50.270> the<00:04:50.419> rest<00:04:50.600> of<00:04:50.750> the<00:04:50.810> series<00:04:50.990> because<00:04:51.259> I

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
for the rest of the series because I

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.370 
for the rest of the series because I
mean<00:04:51.770> come<00:04:51.949> on<00:04:52.100> he<00:04:52.580> and<00:04:52.910> guy<00:04:53.180> are<00:04:53.570> like<00:04:53.900> eternal

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
mean come on he and guy are like eternal

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.070 
mean come on he and guy are like eternal
rival<00:04:54.680> and<00:04:54.830> in<00:04:55.009> this<00:04:55.190> war<00:04:55.490> guy<00:04:55.970> has<00:04:56.330> stepped<00:04:56.780> it

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
rival and in this war guy has stepped it

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.020 
rival and in this war guy has stepped it
up<00:04:57.729> considerably

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
up considerably

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.300 
up considerably
way<00:04:59.419> more<00:04:59.449> than<00:04:59.870> Kakashi<00:05:00.380> has<00:05:00.590> so<00:05:00.949> I<00:05:01.009> thought

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
way more than Kakashi has so I thought

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.310 
way more than Kakashi has so I thought
that<00:05:01.490> kishimoto<00:05:02.000> will<00:05:02.150> keep<00:05:02.389> saying<00:05:03.289> you

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
that kishimoto will keep saying you

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.350 
that kishimoto will keep saying you
to<00:05:03.500> Kakashi<00:05:03.919> because<00:05:04.370> he's<00:05:04.580> headed<00:05:04.940> bad<00:05:05.120> this

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
to Kakashi because he's headed bad this

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.450 
to Kakashi because he's headed bad this
war<00:05:05.599> this<00:05:05.930> guy<00:05:06.199> just<00:05:06.440> got<00:05:06.590> his<00:05:06.740> eye<00:05:06.979> snatched

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
war this guy just got his eye snatched

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.580 
war this guy just got his eye snatched
out<00:05:07.729> what<00:05:08.030> he<00:05:08.270> could<00:05:08.419> not<00:05:08.449> get<00:05:08.780> a<00:05:08.810> break<00:05:09.020> so<00:05:09.500> I'm

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
out what he could not get a break so I'm

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.129 
out what he could not get a break so I'm
pretty<00:05:09.770> sure<00:05:10.070> he'll<00:05:10.340> get<00:05:10.520> and<00:05:10.849> I<00:05:11.090> back<00:05:11.419> so<00:05:11.960> the

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
pretty sure he'll get and I back so the

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.260 
pretty sure he'll get and I back so the
question<00:05:12.470> is<00:05:12.680> will<00:05:13.130> it<00:05:13.160> be<00:05:13.280> just<00:05:13.849> the<00:05:13.940> same

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
question is will it be just the same

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.810 
question is will it be just the same
Sharingan<00:05:14.870> will<00:05:15.349> it<00:05:15.440> have<00:05:15.560> undergone<00:05:16.430> a

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
Sharingan will it have undergone a
