00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello friends welcome to a new 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.660
 chess game this time 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.420
 we have a position in which we see 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.090
 great material advantage on the part of 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.960
 black on this occasion they have the 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.810
 beginning 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:20.890
 a horse and a bishop more than 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:24.340
 White instead, White has two 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.400
 powerful past pawns with which they 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.830
 are imposed in this game and the advantage 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.230
 black material is not enough for the 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.030
 video try to guess what is the 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.610
 correct play without taking it explained to 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.950
 continuation is well worth the white ones 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.800
 impose playing 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:46.059
 and sacrifice of tower 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:49.420
 tower by g7 if it was not enough 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.510
 material that blacks have yet 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.510
 White sacrifices one more tower 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.510
 but 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.320
 this tower can not be eaten for a theme 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.300
 tactical that I explain later to the 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.330
 finalize the explanation of what the 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:09.070
 correct play black the correct play 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:16.440
 black is horse 6 being bad is the 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:21.280
 better would come g8 tower check king by h7 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:24.039
 now your streams white are already 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.899
 threatening issues of mate or that the 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:28.990
 blacks have to be covered and not 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:31.929
 there is no alternative but to interpose the 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.630
 tower to give the king an exit 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:37.690
 when they come to the column be long 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.159
 Check that if it were not for sure it would be 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.259
 checkmate 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:46.000
 if the tower was not there to interpose 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:48.040
 the tower to that 1 check king 8 as the 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.980
 icio takes refuge 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:57.340
 behind the tower but now enter 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:02:00.160
 game the other passed pawn or c7 threaten 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.610
 with crowning the horse you can not take it 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:07.150
 because it is simply now nailed 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.890
 by the action of the lady is worth that is 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.610
 Black does not have any choice 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.500
 to bring the tower to prevent 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.819
 that crown pawn 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.980
 and have another lava 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:25.230
 Now White of 8 and Black does not 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.629
 they have more good remedy what 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.020
 would turn a black lady 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:34.940
 they would take 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:38.660
 and the white lady for 0-8 check and now 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.330
 we see how the material advantage is 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.940
 changing and the blacks are delivering 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.860
 all your entire material advantage for two 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.560
 simple past pawns that had the 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.790
 white to black women have nothing left 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:56.860
 more than roots 7 now towers by g7 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:00.640
 check horse for g 7 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.700
 and tower h 6 and see when looking at the position 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.250
 as how the material advantage has 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.400
 changed and now it's white that 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.760
 They also have a great position 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.670
 with a lot of threats because they have the 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.880
 material advantage of tower by horse 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.370
 let's go back to the position where the 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.980
 white captured the tower forgiveness the 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:29.250
 plant captured the bishop 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.250
 the position in principle would be like this 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.430
 the couturier that although the pawns are 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.510
 blocked east by the king with a large 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:00.680
 black material advantage and this pawn with 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.819
 the sentinel of the infovir here the horse 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.470
 blocking him is not enough to 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:12.299
 stop them the two pawns as I said 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:15.150
 when the white ones make a tower 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:18.519
 bishop that we have seen that being bad the 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:22.829
 best move was horse is 6 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.829
 if Black is wrong 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.940
 and they take the tower really is really bad 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.910
 played because he comes 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:36.800
 checkmate followed with another 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:39.810
 Lady G8 sacrifice hawking tower 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.550
 by g8 and 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.610
 the unstoppable pawn crowning 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.760
 crown with lady and is a checkmate to 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.460
 King is worth good friends yes he liked this 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:56.260
 video because you already know how to do I like no 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.260
 I will put next greetings to all
