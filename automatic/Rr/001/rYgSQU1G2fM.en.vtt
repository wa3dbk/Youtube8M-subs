00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.000

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.250
 your arc xperia on your TV through the buy connection 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.140

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.200
 you advocate the hdmi standard hdmi micro cable 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.349
 that you have first auction 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.349
 the micro crisis 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.020
 you plug in 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.950
 your art experience 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.420
 and from there my TV that was actually going to light up 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.670
 automatically those connected immediately 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.400
 the right channel the external hdd that I read using 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.210
 to connect the cable 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.420
 and my smartphone 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.630
 who was sure that the home page 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.000
 going to go into the right application ie the question what 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.370
 this is the application that interests me to watch my photos avoid 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.950
 that's what was happening 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.840
 and you see I did not touch anything 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.410
 the TV is turned on automatically and the smartphone sony 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.880
 automatically also safe 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.510
 the application of the rules 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.510
 and from there for example I will be able to view the photos 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.990
 what I will realize that on the smartphone will happen immediately 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.990
 and without any delay on the TV 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.610
 as you can see once the photo is loaded 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.180
 I will be able to make a slide show 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.240
 it's very simple I can come back 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.370
 on the video menu for example 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.400
 alas launch a video 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.000
 with a quality bought since I used the connector buy 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.790
 but it is not all the more impressive it is to be able to pose 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.570
 his smartphone next to his TV he uses the protocol has 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.310
 been put to drive his smartphone 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.790
 with the remote control 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.840
 take control of his face 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.470
 and from there josÃ© navigate in the menus of galls alain cossette and 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.470
 how to look 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:17.540
 I'm going on a video 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.540

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:26.979
 Thursday the back 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:30.689

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.579
 smartphone hdmi 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.529
 on the screen buy 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:37.929
 if I'm going to be able to get out of the city app 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:39.209
 and watch 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.099
 the whole music question on my TV but from that 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.900
 moment I can not use the remote control so it's the turn of the 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.599
 predecessors 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.989
 and I'm going to go for example on 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.279
 it was question good luck 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:54.969
 I see in application of March 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:59.069
 alas i arrive on a map because of the united states and i will go 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.149
 precisely in new york the advantage of new york is to be able to display and the 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:04.389
 3d city 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:06.709
 these are these so it's clear 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.899
 in the same way 

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:11.550
 all the people around me to be able to 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.180
 look very comfortable way on this TV screen the map that I am 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.269
 go files 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.239
 this feature should be extended across all major 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.259
 cities of the world 

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:24.299
 one as you can see I can play 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.019
 and i'm in new york 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.159
 and I can obviously do everything I'm used to doing his bit of 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.159
 match in terms of finding places of interest 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.259
 will come to support 

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:37.489
 I hope I convinced you
