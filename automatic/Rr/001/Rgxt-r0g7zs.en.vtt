00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.129 
doing a quick review on two of my
laptops<00:00:07.859> well<00:00:08.550> it's<00:00:09.030> more<00:00:09.300> like<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.480> comparison

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
laptops well it's more like a comparison

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.330 
laptops well it's more like a comparison
i'm<00:00:10.230> comparing<00:00:10.590> them<00:00:10.860> i<00:00:11.730> originally<00:00:12.330> had<00:00:12.599> the

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
i'm comparing them i originally had the

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.269 
i'm comparing them i originally had the
17j<00:00:14.450> 184<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.690> r<00:00:15.960> which<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.920> this<00:00:17.070> one<00:00:17.220> right

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
17j 184 and r which is this one right

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.460 
17j 184 and r which is this one right
here<00:00:17.460> it's<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.449> bigger<00:00:18.720> screen<00:00:18.990> on<00:00:19.199> this<00:00:19.320> one

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
here it's a bigger screen on this one

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.830 
here it's a bigger screen on this one
obviously<00:00:19.590> because<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.730> new<00:00:21.570> HP

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
obviously because this is the new HP

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.560 
obviously because this is the new HP
envy<00:00:22.680> 15<00:00:23.340> c<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.560> g0t<00:00:25.560> 95<00:00:26.310> AV<00:00:27.119> model

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
envy 15 c is the g0t 95 AV model

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.189 
envy 15 c is the g0t 95 AV model
basically<00:00:28.730> specs<00:00:29.730> are<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:29.970> same<00:00:30.179> i<00:00:30.449> just

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
basically specs are the same i just

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.770 
basically specs are the same i just
decided<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.800> get<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.279> one<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:33.210> i<00:00:33.239> can<00:00:33.450> take<00:00:33.630> it

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
decided to get this one so i can take it

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.580 
decided to get this one so i can take it
on<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.899> go<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.950> does<00:00:35.250> feel<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.790> little<00:00:36.230> it<00:00:37.230> feels

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
on the go it does feel a little it feels

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.540 
on the go it does feel a little it feels
more<00:00:37.800> fragile<00:00:38.129> than<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:39.180> one<00:00:39.390> right<00:00:39.540> here

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
more fragile than this one right here

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.110 
more fragile than this one right here
but<00:00:41.550> build<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.390> pretty<00:00:42.660> much<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.899> same<00:00:44.120> it's

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
but build is pretty much the same it's

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.940 
but build is pretty much the same it's
like<00:00:45.480> this<00:00:45.719> one<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:45.989> lighter<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.500> course<00:00:46.739> not

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
like this one is lighter of course not

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.490 
like this one is lighter of course not
only<00:00:47.160> because<00:00:47.460> it's<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.730> 15-inch<00:00:48.300> model<00:00:48.680> but<00:00:49.680> it

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
only because it's a 15-inch model but it

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.799 
only because it's a 15-inch model but it
let's<00:00:52.500> see<00:00:52.620> if<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.770> can<00:00:52.800> see<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.190> on<00:00:54.059> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
let's see if you can see this on the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.000 
let's see if you can see this on the
Newell<00:00:55.079> models<00:00:55.500> they<00:00:56.190> actually<00:00:57.530> changed<00:00:58.530> this

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
Newell models they actually changed this

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.270 
Newell models they actually changed this
a<00:01:00.079> piece<00:01:01.079> right<00:01:01.350> here<00:01:01.410> which<00:01:01.800> I'm<00:01:01.949> not<00:01:02.070> too

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
a piece right here which I'm not too

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.660 
a piece right here which I'm not too
happy<00:01:02.460> about<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.910> mean<00:01:03.149> they<00:01:03.270> added<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.780> rubber<00:01:04.229> I

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
happy about I mean they added a rubber I

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.149 
happy about I mean they added a rubber I
guess<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:06.450> prevent<00:01:06.810> scratches<00:01:07.560> or<00:01:07.770> whatever

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
guess to prevent scratches or whatever

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.370 
guess to prevent scratches or whatever
or<00:01:08.520> slamming<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.270> breaking<00:01:09.659> screen<00:01:10.170> or

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
or slamming it breaking screen or

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.130 
or slamming it breaking screen or
whatever<00:01:11.240> rather<00:01:12.240> than<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.720> one<00:01:12.930> right<00:01:13.080> here

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
whatever rather than this one right here

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.170 
whatever rather than this one right here
I<00:01:13.350> mean<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.369> part<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.939> fact

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
I mean I like this part that the fact

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.620 
I mean I like this part that the fact
that<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.930> feels<00:01:16.290> more<00:01:16.590> sturdy<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.670> rather

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
that it feels more sturdy on this rather

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.240 
that it feels more sturdy on this rather
than<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.110> know<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.439> one<00:01:19.590> has<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> gap<00:01:20.220> in

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
than you know this one has a gap in

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.580 
than you know this one has a gap in
between<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.720> just<00:01:21.930> feels<00:01:22.080> like<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.320> toy

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
between it and it just feels like a toy

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.050 
between it and it just feels like a toy
sometimes<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.280> feels<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:23.549> it's<00:01:23.790> just<00:01:23.909> going

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
sometimes it feels like it's just going

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.210 
sometimes it feels like it's just going
to<00:01:24.150> break<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.570> me<00:01:24.720> um<00:01:25.310> they<00:01:26.310> did<00:01:26.549> upgrade<00:01:26.790> the

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
to break on me um they did upgrade the

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:36.880 
to break on me um they did upgrade the
sea<00:01:31.009> okay<00:01:32.009> they<00:01:32.549> upgraded<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.650> the<00:01:35.240> pad

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
sea okay they upgraded the the pad

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.719 
sea okay they upgraded the the pad
basically<00:01:37.890> they<00:01:38.009> added<00:01:38.250> something<00:01:38.460> called

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
basically they added something called

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.789 
basically they added something called
control<00:01:39.180> zone<00:01:39.420> which<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.350> guess<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.530> new

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
control zone which is I guess the new

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.880 
control zone which is I guess the new
thing<00:01:41.130> but<00:01:42.090> uh<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.509> really<00:01:43.079> don't<00:01:43.259> see<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.560> reason

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
thing but uh I really don't see a reason

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.520 
thing but uh I really don't see a reason
why<00:01:44.100> using<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.820> rather<00:01:45.689> than<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:46.170> one<00:01:46.409> right

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
why using it rather than this one right

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.639 
why using it rather than this one right
here<00:01:46.619> um<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.759> bigger<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:49.259> one<00:01:49.439> feels

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
here um it is bigger this this one feels

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.620 
here um it is bigger this this one feels
about<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.159> probably<00:01:50.820> about<00:01:50.970> five<00:01:51.329> inches

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
about is probably about five inches

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.480 
about is probably about five inches
rather<00:01:51.990> than<00:01:52.290> just<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.680> standard<00:01:53.070> little<00:01:53.340> one

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
rather than just a standard little one

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.969 
rather than just a standard little one
um<00:01:54.710> but<00:01:55.710> yeah<00:01:55.860> basically<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.880> has<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.979> shove

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
um but yeah basically this has a shove

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.240 
um but yeah basically this has a shove
you<00:01:59.100> can<00:01:59.280> see<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.579> but<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.180> has<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.710> line<00:02:01.710> here<00:02:02.130> in

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
you can see it but it has a line here in

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.399 
you can see it but it has a line here in
the<00:02:02.340> line<00:02:02.520> hand<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:03.090> guess<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.869> can<00:02:04.020> control

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
the line hand I guess you can control

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.520 
the line hand I guess you can control
different<00:02:04.649> things<00:02:05.329> multimedia<00:02:06.329> things<00:02:06.659> they

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
different things multimedia things they

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.619 
different things multimedia things they
did<00:02:07.710> move<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.099> fingerprint<00:02:08.700> scanner<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
did move to a fingerprint scanner to the

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.229 
did move to a fingerprint scanner to the
left<00:02:09.869> side<00:02:10.080> rather<00:02:10.500> than<00:02:10.760> the<00:02:11.760> right<00:02:11.940> side

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
left side rather than the right side

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.930 
left side rather than the right side
which<00:02:12.450> I'm<00:02:12.629> not<00:02:12.780> too<00:02:12.900> crazy<00:02:13.050> about<00:02:13.319> for<00:02:13.800> the

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
which I'm not too crazy about for the

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
intel i7 15.6 this is a 17 obviously

5400rpm highbreed hard drive same thing

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.060 
5400rpm highbreed hard drive same thing
with<00:03:33.709> this<00:03:33.950> one<00:03:34.220> uh<00:03:34.459> i<00:03:35.320> believe<00:03:36.320> the<00:03:36.800> battery

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
with this one uh i believe the battery

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.270 
with this one uh i believe the battery
is<00:03:37.600> a<00:03:38.600> little<00:03:39.350> bigger<00:03:39.530> on<00:03:39.800> it<00:03:39.980> well<00:03:40.100> it's

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
is a little bigger on it well it's

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.060 
is a little bigger on it well it's
actually<00:03:40.520> smaller<00:03:41.239> the<00:03:41.510> batteries<00:03:41.900> buds<00:03:42.260> it's

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
actually smaller the batteries buds it's

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.229 
actually smaller the batteries buds it's
very<00:03:43.370> thin<00:03:44.560> compared<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:45.650> this<00:03:45.830> one<00:03:45.890> but<00:03:46.340> this

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
very thin compared to this one but this

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.660 
very thin compared to this one but this
one<00:03:47.300> last<00:03:47.720> is<00:03:47.930> longer<00:03:48.320> than<00:03:48.470> this<00:03:49.130> one<00:03:49.489> I

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
one last is longer than this one I

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.150 
one last is longer than this one I
believe<00:03:50.269> this<00:03:50.420> is<00:03:50.480> a<00:03:50.690> standard<00:03:51.170> about<00:03:51.620> four<00:03:52.130> or

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
believe this is a standard about four or

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.460 
believe this is a standard about four or
five<00:03:52.340> hours<00:03:52.730> this<00:03:53.360> one<00:03:53.540> gives<00:03:53.750> me<00:03:53.900> about<00:03:54.140> six

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
five hours this one gives me about six

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.940 
five hours this one gives me about six
to<00:03:54.650> eight<00:03:54.680> hours<00:03:55.040> um<00:03:56.500> one<00:03:57.500> thing<00:03:57.530> that<00:03:57.800> I<00:03:57.890> did

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
to eight hours um one thing that I did

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.810

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.860 
show you this right here okay so this is
the<00:04:03.739> power<00:04:03.920> brick<00:04:04.250> for<00:04:04.670> the<00:04:04.940> HP<00:04:05.620> 17<00:04:06.620> and<00:04:07.870> this

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
the power brick for the HP 17 and this

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.040 
the power brick for the HP 17 and this
one<00:04:09.170> is<00:04:09.500> for<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:10.430> 15-inch<00:04:11.060> i<00:04:11.269> like<00:04:11.720> that<00:04:11.870> they

one is for the 15-inch i like that they

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.650 
one is for the 15-inch i like that they
actually<00:04:12.200> made<00:04:12.650> it<00:04:12.800> smaller<00:04:12.980> because<00:04:13.600> now<00:04:14.600> we

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
actually made it smaller because now we

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.479 
actually made it smaller because now we
actually<00:04:15.019> feels<00:04:15.530> portable<00:04:16.040> rather<00:04:16.280> than

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
actually feels portable rather than

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.000 
actually feels portable rather than
