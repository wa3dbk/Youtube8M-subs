00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:21.379
 Let's start talking about how many young people we have in the Americas 

00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:26.350
 300 million young people and that area conservative data that 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.060
 international teams that he collected in 1999 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.280
 we are talking about a whole army of young people including 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.160
 North America the Caribbean Spain and of course Central and South America 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.400
 that's why we want to believe them irak we are being called to believe that this 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.720
 Youth army in Latin America 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.210
 can be mobilized to reach the nations 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.800
 and then when we talk about mister they will cover emotion because I get 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.320
 think 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.090
 if we invest in those 300 million young people in the Americas 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.690
 what can be discipleship voice 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.760
 and it may be that I sent the nations I was excited to think that we are another what 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.369
 let's end with the great Iraqi commission to all nations 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:07.520
 and reach them 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.090
 because we are going to help young people first I have to say and affirm the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.700
 young people have great potential and I would say that the second reason is because the 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.620
 It's hard to work with children because they are facing problems that neither 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.700
 even adults should face 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.700
 and the third reason I think what should force us 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.590
 it's because god in history are still young 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.100
 is using young people and will continue to use young people independently 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.330
 that we create 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.220
 p history tells us that the great orion and entÃ³s emerged to 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.880
 through youth 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.810
 what's happening with the young people I think you're half of the time like 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.920
 youth leaders and medel some indications 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.200
 d the four p of the four principles that we see here 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.900
 what teams bring young people the first one that starts with these young people 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.340
 they are confused 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.610
 the other letter that is the letter d are disappointed 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.460
 number 3 the other that explode 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.009
 is they are disoriented and maybe the hardest one with which I showed 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.930
 to contend is the number four young people are disconnected today what 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.499
 is taught in the church I could say 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:22.819
 it is not reinforced by family or friends or by music and by 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.099
 society neither by the school nor by the government 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.929
 as poter commissions or etc 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:30.469
 you should create clear commissions that yes 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.289
 but the implication is going to be 

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:36.949
 we are going to do more persecuted than before and we will be seen as intolerant 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.849
 our young people have that is being prepared to know from what 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.859
 serve to shine in this world or and that this form is being influenced 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.769
 his friends will see him as intolerant of his teachers and 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.639
 professors in university too 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:52.349
 but after all, do not touch the persecution of the church is a promise 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:57.519
 we are all going to be persecuted we were going to shine his famous we are well 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.430
 different poles of the world got lost
