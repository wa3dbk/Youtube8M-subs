freerunning for about seven years and
coaching<00:00:29.939> for<00:00:30.119> about<00:00:30.389> five<00:00:31.050> or<00:00:31.349> six<00:00:31.499> of<00:00:31.679> those

coaching for about five or six of those
years<00:00:32.030> but<00:00:33.500> really<00:00:34.500> it's<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:35.190> just<00:00:35.429> an

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
years but really it's it's just an

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.119 
years but really it's it's just an
excuse<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.059> play<00:00:36.350> so<00:00:37.350> parkour<00:00:38.039> and

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
excuse to play so parkour and

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.189 
excuse to play so parkour and
freerunning<00:00:38.449> as<00:00:39.449> far<00:00:39.690> as<00:00:39.809> I'm<00:00:39.899> concerned

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
freerunning as far as I'm concerned

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:41.990 
freerunning as far as I'm concerned
they're<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.440> same<00:00:40.620> thing<00:00:40.859> it's<00:00:41.429> just<00:00:41.550> two

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
they're the same thing it's just two

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.630 
they're the same thing it's just two
different<00:00:42.120> words<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.570> describe<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:43.019> movement

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
different words to describe a movement

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.700 
different words to describe a movement
but<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:45.089> terms<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.839> kind<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.170> like<00:00:46.320> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
but in terms of kind of like the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.180 
but in terms of kind of like the
classical<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.960> guess<00:00:49.190> differentiation

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
classical I guess differentiation

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.790 
classical I guess differentiation
between<00:00:50.249> the<00:00:50.460> two<00:00:50.670> parkour<00:00:51.179> is<00:00:51.300> more<00:00:51.539> about

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
between the two parkour is more about

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.259 
between the two parkour is more about
efficient<00:00:52.800> useful<00:00:53.219> movement<00:00:53.640> whereas

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
efficient useful movement whereas

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.450 
efficient useful movement whereas
freerunning<00:00:54.929> it's<00:00:55.140> more<00:00:55.469> about<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.859> creative

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
freerunning it's more about the creative

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.910 
freerunning it's more about the creative
side<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.999> that's<00:00:57.420> when<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.629> get<00:00:57.719> into<00:00:57.920> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
side and that's when you get into the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.970 
side and that's when you get into the
tricks<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.339> the<00:00:59.460> things<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.879> are<00:01:00.980> less

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
tricks and the things that are less

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.329 
tricks and the things that are less
about<00:01:02.309> being<00:01:02.489> efficient<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.300> more<00:01:03.629> about

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
about being efficient and more about

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.920 
about being efficient and more about
kind<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.399> an<00:01:05.519> artistic<00:01:05.939> outlet<00:01:06.030> there's<00:01:06.659> kind

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
kind of an artistic outlet there's kind

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.460 
kind of an artistic outlet there's kind
of<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.200> philosophical<00:01:07.799> side<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.880> things

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
of the philosophical side of things

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.039 
of the philosophical side of things
where<00:01:10.520> physical<00:01:11.520> becomes<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.329> metaphor<00:01:12.479> for

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
where physical becomes a metaphor for

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.160 
where physical becomes a metaphor for
the

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
the

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.149 
the
mental<00:01:14.759> and<00:01:15.759> that's<00:01:16.090> basically<00:01:16.930> I<00:01:17.200> mean<00:01:18.009> we

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
mental and that's basically I mean we

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.350 
mental and that's basically I mean we
have<00:01:18.310> all<00:01:18.400> these<00:01:18.520> obstacles<00:01:18.820> that<00:01:19.180> we're

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
have all these obstacles that we're

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.990 
have all these obstacles that we're
trying<00:01:19.540> to<00:01:19.659> overcome<00:01:20.700> smoothly<00:01:21.700> and

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
trying to overcome smoothly and

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.480 
trying to overcome smoothly and
efficiently<00:01:22.180> and<00:01:22.750> it's<00:01:23.409> all<00:01:23.530> about<00:01:23.770> adapting

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
efficiently and it's all about adapting

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.330 
efficiently and it's all about adapting
and<00:01:25.470> kind<00:01:26.470> of<00:01:26.500> knowing<00:01:26.680> your<00:01:26.860> environment<00:01:26.920> but

seeing<00:01:39.780> how<00:01:40.780> easy<00:01:40.990> it<00:01:41.259> is<00:01:41.320> to<00:01:42.039> pick<00:01:42.490> up<00:01:42.549> things

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
seeing how easy it is to pick up things

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:44.910 
seeing how easy it is to pick up things
not<00:01:43.119> necessarily<00:01:43.240> how<00:01:43.720> easy<00:01:43.960> it<00:01:44.170> is<00:01:44.259> but<00:01:44.680> the

fact that it's possible kind of makes

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.309 
fact that it's possible kind of makes
you<00:01:47.619> question<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.220> world<00:01:48.399> not<00:01:48.789> in<00:01:49.259> but<00:01:50.259> I

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
you question the world not in but I

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:51.870 
you question the world not in but I
don't<00:01:50.500> want<00:01:50.619> to<00:01:50.679> say<00:01:50.770> that<00:01:50.920> in<00:01:51.069> negative<00:01:51.729> ways

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
don't want to say that in negative ways

curious a kind of inquisitive way you
know<00:01:57.250> it's<00:01:57.369> like<00:01:57.490> if<00:01:57.610> I<00:01:57.670> could<00:01:57.819> do<00:01:57.880> this<00:01:58.060> then

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
know it's like if I could do this then

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.080 
know it's like if I could do this then
why<00:01:58.959> can't<00:01:59.200> I<00:01:59.259> do<00:01:59.319> this<00:01:59.619> and<00:01:59.890> it's<00:02:00.819> really

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
why can't I do this and it's really

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.889 
why can't I do this and it's really
empowering<00:02:01.709> to<00:02:03.420> kind<00:02:04.420> of<00:02:04.450> look<00:02:04.539> at<00:02:04.659> the<00:02:04.720> world

empowering to kind of look at the world
and<00:02:05.049> say<00:02:05.229> why<00:02:05.679> not<00:02:05.709> it's<00:02:06.490> it's<00:02:07.420> it's<00:02:07.780> funny

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.049 
and say why not it's it's it's funny

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.070 
and say why not it's it's it's funny
because<00:02:08.229> our<00:02:08.619> our<00:02:08.950> world<00:02:09.549> is<00:02:09.729> built<00:02:10.690> in<00:02:10.899> very

things that we're supposed to follow but

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.000 
things that we're supposed to follow but
the<00:02:22.750> first<00:02:22.989> challenge<00:02:23.320> you<00:02:23.470> find<00:02:23.680> out<00:02:23.859> with

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
the first challenge you find out with

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.000 
the first challenge you find out with
parkour<00:02:24.370> is<00:02:24.670> one<00:02:25.480> how<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.750> master<00:02:26.170> body<00:02:26.380> but

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
parkour is one how to master body but

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.490 
parkour is one how to master body but
two<00:02:27.280> it's<00:02:27.549> how<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.060> use<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:28.780> to<00:02:29.109> kind<00:02:29.470> of

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
two it's how to use that to kind of

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.580 
two it's how to use that to kind of
redefine<00:02:30.010> your<00:02:30.400> fear

landscape<00:02:32.060> getting<00:02:33.060> started<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.599> first

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
landscape getting started the first

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.850 
landscape getting started the first
thing<00:02:33.959> I<00:02:34.050> always<00:02:34.080> say<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:35.629> one<00:02:36.680> everything<00:02:37.680> is

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
thing I always say is one everything is

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.880 
thing I always say is one everything is
relative<00:02:38.190> so<00:02:38.550> I<00:02:39.269> think<00:02:39.629> the<00:02:39.870> common<00:02:40.110> work<00:02:40.230> um

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
relative so I think the common work um

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.670 
relative so I think the common work um
in<00:02:41.090> common<00:02:42.090> response<00:02:42.480> when<00:02:42.750> I<00:02:42.780> say<00:02:43.050> you<00:02:43.650> should

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
in common response when I say you should

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.089 
in common response when I say you should
try<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.040> is<00:02:44.400> oh<00:02:44.760> I<00:02:44.849> can't<00:02:45.269> do<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.830> well<00:02:46.830> I

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
try this is oh I can't do that well I

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.410 
try this is oh I can't do that well I
mean<00:02:47.430> obviously<00:02:47.580> you're<00:02:47.940> not<00:02:48.090> going<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.299> go

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
mean obviously you're not going to go

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.150 
mean obviously you're not going to go
out<00:02:48.599> there<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:49.019> start<00:02:49.290> doing<00:02:49.590> double

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
out there and start doing double

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.009 
out there and start doing double
backflips<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:51.000> all<00:02:51.090> these<00:02:51.209> crazy<00:02:51.450> tricks

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
backflips and all these crazy tricks

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.990 
backflips and all these crazy tricks
because<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:53.099> people<00:02:53.250> who<00:02:53.459> are<00:02:53.580> doing<00:02:53.760> that

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
because the people who are doing that

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.030 
because the people who are doing that
have<00:02:54.209> been<00:02:54.360> practicing<00:02:55.140> for<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.349> long<00:02:55.530> time<00:02:55.769> it

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
have been practicing for a long time it

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.280 
have been practicing for a long time it
they<00:02:56.519> took<00:02:56.790> time<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.239> progress<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:57.870> point

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
they took time to progress to that point

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.699 
they took time to progress to that point
but<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:59.239> think<00:03:00.239> that<00:03:00.480> literally<00:03:00.810> anybody<00:03:01.319> can

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
but I think that literally anybody can

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.569 
but I think that literally anybody can
do<00:03:01.890> it<00:03:01.920> it's<00:03:02.519> just<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.730> matter<00:03:02.910> of<00:03:03.060> keeping

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
do it it's just a matter of keeping

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.770 
do it it's just a matter of keeping
everything<00:03:05.579> in<00:03:05.790> perspective<00:03:06.030> it's<00:03:06.450> like<00:03:06.510> what

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
everything in perspective it's like what

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.650 
everything in perspective it's like what
do<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.079> want<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.380> achieve<00:03:08.180> if<00:03:09.180> all<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.480> want

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
do you want to achieve if all you want

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.630 
do you want to achieve if all you want
to<00:03:09.750> achieve<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:10.260> learning<00:03:10.500> four<00:03:11.400> or<00:03:11.519> five

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
to achieve is learning four or five

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.330 
to achieve is learning four or five
basic<00:03:12.000> bolts<00:03:12.329> you<00:03:12.810> can<00:03:13.049> and<00:03:13.349> it's<00:03:14.099> just<00:03:14.280> a

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
basic bolts you can and it's just a

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.949 
basic bolts you can and it's just a
matter<00:03:14.519> of<00:03:14.610> time<00:03:14.880> then<00:03:15.239> from<00:03:15.450> there<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:15.780> hit

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
matter of time then from there you hit

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.160 
matter of time then from there you hit
that<00:03:16.140> goal<00:03:16.319> and<00:03:16.410> you<00:03:16.500> can<00:03:16.650> move<00:03:16.769> on<00:03:17.870> our<00:03:18.870> course

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
that goal and you can move on our course

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.740 
that goal and you can move on our course
is<00:03:19.530> as<00:03:19.980> much<00:03:20.549> about<00:03:20.819> learning<00:03:21.180> how<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.480> fall

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
is as much about learning how to fall

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.130 
is as much about learning how to fall
correctly<00:03:21.959> as<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.680> is<00:03:22.799> about<00:03:24.140> amazing

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
correctly as it is about amazing

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.440 
correctly as it is about amazing
athletic<00:03:25.590> pains

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
athletic pains

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
athletic pains
because<00:03:27.450> if<00:03:27.599> you<00:03:27.690> hurt<00:03:27.810> yourself<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:28.260> can't

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
because if you hurt yourself you can't

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.400 
because if you hurt yourself you can't
keep<00:03:28.590> playing<00:03:28.910> and<00:03:29.910> that's<00:03:30.870> why<00:03:31.019> we<00:03:31.140> all<00:03:31.260> do

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
keep playing and that's why we all do

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.900 
keep playing and that's why we all do
this<00:03:31.560> because<00:03:31.799> it's<00:03:32.099> fun<00:03:32.280> when<00:03:32.760> you're

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
this because it's fun when you're

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.119 
this because it's fun when you're
starting<00:03:33.120> out<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.540> easiest<00:03:34.260> way<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.590> do<00:03:34.980> it

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
starting out the easiest way to do it

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.670 
starting out the easiest way to do it
just<00:03:35.459> like<00:03:35.519> anything<00:03:36.090> else<00:03:36.269> is<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.989> train<00:03:37.530> with

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
just like anything else is to train with

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.500 
just like anything else is to train with
somebody<00:03:37.950> else<00:03:38.130> not<00:03:38.880> only<00:03:38.910> will<00:03:39.209> they<00:03:39.299> teach

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
somebody else not only will they teach

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.229 
somebody else not only will they teach
you<00:03:39.720> faster<00:03:40.170> but<00:03:40.769> you'll<00:03:40.920> also<00:03:41.160> get<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:41.970> play

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
you faster but you'll also get to play

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.020 
you faster but you'll also get to play
around<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.900> try<00:03:43.310> new<00:03:44.310> things<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:44.880> you

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
around and try new things that you

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.210 
around and try new things that you
otherwise<00:03:45.720> might<00:03:45.870> not<00:03:46.350> have<00:03:46.620> thought<00:03:47.160> about

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
otherwise might not have thought about

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:54.160 
otherwise might not have thought about
all<00:03:47.940> you<00:03:48.180> really<00:03:48.359> need<00:03:48.660> is<00:03:50.540> a<00:03:51.540> wall<00:03:52.470> or<00:03:53.010> rail

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
all you really need is a wall or rail

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.309 
all you really need is a wall or rail
something<00:03:55.170> about<00:03:56.130> waist<00:03:56.430> height<00:03:57.079> width<00:03:58.079> that

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
something about waist height width that

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.539 
something about waist height width that
you<00:03:58.560> can<00:03:58.709> pretty<00:03:58.859> much<00:03:58.950> take<00:03:59.220> in<00:03:59.370> any

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
you can pretty much take in any

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.089 
you can pretty much take in any
direction<00:03:59.730> that<00:04:00.000> you<00:04:00.150> want<00:04:00.329> you<00:04:00.569> can<00:04:00.720> do

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
direction that you want you can do

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:03.259 
direction that you want you can do
pretty<00:04:02.099> much<00:04:02.220> every<00:04:02.549> single<00:04:02.700> vault<00:04:03.000> there<00:04:03.150> is

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
pretty much every single vault there is

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.110 
pretty much every single vault there is
and<00:04:04.230> then<00:04:04.349> you<00:04:04.410> can<00:04:04.440> you<00:04:04.950> can<00:04:05.130> even<00:04:05.250> even<00:04:06.030> if

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
and then you can you can even even if

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.640 
and then you can you can even even if
you<00:04:06.180> progress<00:04:06.359> past<00:04:06.720> that<00:04:07.049> you<00:04:07.230> can<00:04:07.380> start

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
you progress past that you can start

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:08.990 
you progress past that you can start
experimenting<00:04:08.099> with<00:04:08.280> other<00:04:08.609> kind<00:04:08.970> of

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
experimenting with other kind of

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.940 
experimenting with other kind of
alternative<00:04:09.510> movements<00:04:09.930> but<00:04:10.709> I<00:04:10.889> think<00:04:12.950> the

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
alternative movements but I think the

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.279 
alternative movements but I think the
most<00:04:14.099> basic<00:04:14.459> version<00:04:14.609> of<00:04:14.790> parkour<00:04:15.180> is<00:04:15.329> a<00:04:15.569> 2b

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
most basic version of parkour is a 2b

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:20.000
