 If you remove the wheel by hand when you make such a Mercy too , it distorts the color 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.450
 There is a risk that the shaft may be bent or bent . Minimize this 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.440
 Hot pot 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:48.370

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.900
 It will be assembled properly even if it looks like a university 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.999

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:53.630
 Of course I can not enter if I come 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:56.659
 It is not put in from the one who has stopped 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.530
 The person who is first loosened 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:03.210

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.240
