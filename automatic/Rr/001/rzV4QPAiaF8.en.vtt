00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.810

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.150
 pooja hook and the contest will be difficult then 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.160

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:47.640
 until I fully thought it over so 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.980
 if there are many likes and members of that 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.219

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:59.489
 stealing how it will be held 1 will 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:01.800
 of the three there will be a round then that first all 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.170
 participants are going to share randomly on 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.799

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.780
 they are playing 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:12.090
 incentive how can they play in team 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.580
 so more than half will be eliminated and about 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.189
