00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 here we are in Argentine chefs 

00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:07.680
 Sunday version with romina de córdoba 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.990
 of belgrano de córdoba and apart with a 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.420
 special guest marcelo gillard and that 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.030
 Mr. is a master pizza maker 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.430
 30 years but a little while ago 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.470
 relatively is a specialist in the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.470
 rancor pizza marchelo 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.570
 how did you come up with this and it is 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.060
 it's like industrializing or having 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.099
 machinery to make it the genito tract 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.829
 that you do it by hand no no no this is 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.960
 something I went looking for there are already many 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.450
 parts of the world inclusive there are already up 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.090
 electrical machines to be able to do it 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.460
 where already knowing him prepared from a 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.170
 way with machines but manual 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.079
 artisan 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.659
 and how good is what is important 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.519
 first base is pizza dough 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.519
 common to all elements 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.079
 that we use for everything now of these 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.920
 oils to do is important so that 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.920
 crispy 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.189
 once we do not have we do as a 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.409
 we place them in these shades 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.009
 metals previously have been a 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.470
 little or with butter or with oil so that 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.869
 we take off them a nice 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.610
 aluminum aluminum or steel word 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.039
 the bitter one you have a little bit more 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.520
 stretched is so that it reaches the 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:33.560
 background we previously introduced it as 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.890
 we said lubricated yes and then 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.150
 we put 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:43.030
 the other with tone and against things and one is 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.530
 the matrix of the sacks we painted it by 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.220
 outside s 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.020
 and now if we are going to go looking for that 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.680
 stay in the middle for all 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.230
 couples of the couple 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.500
 once you already 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.770
 we have the mass in conditions with the 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.859
 special press 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.310
 and look there appears looks like your day 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:10.289
 came out then when the neck comes out 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.620
 an alternative is some it comes out is 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.890
 like the flat pizza some want it 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.250
 with others and we can not cut it 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.280
 recovers nothing is thrown away it recovers and 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.230
 we make another pressing of the Lord 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.060
 date party could not miss the 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.370
 pizza cone we look back 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.980
 again the edge this is going to put 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.340
 up the oven look and we're going to put 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.280
 owing just as it was another pizza ones 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.250
 minutes to take more consistency 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.650
 in amazon this will end and you put it 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.630
 in a more or less temperate area like 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.880
 so that it elevates so that it grows and there 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.079
 the view is one newly armed and the 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.299
 another that a few minutes ago that is 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.160
 helping and then as you pretend 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.620
 get out of the cone 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.459
 then once we have this what 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.569
 let's take we're going to the oven habano 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.490
 we go 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:06.060
 value we do not see the oven 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.060
 baked 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.440
 Lets put 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.740
 the way I open the oven teacher 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.460
 blame the one that I took care of in the oven 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.800
 is that my old man can 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.410
 and put it as in a mold cited and the 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:29.950
 The matter is to leave it alone and that 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.950
 cook inside is fine 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.590
 then what will happen now is that 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.950
 in a few minutes we will take out the 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.020
 color that was above the color that 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.450
 was up we took it out and put it 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.880
 a few more minutes until we have the 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:52.620
 cone with this consistency and as well as 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:04:03.590
 we know the premise we have a 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:03.590
 caution let me be 160 grams 60 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:12.510
 the mold cited the first to come with 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.600
 Butter oil is here he sent 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.600
 save 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.910
 in the matrix and this one out 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.890
 one inside the other and I'm learning it 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.490
 then I'm at the little machine that looks 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.889
 to close the capita crowns with the 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.889
 little man 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.889
 crown 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:58.990
 of debt when as debt there I go 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.350
 then from an exact hit on the 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.770
 filling once we have one that 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.180
 we have the preco not finished we are going to 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.770
 put the filling that always putting 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.070
 a base for example we have ham 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.070
 Cooked 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.530
 we put you infallible mozzarella we can 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.450
 use in the middle always pressure to 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.250
 always press a little carefully 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.100
 because solidified now we can put 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.600
 another variety more 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.350
 a splash of sauce can also be 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.350
 put in the middle 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:44.120
 with many things with for example with a 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.160
 mousse can be filled with different 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.009
 type of creams that can even be put 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:53.530
 some like the meringue in the oven and 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:53.530
 they are totally 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:07.880
 we can not put it with a regio not what 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:09.440
 we can use in this a few minutes 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.389
 then as now what are they 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.820
 making trader and would have to be 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:17.570
 coming out the angles of those from the oven 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:21.199
 Please look to see and place are 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.970
 Adelita that is already here and now we can 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:23.510
 place this output that we have them 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.340
 estate 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.800
 stuffed a ballet 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:31.020
 Roberto has been thrown in 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.220

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:40.329
 and since I have a pencil in chorus to 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:42.159
 enjoy the angles but of course 

00:06:40.329 --> 00:06:43.839
 that will continue to come because it is in 

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:45.789
 the pizza party we have to 

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:48.789
