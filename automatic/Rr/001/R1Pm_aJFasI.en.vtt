squeezed down something that's tight and
that's<00:00:17.670> almost<00:00:18.240> parallel<00:00:18.810> it'll<00:00:19.199> make<00:00:19.650> it

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
that's almost parallel it'll make it

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.509 
that's almost parallel it'll make it

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
line back out there like that not too

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:54.280 
line back out there like that not too
many<00:01:47.179> things<00:01:47.509> you<00:01:47.750> can<00:01:47.840> do<00:01:47.960> that<00:01:48.200> with

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.680 

but<00:01:55.290> that's<00:01:55.500> how<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.950> fits<00:01:56.190> well<00:01:56.490> trees<00:01:56.880> we

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
but that's how it fits well trees we

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.450 
but that's how it fits well trees we
don't<00:01:57.930> try<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.200> skip<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.710> underneath<00:01:59.040> there

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
don't try to skip it underneath there

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.460 
don't try to skip it underneath there
just<00:01:59.820> throw<00:02:00.300> it<00:02:00.450> over<00:02:00.720> in<00:02:00.870> the<00:02:00.960> middle<00:02:01.260> out<00:02:01.380> her

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
just throw it over in the middle out her

00:02:01.470 --> 00:04:10.780 
just throw it over in the middle out her
and<00:02:01.530> let<00:02:01.740> her<00:02:01.830> down

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.890 

take<00:04:11.790> a<00:04:12.000> while<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:12.720> adjust<00:04:13.440> it<00:04:13.739> so<00:04:14.870> we<00:04:15.870> just

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
take a while to adjust it so we just

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.080 
take a while to adjust it so we just
kind<00:04:16.139> of<00:04:16.410> ran<00:04:16.560> into<00:04:17.010> it<00:04:17.100> may<00:04:17.280> not<00:04:17.459> be<00:04:17.669> here<00:04:17.910> long

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
kind of ran into it may not be here long

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:48.320 
kind of ran into it may not be here long
enough<00:04:18.120> to<00:04:44.690> guess<00:04:45.690> where<00:04:45.960> he's<00:04:46.080> hooked
