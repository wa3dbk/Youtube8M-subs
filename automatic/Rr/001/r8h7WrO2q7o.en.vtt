there's<00:00:21.529> no<00:00:21.740> doubt<00:00:21.980> that<00:00:22.190> when<00:00:22.310> we<00:00:22.430> go<00:00:22.580> fool

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
there's no doubt that when we go fool

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.390 
there's no doubt that when we go fool
driving<00:00:23.450> these<00:00:23.600> days<00:00:23.900> we<00:00:24.439> love<00:00:24.710> to<00:00:24.890> take<00:00:25.130> a

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
driving these days we love to take a

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.339 
driving these days we love to take a
whole<00:00:25.760> lot<00:00:26.000> of<00:00:26.029> different<00:00:26.510> gadgets<00:00:26.990> gadgets

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
whole lot of different gadgets gadgets

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.589 
whole lot of different gadgets gadgets
that<00:00:27.770> make<00:00:28.220> it<00:00:28.369> more<00:00:28.490> comfortable<00:00:29.150> like

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
that make it more comfortable like

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.690 
that make it more comfortable like
fridges<00:00:29.960> and<00:00:30.320> other<00:00:30.890> things<00:00:31.220> that<00:00:31.310> help<00:00:31.490> you

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
fridges and other things that help you

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.670 
fridges and other things that help you
record<00:00:32.029> those<00:00:32.360> special<00:00:32.900> memories<00:00:33.050> like<00:00:33.500> your

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
record those special memories like your

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.130 
record those special memories like your
digital<00:00:34.070> cameras<00:00:34.520> but<00:00:35.239> a<00:00:35.420> lot<00:00:35.870> of<00:00:35.900> those

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
digital cameras but a lot of those

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.950 
digital cameras but a lot of those
devices<00:00:36.559> will<00:00:37.010> most<00:00:37.280> of<00:00:37.519> them<00:00:37.699> suck<00:00:38.420> battery

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
devices will most of them suck battery

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.290 
devices will most of them suck battery
power<00:00:39.260> and<00:00:39.530> that<00:00:39.949> does<00:00:40.010> create<00:00:40.580> a<00:00:40.970> few

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
power and that does create a few

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.360 
power and that does create a few
problems<00:00:41.570> if<00:00:41.989> you're<00:00:42.320> relying<00:00:42.710> on<00:00:42.920> one

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
problems if you're relying on one

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.150 
problems if you're relying on one
starter<00:00:44.090> battery<00:00:44.269> so<00:00:44.870> how<00:00:45.199> do<00:00:45.260> we<00:00:45.410> solve<00:00:45.830> those

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
starter battery so how do we solve those

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.700 
starter battery so how do we solve those
power<00:00:46.519> problems<00:00:47.059> well<00:00:47.690> it's<00:00:47.989> not<00:00:48.290> just<00:00:48.559> as

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
power problems well it's not just as

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.950 
power problems well it's not just as
simple<00:00:49.070> as<00:00:49.250> fitting<00:00:50.030> a<00:00:50.150> second<00:00:50.750> battery

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
simple as fitting a second battery

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.079 
simple as fitting a second battery
although<00:00:51.559> that<00:00:51.890> does<00:00:52.129> solve<00:00:52.489> part<00:00:52.940> of<00:00:53.030> the

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
although that does solve part of the

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:54.939 
although that does solve part of the
problem<00:00:53.150> because<00:00:53.540> you're<00:00:54.140> increasing<00:00:54.620> the

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
problem because you're increasing the

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.969 
problem because you're increasing the
capacity<00:00:55.150> but<00:00:56.150> if<00:00:56.420> you<00:00:56.750> simply<00:00:57.140> install<00:00:57.559> that

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:57.979 
capacity but if you simply install that

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:00.219 
capacity but if you simply install that
second<00:00:58.430> battery<00:00:58.820> or<00:00:58.940> that<00:00:59.089> auxilary<00:00:59.629> battery

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
second battery or that auxilary battery

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:02.530 
second battery or that auxilary battery
without<00:01:00.710> any<00:01:01.100> management<00:01:01.489> system<00:01:01.970> behind<00:01:02.360> it

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
without any management system behind it

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.869 
without any management system behind it
you<00:01:02.900> could<00:01:03.199> still<00:01:03.379> be<00:01:03.680> in<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:04.070> same<00:01:04.339> trouble

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
you could still be in the same trouble

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.640 
you could still be in the same trouble
as<00:01:05.000> you<00:01:05.390> were<00:01:05.540> beforehand<00:01:06.200> because<00:01:06.290> what<00:01:06.560> will

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
as you were beforehand because what will

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.830 
as you were beforehand because what will
happen<00:01:07.040> is<00:01:07.220> when<00:01:08.000> you<00:01:08.119> plug<00:01:08.390> in<00:01:08.420> all<00:01:08.630> your

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
happen is when you plug in all your

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.170 
happen is when you plug in all your
electrical<00:01:09.350> devices<00:01:09.680> they'll<00:01:10.400> drain<00:01:10.850> down

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
electrical devices they'll drain down

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.120 
electrical devices they'll drain down
both<00:01:11.659> batteries<00:01:12.229> so<00:01:12.409> your<00:01:12.560> starter<00:01:12.979> battery

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
both batteries so your starter battery

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.609 
both batteries so your starter battery
and<00:01:13.520> your<00:01:14.150> auxiliary<00:01:14.270> battery<00:01:14.840> and<00:01:15.229> you'll

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
and your auxiliary battery and you'll

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.320 
and your auxiliary battery and you'll
won't<00:01:15.950> have<00:01:16.220> enough<00:01:16.430> power<00:01:16.670> to<00:01:16.790> start<00:01:17.119> your

vehicle in the morning so you want a

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.300 
vehicle in the morning so you want a
system<00:01:20.600> that's<00:01:21.110> going<00:01:21.320> to<00:01:21.409> isolate<00:01:22.130> that

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
system that's going to isolate that

charge your auxiliary battery while you

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.870 
charge your auxiliary battery while you
drive<00:01:32.149> but<00:01:32.539> it<00:01:32.990> also<00:01:33.229> protects<00:01:34.219> against<00:01:34.789> a

flat start battery this system is also

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:40.569 
flat start battery this system is also
really<00:01:38.479> quite<00:01:38.960> easy<00:01:39.320> to<00:01:39.499> install<00:01:39.950> although

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
really quite easy to install although

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.880 
really quite easy to install although
you<00:01:40.640> really<00:01:40.850> do<00:01:41.420> want<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.689> make<00:01:41.840> sure<00:01:41.899> that<00:01:42.770> in

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
you really do want to make sure that in

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.590 
you really do want to make sure that in
that<00:01:43.009> installation<00:01:43.399> you've<00:01:43.939> got<00:01:44.149> a<00:01:44.179> really

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
that installation you've got a really

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.130 
that installation you've got a really
solid<00:01:45.310> battery<00:01:46.310> cradle<00:01:46.939> so<00:01:47.179> that's<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:47.899> part

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
solid battery cradle so that's the part

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.139 
solid battery cradle so that's the part
that<00:01:48.289> actually<00:01:48.320> holds<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.130> battery<00:01:49.399> in<00:01:49.789> and

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
that actually holds the battery in and

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.349 
that actually holds the battery in and
in<00:01:50.600> place<00:01:51.109> and<00:01:51.469> personally<00:01:52.369> I<00:01:52.549> always<00:01:52.609> love

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
in place and personally I always love

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:55.630 
in place and personally I always love
having<00:01:53.749> a<00:01:53.929> top-quality<00:01:54.590> second<00:01:55.310> battery

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
having a top-quality second battery

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.059 
having a top-quality second battery
because<00:01:55.999> we<00:01:56.630> give<00:01:56.869> it<00:01:56.960> a<00:01:57.020> pounding<00:01:57.590> off-road

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
because we give it a pounding off-road

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.609 
because we give it a pounding off-road
we've<00:01:58.789> used<00:01:59.060> these<00:01:59.270> Optima<00:01:59.780> yellow<00:02:00.049> tops<00:02:00.380> for

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
we've used these Optima yellow tops for

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.739 
we've used these Optima yellow tops for
years<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.159> I<00:02:01.340> tell<00:02:01.609> you<00:02:01.729> what<00:02:01.939> they've<00:02:02.450> got<00:02:02.719> a

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:02.749 
years and I tell you what they've got a

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:05.260 
years and I tell you what they've got a
lot<00:02:03.200> of<00:02:03.439> bang<00:02:03.799> for<00:02:03.829> their<00:02:04.189> buck<00:02:04.520> they<00:02:04.880> charge

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
lot of bang for their buck they charge

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.149 
lot of bang for their buck they charge
up<00:02:05.539> quicker<00:02:05.899> than<00:02:06.139> your<00:02:06.259> normal<00:02:06.380> battery<00:02:06.770> and

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
up quicker than your normal battery and

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.639 
up quicker than your normal battery and
they're<00:02:07.579> also<00:02:07.729> much<00:02:08.240> more<00:02:08.509> resistant<00:02:09.140> to

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
they're also much more resistant to

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.280 
they're also much more resistant to
vibration<00:02:09.890> so<00:02:10.789> they<00:02:11.270> can<00:02:11.480> take<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:11.960> rough<00:02:12.170> and

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
vibration so they can take the rough and

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.559 
vibration so they can take the rough and
tumble<00:02:12.560> of<00:02:12.770> off-roading<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.550> keep<00:02:14.330> on

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
tumble of off-roading and keep on

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:15.010 
tumble of off-roading and keep on
running

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
running

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.680

now<00:02:15.650> batteries<00:02:16.100> can<00:02:16.430> actually<00:02:16.850> get<00:02:17.090> seriously

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
now batteries can actually get seriously

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.170 
now batteries can actually get seriously
damaged<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.290> not<00:02:18.650> work<00:02:18.950> in<00:02:19.370> some<00:02:19.790> off-road

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180

actually shake come look

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.679 
actually shake come look
and<00:02:31.499> short<00:02:31.980> out<00:02:32.189> and<00:02:32.430> then<00:02:32.700> your<00:02:33.150> battery<00:02:33.540> will

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
and short out and then your battery will

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.050 
and short out and then your battery will
be<00:02:33.719> kaput<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.439> won't<00:02:34.709> work<00:02:35.010> in<00:02:35.639> that<00:02:35.819> situation

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
be kaput it won't work in that situation

because<00:02:38.969> you<00:02:39.389> would<00:02:39.510> think<00:02:39.540> well<00:02:39.900> it's<00:02:40.079> been

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
because you would think well it's been

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.890 
because you would think well it's been
preferring<00:02:41.579> to<00:02:41.730> take<00:02:41.939> the<00:02:42.090> power<00:02:42.329> off<00:02:42.599> the
