00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:10.099
 next fight 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:16.770
 exhibit closure 3001 h 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:19.890
 if I'm not mistaken by them 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.900
 in front of canter this tank is mine 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.220
 see again let it feed not worth 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.170
 the top 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.330
 not because I'm not right for us 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.750
 naturally open everything is there but because 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.480
 I like this gun more like it again 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.450
 the positions I show you 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.940
 sometimes java show positions at all 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.200
 their tanks there windows rotating 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.739
 I occupied the tower 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.690
 it is this position I always don't know 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.309
 why here on this position 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.469
 little make up usually the end of march there 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.270
 still happens that Lenin but some tanks 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.140
 here come su-152 with you card 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.979
 becomes 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.290
 for example from new rarely here and so here 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.600
 why then this subspecies police nobody up 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.220
 disconnect see for yourself what kind of review 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.380
 gis common sides to be an idea but again 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.259
 with enlightened optics there with stereo 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.580
 pipes with all these things over there 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.210
 you can look very well 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:29.810
 shoot because those who go to 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:32.579
 close combat they also mean there 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.759
 go back and forth well maybe so there 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.579
 more like it may well not like 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.130
 a portrait from afar the first time I sweat 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.070
 Naturally, too, am going to close combat with a 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.930
 after some time new beginnings can 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:51.250
 from here they let me do it 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:54.880
 how to type 7 points that try 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.220
 it is given experience is chosen 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.860
 due to these hits but few of them 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.090
 sees from here almost no well 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.840
 illuminate sometimes 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.880
 but someone lingers there well now me 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.179
 year will be this among 10 someone but I 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.850
 hide behind a pebble as usual 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:16.390
 here I shoot she you get someone 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.370
 but is there a little or there is a hit of 35 hair 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.590
 on whom the pedicure did not stop 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.239
 I immediately showed up amazingly 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.489
 How far is valid as they too 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.489
 Apparently it ’s about the same 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.800
 equipment like mine that is 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.450
 there it highlights here 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:43.550
 what distance can i highlight then 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:47.000
 there is still this position here in my 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.480
 a look but just about perfect to 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.959
 for some reason don’t stand there 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:57.020
 melee well here and this time we 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:00.250
 I think you should have wanted an hour with us 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:04.240
 it seems to be less alive 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.240
 enemy advantage 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:17.030
 let's see what happens 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:19.370
 further and here and go there how much floor they have 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.580
 Now we will shoot at someone 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:32.600
 maybe most likely a bed anyway 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:36.200
 anyone when in melee they 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.870
 do not live as a whole picture sees here 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.380
 these here he left i his george it 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.380
 puts it on 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.140
 I hit it and egged here please wiki 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.280
 such a distance to get and of course 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.770
 harder than there folding consist 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.290
 shoot at look see what 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.680
 advantage they are protecting me not even 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.950
 I see them smacks smacks 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.140
 undeveloped 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.170
 exceptional police even in my 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:14.530
 I didn’t break it, but I still 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.239
 Well, you see for yourself I don't know 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.640
 I think that this position will become 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.150
 exclusively on this map and from this 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:26.820
 parties please 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:32.440
 and they don't even see close 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:35.350
 Well, that's probably the art of highlight drying 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.530
 to please our advantage become 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:44.710
 how many of them were hits I did not count them 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:48.490
 see for yourself, well, even though I have 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.830
 Send me there I like 1 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.110
 destroyed and how many hits 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.800
 punch this pretty much know yet 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.420
 the battle 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.420
 and have a good bye
