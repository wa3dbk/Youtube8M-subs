00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:12.079
 consider new skis come from the factory 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:14.269
 let it be ridged skis or 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.089
 classic role does not play 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:19.859
 training skate and classic above 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.089
 differs only in that he is alive 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:24.580
 designed for classic style 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.570
 have a special area under the cargo 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.460
 pad block on which are applied 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.849
 mother 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.219
 and called holding area 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:35.460
 it is very with such a collapse in seven 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.410
 ten centimeters from hide and seek shoes 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.760
 the pad is lubricated holding Asia to 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.050
 your skis nicotine them back just as well 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.010
 like forward 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.180
 to put it simply 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.220
 so that there is no return 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.240
 the length of the pad is affected by the length 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.020
 distance the more athlete gets up 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.330
 all the more confident holding him 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.230
 is necessary 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.040
 which means 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.860
 and longer block preparation 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.280
 higher for riding or running as for 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.320
 skating so for classic 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.820
 in the same way and you are exposed 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.350
 multiple processing articles 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.540
 The first is Cycle Levka Luis 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.670
 the following preparation is higher for primer 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.250
 then primer above 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.750
 and primer above the main paraffin 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.910
 corresponding weather 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.600
 the penultimate stage is application 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.060
 main paraffin corresponding 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.340
 the weather and the last this powder coating 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.810
 consider all these stages 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.810
 in details 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.580
 primarily for handling skis to us 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.179
 need a table comfortable height 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:45.919
 equipped with the necessary for 

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:47.780
 work and fixtures 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.750
 first of all the machine 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.710
 fixture on which strengthens 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.770
 skiing in such a way that she had support 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.370
 full length 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.570
 for manual handling of skis, we need 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.580
 several brushes 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.259
 metal brushes are brass 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.330
 bronze 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.600
 synthetic 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.090
 hard soft medium 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.010
 brushes made of natural bristles and 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.779
 combo brushes 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:17.159
 acquiring new skis untreated 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.690
 we get skis dry surface 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.429
 and with a definite thing earlier TV there 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:24.779
 and therefore the ski does not need the first 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:26.509
 processing stages 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:28.289
 Omsk cycle 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:30.599
 but at the same time, each pair of skis 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.180
 must at least twice a season 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.320
 go through the factory or indeed 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.639
 scraping 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:38.950
 once became the beginning of winter 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.530
 and the second time two weeks before the main 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.629
 competition 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.309
 since the skis exhibit the best 

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:45.809
 quality slip on the trail 

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:48.309
 two week break-in 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:50.269
 enough for lovers 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.689
 once a year skidding 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:54.999
 at the beginning of the winter season 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:56.759
 sliding microstructure 

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:59.079
 surface consists of two areas 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.060
 crystalline and 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.999
 and you can 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:05.469
 Fire Crystal 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:07.839
 and therefore it does not absorb paraffin 

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:08.719
 and mother 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:10.719
 amorphous region opposite 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:13.059
 capable of activity peak paraffin and 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:14.039
 mother 

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:16.969
 but back to preparing our skis 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:19.389
 the second article handling skis is 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.389
 preparation for primer 

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:29.449
 prefabricated skis 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:30.640
 grinding 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.010
 require easy manual scraping and 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.379
 at which only Vasya Germans is removed 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.370
 but not plastic ie mr ii picture 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.720
 as in swedish sliding 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.019
 surface 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.529
 if there was no factory grinding then 

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:45.409
 it is necessary to check the condition of the sliding 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.059
 surface removing defects 

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:50.289
 this is done by removing the thin layer 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:51.480
 surface 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.569
 alternating it with paraffin wax 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.549
 then about a ton of brushed 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:57.809
 clear skis 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:00.809
 from paraffin residues 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.679
 next stage of ski preparation 

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:08.679
 it's a primer 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:14.649
 on a cleaned out sliding 

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:16.709
 surface primer is applied full-time 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.809
 paraffin or any more or less 

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:21.190
 medics restrained use from trick 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.659
 up to five degrees 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:25.069
 paraffin violet is used more often 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:26.270
 colors 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.599
 paraffin calls are very important 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:29.790
 exact quantity 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.470
 to carefully us and tequila 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.849
 paraffin beetle 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:37.909
 warm the skis 2 three times by adding paraffin 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:39.990
 Pamira absorption into the surface 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.460
 I'll see you cool 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.530
 after 30 minutes, remove excess paraffin 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.729
 plastic scraper 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.340
 and process the surface medium 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.439
 on soft synthetic clear 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:55.529
 such processing is performed by sliding 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:57.419
 surface several times 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.740
 after each ski saturation 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.590
 carefully protected from 7 thousand crossed 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.360
 but a few passes across the surface 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.289
 after these operations 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:08.610
 gliding surface should 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.550
 have a characteristic crack 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.650
 if weather conditions require that 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.449
 skiing was a structure toddlers do not have 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.159
 factory that extra spending 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:19.830
 must be manually made 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.939
 matching cut 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:24.069
 the application of the structure is always done 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.219
 before the main is applied to the skis 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:28.860
 paraffin 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.460
 the next step 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.400
 we will look at the ski undercoat 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.400
 primary paraffin 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.960
 cook under the main paraffin 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.349
 need to withstand the temperature difference 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.080
 paraffin melting point 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.910
 used in primers 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.420
 should be higher temperature 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.279
 main melting profile 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:52.400
 i.e. thunder fine paraffin 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.860
 must be more than just melting 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.719
 in this case, the main paraffin is not 

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:59.419
 mixed with primer 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:01.639
 in case of cold weather when in 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:03.129
 as the main profile 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:05.210
 used frosty so 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.990
 refractory solid paraffin and no 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.310
 capacity as 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.080
 primer use more 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.080
 solid paraffin wax similar 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.749
 on the hardness of the main paraffin 

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:18.709
 when cooking skis under the appropriate 

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:19.490
 weather 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.169
 under normal paraffin is necessary 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:22.699
 use simple 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:24.999
 And Patrick in torus containing 

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:26.619
 fluoride 

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:28.539
 primer is made ordinary 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:31.029
 in a special way
