saying that I have pretty dry skin the
only<00:00:25.470> place<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.769> get<00:00:25.830> oily<00:00:26.699> sometimes<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.300> on<00:00:27.420> my

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510

forehead and on my nose in the summer
but<00:00:29.460> other<00:00:29.609> than<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.029> would<00:00:30.240> consider

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
but other than that I would consider

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.470 
but other than that I would consider
myself<00:00:30.900> having<00:00:31.470> dry<00:00:31.679> skin<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.880> very<00:00:33.300> very

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
myself having dry skin and I very very

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.010 
myself having dry skin and I very very
sensitive<00:00:34.050> skin<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.739> wouldn't<00:00:35.579> say<00:00:35.790> it's<00:00:36.120> prone

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
sensitive skin I wouldn't say it's prone

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.319 
sensitive skin I wouldn't say it's prone
to<00:00:37.320> breakout<00:00:37.770> or<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.219> I've<00:00:38.370> acne<00:00:38.940> if

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
to breakout or that I've acne if

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.119 
to breakout or that I've acne if
anything<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.870> usually<00:00:40.260> get<00:00:40.500> one<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.100> two

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
anything I usually get one to two

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.450 
anything I usually get one to two
breakouts<00:00:41.790> at<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.059> time<00:00:42.450> but<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.290> have<00:00:43.829> found<00:00:44.190> a

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
breakouts at a time but I have found a

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.770 
breakouts at a time but I have found a
routine<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:44.940> think<00:00:45.270> keeps<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.570> pretty

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
routine that I think keeps it pretty

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.479 
routine that I think keeps it pretty
under<00:00:46.050> control<00:00:46.500> now<00:00:46.710> when<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:46.950> wake<00:00:47.160> up<00:00:47.309> I

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
under control now when I wake up I

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.069 
under control now when I wake up I
actually<00:00:47.670> don't<00:00:48.030> wash<00:00:48.360> my<00:00:48.390> face<00:00:48.719> with<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
actually don't wash my face with the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.069 
actually don't wash my face with the
cleanser<00:00:49.469> if<00:00:49.770> anything<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.850> will<00:00:51.239> take<00:00:51.899> any

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
cleanser if anything I will take any

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.470 
cleanser if anything I will take any
excess<00:00:52.530> excess<00:00:52.860> makeup<00:00:53.489> off<00:00:53.640> with<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:54.149> makeup

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
excess excess makeup off with a makeup

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.360 
excess excess makeup off with a makeup
remover<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:55.020> then<00:00:55.469> splash<00:00:55.800> my<00:00:55.980> face<00:00:56.010> with

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
remover and then splash my face with

remover and then splash my face with
warm<00:00:56.550> water<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.180> then<00:00:57.750> I'll<00:00:57.899> apply<00:00:58.079> a

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
warm water and then I'll apply a

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.099 
warm water and then I'll apply a
moisturizer<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.129> my<00:00:59.820> skin<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.149> just<00:01:00.690> too

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
moisturizer and my skin is just too

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.680 
moisturizer and my skin is just too
sensitive<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:02.280> wash<00:01:02.699> twice<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> day<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.539> my

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
sensitive to wash twice a day in my

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.020 
sensitive to wash twice a day in my
opinion<00:01:04.170> I've<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.460> found<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.880> works

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
opinion I've just found that it works

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.330 
opinion I've just found that it works
better<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.360> wash<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.810> once<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.439> day<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.920> doesn't

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
better to wash it once a day it doesn't

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.340 
better to wash it once a day it doesn't
dry<00:01:08.549> my<00:01:08.700> skin<00:01:08.909> out<00:01:09.030> as<00:01:09.210> much<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:10.170> just

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
dry my skin out as much and it just

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.350 
dry my skin out as much and it just
works<00:01:10.530> for<00:01:10.770> me<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.640> moisturizer<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.210> I

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
works for me so the moisturizer that I

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.070 
works for me so the moisturizer that I
apply<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.409> center<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:15.080> moisturizing

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
apply is the center of a moisturizing

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.170 
apply is the center of a moisturizing
cream<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.710> normal<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:16.979> dry<00:01:17.100> skin<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.000> think

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
cream for normal to dry skin and I think

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.700 
cream for normal to dry skin and I think
this<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.450> mostly<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.869> nighttime<00:01:19.320> moisturizer

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
this is mostly a nighttime moisturizer

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.560 
this is mostly a nighttime moisturizer
because<00:01:20.460> it's<00:01:20.670> very<00:01:20.939> thick<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.479> very

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
because it's very thick and very

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.620 
because it's very thick and very
moisturizing<00:01:22.470> but<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.670> put<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.570> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
moisturizing but I put this on in the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.929 
moisturizing but I put this on in the
morning<00:01:24.990> because<00:01:25.170> my<00:01:25.710> skin<00:01:26.189> needs<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.700> it's

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
morning because my skin needs it it's

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.390 
morning because my skin needs it it's
just<00:01:27.240> really<00:01:27.479> dry<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.409> don't<00:01:28.619> feel<00:01:28.979> like<00:01:29.220> it

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
just really dry and I don't feel like it

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.140 
just really dry and I don't feel like it
makes<00:01:29.759> my<00:01:29.939> skin<00:01:30.000> really<00:01:30.960> greasy<00:01:31.229> or<00:01:31.680> heavy<00:01:32.150> so

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
makes my skin really greasy or heavy so

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.539

I use this morning and night time but

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090

they just work very well and how I use
these<00:02:00.299> as<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.630> usually

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
these as I usually

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.140 
these as I usually
kind<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.130> dried<00:02:02.370> out<00:02:02.400> I'll<00:02:02.700> run<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.940> under<00:02:03.120> some

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
kind of dried out I'll run it under some

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.210 
kind of dried out I'll run it under some
warm<00:02:03.480> water<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.930> they<00:02:04.020> soap<00:02:04.320> up<00:02:04.560> right<00:02:04.980> away

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
warm water and they soap up right away

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.790 
warm water and they soap up right away
so<00:02:05.280> that's<00:02:06.090> really<00:02:06.510> nice<00:02:06.690> because<00:02:07.170> if<00:02:07.680> they

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
so that's really nice because if they

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.859 
so that's really nice because if they
ever<00:02:07.890> dry<00:02:08.160> out<00:02:08.340> they<00:02:08.729> still<00:02:09.060> work<00:02:09.479> really<00:02:09.660> well

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
ever dry out they still work really well

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.860 
ever dry out they still work really well
and<00:02:10.320> I'll<00:02:10.410> usually<00:02:10.590> use<00:02:10.979> one<00:02:11.370> side<00:02:11.700> for<00:02:12.660> my

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
and I'll usually use one side for my

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.660 
and I'll usually use one side for my
whole<00:02:13.140> face<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:13.470> eye<00:02:14.040> makeup<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.490> everything

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
whole face and eye makeup and everything

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.000 
whole face and eye makeup and everything
and<00:02:15.240> then<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:16.110> might<00:02:16.320> be<00:02:16.440> kind<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.770> gross<00:02:16.980> but

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
and then this might be kind of gross but

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.750 
and then this might be kind of gross but
I'll<00:02:17.460> usually<00:02:17.670> save<00:02:18.300> that<00:02:18.770> wipe<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.070> I'll<00:02:20.490> use

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
I'll usually save that wipe and I'll use

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.820 
I'll usually save that wipe and I'll use
the<00:02:20.970> next<00:02:21.210> side<00:02:21.570> either<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.380> morning<00:02:22.680> if<00:02:22.770> I

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
the next side either in the morning if I

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.770 
the next side either in the morning if I
have<00:02:22.920> leftover<00:02:23.220> makeup<00:02:23.670> or<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:23.910> next<00:02:24.570> night

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
have leftover makeup or the next night

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.190 
have leftover makeup or the next night
and<00:02:25.880> maybe<00:02:26.880> that's<00:02:27.180> really<00:02:27.390> gross<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:28.020> save

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
and maybe that's really gross to save

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.020 
and maybe that's really gross to save
makeup<00:02:28.560> wipes<00:02:28.770> but<00:02:29.160> honestly<00:02:29.730> you<00:02:29.880> can

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
makeup wipes but honestly you can

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.970 
makeup wipes but honestly you can
definitely<00:02:30.210> get<00:02:30.510> 2<00:02:30.660> uses<00:02:30.870> out<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.290> these<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:31.770> if

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
definitely get 2 uses out of these so if

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.070 
definitely get 2 uses out of these so if
it<00:02:32.100> doesn't<00:02:32.370> bother<00:02:32.460> your<00:02:32.760> skin<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.330> would<00:02:33.930> do

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
ever found I'm absolutely stuffed with

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.190 
ever found I'm absolutely stuffed with
it<00:04:38.820> and<00:04:38.940> I've<00:04:39.000> been<00:04:39.030> using<00:04:39.150> it<00:04:39.480> for<00:04:39.510> years<00:04:39.690> I

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
it and I've been using it for years I

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.750 
it and I've been using it for years I
highly<00:04:40.470> recommend<00:04:40.830> this<00:04:40.950> and<00:04:41.250> then<00:04:41.430> just<00:04:41.640> one

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
highly recommend this and then just one

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.090 
highly recommend this and then just one
more<00:04:41.880> point<00:04:42.090> that<00:04:42.210> I<00:04:42.390> wanted<00:04:42.720> to<00:04:42.780> make<00:04:43.290> I'm<00:04:44.040> not

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
more point that I wanted to make I'm not

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.030 
more point that I wanted to make I'm not
sponsored<00:04:44.610> or<00:04:44.940> anything<00:04:45.210> by<00:04:45.750> survey<00:04:46.320> I<00:04:46.560> use

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
sponsored or anything by survey I use

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.670 
sponsored or anything by survey I use
this<00:04:47.280> because<00:04:47.580> it's<00:04:48.540> really<00:04:48.960> really<00:04:49.080> gentle

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
this because it's really really gentle

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.700 
this because it's really really gentle
and<00:04:49.920> I<00:04:50.400> think<00:04:50.820> it's<00:04:50.970> just<00:04:51.060> like<00:04:51.690> less<00:04:52.140> is<00:04:52.410> more

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
and I think it's just like less is more

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.700 
and I think it's just like less is more
I<00:04:53.070> also<00:04:53.480> think<00:04:54.480> that<00:04:54.570> using<00:04:55.080> products<00:04:55.470> is<00:04:55.590> in

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
I also think that using products is in

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.040 
I also think that using products is in
the<00:04:55.830> same<00:04:56.070> line<00:04:56.340> really<00:04:56.760> helps<00:04:57.150> because<00:04:57.390> they

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
the same line really helps because they

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.860 
the same line really helps because they
are<00:04:58.170> meant<00:04:58.470> to<00:04:58.560> go<00:04:58.770> together<00:04:59.070> so<00:04:59.660> these<00:05:00.660> are

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
are meant to go together so these are

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.150 
are meant to go together so these are
just<00:05:01.050> ones<00:05:01.230> that<00:05:01.410> my<00:05:01.560> dermatologist

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
just ones that my dermatologist

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.740 
just ones that my dermatologist
recommend<00:05:02.640> and<00:05:02.850> they<00:05:02.940> work<00:05:03.150> super<00:05:03.540> well<00:05:03.720> for

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
recommend and they work super well for

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.780 
recommend and they work super well for
my<00:05:04.050> skin<00:05:04.320> so<00:05:04.530> if<00:05:04.620> you<00:05:04.740> do<00:05:04.920> have<00:05:05.040> sensitive<00:05:05.250> skin

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
my skin so if you do have sensitive skin

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.460 
my skin so if you do have sensitive skin
I<00:05:05.970> definitely<00:05:06.420> recommend<00:05:06.660> trying<00:05:06.990> these<00:05:07.230> out

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
I definitely recommend trying these out

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.500 
I definitely recommend trying these out
if<00:05:07.800> you've<00:05:08.160> never<00:05:08.310> tried<00:05:08.580> them<00:05:08.850> before<00:05:08.880> so<00:05:09.450> you

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
if you've never tried them before so you

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.960 
if you've never tried them before so you
can<00:05:09.690> find<00:05:09.930> them<00:05:10.050> at<00:05:10.290> your<00:05:10.320> local<00:05:10.980> drugstore<00:05:11.460> I

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
can find them at your local drugstore I

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.850 
can find them at your local drugstore I
don't<00:05:12.150> think<00:05:12.330> they're<00:05:12.620> super<00:05:13.620> inexpensive

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
don't think they're super inexpensive

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.000 
don't think they're super inexpensive
but<00:05:14.640> they're<00:05:14.940> definitely<00:05:15.090> not<00:05:15.620> high-end<00:05:16.620> or

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
but they're definitely not high-end or

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.909 
but they're definitely not high-end or
gonna<00:05:17.419> break<00:05:18.419> your<00:05:18.570> bank<00:05:18.750> buy<00:05:19.169> though<00:05:19.650> with
