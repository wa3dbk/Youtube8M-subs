important<00:00:35.489> thing<00:00:35.550> always<00:00:36.180> if<00:00:36.930> you're<00:00:37.050> someone

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
important thing always if you're someone

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.220

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
that's that and then the last thing that

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:40.910 
that's that and then the last thing that
I<00:04:32.980> do<00:04:33.130> is<00:04:34.260> I<00:04:36.000> use<00:04:37.920> cliniques<00:04:38.940> Moisture<00:04:39.940> Surge

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920

extended<00:04:41.920> thirst<00:04:42.400> relief<00:04:43.090> gel<00:04:44.050> cream<00:04:44.910> so<00:04:45.910> it

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
extended thirst relief gel cream so it

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.570 
extended thirst relief gel cream so it
looks<00:04:47.020> like<00:04:47.140> this<00:04:47.560> and<00:04:47.980> it's<00:04:48.190> pretty

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
looks like this and it's pretty

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.920 
looks like this and it's pretty
expensive<00:04:49.000> and<00:04:49.720> it's<00:04:50.650> only<00:04:51.100> a<00:04:51.130> little<00:04:51.550> thing

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
expensive and it's only a little thing

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.110 
expensive and it's only a little thing
but<00:04:52.930> it<00:04:53.410> lasts<00:04:53.800> forever<00:04:54.040> it<00:04:54.550> because<00:04:54.850> you<00:04:54.970> only

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
but it lasts forever it because you only

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.020 
but it lasts forever it because you only
need<00:04:55.360> the<00:04:55.390> tiniest<00:04:55.660> bit<00:04:56.140> like<00:04:56.940> getting<00:04:57.940> all

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
need the tiniest bit like getting all

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.080 
need the tiniest bit like getting all
turn<00:04:58.210> around<00:04:58.540> with<00:04:58.660> this<00:04:58.780> camera<00:04:59.440> situation

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
turn around with this camera situation

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.080 
turn around with this camera situation
but<00:05:01.230> it's<00:05:02.230> like<00:05:02.410> not<00:05:03.130> even<00:05:03.310> halfway<00:05:03.640> done<00:05:03.880> and

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
but it's like not even halfway done and

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.790 
but it's like not even halfway done and
I've<00:05:04.330> been<00:05:04.420> using<00:05:04.630> this<00:05:04.840> for<00:05:04.900> a<00:05:05.140> won't<00:05:05.530> for

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
I've been using this for a won't for

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.090 
I've been using this for a won't for
awhile<00:05:05.890> now<00:05:06.750> at<00:05:07.750> night<00:05:08.200> and<00:05:08.410> in<00:05:08.920> the<00:05:08.950> morning

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
awhile now at night and in the morning

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.890 
awhile now at night and in the morning
so<00:05:11.040> at<00:05:12.040> first<00:05:12.100> I<00:05:12.460> was<00:05:12.580> like<00:05:12.610> oh<00:05:12.910> that's<00:05:13.300> too

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
so at first I was like oh that's too

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.620 
so at first I was like oh that's too
much<00:05:13.930> but<00:05:14.380> I<00:05:14.910> think<00:05:15.910> it's<00:05:16.030> worth<00:05:16.150> it<00:05:16.300> now<00:05:16.450> that

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
much but I think it's worth it now that

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.890 
much but I think it's worth it now that
lasts<00:05:16.930> so<00:05:17.080> long<00:05:17.110> and<00:05:17.650> I<00:05:18.340> like<00:05:19.120> the<00:05:19.270> gel<00:05:19.600> because

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
lasts so long and I like the gel because

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.380 
lasts so long and I like the gel because
I<00:05:20.290> don't<00:05:20.950> know<00:05:21.040> for<00:05:21.310> someone<00:05:21.550> for<00:05:22.030> people<00:05:22.300> with

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
I don't know for someone for people with

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:23.760 
I don't know for someone for people with
acne<00:05:22.570> prone<00:05:22.960> skin<00:05:23.020> I<00:05:23.260> think<00:05:23.560> you<00:05:23.650> can

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
acne prone skin I think you can

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.030

idea<00:05:25.360> of<00:05:25.630> putting<00:05:25.780> lotion<00:05:26.110> on<00:05:26.380> my<00:05:26.530> face<00:05:26.740> it's

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
idea of putting lotion on my face it's

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.340 
idea of putting lotion on my face it's
like<00:05:27.100> I'm<00:05:27.340> gonna<00:05:27.490> break<00:05:27.670> out<00:05:27.940> and<00:05:28.330> it's<00:05:29.140> gonna

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.950 
like I'm gonna break out and it's gonna
be<00:05:29.440> horrible<00:05:29.710> so<00:05:30.280> the<00:05:30.580> gel<00:05:30.910> for<00:05:31.240> me<00:05:31.360> it<00:05:31.450> feels<00:05:31.600> a

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
be horrible so the gel for me it feels a

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.220 
be horrible so the gel for me it feels a
little<00:05:32.110> bit<00:05:32.350> more<00:05:33.570> refreshing<00:05:34.570> and<00:05:34.900> less<00:05:35.080> like

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.230 
little bit more refreshing and less like

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.950
