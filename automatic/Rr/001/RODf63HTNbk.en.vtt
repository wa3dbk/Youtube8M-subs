everybody knows it but you have a block

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
down here quite often you have a block

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.959 
down here quite often you have a block
all<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.660> way<00:00:54.750> down<00:00:54.930> here<00:00:55.610> which<00:00:56.610> gives<00:00:56.850> it

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
all the way down here which gives it

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.549 
all the way down here which gives it
certain<00:00:57.300> qualities<00:00:57.750> or<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.109> have<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> partial

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
certain qualities or you have a partial

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.500 
certain qualities or you have a partial
block<00:00:58.949> sometimes<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.640> have<00:00:59.760> no<00:00:59.789> block

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
block sometimes you have no block

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.569 
block sometimes you have no block
well<00:01:00.960> it's<00:01:01.109> hollow<00:01:01.289> though<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.190> one<00:01:02.370> has<00:01:02.399> got

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
well it's hollow though this one has got

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.690 
well it's hollow though this one has got
a<00:01:02.640> sort<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.879> partial<00:01:03.420> block<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.769> keeps<00:01:05.040> from

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
a sort of partial block so it keeps from

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.700 
a sort of partial block so it keeps from
not<00:01:06.450> exactly<00:01:06.750> acoustic<00:01:07.200> qualities<00:01:07.560> but<00:01:07.650> it

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
not exactly acoustic qualities but it

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.080 
not exactly acoustic qualities but it
keeps<00:01:07.890> them<00:01:08.010> sort<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.250> resonant<00:01:08.670> qualities

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
keeps them sort of resonant qualities

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.359 
keeps them sort of resonant qualities
that<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.360> really<00:01:09.689> like<00:01:09.869> with<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:10.979> kind<00:01:11.280> of

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
that I really like with this kind of

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.300 
that I really like with this kind of
guitar<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.850> mean<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.180> do<00:01:13.140> play<00:01:13.530> solid<00:01:13.950> guitars

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
guitar I mean I do play solid guitars

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.270 
guitar I mean I do play solid guitars
and<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.880> play<00:01:15.180> completely<00:01:15.979> archtop<00:01:16.979> hollow

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
and I play completely archtop hollow

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.109 
and I play completely archtop hollow
guitars<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.619> solid<00:01:19.619> guitars<00:01:19.950> obviously<00:01:20.880> are

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
guitars and solid guitars obviously are

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.200 
guitars and solid guitars obviously are
great<00:01:22.100> for<00:01:23.100> all<00:01:23.340> sorts<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.790> things<00:01:23.939> but

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
great for all sorts of things but

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.690 
great for all sorts of things but
there's<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.200> certain<00:01:25.380> resonance<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.159> get<00:01:26.460> when

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
there's a certain resonance you get when

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.940 
there's a certain resonance you get when
there's<00:01:26.880> some<00:01:27.000> hollow<00:01:27.390> chamber<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.829> it's

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
there's some hollow chamber in that it's

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.469 
there's some hollow chamber in that it's
very<00:01:28.979> attractive<00:01:29.189> particularly<00:01:30.119> not<00:01:30.240> playing

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
very attractive particularly not playing

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.969 
very attractive particularly not playing
particularly<00:01:31.079> loud<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.619> know<00:01:31.740> if<00:01:31.829> you've<00:01:31.920> got

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
particularly loud you know if you've got

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.590 
particularly loud you know if you've got
the<00:01:32.159> kind<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.340> in-between<00:01:32.520> volumes<00:01:33.299> really

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
the kind of in-between volumes really

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.480 
the kind of in-between volumes really
gives<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.840> kind<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.229> woody<00:01:37.560> edge<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.250> things

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
gives it a kind of woody edge to things

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.450 
gives it a kind of woody edge to things
which<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.240> really<00:01:40.079> like<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.439> I've<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.829> really

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
it you know and I guess it's a certain

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.110 
it you know and I guess it's a certain
kind<00:04:01.329> of<00:04:01.420> cording<00:04:02.049> and<00:04:02.200> things<00:04:02.319> it's<00:04:02.709> easier

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
kind of cording and things it's easier

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.280 
kind of cording and things it's easier
but<00:04:04.120> that's<00:04:04.480> a<00:04:04.569> matter<00:04:04.750> of<00:04:04.840> taste<00:04:05.049> but<00:04:05.140> if

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
but that's a matter of taste but if

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.160 
but that's a matter of taste but if
we've<00:04:05.410> got<00:04:05.530> Everly<00:04:05.860> on<00:04:05.980> here<00:04:06.370> and<00:04:07.170> lovely

we've got Everly on here and lovely
color<00:04:08.379> I<00:04:08.500> think<00:04:08.829> actually<00:04:09.040> I<00:04:09.340> think<00:04:09.670> you'll

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819

agree<00:04:09.970> this<00:04:10.750> is<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:10.930> beautiful<00:04:11.319> color<00:04:11.500> that<00:04:11.829> we

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
agree this is a beautiful color that we

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:14.400 
agree this is a beautiful color that we
sort<00:04:12.819> of<00:04:12.910> jointly<00:04:13.600> came<00:04:13.780> up<00:04:13.930> with<00:04:14.139> but<00:04:14.319> of

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
sort of jointly came up with but of

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.180 
sort of jointly came up with but of
course<00:04:14.880> it's<00:04:15.880> been<00:04:16.060> realized<00:04:16.600> in<00:04:17.380> itself<00:04:17.919> and

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
course it's been realized in itself and

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.430 
course it's been realized in itself and
this<00:04:18.340> and<00:04:18.729> this<00:04:19.329> tail<00:04:19.600> piece<00:04:19.870> are<00:04:20.139> this<00:04:20.350> is

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
this and this tail piece are this is

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.920 
this and this tail piece are this is
very<00:04:20.620> interesting<00:04:21.000> tail<00:04:22.000> piece<00:04:22.270> is<00:04:22.419> a<00:04:22.450> special

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
very interesting tail piece is a special

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.100 
very interesting tail piece is a special
feature<00:04:23.280> because<00:04:24.280> it<00:04:24.460> looks<00:04:24.669> like<00:04:24.940> a<00:04:25.270> sort<00:04:26.020> of

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
feature because it looks like a sort of

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.200 
feature because it looks like a sort of
jazz<00:04:26.349> guitar<00:04:26.710> tail<00:04:26.979> piece<00:04:27.280> like<00:04:27.700> the<00:04:27.940> strings

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
jazz guitar tail piece like the strings

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.180 
jazz guitar tail piece like the strings
would<00:04:28.419> be<00:04:28.539> attached<00:04:28.870> there<00:04:29.169> with<00:04:29.919> a<00:04:29.950> trapeze

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
would be attached there with a trapeze

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.950 
would be attached there with a trapeze
so<00:04:30.580> it<00:04:30.700> looks<00:04:30.849> like<00:04:30.910> a<00:04:31.000> trapeze<00:04:31.240> tail<00:04:31.660> piece

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
so it looks like a trapeze tail piece

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.860 
so it looks like a trapeze tail piece
but<00:04:32.740> basic<00:04:33.190> but<00:04:33.520> it<00:04:33.639> isn't<00:04:33.940> because<00:04:34.510> the

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
but basic but it isn't because the

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.360 
but basic but it isn't because the
strings<00:04:35.139> are<00:04:35.260> going<00:04:35.289> through<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.710> body<00:04:35.919> back

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
strings are going through the body back

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.279 
strings are going through the body back
here<00:04:36.729> and<00:04:37.380> coming<00:04:38.380> through<00:04:39.690> into<00:04:40.690> the<00:04:41.080> tail

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
here and coming through into the tail

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.640 
here and coming through into the tail
tail<00:04:41.860> piece<00:04:42.099> and<00:04:42.340> across<00:04:42.760> the<00:04:43.169> spring<00:04:44.169> so<00:04:44.349> it

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
tail piece and across the spring so it

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.930 
tail piece and across the spring so it
kind<00:04:44.830> of<00:04:44.889> gives<00:04:45.099> the<00:04:45.220> impression<00:04:45.460> a<00:04:45.760> rather

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
kind of gives the impression a rather

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.029 
kind of gives the impression a rather
attractive<00:04:46.479> sort<00:04:47.320> of<00:04:47.669> Greek<00:04:48.669> lyre<00:04:49.090> type

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
attractive sort of Greek lyre type

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:54.150 
attractive sort of Greek lyre type
design<00:04:52.229> gives<00:04:53.229> the<00:04:53.320> impression<00:04:53.530> that<00:04:53.770> it's<00:04:54.070> a

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
design gives the impression that it's a

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.940 
design gives the impression that it's a
sort<00:04:54.370> of<00:04:54.460> you<00:04:55.210> know<00:04:55.240> jazz<00:04:55.539> guitar<00:04:55.930> style<00:04:56.680> but

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
sort of you know jazz guitar style but

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.080 
sort of you know jazz guitar style but
actually<00:04:57.220> the<00:04:57.280> strings<00:04:57.490> go<00:04:57.550> through<00:04:57.820> the<00:04:57.910> body

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
actually the strings go through the body

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.240 
actually the strings go through the body
so<00:04:58.180> you<00:04:58.360> getting<00:04:58.630> more<00:04:58.750> sustain<00:04:59.169> you<00:05:00.070> don't

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
so you getting more sustain you don't

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.100 
so you getting more sustain you don't
give<00:05:00.400> you<00:05:00.550> that<00:05:01.210> gives<00:05:01.389> you<00:05:01.510> a<00:05:01.570> different<00:05:01.630> kind

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
give you that gives you a different kind

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.700 
give you that gives you a different kind
of<00:05:02.139> tension<00:05:02.880> and<00:05:03.880> it<00:05:04.000> gives<00:05:04.150> you<00:05:04.300> a<00:05:04.680> well<00:05:05.680> I

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
of tension and it gives you a well I

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.050 
of tension and it gives you a well I
think<00:05:05.770> it<00:05:05.979> gives<00:05:06.099> you<00:05:06.160> extra<00:05:06.460> sustain<00:05:06.880> because

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
think it gives you extra sustain because

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.240 
think it gives you extra sustain because
the<00:05:07.270> strings<00:05:07.510> all<00:05:07.690> gain<00:05:07.840> through<00:05:08.020> the<00:05:08.110> body<00:05:08.289> so

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
the strings all gain through the body so

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.620 
the strings all gain through the body so
that<00:05:09.400> was<00:05:09.520> an<00:05:09.610> interesting<00:05:09.700> feature<00:05:10.180> that<00:05:10.360> he

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
that was an interesting feature that he

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.140 
that was an interesting feature that he
wanted<00:05:10.900> to<00:05:10.960> try<00:05:11.289> and<00:05:11.620> then<00:05:12.400> we<00:05:12.610> thought<00:05:12.820> we'd

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
wanted to try and then we thought we'd

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.390 
wanted to try and then we thought we'd
try<00:05:13.330> and<00:05:13.660> it<00:05:13.780> to<00:05:14.260> me<00:05:14.380> it<00:05:14.500> worked<00:05:14.740> great<00:05:14.860> because

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
try and it to me it worked great because

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.730 
try and it to me it worked great because
the<00:05:15.490> guitar<00:05:15.610> feels<00:05:16.030> really<00:05:16.539> really<00:05:17.380> good<00:05:17.710> I

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
the guitar feels really really good I

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.700 
the guitar feels really really good I
mean<00:05:17.950> one<00:05:18.219> of<00:05:18.250> the<00:05:18.370> features

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
mean one of the features
