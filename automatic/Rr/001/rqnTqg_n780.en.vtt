can<00:03:34.410> be<00:03:34.500> pretty<00:03:34.680> exciting<00:03:35.099> so<00:03:35.550> certainly<00:03:36.269> the

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
can be pretty exciting so certainly the

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
with lot more freedoms with the engine

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.199 
with lot more freedoms with the engine
we've<00:03:40.980> got<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.250> probably<00:03:41.580> another<00:03:41.730> 200

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
we've got a probably another 200

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.630 
we've got a probably another 200
horsepower<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:43.200> we've<00:03:43.349> got<00:03:43.560> good<00:03:44.129> brakes<00:03:44.340> on

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
horsepower and we've got good brakes on

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.550 
horsepower and we've got good brakes on
the<00:03:44.730> car<00:03:44.760> now<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.780> bit<00:03:45.900> more<00:03:46.080> rubber<00:03:46.290> so

the car now and a bit more rubber so
that<00:03:46.590> all<00:03:46.860> adds<00:03:47.040> up<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.280> more<00:03:47.549> excitement<00:03:47.910> oh

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239

it's got a good genuine Chevy Camaro

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.449 
it's got a good genuine Chevy Camaro
motor<00:03:51.049> for<00:03:52.049> we're<00:03:52.170> in<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.379> 600<00:03:52.890> or<00:03:52.980> 700

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
motor for we're in the 600 or 700

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.050 
motor for we're in the 600 or 700
department<00:03:54.739> yeah<00:03:55.769> no<00:03:56.129> it's<00:03:56.310> it's<00:03:56.580> plenty<00:03:56.940> and

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
department yeah no it's it's plenty and

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.059 
department yeah no it's it's plenty and
that<00:03:57.720> sort<00:03:57.930> of<00:03:58.019> wants<00:03:58.440> to<00:03:58.470> be<00:03:58.560> read<00:03:58.830> pretty

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
that sort of wants to be read pretty

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.830 
that sort of wants to be read pretty
hard<00:03:59.370> so<00:03:59.730> it<00:03:59.819> sounds<00:04:00.090> pretty<00:04:00.239> leak<00:04:00.510> down<00:04:00.660> the

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
hard so it sounds pretty leak down the

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.690 
hard so it sounds pretty leak down the
straight<00:04:01.110> for<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.349> spectators<00:04:01.950> all<00:04:02.549> right

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
straight for the spectators all right

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.520 
straight for the spectators all right
certainly<00:04:03.120> a<00:04:03.150> handful<00:04:03.599> it<00:04:03.750> even<00:04:04.260> though<00:04:04.380> we've

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
certainly a handful it even though we've

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.229 
certainly a handful it even though we've
got<00:04:04.680> bigger<00:04:04.860> tires<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.340> we<00:04:05.519> run<00:04:05.700> back<00:04:05.910> in<00:04:06.060> ours

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
got bigger tires and we run back in ours

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.539 
got bigger tires and we run back in ours
it's<00:04:06.450> got<00:04:06.660> plenty<00:04:06.900> more<00:04:07.019> horsepower<00:04:07.680> so<00:04:07.980> you

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
it's got plenty more horsepower so you

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.520 
it's got plenty more horsepower so you
know<00:04:08.700> you<00:04:09.209> look<00:04:09.239> at<00:04:09.630> the<00:04:09.780> cars<00:04:10.019> that<00:04:10.349> we're

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
know you look at the cars that we're

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.250 
know you look at the cars that we're
running<00:04:10.860> here<00:04:11.160> they've<00:04:11.849> all<00:04:12.030> got<00:04:12.209> between<00:04:12.510> 600

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
running here they've all got between 600

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.259 
running here they've all got between 600
and<00:04:13.349> 700<00:04:13.709> horsepower<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:14.700> they're<00:04:15.030> running

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
and 700 horsepower and they're running

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.780 
and 700 horsepower and they're running
on<00:04:15.360> dot<00:04:15.629> tires<00:04:15.930> so<00:04:16.440> that<00:04:17.040> equates<00:04:17.370> to<00:04:17.459> a<00:04:17.579> head

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
on dot tires so that equates to a head

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.250 
on dot tires so that equates to a head
forward<00:04:18.239> probably<00:04:18.600> the<00:04:18.780> only<00:04:18.870> thing<00:04:18.989> that's

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
forward probably the only thing that's

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.080 
forward probably the only thing that's
close<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.500> its<00:04:19.829> original<00:04:19.979> is<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.609> 4-speed

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
close to its original is the 4-speed

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.029 
close to its original is the 4-speed
transmission<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.019> 12-volt<00:04:22.440> Shelby<00:04:22.860> diff

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
transmission and the 12-volt Shelby diff

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.930 
transmission and the 12-volt Shelby diff
so<00:04:23.340> rough<00:04:23.669> but<00:04:24.270> yep<00:04:25.139> obviously<00:04:26.100> most<00:04:26.610> of<00:04:26.850> the

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
so rough but yep obviously most of the

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.790 
so rough but yep obviously most of the
cars<00:04:27.210> here<00:04:27.539> it<00:04:27.900> still<00:04:28.199> got<00:04:28.320> like<00:04:28.530> a<00:04:28.560> leaf

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
cars here it still got like a leaf

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.500 
cars here it still got like a leaf
spring<00:04:29.100> area<00:04:29.340> that<00:04:29.880> still<00:04:30.180> got<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.419> original

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
spring area that still got the original

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.140 
spring area that still got the original
a<00:04:30.930> arm<00:04:31.169> suspension<00:04:31.440> on<00:04:31.919> the<00:04:32.039> front<00:04:32.340> so<00:04:32.610> whilst

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
a arm suspension on the front so whilst

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.120 
a arm suspension on the front so whilst
we're<00:04:33.510> being<00:04:33.720> able<00:04:33.810> to<00:04:33.990> hold<00:04:34.410> it<00:04:34.530> up<00:04:34.650> a<00:04:34.740> bit<00:04:34.919> and

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
we're being able to hold it up a bit and

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.980 
we're being able to hold it up a bit and
make<00:04:35.190> it<00:04:35.340> a<00:04:35.520> bit<00:04:35.639> adjustable<00:04:36.240> these<00:04:36.630> are<00:04:36.810> still

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
make it a bit adjustable these are still

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.409 
make it a bit adjustable these are still
pretty<00:04:37.200> much<00:04:37.410> here<00:04:37.680> based<00:04:37.919> around<00:04:38.190> a<00:04:38.340> good<00:04:38.550> 70

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
pretty much here based around a good 70

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.500 
pretty much here based around a good 70
