animals to cut down on the cost so the

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.640 
animals to cut down on the cost so the
first<00:00:21.310> thing<00:00:21.430> we<00:00:21.520> decided<00:00:21.730> to<00:00:21.880> try<00:00:22.180> was<00:00:23.110> to

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
first thing we decided to try was to

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.920 
first thing we decided to try was to
grow<00:00:24.220> it<00:00:24.370> for<00:00:24.580> our<00:00:24.670> rabbits<00:00:25.030> and<00:00:25.210> see<00:00:25.450> how<00:00:25.690> well

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 
grow it for our rabbits and see how well

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.089 
grow it for our rabbits and see how well
they<00:00:26.140> ate

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
they ate

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.640 
they ate
we<00:00:28.579> we<00:00:28.970> did<00:00:29.179> this<00:00:29.359> to<00:00:29.509> see<00:00:29.689> how<00:00:29.869> the<00:00:30.470> rabbits

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
we we did this to see how the rabbits

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.109 
we we did this to see how the rabbits
would<00:00:30.949> do<00:00:31.099> with<00:00:31.250> it<00:00:31.369> to<00:00:31.489> see<00:00:31.640> if<00:00:31.730> it<00:00:31.820> cut<00:00:31.999> our

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
would do with it to see if it cut our

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.830 
would do with it to see if it cut our
costs<00:00:32.329> and<00:00:32.899> and<00:00:33.760> and<00:00:34.760> as<00:00:35.090> a<00:00:35.120> result<00:00:35.600> it<00:00:35.809> has

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
costs and and and as a result it has

and we're just we're just in the
learning<00:00:45.409> process<00:00:45.530> here<00:00:46.129> there's<00:00:46.309> so<00:00:46.430> many

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
learning process here there's so many

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.759 
learning process here there's so many
different<00:00:46.940> things<00:00:47.059> to<00:00:47.269> know<00:00:47.589> the<00:00:48.589> wheat

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
different things to know the wheat

starch dust germinate and sprout within

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.079 
starch dust germinate and sprout within
one<00:00:52.670> or<00:00:52.790> two<00:00:52.850> three<00:00:53.449> days<00:00:53.659> and<00:00:53.960> then<00:00:54.739> and<00:00:55.430> by

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
one or two three days and then and by

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.680 
one or two three days and then and by
day<00:00:56.149> nine<00:00:57.399> it's<00:00:58.399> about<00:00:58.579> time<00:00:58.850> to<00:00:59.089> feed<00:00:59.510> it<00:00:59.600> to

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
day nine it's about time to feed it to

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.060 
day nine it's about time to feed it to
the<00:00:59.780> rabbits<00:01:00.309> so<00:01:01.309> all<00:01:01.460> we<00:01:01.580> do<00:01:01.759> is<00:01:02.030> we'll<00:01:03.070> we'll

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
the rabbits so all we do is we'll we'll

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.830 
the rabbits so all we do is we'll we'll
take<00:01:04.220> a<00:01:04.280> bucket<00:01:06.970> like<00:01:07.970> this<00:01:08.210> and<00:01:08.450> put<00:01:08.659> about<00:01:08.780> a

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
take a bucket like this and put about a

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.770 
take a bucket like this and put about a
gallon<00:01:09.470> of<00:01:09.680> weed<00:01:10.130> in<00:01:10.340> it<00:01:10.490> and<00:01:11.090> we'll<00:01:11.450> soak<00:01:11.659> it

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
gallon of weed in it and we'll soak it

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.120 
gallon of weed in it and we'll soak it
overnight<00:01:11.810> about<00:01:12.259> twelve<00:01:12.590> hours

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
overnight about twelve hours

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.810 
overnight about twelve hours
the<00:01:13.400> longer<00:01:13.700> you<00:01:13.820> soak<00:01:14.119> it<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.659> better<00:01:15.020> it

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
the longer you soak it the better it

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.690 
the longer you soak it the better it
stays<00:01:16.820> wet<00:01:17.259> so<00:01:18.259> when<00:01:18.409> it<00:01:18.560> germinates<00:01:18.979> it<00:01:19.250> more

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
stays wet so when it germinates it more

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.969 
stays wet so when it germinates it more
of<00:01:19.790> them<00:01:19.909> will<00:01:20.060> germinate<00:01:20.270> right<00:01:21.259> away<00:01:21.470> and

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
of them will germinate right away and

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.280 
of them will germinate right away and
then<00:01:22.430> after<00:01:22.670> we<00:01:22.759> soak<00:01:22.970> it<00:01:23.150> we'll<00:01:23.930> put<00:01:24.140> it<00:01:24.229> in

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
then after we soak it we'll put it in

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.020 
then after we soak it we'll put it in
this<00:01:24.439> bucket<00:01:24.619> you<00:01:25.310> saw<00:01:25.460> this<00:01:25.610> in<00:01:25.790> another

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
this bucket you saw this in another

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.810 
this bucket you saw this in another
youtube<00:01:26.390> video<00:01:26.540> just<00:01:27.020> cut<00:01:27.920> some<00:01:28.100> slots<00:01:28.610> in

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
youtube video just cut some slots in

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.700 
youtube video just cut some slots in
here<00:01:28.850> so<00:01:29.270> that<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:29.570> drains<00:01:29.750> real<00:01:30.079> well<00:01:30.290> and

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
here so that it drains real well and

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.370 
here so that it drains real well and
then<00:01:31.390> we<00:01:32.390> let<00:01:32.540> it<00:01:32.570> drain<00:01:32.810> for<00:01:32.840> a<00:01:33.050> little<00:01:33.229> while

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
then we let it drain for a little while

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.130 
then we let it drain for a little while
and<00:01:33.650> then<00:01:33.890> what<00:01:34.190> we've<00:01:34.310> done<00:01:34.580> is<00:01:34.930> you've<00:01:35.930> got<00:01:36.110> a

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
and then what we've done is you've got a

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.910 
and then what we've done is you've got a
lot<00:01:36.290> of<00:01:36.350> these<00:01:36.440> flats<00:01:38.229> that<00:01:39.229> I<00:01:39.260> use<00:01:39.470> to<00:01:39.620> pick<00:01:39.800> up

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
lot of these flats that I use to pick up

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.130 
lot of these flats that I use to pick up
produce<00:01:40.130> with<00:01:40.550> and<00:01:40.850> we've<00:01:41.420> lined<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.780> bottom

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
produce with and we've lined the bottom

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.730 
produce with and we've lined the bottom
of<00:01:42.290> them<00:01:42.440> with<00:01:42.770> a<00:01:43.130> sheet<00:01:43.610> of<00:01:43.790> a<00:01:44.720> feed<00:01:45.140> bag<00:01:45.350> where

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
of them with a sheet of a feed bag where

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.260 
of them with a sheet of a feed bag where
that<00:01:45.860> we<00:01:45.950> cut<00:01:46.220> to<00:01:46.430> fit<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:46.880> then<00:01:46.909> we'll<00:01:47.120> cut

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
that we cut to fit and then we'll cut

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.920 
that we cut to fit and then we'll cut
slots<00:01:47.570> in<00:01:47.810> it<00:01:47.870> so<00:01:48.020> it<00:01:48.140> drains<00:01:48.380> well<00:01:49.750> what<00:01:50.750> we<00:01:50.840> do

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
slots in it so it drains well what we do

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.100 
slots in it so it drains well what we do
is<00:01:51.049> we<00:01:51.200> lay<00:01:51.350> about<00:01:51.530> a<00:01:51.590> half<00:01:51.799> inch<00:01:52.010> of<00:01:53.110> seeds

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
is we lay about a half inch of seeds

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.910 
is we lay about a half inch of seeds
down<00:01:54.409> and<00:01:55.010> these<00:01:55.580> ones<00:01:55.880> are<00:01:56.500> I'm<00:01:57.500> guessing

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
down and these ones are I'm guessing

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.760 
down and these ones are I'm guessing
about<00:01:58.070> two<00:01:58.250> days<00:01:58.369> old<00:01:59.170> I'm<00:02:00.170> gonna<00:02:00.320> grab<00:02:00.619> the

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
about two days old I'm gonna grab the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.810 
about two days old I'm gonna grab the
camera<00:02:01.070> and<00:02:01.100> I'm<00:02:01.220> gonna<00:02:01.340> get<00:02:01.520> up<00:02:01.610> real<00:02:01.790> close

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
camera and I'm gonna get up real close

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.380 
camera and I'm gonna get up real close

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.070 
and show you this there's they're just
starting<00:02:05.690> to<00:02:05.930> sprout<00:02:06.880> I'm<00:02:07.880> not<00:02:08.239> sure<00:02:08.479> how<00:02:08.959> much

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
starting to sprout I'm not sure how much

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.520 
starting to sprout I'm not sure how much
you<00:02:09.140> can<00:02:09.409> see<00:02:09.560> from<00:02:09.769> there<00:02:09.950> so<00:02:11.200> it<00:02:12.200> just<00:02:12.349> looks

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
you can see from there so it just looks

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.500 
you can see from there so it just looks
like<00:02:12.620> a<00:02:12.709> little<00:02:12.950> greenhouse<00:02:13.340> it<00:02:14.209> actually

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
like a little greenhouse it actually

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.240 
like a little greenhouse it actually
works<00:02:14.659> pretty<00:02:14.810> well<00:02:14.930> we<00:02:15.739> put<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:15.980> plastic

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
works pretty well we put the plastic

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.699 
works pretty well we put the plastic
around<00:02:16.610> it<00:02:17.000> at<00:02:17.540> first<00:02:17.780> keep<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.260> chickens<00:02:18.590> out

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
around it at first keep the chickens out

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.880 
around it at first keep the chickens out
and<00:02:19.360> as<00:02:20.360> it<00:02:20.569> turns<00:02:20.780> out<00:02:20.959> it<00:02:21.200> also<00:02:21.379> holds<00:02:21.739> in<00:02:21.769> the

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
and as it turns out it also holds in the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.470 
and as it turns out it also holds in the
humidity<00:02:22.159> and<00:02:22.340> makes<00:02:22.849> the<00:02:22.939> tour<00:02:23.120> we<00:02:23.299> don't

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
humidity and makes the tour we don't

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.330 
humidity and makes the tour we don't
have<00:02:23.569> to<00:02:23.689> water<00:02:23.900> them<00:02:24.110> so<00:02:24.319> much

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
have to water them so much

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.390 
have to water them so much
beans<00:02:25.939> it's<00:02:26.150> inside<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.720> big<00:02:26.870> greenhouse

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
beans it's inside the big greenhouse

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.179 
beans it's inside the big greenhouse
during<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.489> day<00:02:29.230> it<00:02:30.230> heats<00:02:30.470> up<00:02:30.650> pretty<00:02:30.890> nicely

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:31.189 
during the day it heats up pretty nicely

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.869 
during the day it heats up pretty nicely
and<00:02:31.909> heats<00:02:32.360> up<00:02:32.510> even<00:02:32.750> better<00:02:32.900> in<00:02:33.080> here<00:02:33.879> I'd

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
and heats up even better in here I'd

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.519 
and heats up even better in here I'd
love<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.180> tell<00:02:35.390> you<00:02:35.510> all<00:02:35.599> the<00:02:35.750> dimensions<00:02:36.260> and

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:36.529 
love to tell you all the dimensions and

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:38.649 
love to tell you all the dimensions and
how<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:36.950> build<00:02:37.249> one<00:02:37.430> of<00:02:37.459> these<00:02:37.579> racks<00:02:37.939> but<00:02:38.299> I

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
how to build one of these racks but I

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.600 
how to build one of these racks but I
didn't<00:02:39.409> really<00:02:39.650> write<00:02:39.799> it<00:02:39.950> down<00:02:40.069> I<00:02:40.129> just

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
didn't really write it down I just

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.050 
didn't really write it down I just
through<00:02:40.940> it<00:02:41.030> together<00:02:42.730> there's<00:02:43.730> a<00:02:43.820> lot<00:02:43.970> of

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
through it together there's a lot of

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.460 
through it together there's a lot of
different<00:02:44.360> changes<00:02:44.540> there's<00:02:45.050> tons<00:02:45.380> of

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
different changes there's tons of

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.810 
different changes there's tons of
modifications<00:02:46.070> I<00:02:46.160> would<00:02:46.310> do<00:02:46.400> because<00:02:46.700> these

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
modifications I would do because these

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.270 
modifications I would do because these
are<00:02:47.000> these<00:02:47.240> trays<00:02:47.810> are<00:02:48.050> too<00:02:48.860> close<00:02:49.100> together

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
are these trays are too close together

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.130 
are these trays are too close together
to<00:02:49.640> get<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.910> appropriate<00:02:50.450> light<00:02:50.690> they<00:02:50.930> need

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
to get the appropriate light they need

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.990 
to get the appropriate light they need
but<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:51.680> is<00:02:51.800> working<00:02:52.250> for<00:02:52.460> right<00:02:52.610> now

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.370 

this<00:02:56.000> one<00:02:56.180> here<00:02:56.510> is<00:02:56.540> about<00:02:56.930> six<00:02:57.200> days<00:02:57.380> old

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
this one here is about six days old

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.480 
this one here is about six days old
maybe<00:03:00.380> even<00:03:00.680> seven<00:03:02.950> this<00:03:03.950> is<00:03:04.010> one<00:03:04.340> of<00:03:04.370> the

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
maybe even seven this is one of the

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.190 
maybe even seven this is one of the
experiments<00:03:04.850> we<00:03:05.180> went<00:03:05.420> less<00:03:05.630> than<00:03:05.870> half<00:03:06.080> an

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
experiments we went less than half an

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.250 
experiments we went less than half an
inch<00:03:06.320> and<00:03:07.270> what<00:03:08.270> happens<00:03:08.660> when<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:08.930> go<00:03:09.050> less

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
inch and what happens when you go less

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.890 
inch and what happens when you go less
than<00:03:09.470> half<00:03:09.650> an<00:03:09.800> inch<00:03:09.920> is<00:03:10.190> it's<00:03:10.880> it's<00:03:11.450> real<00:03:11.690> weak

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
than half an inch is it's it's real weak

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.490 
than half an inch is it's it's real weak
the<00:03:12.490> the<00:03:13.490> root<00:03:13.910> bones<00:03:14.180> are<00:03:14.480> real<00:03:14.690> weak<00:03:14.930> it

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
the the root bones are real weak it

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.130 
the the root bones are real weak it
grows<00:03:15.770> just<00:03:15.800> fine<00:03:16.340> it's<00:03:16.850> just<00:03:16.970> that<00:03:17.330> you<00:03:17.959> could

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
grows just fine it's just that you could

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.430 
grows just fine it's just that you could
get<00:03:18.320> more<00:03:18.500> use<00:03:18.800> out<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.100> a<00:03:19.520> half<00:03:20.150> inch<00:03:20.420> of<00:03:20.660> seed

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
get more use out of a half inch of seed

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.640 
get more use out of a half inch of seed
there<00:03:21.770> instead<00:03:22.130> of<00:03:22.190> a<00:03:22.370> quarter<00:03:23.120> inch<00:03:24.520> but<00:03:25.520> also

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
there instead of a quarter inch but also

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.050 
there instead of a quarter inch but also
when<00:03:27.650> we<00:03:27.680> started<00:03:28.220> we<00:03:28.400> had<00:03:28.580> some<00:03:28.820> of<00:03:28.940> these

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
when we started we had some of these

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.660 
when we started we had some of these
little<00:03:29.500> slotted<00:03:30.500> trays<00:03:30.920> and<00:03:31.190> when<00:03:31.310> we<00:03:31.430> filled

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
little slotted trays and when we filled

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.010 
little slotted trays and when we filled
them<00:03:31.790> all<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.090> way<00:03:32.209> up<00:03:32.390> which<00:03:32.600> is<00:03:32.720> about<00:03:32.870> an

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
them all the way up which is about an

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.430 
them all the way up which is about an
inch<00:03:33.170> deep<00:03:33.470> what<00:03:34.459> happens<00:03:34.760> is<00:03:34.910> they<00:03:35.510> grow<00:03:35.750> they

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
inch deep what happens is they grow they

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.470 
inch deep what happens is they grow they
expand<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:38.380> in<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:39.560> expansion<00:03:40.120> what<00:03:41.120> happens

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
expand and in the expansion what happens

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.620 
expand and in the expansion what happens
is<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:42.380> lower<00:03:43.070> seeds<00:03:43.670> don't<00:03:44.450> germinate

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
is the the lower seeds don't germinate

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.500 
is the the lower seeds don't germinate
and<00:03:45.220> they<00:03:46.220> start<00:03:46.489> to<00:03:46.580> mold<00:03:46.760> and<00:03:47.030> once<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.299> mold

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
and they start to mold and once the mold

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.660 
and they start to mold and once the mold
starts<00:03:47.959> the<00:03:48.620> mold<00:03:48.830> can<00:03:48.980> take<00:03:49.130> over<00:03:49.310> the<00:03:49.519> whole

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
starts the mold can take over the whole

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.430 
starts the mold can take over the whole
tray<00:03:50.950> so<00:03:51.950> you<00:03:52.459> know<00:03:53.269> live<00:03:53.989> and<00:03:54.080> learn<00:03:54.260> a<00:03:54.290> little

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
tray so you know live and learn a little

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.210 
tray so you know live and learn a little
bit<00:03:55.810> we're<00:03:56.810> trying<00:03:56.840> to<00:03:57.380> get<00:03:57.500> this<00:03:57.650> done<00:03:57.890> every

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
bit we're trying to get this done every

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.930 
bit we're trying to get this done every
day<00:03:58.400> and<00:03:58.850> we<00:03:59.750> found<00:03:59.930> out<00:04:00.170> with<00:04:03.340> 5654<00:04:04.340> cages<00:04:04.820> of

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
day and we found out with 5654 cages of

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.470 
day and we found out with 5654 cages of
rabbits<00:04:05.360> we<00:04:06.320> basically<00:04:06.769> can<00:04:07.400> feed<00:04:08.150> all<00:04:08.330> of

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
rabbits we basically can feed all of

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.640 
rabbits we basically can feed all of
them<00:04:10.239> the<00:04:11.239> wheat<00:04:11.420> fodder<00:04:11.690> with<00:04:12.320> three<00:04:12.560> of

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
them the wheat fodder with three of

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.470 
them the wheat fodder with three of
these<00:04:12.769> trays<00:04:13.100> which<00:04:13.519> is<00:04:13.670> about<00:04:13.910> a<00:04:13.970> gallon<00:04:14.239> of

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
these trays which is about a gallon of

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.159 
these trays which is about a gallon of
wheat<00:04:14.630> see<00:04:14.870> today<00:04:16.600> they're<00:04:17.600> originally<00:04:18.019> we

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
wheat see today they're originally we

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.710 
wheat see today they're originally we
were<00:04:18.320> using<00:04:18.709> a<00:04:21.070> bag<00:04:22.070> of<00:04:22.250> feed<00:04:22.430> every<00:04:22.850> day<00:04:23.030> to

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
were using a bag of feed every day to

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.719 
were using a bag of feed every day to
feed<00:04:23.870> all<00:04:24.050> the<00:04:24.140> rabbits<00:04:24.290> and<00:04:24.770> now<00:04:25.220> we're<00:04:25.520> down

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
feed all the rabbits and now we're down

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.930 
feed all the rabbits and now we're down
to<00:04:26.030> less<00:04:26.210> than<00:04:26.270> half<00:04:26.450> a<00:04:26.780> bag<00:04:26.990> and<00:04:27.790> some<00:04:28.790> days

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
to less than half a bag and some days

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.340 
to less than half a bag and some days
we'll<00:04:29.120> even<00:04:29.360> skip<00:04:29.750> because<00:04:30.080> we'll<00:04:30.229> get

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
we'll even skip because we'll get

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.960 
we'll even skip because we'll get
produce<00:04:30.770> from<00:04:30.950> the<00:04:31.010> produce<00:04:31.400> store<00:04:31.640> and<00:04:31.850> we'll

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
produce from the produce store and we'll

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.200 
produce from the produce store and we'll
give<00:04:32.090> them<00:04:32.210> that<00:04:32.419> and<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:32.900> wheat<00:04:33.050> fodder<00:04:33.320> and

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
give them that and the wheat fodder and

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.580 
give them that and the wheat fodder and
they'll<00:04:35.210> be<00:04:35.390> just<00:04:35.419> happy<00:04:35.960> as<00:04:36.050> can<00:04:36.200> be

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.460 

so<00:04:40.590> this<00:04:40.740> is<00:04:40.889> our<00:04:41.039> first<00:04:41.780> showing<00:04:42.780> of<00:04:43.169> the

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
so this is our first showing of the

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.439 
so this is our first showing of the
wheat<00:04:43.620> fodder<00:04:43.949> we<00:04:44.430> will<00:04:44.610> probably<00:04:44.819> do<00:04:45.060> a

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
wheat fodder we will probably do a

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.350 
wheat fodder we will probably do a
supplemental<00:04:46.020> videos<00:04:46.909> so<00:04:47.909> there's<00:04:48.120> a<00:04:48.150> nice

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
supplemental videos so there's a nice

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.999 
supplemental videos so there's a nice
one<00:04:48.569> that's<00:04:48.720> sitting<00:04:49.020> on<00:04:49.080> top<00:04:49.139> that's<00:04:49.680> kind<00:04:49.979> of

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 
one that's sitting on top that's kind of

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:51.920 
one that's sitting on top that's kind of
what<00:04:50.190> I<00:04:50.220> do<00:04:50.310> to<00:04:50.669> finish<00:04:51.030> is<00:04:51.210> I'll<00:04:51.360> put<00:04:51.509> the<00:04:51.659> tray

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
what I do to finish is I'll put the tray

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.110 
what I do to finish is I'll put the tray
on<00:04:52.080> top<00:04:52.110> for<00:04:52.530> a<00:04:52.560> couple<00:04:52.860> days<00:04:52.979> it<00:04:53.759> gets<00:04:53.940> nice

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
on top for a couple days it gets nice

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.850 
on top for a couple days it gets nice
and<00:04:54.180> thick

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.550 

some<00:04:58.860> of<00:04:58.979> the<00:04:59.099> germination<00:04:59.490> is<00:04:59.789> not<00:04:59.970> going<00:05:00.300> on

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
some of the germination is not going on

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.809 
some of the germination is not going on
we<00:05:01.560> still<00:05:01.800> haven't<00:05:02.069> figured<00:05:02.280> out<00:05:02.490> the<00:05:02.550> best

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:02.819 
we still haven't figured out the best

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.080 
we still haven't figured out the best
solution<00:05:03.180> for<00:05:03.210> that<00:05:03.919> part<00:05:04.919> of<00:05:05.009> it<00:05:05.129> is<00:05:05.400> probably

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
solution for that part of it is probably

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.260 
solution for that part of it is probably
because<00:05:06.860> I'm<00:05:07.860> getting<00:05:08.039> the<00:05:08.190> seed<00:05:08.520> at<00:05:09.210> a

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
because I'm getting the seed at a

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.510 
because I'm getting the seed at a
discount<00:05:09.840> which<00:05:10.379> means<00:05:10.620> it's<00:05:10.830> probably<00:05:11.280> not

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
discount which means it's probably not

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.379 
discount which means it's probably not
all<00:05:11.729> going<00:05:11.909> to<00:05:11.969> germinate<00:05:13.969> but<00:05:14.969> it's<00:05:15.780> a<00:05:15.900> great

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
all going to germinate but it's a great

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.270 
all going to germinate but it's a great
substitute<00:05:18.389> food<00:05:18.990> source<00:05:19.289> instead<00:05:19.889> of<00:05:20.039> giving

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
substitute food source instead of giving

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.680 
substitute food source instead of giving
alfalfa<00:05:20.940> pellets<00:05:21.090> all<00:05:21.629> the<00:05:21.780> time<00:05:23.539> we<00:05:24.539> give

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
alfalfa pellets all the time we give

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.869 
alfalfa pellets all the time we give
them<00:05:24.810> lots<00:05:24.960> of<00:05:25.139> produce<00:05:25.349> and<00:05:25.860> corn<00:05:26.159> husks<00:05:26.669> and

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:26.879 
them lots of produce and corn husks and

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:30.200 
them lots of produce and corn husks and
stuff<00:05:27.270> like<00:05:27.419> that<00:05:27.710> for<00:05:28.710> their<00:05:28.860> fiber<00:05:29.099> so<00:05:29.789> this

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
stuff like that for their fiber so this

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.059 
stuff like that for their fiber so this
is<00:05:30.389> their<00:05:30.569> nutrients<00:05:31.259> that<00:05:31.440> they<00:05:31.560> get<00:05:31.800> and

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:32.069 
is their nutrients that they get and

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:34.640 
is their nutrients that they get and
then<00:05:32.389> the<00:05:33.389> other<00:05:33.509> stuff<00:05:33.780> is<00:05:33.900> their<00:05:34.080> fiber<00:05:34.289> so

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
then the other stuff is their fiber so

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.369 
then the other stuff is their fiber so
they<00:05:34.800> do<00:05:34.860> really<00:05:34.979> well<00:05:35.930> but<00:05:36.930> we<00:05:37.020> just<00:05:37.139> wanted

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:37.379 
they do really well but we just wanted

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:41.839 
they do really well but we just wanted
to<00:05:37.440> show<00:05:37.650> you<00:05:39.530> another<00:05:40.530> way<00:05:40.740> of<00:05:40.889> feeding<00:05:41.159> your

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:41.849 
to show you another way of feeding your

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:43.969 
to show you another way of feeding your
animals<00:05:41.969> at<00:05:42.569> a<00:05:42.599> low<00:05:42.780> cost<00:05:43.020> and<00:05:43.469> wheat<00:05:43.710> fodder

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
animals at a low cost and wheat fodder

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.490 
animals at a low cost and wheat fodder
is<00:05:44.279> one<00:05:44.520> that<00:05:44.699> really<00:05:45.060> really<00:05:45.240> works<00:05:45.479> now<00:05:46.349> in

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
is one that really really works now in

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.899 
is one that really really works now in
the<00:05:46.560> winter<00:05:46.740> time<00:05:46.919> when<00:05:47.009> it<00:05:47.130> gets<00:05:47.310> cooler<00:05:47.610> out

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:47.909 
the winter time when it gets cooler out

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:51.320 
the winter time when it gets cooler out
here<00:05:48.469> if<00:05:49.469> I<00:05:49.590> don't<00:05:49.770> close<00:05:49.979> the<00:05:50.190> ends<00:05:50.580> I<00:05:50.759> may<00:05:51.150> not

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
here if I don't close the ends I may not

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.580 
here if I don't close the ends I may not
be<00:05:51.479> able<00:05:51.539> to<00:05:51.690> continue<00:05:51.930> to<00:05:52.169> do<00:05:52.289> this<00:05:53.360> but<00:05:54.590> but

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
be able to continue to do this but but

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.610 
be able to continue to do this but but
so<00:05:55.770> far<00:05:55.979> it's<00:05:56.099> working<00:05:56.279> really<00:05:56.520> well
