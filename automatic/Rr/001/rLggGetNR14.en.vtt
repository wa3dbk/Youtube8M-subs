around 60 amps so if we come over here

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.350 
around 60 amps so if we come over here
that<00:01:49.680> doesn't<00:01:49.950> mean<00:01:50.040> too<00:01:50.220> much<00:01:50.250> if<00:01:51.000> we<00:01:51.180> come

a postage design if it includes all of
these<00:02:24.310> chips<00:02:24.730> in<00:02:25.030> one<00:02:25.209> so<00:02:25.450> it's<00:02:25.600> much<00:02:25.780> more

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
these chips in one so it's much more

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.250 
these chips in one so it's much more
efficient<00:02:26.440> there's<00:02:27.100> less<00:02:27.310> power<00:02:27.610> leakage

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260

this<00:03:24.790> system<00:03:25.390> keeps<00:03:25.630> crashing<00:03:26.170> we're<00:03:26.980> running

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
this system keeps crashing we're running

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.280 
this system keeps crashing we're running
loading<00:03:27.790> under<00:03:28.180> loading<00:03:28.510> hundred<00:03:28.959> percent

loading under loading hundred percent

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.050 
loading under loading hundred percent
loading<00:03:29.620> this<00:03:30.100> one<00:03:30.310> we're<00:03:30.459> running<00:03:30.700> at<00:03:30.820> ninety

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
loading this one we're running at ninety

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.400 
loading this one we're running at ninety
percent<00:03:31.209> voting<00:03:31.690> but<00:03:31.870> it's<00:03:31.989> getting<00:03:32.079> too<00:03:32.380> hot

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
percent voting but it's getting too hot

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.030 
percent voting but it's getting too hot
so<00:03:32.860> it<00:03:32.950> keeps<00:03:33.070> crashing<00:03:33.610> on<00:03:33.760> this<00:03:33.910> okay<00:03:34.390> so

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
so it keeps crashing on this okay so

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.370 
so it keeps crashing on this okay so
okay<00:03:36.040> so<00:03:36.220> we've<00:03:36.820> got<00:03:36.940> one<00:03:37.090> board<00:03:37.299> here<00:03:37.570> you<00:03:38.230> can

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
okay so we've got one board here you can

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.490 
okay so we've got one board here you can
say<00:03:38.620> all<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.100> levels<00:03:39.310> of<00:03:39.519> been<00:03:39.760> hidden

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
say all the levels of been hidden

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.140 
say all the levels of been hidden
there's<00:03:41.500> another<00:03:41.680> board<00:03:41.980> here<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.850> then

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
there's another board here and then

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.860 
there's another board here and then
there's<00:03:43.360> not<00:03:43.510> one<00:03:43.690> over<00:03:43.930> here<00:03:45.000> now<00:03:46.000> this<00:03:46.660> is

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
there's not one over here now this is

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.350 
there's not one over here now this is
this<00:03:47.140> is<00:03:47.290> a<00:03:47.320> gay<00:03:47.470> black<00:03:47.620> board<00:03:48.010> okay<00:03:48.700> so<00:03:48.760> if<00:03:49.180> we

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
this is a gay black board okay so if we

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.900 
this is a gay black board okay so if we
look<00:03:49.390> over<00:03:49.810> here<00:03:50.110> this<00:03:50.980> is<00:03:51.160> for<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.400> first

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
look over here this is for the first

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.509 
look over here this is for the first

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.800 
going to be learning now 29 concern yeah
so<00:04:17.310> I<00:04:17.340> have<00:04:17.519> to<00:04:17.640> actually<00:04:17.880> start<00:04:18.299> this<00:04:18.510> one<00:04:18.660> up

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
so I have to actually start this one up

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.510 
so I have to actually start this one up
together<00:04:19.230> okay<00:04:21.950> actually<00:04:22.950> as<00:04:23.100> you<00:04:23.250> can<00:04:23.400> see

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
together okay actually as you can see

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.790 
together okay actually as you can see
it's<00:04:23.670> cool<00:04:24.180> down<00:04:24.450> for<00:04:24.660> part<00:04:24.810> a<00:04:24.840> bit<00:04:24.990> we<00:04:25.350> go<00:04:25.470> it's

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
it's cool down for part a bit we go it's

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.590 
it's cool down for part a bit we go it's
running<00:04:26.070> a<00:04:26.280> similar<00:04:26.820> temperature<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.450> this

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
running a similar temperature to this

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.230 
running a similar temperature to this
one<00:04:27.780> ok<00:04:28.260> so<00:04:29.100> now<00:04:29.310> it's<00:04:29.640> going<00:04:29.940> to<00:04:30.060> heat<00:04:30.210> up

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
one ok so now it's going to heat up

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.640 
one ok so now it's going to heat up
because<00:04:30.780> it's<00:04:31.020> loading<00:04:32.010> to<00:04:32.160> ninety<00:04:32.700> percent

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
because it's loading to ninety percent

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.330 
because it's loading to ninety percent
you'll<00:04:34.650> see<00:04:34.860> at<00:04:34.980> heat<00:04:35.220> of<00:04:35.540> gradually<00:04:36.680> but<00:04:37.680> what

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
you'll see at heat of gradually but what

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.860 
you'll see at heat of gradually but what
was<00:04:38.430> that<00:04:38.490> setting<00:04:38.820> up<00:04:38.940> we<00:04:39.210> look<00:04:39.390> over<00:04:39.510> this<00:04:39.720> is

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
was that setting up we look over this is

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.780 
was that setting up we look over this is
gigabyte<00:04:40.260> board<00:04:40.500> and<00:04:40.770> it's<00:04:40.890> it's<00:04:41.430> based<00:04:41.640> on

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
gigabyte board and it's it's based on

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.000 
gigabyte board and it's it's based on
algebra<00:04:42.360> five<00:04:42.600> technology<00:04:43.290> and<00:04:43.410> you<00:04:43.470> can<00:04:43.650> see

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
algebra five technology and you can see

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.360 
algebra five technology and you can see
that<00:04:44.910> it's<00:04:45.090> running<00:04:45.360> 65<00:04:45.900> degrees<00:04:46.710> Celsius<00:04:47.220> of

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
that it's running 65 degrees Celsius of

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.480 
that it's running 65 degrees Celsius of
course<00:04:47.669> much<00:04:48.510> much<00:04:48.750> cooler<00:04:48.990> and<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:50.250> first

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
course much much cooler and the first

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.270 
course much much cooler and the first
blow<00:04:50.669> up<00:04:50.880> and<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:51.840> second<00:04:52.200> board<00:04:52.350> here<00:04:52.680> is

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
blow up and the second board here is

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.740 
blow up and the second board here is
heading<00:04:53.640> out<00:04:53.870> so<00:04:54.870> obviously<00:04:55.350> these<00:04:55.950> new

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
heading out so obviously these new

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.630 
heading out so obviously these new
components<00:04:57.750> that<00:04:58.130> gigabyte<00:04:59.130> is<00:04:59.280> using<00:04:59.520> an

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
components that gigabyte is using an

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.220 
components that gigabyte is using an
ultra<00:04:59.910> durable<00:05:00.000> 5motor<00:05:00.480> book<00:05:00.690> so<00:05:00.930> that<00:05:00.960> you

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
ultra durable 5motor book so that you

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.800 
ultra durable 5motor book so that you
saw<00:05:01.410> before<00:05:01.440> for<00:05:01.890> the<00:05:01.950> first<00:05:02.160> time<00:05:02.480> I'm<00:05:03.480> making

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
saw before for the first time I'm making

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.010 
saw before for the first time I'm making
quite<00:05:04.740> a<00:05:04.800> big<00:05:04.950> difference<00:05:05.310> so<00:05:06.210> this<00:05:06.750> has<00:05:06.870> been

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
quite a big difference so this has been

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.060 
quite a big difference so this has been
come<00:05:07.260> with<00:05:07.410> its<00:05:07.590> weak<00:05:07.740> town<00:05:08.010> at<00:05:08.280> the<00:05:08.940> gigabytes

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
come with its weak town at the gigabytes

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.800 
come with its weak town at the gigabytes
ruin<00:05:11.070> in<00:05:11.280> cycling<00:05:11.730> running<00:05:11.820> on<00:05:12.090> I<00:05:12.270> hope<00:05:12.660> you

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
ruin in cycling running on I hope you

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.200 
ruin in cycling running on I hope you
enjoyed<00:05:13.020> good
