00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020
 hi guys today on the internet I have 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.960
 found this game called 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:12.719
 very animated are two then binds 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.940
 you will find in the description while the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.750
 Chinese a bit like playing now part 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.150
 one thing there are several blocks 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.369
 we choose this we can chain 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.660
 domain 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:33.320
 then with this we can draw a 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.320
 weapon this case is a gun 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.190
 then we can do 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.630
 I make our movie there 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.860
 I recommend making tutorials because the 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:08.790
 game is too hard then here it is 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:12.119
 here he explains a little to you the masses of it 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.270
 this then 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:20.580
 and then you see now I see a 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:23.460
 how to play and put on and 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.300
 let's say let's say this let's do one 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.300
 face species 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:36.020
 this does something wrong with bondi 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.020
 then, there is 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.920
 we can trap things by shooting it 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.900
 this is a very fun game there 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.790
 I recommend playing from yours 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.790
 help more practice
