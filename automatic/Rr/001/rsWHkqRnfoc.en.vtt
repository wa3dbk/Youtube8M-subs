00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.109 
you think guys let's test it out we had
to<00:02:00.560> get<00:02:00.679> a<00:02:00.709> lot<00:02:00.830> of<00:02:00.920> bags<00:02:01.100> here<00:02:01.369> because<00:02:01.640> they

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
to get a lot of bags here because they

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.510 
to get a lot of bags here because they
tend<00:02:02.330> to<00:02:02.390> break<00:02:04.959> okay<00:02:06.069> all<00:02:07.069> right<00:02:07.190> let's<00:02:07.429> take

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
tend to break okay all right let's take

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.880 
tend to break okay all right let's take
a<00:02:07.580> closer<00:02:07.850> inspection<00:02:08.560> give<00:02:09.560> it<00:02:09.679> a<00:02:09.709> nice

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
a closer inspection give it a nice

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.330 
a closer inspection give it a nice
little<00:02:10.039> rubdown<00:02:10.310> here<00:02:10.700> see

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.460 

okay<00:02:15.340> so<00:02:15.400> they<00:02:15.790> do<00:02:16.150> have<00:02:16.180> one<00:02:16.660> scratch<00:02:16.990> here<00:02:17.290> on

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
okay so they do have one scratch here on

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.590 
okay so they do have one scratch here on
the<00:02:17.560> display<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:18.790> doesn't<00:02:19.150> seem<00:02:19.270> to<00:02:19.360> be<00:02:19.450> too

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
the display it doesn't seem to be too

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.360 
the display it doesn't seem to be too
bad<00:02:19.840> in<00:02:20.290> fact<00:02:20.560> actually<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:20.950> can<00:02:21.100> smudge<00:02:21.340> it

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
bad in fact actually I can smudge it

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.190 
bad in fact actually I can smudge it
away<00:02:22.350> obviously<00:02:23.350> still<00:02:23.560> working<00:02:25.020> yeah<00:02:26.020> in

so now we're going to be throwing it in
the<00:03:15.510> water<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:15.840> submerging<00:03:16.380> it<00:03:16.470> for<00:03:16.590> 15

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
the water and submerging it for 15

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.590 
the water and submerging it for 15
seconds<00:03:17.370> with<00:03:17.460> the<00:03:17.550> video<00:03:17.790> playing<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.420> see

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
seconds with the video playing to see

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.120 
seconds with the video playing to see
how<00:03:18.720> it<00:03:18.840> fares<00:03:19.080> after<00:03:19.710> that<00:03:19.830> we're<00:03:19.950> going<00:03:20.040> to

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
how it fares after that we're going to

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.410 
how it fares after that we're going to
pull<00:03:20.280> it<00:03:20.370> out<00:03:20.460> we're<00:03:20.820> going<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.000> dry<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.210> off

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
pull it out we're going to dry it off

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.240 
pull it out we're going to dry it off
and<00:03:21.450> see<00:03:21.750> its<00:03:21.870> operation<00:03:22.380> if<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:22.890> is<00:03:23.040> not

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
and see its operation if it is not

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.650 
and see its operation if it is not
functioning<00:03:23.760> we<00:03:23.880> are<00:03:24.060> going<00:03:24.240> to<00:03:24.300> chuck<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.570> in

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
functioning we are going to chuck it in

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.900 
functioning we are going to chuck it in
some<00:03:24.810> rice<00:03:24.930> for<00:03:25.170> 24<00:03:25.500> hours<00:03:25.770> but<00:03:26.250> based<00:03:26.670> on<00:03:26.760> what

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
we're seeing so far this thing is

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.200 
we're seeing so far this thing is
virtually<00:03:28.440> well<00:03:29.190> we'll<00:03:29.550> just<00:03:29.730> leave<00:03:29.820> it<00:03:29.880> dark

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210

really good sign you know for about five

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.620 
really good sign you know for about five
minutes<00:04:32.490> though<00:04:32.610> it<00:04:32.880> was<00:04:33.270> stuck<00:04:33.449> in<00:04:33.569> a

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
minutes though it was stuck in a

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.450 
minutes though it was stuck in a
perpetual<00:04:33.930> boot<00:04:34.319> and<00:04:34.530> we<00:04:34.860> were<00:04:34.979> unable<00:04:35.130> to<00:04:35.250> use

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
perpetual boot and we were unable to use

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.390 
perpetual boot and we were unable to use
it<00:04:35.759> but<00:04:36.690> yeah<00:04:36.840> initially<00:04:37.650> we<00:04:37.979> thought<00:04:38.009> that

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
it but yeah initially we thought that

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.920 
it but yeah initially we thought that
water<00:04:38.490> had<00:04:38.759> penetrated<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.300> display<00:04:39.599> because

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
water had penetrated the display because

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.110 
water had penetrated the display because
there<00:04:40.050> was<00:04:40.169> some<00:04:40.349> color<00:04:40.530> degradation<00:04:41.000> but<00:04:42.000> it

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
there was some color degradation but it

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.370 
there was some color degradation but it
does<00:04:42.270> seem<00:04:42.449> that<00:04:42.479> it<00:04:42.690> has<00:04:42.840> come<00:04:43.020> back<00:04:43.110> to<00:04:43.229> life

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
does seem that it has come back to life

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.529 
does seem that it has come back to life
it<00:04:43.560> is<00:04:43.680> still<00:04:43.889> functioning<00:04:44.400> let's<00:04:45.240> just<00:04:45.389> test

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
it is still functioning let's just test

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.469 
it is still functioning let's just test
the<00:04:45.630> keyboard<00:04:46.699> okay<00:04:47.699> so<00:04:47.759> the<00:04:48.000> keyboard<00:04:48.150> is

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.820 

okay<00:05:10.330> guys<00:05:10.479> so<00:05:10.539> it's<00:05:10.810> been<00:05:10.930> 24<00:05:11.319> hours<00:05:11.379> since<00:05:11.710> we

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
okay guys so it's been 24 hours since we

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.649 
okay guys so it's been 24 hours since we

submerge the iPhone underwater for 15

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:15.570 
submerge the iPhone underwater for 15
seconds<00:05:14.080> we<00:05:14.439> did<00:05:14.620> place<00:05:14.830> it<00:05:14.979> in<00:05:15.099> rice<00:05:15.280> to<00:05:15.460> let

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
seconds we did place it in rice to let

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.249 
seconds we did place it in rice to let
it<00:05:15.669> dry<00:05:15.849> off<00:05:16.000> to<00:05:16.150> soak<00:05:16.360> up<00:05:16.449> the<00:05:16.539> water<00:05:16.629> now

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:17.259 
it dry off to soak up the water now

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:20.059 
it dry off to soak up the water now
let's<00:05:17.500> power<00:05:17.710> it<00:05:17.830> on<00:05:17.919> and<00:05:18.250> see<00:05:18.340> if<00:05:18.490> it<00:05:18.580> works

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:20.069 
let's power it on and see if it works

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:22.890 
let's power it on and see if it works
okay<00:05:21.069> now<00:05:21.310> let's<00:05:21.490> power<00:05:21.699> it<00:05:21.759> up<00:05:21.879> those<00:05:22.689> don't

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
okay now let's power it up those don't

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.649 
okay now let's power it up those don't
belong<00:05:23.050> together<00:05:23.729> obviously<00:05:24.729> a<00:05:25.090> bit<00:05:25.240> dirty

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:25.659 
belong together obviously a bit dirty

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:26.999 
belong together obviously a bit dirty
that's<00:05:26.379> not<00:05:26.530> going<00:05:26.620> to<00:05:26.680> affect<00:05:26.770> its

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.009 
that's not going to affect its

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.059 
that's not going to affect its
functionality<00:05:28.169> okay<00:05:29.169> so<00:05:29.229> repeated<00:05:29.770> attempts

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:30.069 
functionality okay so repeated attempts

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:31.290 
functionality okay so repeated attempts
to<00:05:30.099> power<00:05:30.400> it<00:05:30.490> on<00:05:30.580> are<00:05:30.879> proving<00:05:31.210> to<00:05:31.270> be

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
to power it on are proving to be

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.149 
to power it on are proving to be
unsuccessful<00:05:31.659> so<00:05:32.199> the<00:05:32.289> iPhone<00:05:32.590> 5<00:05:32.770> did<00:05:32.979> fail
