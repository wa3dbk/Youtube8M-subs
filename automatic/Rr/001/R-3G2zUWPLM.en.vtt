00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
peyote stitching an interesting thing to

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.700 
peyote stitching an interesting thing to
note<00:01:51.909> is<00:01:52.090> that<00:01:52.119> now<00:01:52.630> you<00:01:52.690> essentially<00:01:53.319> have

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
note is that now you essentially have

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.730 
note is that now you essentially have
three<00:01:54.090> rows<00:01:55.090> this<00:01:56.050> one<00:01:56.229> right<00:01:56.350> here<00:01:56.560> on<00:01:56.649> the

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
three rows this one right here on the

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.520 
three rows this one right here on the
bottom<00:01:57.240> two<00:01:58.240> is<00:01:58.569> the<00:01:58.810> one<00:01:58.929> in<00:01:59.050> the<00:01:59.080> middle<00:01:59.259> and

bottom two is the one in the middle and

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.370 
bottom two is the one in the middle and
three<00:02:00.369> is<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.789> white<00:02:00.940> seed<00:02:01.210> bead<00:02:01.420> so<00:02:02.229> keep

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
three is the white seed bead so keep

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.630 
three is the white seed bead so keep
this<00:02:02.530> in<00:02:02.649> mind<00:02:02.800> whenever<00:02:03.009> you're<00:02:03.159> following

three rows 5 rows 7 rows and so on

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.030 
three rows 5 rows 7 rows and so on
they're<00:02:09.039> really<00:02:09.580> talking<00:02:09.910> about<00:02:09.970> all<00:02:11.040> the

you've<00:02:16.450> come<00:02:16.690> back<00:02:16.810> out<00:02:17.019> of<00:02:17.049> your<00:02:17.290> stop<00:02:17.799> bead

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
you've come back out of your stop bead

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.890 
you've come back out of your stop bead
up<00:02:18.250> here<00:02:18.400> at<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:18.579> top<00:02:18.760> thread<00:02:19.209> on<00:02:19.390> another

up here at the top thread on another
bead<00:02:20.350> and<00:02:20.380> then<00:02:21.000> continue<00:02:22.000> with<00:02:22.150> your<00:02:22.329> peyote

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750

bead and then continue with your peyote
stitch<00:02:22.959> back<00:02:23.560> down<00:02:23.950> from<00:02:24.430> left<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.850> right<00:02:25.150> so

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
stitch back down from left to right so

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.600 
stitch back down from left to right so
this<00:02:25.959> is<00:02:26.079> what<00:02:26.200> your<00:02:26.320> next<00:02:26.620> row<00:02:26.829> of<00:02:27.100> peyote

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
this is what your next row of peyote

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.729 
this is what your next row of peyote
stitching<00:02:28.060> looks<00:02:28.239> like<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.660> what<00:02:29.320> I've<00:02:29.500> done

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
stitching looks like and what I've done

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.420 
stitching looks like and what I've done
is<00:02:31.019> when<00:02:32.019> I<00:02:32.049> came<00:02:32.140> back<00:02:32.350> through<00:02:32.769> my<00:02:32.799> stop<00:02:33.190> bead

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
is when I came back through my stop bead

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.819 
is when I came back through my stop bead
I<00:02:33.609> thread<00:02:33.970> it<00:02:34.090> on<00:02:34.209> another<00:02:34.690> seed<00:02:34.989> bead<00:02:35.019> this

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
I thread it on another seed bead this

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:37.560 
I thread it on another seed bead this
time<00:02:36.040> in<00:02:36.220> that<00:02:36.340> same<00:02:36.640> color<00:02:36.850> as<00:02:37.120> my<00:02:37.359> base

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
time in that same color as my base

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.470 
time in that same color as my base
stitch<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.230> then<00:02:38.590> I<00:02:38.680> went<00:02:38.920> through<00:02:39.480> this

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
stitch and then I went through this

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.479 
stitch and then I went through this
white<00:02:40.810> seed<00:02:41.079> bead<00:02:41.320> thread<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:42.040> on<00:02:42.190> another

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
white seed bead thread it on another

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.300 
white seed bead thread it on another
black<00:02:42.970> seed<00:02:43.299> bead<00:02:43.829> went<00:02:44.829> through<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.160> white

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
black seed bead went through the white

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.610 
black seed bead went through the white
so<00:02:46.269> really<00:02:46.780> what<00:02:46.930> you're<00:02:47.019> doing<00:02:47.049> is<00:02:47.440> you're

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
so really what you're doing is you're

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.849 
so really what you're doing is you're
making<00:02:47.650> for<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.549> most<00:02:48.700> part<00:02:48.910> a<00:02:49.060> straight<00:02:49.450> line

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
making for the most part a straight line

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.380 
making for the most part a straight line
through<00:02:50.859> this<00:02:50.980> other<00:02:51.220> row<00:02:51.519> but<00:02:51.820> because<00:02:52.150> these

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
through this other row but because these

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.810 
through this other row but because these
beads<00:02:52.720> are<00:02:52.930> staggered<00:02:53.410> these<00:02:54.340> beads<00:02:54.609> in

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
beads are staggered these beads in

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.580 
beads are staggered these beads in
between<00:02:54.850> each<00:02:55.450> of<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.870> white<00:02:56.049> seed<00:02:56.320> beads

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
between each of the white seed beads

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.849 
between each of the white seed beads
will<00:02:57.400> rise<00:02:57.730> up<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.269> little<00:02:58.840> bit<00:02:59.019> more<00:02:59.200> causing

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
will rise up a little bit more causing

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:01.680 
will rise up a little bit more causing
an<00:02:59.950> indentation<00:03:00.280> between<00:03:00.790> each<00:03:01.209> one<00:03:01.450> of<00:03:01.570> them

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
an indentation between each one of them

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.930 
an indentation between each one of them
that's<00:03:02.200> exactly<00:03:02.680> what<00:03:02.829> you<00:03:02.920> want<00:03:03.070> this<00:03:03.670> is<00:03:03.910> a

you<00:03:36.090> would<00:03:36.210> only<00:03:36.360> leapfrog<00:03:36.840> over<00:03:36.990> one<00:03:37.410> seed

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
you would only leapfrog over one seed

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.500 
you would only leapfrog over one seed
bead<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.190> then<00:03:38.340> stitch<00:03:38.580> through<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:38.910> next<00:03:39.210> in

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
bead and then stitch through the next in

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.020 
bead and then stitch through the next in
to<00:03:40.200> drop<00:03:40.500> you're<00:03:41.040> going<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.370> leapfrog<00:03:41.610> over

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
to drop you're going to leapfrog over

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.690 
to drop you're going to leapfrog over
two<00:03:42.540> seed<00:03:42.870> beads<00:03:43.140> and<00:03:43.470> then<00:03:44.010> stitch<00:03:44.310> through

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
two seed beads and then stitch through

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.450 
two seed beads and then stitch through
the<00:03:44.970> next<00:03:45.420> two<00:03:46.050> seed<00:03:46.350> beads<00:03:46.590> let<00:03:47.160> me<00:03:47.250> show<00:03:47.400> you

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
the next two seed beads let me show you

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.110 
the next two seed beads let me show you
how<00:03:47.610> this<00:03:47.760> works

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
how this works

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.110 
how this works
I<00:03:48.180> have<00:03:48.900> leapfrog<00:03:49.350> over<00:03:49.740> the<00:03:50.070> two<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.610> then<00:03:50.970> go

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
I have leapfrog over the two and then go

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.170 
I have leapfrog over the two and then go
through<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:52.350> adjacent<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:53.010> two<00:03:53.160> that<00:03:53.340> pull

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
through the adjacent to two that pull

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.000 
through the adjacent to two that pull
nice<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:54.450> tight<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:55.080> what<00:03:55.500> you're<00:03:55.620> left<00:03:55.770> with

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
nice and tight and what you're left with

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.100 
nice and tight and what you're left with
is<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.490> beginning<00:03:56.790> to<00:03:57.240> the<00:03:57.330> next<00:03:57.600> row<00:03:57.750> of<00:03:57.990> your

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
is the beginning to the next row of your

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.650 
is the beginning to the next row of your
two<00:03:58.260> drop<00:03:58.500> peyote<00:03:58.710> stitch<00:03:59.150> continue<00:04:00.150> this<00:04:00.330> all

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
two drop peyote stitch continue this all

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.290 
two drop peyote stitch continue this all
the<00:04:00.720> way<00:04:01.410> down<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.430> length<00:04:02.610> of<00:04:02.790> your<00:04:03.120> base

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
the way down the length of your base

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.480 
the way down the length of your base
stitch<00:04:03.770> this<00:04:04.770> is<00:04:04.830> what<00:04:04.920> it's<00:04:05.130> gonna<00:04:05.250> look<00:04:05.340> like

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
stitch this is what it's gonna look like

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.480 
stitch this is what it's gonna look like
after<00:04:05.850> stitching<00:04:06.680> all<00:04:07.680> of<00:04:07.920> your<00:04:08.070> alternate

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
after stitching all of your alternate

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.490 
after stitching all of your alternate
seed<00:04:09.000> beads<00:04:09.210> onto<00:04:09.480> your<00:04:09.660> base<00:04:09.810> row<00:04:10.050> your

seed beads onto your base row your
cording<00:04:10.860> now<00:04:10.980> is<00:04:11.100> coming<00:04:11.370> out<00:04:11.490> of<00:04:11.610> your<00:04:11.670> stop

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
cording now is coming out of your stop

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.000 
cording now is coming out of your stop
bead<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:12.360> just<00:04:13.290> like<00:04:13.440> before<00:04:13.590> when<00:04:13.920> you're

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
bead and just like before when you're

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.949 
bead and just like before when you're
doing<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.370> one<00:04:14.550> drop<00:04:14.790> peyote<00:04:15.000> stitch<00:04:15.330> you're

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
doing the one drop peyote stitch you're

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.539 
doing the one drop peyote stitch you're
going<00:04:16.140> to<00:04:16.260> pick<00:04:16.410> up<00:04:16.440> two<00:04:16.859> more<00:04:17.100> of<00:04:17.220> your<00:04:17.340> seed

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
going to pick up two more of your seed

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.310 
going to pick up two more of your seed
beads<00:04:17.760> and<00:04:18.030> so<00:04:18.359> now<00:04:18.510> I'm<00:04:18.630> going<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:18.870> go<00:04:18.959> back<00:04:19.140> to

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
beads and so now I'm going to go back to

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.949 
beads and so now I'm going to go back to
using<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.680> black<00:04:19.890> seed<00:04:20.160> bead<00:04:20.340> color<00:04:20.549> and<00:04:20.959> I'm

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
using the black seed bead color and I'm

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.740 
using the black seed bead color and I'm
going<00:04:21.989> to<00:04:22.200> go<00:04:22.410> then<00:04:23.040> through<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:24.000> two<00:04:24.300> white

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
going to go then through the two white

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.710 
going to go then through the two white
seed<00:04:25.020> beads<00:04:25.260> right<00:04:26.160> here<00:04:26.370> in<00:04:26.520> this<00:04:26.640> row<00:04:26.850> now

seed beads right here in this row now

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.020 
seed beads right here in this row now
just<00:04:28.020> like<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.560> one<00:04:28.740> drop<00:04:28.950> peyote<00:04:29.160> stitch<00:04:29.490> you

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
just like the one drop peyote stitch you

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.710 
just like the one drop peyote stitch you
now<00:04:30.210> have<00:04:30.510> 3<00:04:31.020> rows<00:04:31.290> 1<00:04:31.890> 2<00:04:32.340> 3<00:04:32.730> that<00:04:33.360> are<00:04:33.450> stitched

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
now have 3 rows 1 2 3 that are stitched

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.990 
now have 3 rows 1 2 3 that are stitched
on<00:04:33.930> to<00:04:34.470> your<00:04:34.590> peyote<00:04:34.890> stitch<00:04:35.070> so<00:04:35.550> keep<00:04:35.730> that<00:04:35.850> in

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
on to your peyote stitch so keep that in

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.400 
on to your peyote stitch so keep that in
mind<00:04:36.210> when<00:04:36.480> you're<00:04:36.600> following<00:04:36.810> any<00:04:37.140> of<00:04:37.260> your

with<00:04:40.650> our<00:04:40.680> 1<00:04:41.010> drop<00:04:41.280> peyote<00:04:41.490> stitch<00:04:41.850> our<00:04:42.180> two

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
with our 1 drop peyote stitch our two

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.390 
with our 1 drop peyote stitch our two
drop<00:04:42.990> peyote<00:04:43.200> stitch<00:04:43.500> will<00:04:43.770> work<00:04:43.950> the<00:04:44.160> exact

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
drop peyote stitch will work the exact

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.640 
drop peyote stitch will work the exact
same<00:04:44.430> way<00:04:44.669> when<00:04:45.060> adding<00:04:45.510> that<00:04:45.840> third<00:04:46.110> row<00:04:46.380> I

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
same way when adding that third row I

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.470 
same way when adding that third row I
flipped<00:04:47.370> my<00:04:47.460> work<00:04:47.700> around<00:04:47.970> so<00:04:48.120> that<00:04:48.150> you<00:04:48.330> can

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
flipped my work around so that you can

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.870 
flipped my work around so that you can
see<00:04:48.750> exactly<00:04:49.050> what<00:04:49.320> I'm<00:04:49.380> talking<00:04:49.740> about<00:04:49.950> this

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
see exactly what I'm talking about this

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.850 
see exactly what I'm talking about this
is<00:04:51.060> where<00:04:51.180> we<00:04:51.300> came<00:04:51.450> out<00:04:51.600> in<00:04:51.810> the<00:04:52.470> previous

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
is where we came out in the previous

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.800 
is where we came out in the previous
segment<00:04:53.280> these<00:04:54.030> are<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.270> two<00:04:54.450> seed<00:04:54.780> beads

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
segment these are the two seed beads

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.330 
segment these are the two seed beads
that<00:04:55.080> I<00:04:55.169> stitched<00:04:55.470> on<00:04:55.680> and<00:04:55.919> then<00:04:56.070> I<00:04:56.100> went

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
that I stitched on and then I went

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.090 
that I stitched on and then I went
through<00:04:56.430> these<00:04:57.000> two<00:04:57.270> white<00:04:57.540> seed<00:04:57.810> beads<00:04:58.100> so

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
through these two white seed beads so

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.159 
through these two white seed beads so
for<00:04:59.520> the<00:04:59.610> most<00:04:59.790> part<00:04:59.940> threading<00:05:00.840> through<00:05:00.990> in<00:05:01.110> a

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
for the most part threading through in a

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:02.990 
for the most part threading through in a
straight<00:05:01.440> line<00:05:01.470> but<00:05:02.160> because<00:05:02.520> like<00:05:02.850> before

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
straight line but because like before

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.960 
straight line but because like before
these<00:05:03.720> seed<00:05:04.050> beads<00:05:04.320> are<00:05:04.650> staggered<00:05:05.220> this<00:05:05.790> will

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
these seed beads are staggered this will

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.330 
these seed beads are staggered this will
raise<00:05:06.210> some<00:05:06.630> of<00:05:07.470> your<00:05:07.650> seed<00:05:07.890> beads<00:05:08.100> these

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
raise some of your seed beads these

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.220 
raise some of your seed beads these
black<00:05:08.610> seed<00:05:08.850> beads<00:05:09.090> up<00:05:09.270> a<00:05:09.390> bit<00:05:09.570> leaving<00:05:10.140> an

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
black seed beads up a bit leaving an
