alright<00:00:21.779> here<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.019> are<00:00:22.079> with<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.380> next<00:00:22.619> step

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:22.829 
alright here we are with the next step

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:24.740 
alright here we are with the next step
after<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.460> went<00:00:23.730> ahead<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.000> performed<00:00:24.630> the

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
after we went ahead and performed the

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.140 
after we went ahead and performed the
battery<00:00:25.079> destination<00:00:25.589> at<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.220> acid<00:00:26.640> put<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
battery destination at the acid put the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.089 
battery destination at the acid put the
seal<00:00:27.359> on<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:28.410> went<00:00:28.619> ahead<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.919> checked

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
seal on it you went ahead and checked

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.359 
seal on it you went ahead and checked
for<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.820> power<00:00:30.029> we<00:00:30.449> got<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.809> good<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.369> we're

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
for the power we got that good and we're

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.759 
for the power we got that good and we're
on<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.610> lit<00:00:32.759> up<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.300> if<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.870> want<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.590> little

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:34.769 
on the lit up so if you want it a little

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:37.490 
on the lit up so if you want it a little
tougher<00:00:35.129> here<00:00:36.140> headlights<00:00:37.140> everything's

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
tougher here headlights everything's

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.420 
tougher here headlights everything's
working<00:00:37.829> we<00:00:37.920> got<00:00:38.070> good<00:00:38.220> power<00:00:39.829> alright<00:00:40.829> next

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
working we got good power alright next

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.450 
working we got good power alright next
step<00:00:41.870> just<00:00:42.870> put<00:00:43.050> together<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.530> frame<00:00:44.159> for<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
step just put together the frame for the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.160 
step just put together the frame for the
rooftop<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:45.390> pretty<00:00:45.659> much<00:00:45.780> four<00:00:45.960> pieces

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
rooftop it's pretty much four pieces

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.790 
rooftop it's pretty much four pieces
self-explanatory<00:00:46.970> the<00:00:47.970> two<00:00:48.180> crossbars<00:00:48.800> go

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
self-explanatory the two crossbars go

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.560 
self-explanatory the two crossbars go
together<00:00:49.920> with<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.370> socket<00:00:50.579> heads<00:00:50.879> adding

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
together with the socket heads adding

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.619 
together with the socket heads adding
keys<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.050> adding<00:00:52.440> screws<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.890> nuts<00:00:53.480> put<00:00:54.480> them

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
keys and adding screws and nuts put them

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.660 
keys and adding screws and nuts put them
all<00:00:54.690> together<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.170> then<00:00:55.500> we're<00:00:55.710> at<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.280> next

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
all together and then we're at the next

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.040 
all together and then we're at the next
phase<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:56.879> pretty<00:00:57.210> much<00:00:57.329> just<00:00:57.539> supporting<00:00:57.960> it

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
phase is pretty much just supporting it

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.090 
phase is pretty much just supporting it
and<00:00:58.460> just<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.719> 78<00:01:00.719> on<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.960> frame<00:01:01.170> getting<00:01:01.949> nice

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
and just a 78 on the frame getting nice

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.410 
and just a 78 on the frame getting nice
and<00:01:02.129> secure<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.730> then<00:01:02.850> we're<00:01:03.120> gonna<00:01:03.210> go<00:01:03.359> ahead

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
and secure and then we're gonna go ahead

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:34.719 
and secure and then we're gonna go ahead
and<00:01:03.510> stall<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.929> hardware<00:01:04.259> now

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:49.870 

so<00:01:35.729> Sammy<00:01:36.470> we're<00:01:37.470> done<00:01:37.680> with<00:01:37.830> the<00:01:39.020> seatbelts

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.899 

the<00:01:50.630> last<00:01:50.840> step<00:01:51.110> is<00:01:51.409> the<00:01:51.560> roof<00:01:53.440> easy<00:01:54.440> to<00:01:54.710> mount

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
the last step is the roof easy to mount

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:02.530 
the last step is the roof easy to mount
normal<00:01:55.909> is<00:01:56.030> done<00:01:56.210> here<00:01:57.790> fantastic

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.120

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:26.609 
this is a final step on assembly of the

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.539 
this is a final step on assembly of the
cargo<00:02:27.030> bed<00:02:27.650> pretty<00:02:28.650> basic<00:02:28.829> pretty<00:02:29.219> much<00:02:29.400> what

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
cargo bed pretty basic pretty much what

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:30.740 
cargo bed pretty basic pretty much what
we<00:02:29.640> did<00:02:29.819> here<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.269> hardware<00:02:30.599> that<00:02:30.629> we

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
we did here the hardware that we

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.110 
we did here the hardware that we
discussed<00:02:31.459> we<00:02:32.459> went<00:02:32.609> here<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.760> put<00:02:32.939> it<00:02:33.030> in

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
discussed we went here to put it in

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.690 
discussed we went here to put it in
there<00:02:33.299> and<00:02:34.139> that<00:02:34.200> goes<00:02:34.500> with<00:02:34.859> a<00:02:35.040> cotter<00:02:35.459> pin

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
there and that goes with a cotter pin

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.729 
there and that goes with a cotter pin
and<00:02:35.849> then<00:02:36.689> the<00:02:36.780> dampener<00:02:37.200> spinning<00:02:37.500> we<00:02:37.560> just

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
and then the dampener spinning we just

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.490 
and then the dampener spinning we just
go<00:02:37.859> on<00:02:38.329> install<00:02:39.329> the<00:02:39.480> washer<00:02:39.719> and<00:02:40.019> a<00:02:40.230> separate

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
go on install the washer and a separate

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.949 
go on install the washer and a separate
cotter<00:02:40.680> pin<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.969> allows<00:02:42.000> us<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.420> come<00:02:42.689> up<00:02:42.840> and

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
cotter pin that allows us to come up and

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.920 
cotter pin that allows us to come up and
down<00:02:43.079> with<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.489> go<00:02:44.489> freely<00:02:44.939> really<00:02:45.599> basic

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
down with it go freely really basic

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.720 
down with it go freely really basic
really<00:02:46.079> simple<00:02:46.530> all<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:47.400> hardware's

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
really simple all the hardware's

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.300 
really simple all the hardware's
included<00:02:48.299> it's<00:02:48.450> already<00:02:48.750> there

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
included it's already there

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.369

pre-installed just remove them put the

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.589 
pre-installed just remove them put the
cotter<00:02:52.620> pins<00:02:52.889> in<00:02:53.099> bend<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.819> tabs<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.389> you're

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
cotter pins in bend the tabs and you're

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:55.360 
cotter pins in bend the tabs and you're
good<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.870> go
