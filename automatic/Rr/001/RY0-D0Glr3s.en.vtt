00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 so hello everyone I really like the theme 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:07.919
 tied to the floor banks i love such 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.429
 charging love them because the fault with 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.440
 childhood, I left a shortage 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:16.820
 electricity when you take the player 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.230
 musical when you take it there 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.960
 go to bed the same 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.320
 the city there by car by train and on 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.570
 plane and you have but not enough charge 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.449
 you are in full swing when you have nothing to do 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.579
 and you have time and the charge ends so I 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.329
 Now very often I buy it all 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.760
 charging from solar energy and today 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.879
 for the first time on my channel charging from 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.590
 xiaomi not charging powerman let's car 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:51.449
 calmly he came to the site tinydeal 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:56.370
 Came quickly enough to open all 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:59.180
 what was more of course this and so 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.879
 there is nothing else for sure there is nothing 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.790
 can we recruit it from us xiaomi 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.040
 so here it is necessary to keep comic con 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.030
 camera today a little setting one 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.180
 according to 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.890
 too sayak can shoot light 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:21.509
 bright xiaomi at 5000 milliamp hours 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:24.509
 Thin on the shadow of the ideal was just 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.350
 some taste he handed out and I him 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.180
 took advantage of thinking why should I buy a 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:36.060
 xiaomi nothing like that 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:41.549
 besides the router we have instructions on 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:44.840
 in Chinese and here we have clearly 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:48.060
 drawn that where we can check 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.159
 are we a real bank cook or not 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:56.479
 I will do it if I want 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:02:00.090
 so we have it here 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:04.430
 comes off cool for the first time see 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:08.789
 Here is such a thing closed still include 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:12.140
 stunned they are not full not full charge 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:16.590
 charge us here and so one 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.900
 exit and look 5000 milliamp hours not 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.989
 I know you can see or not here 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.260
 5000 milliamper hours here we have 33,100 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:29.610
 milliamp hours I mean that 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.650
 most likely five is supposedly the maximum 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.349
 calculated from the street example of what 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:39.299
 plus provide a 3,300 this 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:45.090
 more or less real 1 size and yusb 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:48.359
 the port gives us 2 and 1 amp 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:52.319
 you're the same well, I'll start it now 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:55.530
 test in this video today you and 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:58.079
 You learn how to be as real and scored 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.859
 while i like to tell you i am here 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:03.120
 recently stumbled upon a conal novel he 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:06.030
 engaged in professional 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.940
 testing such u power bank of 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.840
 collects stands quite interesting and 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.690
 he was not on his fingers trying to explain from 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.260
 To be honest, I was very busy and did not understand 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.450
 but now I look in some episodes 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.940
 dedicated to powerbank and he didn't try 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.639
 explain why all the same here this 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.579
 the number does not correspond to what 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:32.190
 we have a phone running on such a battery 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.799
 charging so that a reference in the description 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.290
 You can go and see and I went 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.389
 test and so i missed this 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.480
 powerbank is quite interesting 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:45.359
 result but a little now is not about that 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.579
 by the way my sound has changed to 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:50.099
 Unfortunately the sound I have not signed up with 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:53.160
 this microphone in the past past 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:55.319
 cut but okay so i wanted 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.970
 would you show what dimensions of this 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.120
 powerbank and when u tested it 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:05.810
 I drove very straight surprised these 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:09.329
 sizes from my phone ulefone be one 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.819
 5 5 inches screen and that's what size 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:16.720
 this power bank i mean it somewhere 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:18.970
 inches 4 strong raids but maybe 5 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.070
 here such as a thin telefonchik it 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.590
 you can safely put 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.560
 back pockets like iphone won't bend 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.050
 because good enough good 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.700
 here we have four bulbs 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:36.400
 they start to fade as far as 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:40.360
 charge completion ie from 4 and to 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.180
 one and quietly flashes at night it does not 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.850
 straining in well see from the floor a little 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.230
 which is very convenient but when charging they 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.760
 naturally blink in the opposite direction 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:54.700
 I also deleted this number here. 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:58.750
 affairs while testing drove rendered that on 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:01.060
 tinydeal yes it turned out it turned out that 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.820
 on that did this time the original bank 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.500
 it's very good and I also wanted 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.710
 tell all the same about 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.390
 Testing I drove it for two days 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:16.450
 don't worry about me being the same 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:20.250
 T-shirt was washing and so I drove it two 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:22.540
 days to discharge and charge what turned out 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:26.250
 charges the bank takes 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:28.570
 energy according to yusb doctor naturally takes 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.840
 4600 milliampere hours 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:35.590
 merges about 4200 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.300
 plus or minus five thousand mA can 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:42.160
 being here basically is 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:44.740
 but on the lost ride the doctor I charged 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.870
 first and the tablet then charged the phone 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.840
 some losses are visible but not 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:52.090
 less powerbank original buy 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.000
 can its price not be so big 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:59.680
 the most important thing is the dimensions I have 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.669
 since the bank for 3 thousand it is 6000 meters 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.890
 confused and it is much bigger and thicker and not 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:08.020
 always its convenient to put back pocket 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:10.419
 from somewhere to take this 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:14.320
 powerbank buy a reference 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:17.140
 under the video also about testing 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:20.550
 crib too go to the channel i 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:22.760
 I will collect the same stand for testing 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.070
 such power bank of to 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.500
 get more interesting results already 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:30.200
 Sergei was signed with you 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.750
 video channel and I can ask you 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.450
 if you use some kind of powerbank 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.730
 or would like me to take on 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:39.860
 testing some of the pore banks 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:42.320
 please leave comments under 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.140
 I will definitely listen to this video 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:48.020
 I'll count and decide so that I can 

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:51.160
 purchase video reviews and 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.160
 show you bye
