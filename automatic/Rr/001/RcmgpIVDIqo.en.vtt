00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:56.790
 although we always say up to 5 kg 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:59.680

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.580
 so few people in here just to the 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.030

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:08.220
 what do we have to ffm freak that is 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:11.860
 Small again and then plan out 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:15.390
 only so much the Swiss big yes one 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:20.440
 really we still sweat shines on tv 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.930
 So now , like me, I've reached it 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.720
 I'm not told now in the video 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.940
 a banner appears or 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.400
 an overlay that has the love n7 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.269
 domenico made then can you as well 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.480
 you cool 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:36.610
 just like the intro and you see 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.500
 now on the top left against nico 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.140
 that will be natural and right 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.260
 Apply for a bad one because you 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.560
 yes just watched so important 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.450
 now the votings are not coming up 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.000
 the main video so you can come 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.860
 not vote for the better there 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.030
 but you wanted to be in the end of it 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.250
 the video of the contest battle demir 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.200
 left or right on the video clicks 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.200
 So on the left you come to the commentator 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.630
 and right to that there will be everything 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.130
 counted or likes of likes 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.860
 and of course the comments 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.180
 comments have no influence at all 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.040
 that means you have to go then anyway 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.500
 go on an external video on it where 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:26.609
 you vote for him that's all 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.609
 important that is in any case know 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.590
 brought to 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:35.500
 So I guess we'll solve it now 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:39.640
 Just look at who's the first one here 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.049
 to make battle may not be sad 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.730
 if you are not there but that is 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.380
 the life that is all here by chance 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.700
 him with no preference but somehow 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.350
 befriend that with me or not it 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.940
 No one is preferred, that is you 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.970
 Become by chance now 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:55.730
 and we have the first one 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:59.280
 he is mister gumbo 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.440
 He is the first applicant I will 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.880
 should contact them now via skype 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:09.630
 he would not be there then yes that would be 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:13.110
 Bad for him, I think so and times 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.090
 the second applicant is then moment if 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.070
 now this mister khumbu is not 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.420
 then reports a new one is drawn and 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.180
 the other who has reported 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.440
 Nevertheless, the applicants were still so 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:27.840
 the next one will be 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:32.150
 tirex or tricks as he always does 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.200
 May call with the tm mark behind it 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.730

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.380
 videoclip comes her to the respective 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.080
 you can then picture you 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.530

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.530
