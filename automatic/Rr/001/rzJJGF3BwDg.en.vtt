00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hey people today i'll show you this 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.140
 hairstyles this makeup I saw 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.120
 have lydia in the series team throw 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.620
 And it's such a small practical 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.639
 cool video if you have these hairstyles 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.639
 easy in the morning 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.430
 let's start with the makeup to use as 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.800
 i first take my concealer and wear 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.420
 him then and in my eyes and there 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.420
 where I let him need yours 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.480
 then I use my brother 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:43.060
 and then this call in color rosbach 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.830
 and then you bear on mine one could 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.830
 on fairly spacious 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:57.600
 and then I use my lax 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.460
 and then asks something about the job 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.559
 also quite spacious and then 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.559
 I use my eyebrow pencil 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.910
 with my eyebrows a bit 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.910
 look completely 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.200
 all the products that I use I 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.590
 I'll write you again in the 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.359
 infobox on 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.770
 and now i start with my eyes 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:24.719
 make up so I use it first 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:30.960
 All this light brown tone and traction 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:32.759
 on my mobile lid on something 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.289
 darker brown tone but still 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.300
 quite bright and only starts in 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.060
 monster 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.060
 movable goes on in his 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.060
 semicircular shape 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.470
 as you see 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.760
 then I use this a little reddish 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.760
 do brown 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.099
 and asks in a line about my bank 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.099
 runs on 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.450
 then it is worth this white and wear 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.890
 in the inner corner of the eye 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.440
 and then this very dark brown thing 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.330
 I then again only on the line 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.670
 Apply and this time but also 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.670
 at the bottom of the case in the application 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.370
 there you should do more then that 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.280
 outer edge on the question than on the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.930
 inner and if a little too much 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.460
 applied that messi to the whole thing 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.940
 you can look the whole with one 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:45.110
 celebrate a bit of white t-shirt and 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.110
 then I use my most kohl 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.000
 request for my waterline 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.750
 and forms mascara and empty 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.520
 always has a lot on it 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.520
 really stressed her eyes 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.349
 in 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.940
 and he is also known for being 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.390
 often wears lipstick and I'm here 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.380
 used these pinks in the pen and 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.430
 then came on it then my glass on 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.700
 and that at all with the make-up already 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.710
 finished and now we come to the hairstyle 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.730
 the 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.239
 you need it for that 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.239
 a middle parting 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.680
 you take one at the top of one page 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.680
 small tear away 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.830
 Do it a bit further down 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.209
 and these two strands plead for 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.209
 each other away from the face 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.250
 and I will continue to do that 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.050
 every time you do that 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.100
 two face each shot has take 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.100
 her front a few hairs with 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.480
 and all that takes about four 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.480
 five times 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.960
 then you take with you 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.120
 and does not turn but uses 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:18.950
 then he was third for the 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:23.079
 basis of a flash mob and this braid 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.079
 braid or simply back further 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.410
 you do all this until the 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.410
 braid for about as long as this is here 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.760
 behind the one with her head reached and 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.180
 The same thing you do with the other 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.180
 page 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.819
 again two strands take the 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.860
 wrap around each other and front each one because of it 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:50.860
 always take a few 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.390
 and then later all the braid 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.650
 u 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.360
 then you both take a lot of zeal 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.639
 make this 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.870
 take a harmony and fasten 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:10.870
 this together 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.340
 m 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.790
 This is how the hairstyle looks and you see 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.960
 that she is beautifully screwed in front and 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.670
 maybe a bit further back 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.950
 is made 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:50.620
 by lydia has this hairstyle in the wake 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.270
 wears straight hair resp 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.460
 she did not put down the typical 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.140
 Lydia hairstyle is just that she has many 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.460
 lure or report and therefore have 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.019
 I then go to the hairstyle then just 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.889
 still tempted 

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:03.389
 I have a pretty big one for that 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.639
 Part my hair around the curling iron 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:07.110
 wound 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:10.159
 because i just use this casual with 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.159
 wanted to have balls 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:48.350
 then I'm still infected without 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:50.090
 you know of course not 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:53.480
 actually good luck and 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:56.410
 then again a few bugs but the one 

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.410
 keep a little longer 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.440
 and then the hairstyle is actually too 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.440
 already finished 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.410
 but that was still very strong in the 

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.670
 looks like the song is yes her hair 

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:17.310
 still very 

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:18.900
 yes, that's why I'm pulling 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.810
 me just here a few small ones 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.770
 Strive out and clarify here more with the 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.790
 still a bit through the hands 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.870
 hair with it all a bit 

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.870
 looks loosened up 

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.870
 high 

00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:44.950
 Use the hairstyle and I hope 

00:07:42.869 --> 00:07:48.750
 you like this video 

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.750
