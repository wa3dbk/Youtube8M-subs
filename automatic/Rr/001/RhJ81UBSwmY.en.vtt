 do not not entertainment french studios 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.769
 irresponsible to remember me 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.460
 they present a new proposal called 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:19.160
 life is strange this time episodic and in 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.290
 format download if remember I was 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.779
 more focused on the action this new 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.300
 product is more like work 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.519
 from the game the conversation 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.070
 predominates over the action in this first 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.720
 episode in which we basically take 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.269
 contact with the protagonist and her 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.210
 powers and gives us brushstrokes of what is 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:39.829
 the plot of the game life is strange we 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.140
 tells the story of marks a 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.790
 student of photography that suddenly

 discover that he has the power to do 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.309
 go back in time this will leave you a 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.440
 little out of the game trying to understand 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.239
 what is happening to him at the same time 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.590
 begins to master the use of time to 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.050
 change conversations with others 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.449
 characters and solve certain actions or 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.469
 modify the facts by taking one or the other 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.329
 decision 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.640
 the actions of macs have 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.280
 consequences either in your relationship for 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.840
 with others or unchaining some u 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.939
 other events 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.159
 this adventure is located in arcadia bay 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.200
 city ​​where the five will happen 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.810
 predicted episodes of this story 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.789
 this first focuses a large part of his 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.479
 duration in the facilities of the 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.670
 academy 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.649
 blackwell residence of studies where 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.810
 Max is related to his peers and 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.850
 teachers is in this educational center 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.829
 where we will start to make the 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.289
 first manipulations over time 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.569
 from a conversation to more facts 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.880
 Highlights for the player to leave 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:39.829
 getting used to the mechanics at the beginning 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.110
 we make small changes in some 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:45.259
 conversation although there are facts 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.599
 highlights that already mark the future of 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.909
 game this proposal forces us to 

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:52.219
 listen or read carefully all the 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.679
 possible information some banal and other 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:57.319
 more useful as well as look at so many 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.390
 details as we can the exploration is 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.409
 important in this game moving around 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.709
 the different corridors and rooms 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.939
 that we visited in this first chapter 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:06.950
 engage in conversation with as many 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.750
 we can also show the rich 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.640
 fan of characters and their characters 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.290
 that will give us more 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.880
 information to use at the time of 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.950
 rewind time 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.200
 in the upper left we have 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.760
 the rewind spiral with the trigger 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.400
 left rear is with which 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.980
 we rewind speeding up its speed with 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.810
 the other trigger in some occasions in 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.270
 this spiral appear small dots 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.240
 key indicating that there we can already 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.530
 change part of the events if 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.330
 we reach the end of the spiral 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.240
 we will do the whole situation again 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.070
 again from the beginning depending 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.410
 of what we want to change we will stop in 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.540
 one of the points in another or none 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.460
 it will be usual to talk to a character and 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.410
 give the wrong answer so that 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.270
 give us clues of what to do to earn us 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.950
 the confidence of that character and 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.800
 rewind back to return it to 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.170
 do as well as redo several times a 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.140
 same situation to see how it evolves 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.150
 or it varies thanks to this new power max 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.420
 is opening up to others helping 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.370
 both an important fact unites 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.230
 much to chloe with whom he has a 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.850
 friendship that will evolve in 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.410
 successive chapters 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.270
 will be from the second chapter 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.980
 when we will begin to deepen the 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.530
 plot indicated by the developers 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.810
 the demise of rachel 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.580
 amber about three hours that lasts 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.530
 this first chapter are developed to a 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.140
 rhythm very similar to that of the games of 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.760
 telltale games with lots of conversation and 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.800
 interaction with some objects of 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.010
 environment replacing the quick time 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.090
 events for the moments of rewinding 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.830
 although normally a first episode 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.690
 It is usually an introduction to history 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.580
 complete the characters that the 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.160
 make up the advance in this first 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.050
 contact seems to us somewhat slow and 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.660
 has offered a little more hook 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.640
 important things happen and at the end 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.400
 this first chapter and observe everything 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.050
 what we have done and the decisions made 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.210
 we will see that they are many but has been missing 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.980
 that point that causes us the desire to 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.260
 face the next chapter that does not 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.360
 will arrive until March a small 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.090
 sequence after the credits tells us 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.440
 that there will be more spark in the second if 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.120
 we have indicated how is the gameplay 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.400
 we speak now of his visual section 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.590
 although he remembers a lot the style of 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.060
 of walking dead '10 of the cte el game el 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.580
 design of the characters and 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.359
 scenarios is based on textures 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.090
 drawn 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.219
 by hand giving it a very particular look 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.439
 the look is interesting and eye-catching 

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:27.050
 and the animations of the characters are 

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:29.419
 natural and fluid all based on 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.310
 the use of the unreal engine there are moments of 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.110
 great visual beauty and others in which 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.930
 we do not see the objects so clearly 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.430
 as you would expect, take out your own 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.490
 conclusion with those images that 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.930
 belong to the version of ps 4 a 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.819
 aspect that is going to take many 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.909
 criticism is that the game is in English 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:49.280
 with English subtitles again we 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:49.639
 remember traveler styles so if you 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.889
 do not 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.379
 anders have this language then you will have it 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.120
 a little raw to follow the thread the 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:58.069
 interpretations have their hook with 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.979
 voices that emphasize moods 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:03.080
 variables of the different characters the 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.150
 soundtrack with modern folk touches 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.759
 house very well with the room of the 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.129
 title many things will happen in this 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.900
 game over the five chapters 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.759
 at the moment max has already shown us 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.099
 because she is the protagonist of it 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.900
 and what does his power 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:19.879
 good start though a little looser than 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.560
 what is expected for some developers 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:24.129
 that always get rid of what 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.129
 conventional
