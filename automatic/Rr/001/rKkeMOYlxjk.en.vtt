00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hi to all and presence here today 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.160
 do you a tutorial to put the 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.510
 sound in gta san andreas 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.929
 often the cracked versions you have 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:17.490
 put the dark in cinematics neither 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.410
 radio nor the voice of the characters during 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.970
 their car dialogues 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.570
 today he explained how to hand over 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.580
 the sounds of cinematics the radios and 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.260
 the radios because I did not find 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.390
 session third problem is 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.890
 by the way if you have it I would like 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.950
 although you put it in the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.170
 comments would help me a lot 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:40.460
 because it's annoying to have to 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.510
 lead and although at the same time so 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:48.030
 started but a first with 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:50.390
 discretion so mediafire you do from 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.390
 the Aude 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:05.690
 so that my old computer has it so 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:09.010
 do not listen to the ad of course so I 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:12.770
 look at it is the download 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:22.270
 so it's parentis eyes heavy clue 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:22.270
 on 127 megabyte not heavy so 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:36.250
 here you want to download and a 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.320
 time so we're fine because I 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.430
 already so once you have 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:54.340
 downloaded you put a folder of a 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:55.690
 okay office after so wait so 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.330
 so here you go 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.789
 excuse me so you have a file 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.899
 like that in the euro have reported a 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.550
 audio arm tune normally hand to 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.830
 train but since I already made the 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.820
 manipulation is no longer and you 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.500
 put it here so a site to mater 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.230
 radio so that's going to be easy so 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.810
 since here at these words serve 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.209
 there all the records by giving these are 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.720
 radios those who would not doubt so 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.640
 without the radios of which you go so 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.010
 full of the dysfunction so to you of 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.890
 you do a quick cons you 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.960
 put a door like name the address 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.140
 E-mail 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.800
 below which is not confirmed 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.350
 by email 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:45.180
 and here you are download so 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.810
 it's very fast registration to as I 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.290
 tell you you're celebrating germans free 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.290
 as much as 20 seconds 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.280
 so very fast will ensue 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.200
 anything as not as address 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:09.620

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:09.620
 e-mail here is download this file 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:19.160
 so that will come out have seen 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.780
 I have my share 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.250
 so you go where your workshop 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:28.770
 sheet is therefore me in this case a 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:31.320
 attracted dandonneau so these little ones 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.530
 patches these little pages the radio 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.310
 public ferry or locker room for 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.410
 we will take 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:43.140
 and then there is danger size I got 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:48.320
 a little me who has 12 radios when I 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.320
 told one two three four five six 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.110
 or twelve 12 radios content with the 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.630
 Police and ambulances 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.970
 so we'll take one here so 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.150
 this is where to extract the 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.150
 files 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.000
 although I do not need to be with these 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.980
 names double click on it 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.830
 you take the little son he has until then 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:20.850
 we did not put in your office to the 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:24.990
 well posed for a small the city files 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.870
 like that can you expect small 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.470
 extraction phase 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.850
 here we could go back to 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:37.260
 that afterwards you are in the state are 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:41.640
 many to nÃ®mes audio pardon you are 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.440
 still auxerre you already see there 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.260
 so I say creeps and got 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:50.580

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.510
