around it looks like a Bristol car but I
don't<00:00:30.750> think<00:00:30.960> that's<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.170> way<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.380> go<00:00:31.730> see

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
don't think that's the way to go see

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.889 
don't think that's the way to go see
what<00:00:32.880> happens<00:00:33.149> your<00:00:33.239> hand<00:00:33.450> Junior<00:00:33.750> we're

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
that right rear quarter panel then

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.590 
that right rear quarter panel then
looked<00:00:46.980> like<00:00:47.100> hit<00:00:47.340> any<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:48.059> wheels<00:00:48.300> or

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.380 
I think his right rear is damaged he's
going<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.129> come<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.370> pit<00:00:53.520> road<00:00:53.730> or<00:00:53.850> wreck<00:00:54.059> you

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
hear him he says he feels like it has a

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.560 
hear him he says he feels like it has a
flat<00:00:55.949> tire<00:00:56.219> unless<00:00:56.640> he's<00:00:56.850> got<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.210> free<00:00:57.420> on
