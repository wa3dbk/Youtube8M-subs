00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.540
 tee 

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.500
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.500
 dare 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.520
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.980
 re you doing 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.710
 Another note rear 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:39.090
 It is also a place Asia to the called Nadeshiko Japan 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.260
 After all world convention not shown bad 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.839
 that 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:50.850
 Do this to themselves to Doshitemoko in the Well in to say that went to the final 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:52.740
 If there was a little hollow situation, it is said that it is Asia's Nozoshiko Japan 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.770
 While showing 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:01:03.780
 First, a large anti-prima facie way their softening barely in it 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:09.000
 If you get status , you will be very confident in Baba 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.390
 Well in that sense, if Asia and the world are going to make a big leap further in the future 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.060
 Than 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.060
 I think it is no doubt if it becomes a switch 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.440
 ni 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:29.220
 First of all that Aoko 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:33.330
 Application received Walcup and Rondo 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:40.170
 Well in the very experience I have this yet again 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:42.260
 During the four years from 2011, I feel that one person has grown very much. 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.120
 But a 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.140
 Foreign countries 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:51.380
 It is a reality that the country is also getting very high level 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.670
 Well that world has come up with that world 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:02:00.140
 Get 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:01.360
 It is about how much you can do as a team in the growing nadeshiko too 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.390
 With that 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:13.550
 In 2011, our team aimed to win the world championship , but 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:20.930
 Now that the whole of Japan has won , 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:22.590
 Well, in the back of how much we expect to be such top top 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.730
 The tournament 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:32.540
 It is also amazing to say that you can also do powder 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:36.490
 I think it's a big tournament that will give us the opportunity to grow further into our growth 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.050
 den's blog 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.450

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:46.650
 bl 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:52.390
 Mama Ma ah many times rivals where the country is 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:57.740
 There is a place, but also through our possibilities 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:00.650
 I do not know what will happen in the preparation stage from now 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.750
 I only have a good image 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.630
 There is a possibility if you feel it 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.620
 I believe in 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.620
