00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
I've said in numerous reviews I'm not a

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.140

big<00:01:06.630> fan<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.619> Black<00:01:08.580> Series<00:01:08.820> three

big fan of the Black Series three

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.030 
big fan of the Black Series three
three-quarter<00:01:09.630> inch<00:01:09.840> packaging<00:01:10.350> it's<00:01:10.830> very

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
three-quarter inch packaging it's very

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.429 
three-quarter inch packaging it's very
bleak<00:01:11.340> very<00:01:11.670> minimal<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.960> think<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.290> works

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
bleak very minimal and I think it works

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.620 
bleak very minimal and I think it works
much<00:01:13.710> better<00:01:13.740> for<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.369> six<00:01:14.580> inch<00:01:14.790> figures<00:01:15.150> and

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
much better for the six inch figures and

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.990 
much better for the six inch figures and

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
the fact that has Birchers to bring back

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.220 
the fact that has Birchers to bring back
weathering<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:44.939> that's<00:02:45.810> something<00:02:46.049> that

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
weathering and that's something that

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.530 
weathering and that's something that
they<00:02:46.409> stopped<00:02:46.769> doing<00:02:47.099> back<00:02:47.280> in<00:02:47.310> 2008<00:02:48.209> as<00:02:48.389> they

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
they stopped doing back in 2008 as they

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.140 
they stopped doing back in 2008 as they
said<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:48.840> wasn't<00:02:48.989> cost<00:02:49.319> effective<00:02:49.700> however<00:02:50.700> I

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
said it wasn't cost effective however I

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.089 
said it wasn't cost effective however I
think<00:02:51.569> whether<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.470> makes<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.769> world<00:02:52.919> of

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
think whether it makes a world of

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.530 
think whether it makes a world of
difference<00:02:53.159> to<00:02:53.639> action<00:02:53.939> figures<00:02:54.239> you<00:02:54.329> know<00:02:54.359> it

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.839 
difference to action figures you know it
really<00:02:54.720> does<00:02:55.049> add<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.709> sense<00:02:55.980> of<00:02:56.129> realism<00:02:56.459> and

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
really does add a sense of realism and

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.589
