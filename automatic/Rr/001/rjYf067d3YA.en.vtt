 looking for help from minas tirith 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.299

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.730
 the end of the world the roan knight 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.949
 nothing collides with the enemy 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.410
 telenor fields can withstand 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.630
 their fury besieged from everywhere by 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.669
 war machines and huge beasts i 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.070
 brave of teo dem have to survive 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:31.110
 to an endless horde of orcs and 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.149
 world air riders or the rim 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.170
 they will inflict serious damage on armies 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.180
 of sauron 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.180
 surely the sorcerer king will do it 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.350
 ahead of him his defeat 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.410
 it would change the fate of the battle 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.800
 since his followers would not hesitate 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.800
 to disappear 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:06.399
 we climb for ruin and for the end 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.399
 of the world 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:16.650
 I don't have to add the back lines 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.650
 force with the catapults to tighten 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.260
 remains a tower we destroy the 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.409
 those towers will no longer create us 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.409
 problems 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.310
 with the foot soldiers we must stop those monsters 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.310
 we attack there 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.829
 now I should meet we must fear them 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.310
 we slaughter the horizons there must 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:38.099
 to die 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.720
 we need not fear we may create there 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.720
 I have them all to die 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:21.489
 remains a tower we destroy the non 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.489
 we hesitate it remains only one footman 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.750
 you have been brave men of gondor 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.750
 meanwhile the elephants 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:21.730
 thyme was soon destroyed to me 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:21.730
 we need to get together you are yesterday to help 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.020
 we sleep assailing the sorcerer king 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.890
 face your fear men can 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:36.100
 being defeated we do not give in to fear 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:39.060
 we kill the sorcerer king I fight for 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.060
 the people of ron 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:30.220
 mestre the enemy flees in the throes of 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.220
 panic but windy 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.680
 But the clash is still uncertain least 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.690
 until the arrival of aragorn to the head 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.030
 of the gray army no being 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.580
 living can escape the fury of 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.740
 these warriors, however glorious 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.650
 may seem like a victory war is 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.080
 far from being the dark sire ended 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:58.050
 it is increasingly powerful within the way walls 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.449
 to ward off sauron's eye from the 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.460
 ring bearer will be necessary 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:04.710
 to sustain great sacrifices 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.160
 the men of the west must face it 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.780
 within its borders within its domains 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.320
 coming to attack the dark sire 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.320
 same
