what is it called the weight vest now at

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.019 
what is it called the weight vest now at
the<00:05:56.710> end<00:05:56.860> of<00:05:56.949> my<00:05:57.099> workouts<00:05:57.520> I'm<00:05:57.729> basically

going to be using my way to the best as
I<00:06:00.129> can<00:06:00.189> alternative<00:06:00.819> to<00:06:00.969> dumbbells<00:06:01.389> or

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:01.599 
I can alternative to dumbbells or

I can alternative to dumbbells or
barbells<00:06:02.139> like<00:06:02.680> the<00:06:02.830> basically<00:06:03.189> exercises

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:03.819 
barbells like the basically exercises

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:06.149 
barbells like the basically exercises
like<00:06:03.939> this<00:06:03.999> to<00:06:04.449> continue<00:06:04.659> to<00:06:05.469> burn<00:06:05.740> out<00:06:05.949> my

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:06.159 
like this to continue to burn out my

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:08.399 
like this to continue to burn out my
muscles<00:06:06.729> now<00:06:07.539> whether<00:06:07.840> a<00:06:07.990> lot<00:06:08.199> of<00:06:08.289> you<00:06:08.379> guys

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:08.409 
muscles now whether a lot of you guys

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:09.869 
muscles now whether a lot of you guys
want<00:06:08.740> to<00:06:08.800> believe<00:06:09.009> this<00:06:09.159> or<00:06:09.340> not<00:06:09.370> because<00:06:09.729> I

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:09.879 
want to believe this or not because I

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:12.119 
want to believe this or not because I
know<00:06:09.939> a<00:06:10.120> lot<00:06:10.360> of<00:06:10.419> guys<00:06:10.689> love<00:06:11.050> the<00:06:11.199> gym<00:06:11.499> but<00:06:11.889> just

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:12.129 
know a lot of guys love the gym but just

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:14.519 
know a lot of guys love the gym but just
realize<00:06:12.370> that<00:06:12.580> using<00:06:13.270> external<00:06:13.900> waist<00:06:14.319> like

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:14.529 
realize that using external waist like

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:17.040 
realize that using external waist like
dumbbells<00:06:14.919> and<00:06:15.129> barbells<00:06:15.189> is<00:06:15.699> way<00:06:16.419> easier

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
dumbbells and barbells is way easier

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.600 
dumbbells and barbells is way easier
than<00:06:17.110> doing<00:06:17.409> calisthenics<00:06:18.069> because<00:06:18.490> you

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
than doing calisthenics because you

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.519 
than doing calisthenics because you
could<00:06:18.789> actually<00:06:18.969> choose<00:06:19.449> your<00:06:19.719> intensity<00:06:20.259> a

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:20.529 
could actually choose your intensity a

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:22.469 
could actually choose your intensity a
lot<00:06:21.099> more<00:06:21.430> than<00:06:21.759> what<00:06:22.029> you're<00:06:22.120> going<00:06:22.240> to<00:06:22.300> count

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 
lot more than what you're going to count

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:24.269 
lot more than what you're going to count
Stelling<00:06:22.810> now<00:06:23.409> this<00:06:23.650> is<00:06:23.770> going<00:06:23.919> to<00:06:24.069> sound

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:24.279 
Stelling now this is going to sound

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:26.249 
Stelling now this is going to sound
harsh<00:06:24.699> but<00:06:24.789> just<00:06:25.270> understand<00:06:25.810> why<00:06:25.930> i'm<00:06:26.050> saying

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:26.259 
harsh but just understand why i'm saying

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:28.800 
harsh but just understand why i'm saying
if<00:06:26.560> you're<00:06:27.159> trying<00:06:27.400> to<00:06:27.520> bodybuilding<00:06:28.389> and

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
if you're trying to bodybuilding and

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.499 
if you're trying to bodybuilding and
you're<00:06:29.169> a<00:06:29.199> week<00:06:29.289> you<00:06:30.099> have<00:06:30.400> to<00:06:30.699> go<00:06:30.909> to<00:06:30.969> the<00:06:31.210> gym

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:31.509 
you're a week you have to go to the gym

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:34.110 
you're a week you have to go to the gym
for<00:06:32.500> example<00:06:33.009> some<00:06:33.279> of<00:06:33.310> you<00:06:33.520> guys<00:06:33.699> can't<00:06:34.029> even

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
for example some of you guys can't even

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.119 
for example some of you guys can't even
do<00:06:34.389> pull-ups<00:06:34.689> there's<00:06:35.139> even<00:06:35.319> some<00:06:35.650> big<00:06:35.889> people

00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:36.129 
do pull-ups there's even some big people

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:38.279 
do pull-ups there's even some big people
in<00:06:36.370> the<00:06:36.490> gym<00:06:36.759> lab<00:06:37.000> muscle<00:06:37.539> but<00:06:37.990> there's<00:06:38.169> still

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:38.289 
in the gym lab muscle but there's still

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:41.010 
in the gym lab muscle but there's still
too<00:06:38.800> weak<00:06:39.069> to<00:06:39.279> do<00:06:39.520> proper<00:06:39.939> pillows<00:06:40.300> so<00:06:40.810> they're

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
too weak to do proper pillows so they're

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.309 
too weak to do proper pillows so they're
forced<00:06:41.589> to<00:06:41.680> being<00:06:42.189> the<00:06:42.339> gym<00:06:42.610> and<00:06:42.759> use<00:06:43.330> wait<00:06:43.719> to

00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:44.319 
forced to being the gym and use wait to

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:45.869 
forced to being the gym and use wait to
build<00:06:44.529> their<00:06:44.710> muscle<00:06:45.099> because<00:06:45.550> you're<00:06:45.699> just

00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:45.879 
build their muscle because you're just

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:47.339 
build their muscle because you're just
not<00:06:46.029> strong<00:06:46.360> enough<00:06:46.419> to<00:06:46.750> actually<00:06:46.930> use<00:06:47.199> your

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:47.349 
not strong enough to actually use your

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:49.260 
not strong enough to actually use your
own<00:06:47.409> body<00:06:47.620> weight<00:06:47.860> it's<00:06:48.039> too<00:06:48.250> intense<00:06:48.430> it's

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
own body weight it's too intense it's

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.790 
own body weight it's too intense it's
too<00:06:49.539> much<00:06:49.719> weight<00:06:49.990> for<00:06:50.020> them<00:06:50.349> basically

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 
too much weight for them basically

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.559 
too much weight for them basically
that's<00:06:51.430> why<00:06:51.639> I'm<00:06:51.729> trying<00:06:51.879> to<00:06:52.029> tell<00:06:52.180> you<00:06:52.240> guys

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:52.569 
that's why I'm trying to tell you guys

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:55.230 
that's why I'm trying to tell you guys
that<00:06:52.629> using<00:06:53.589> your<00:06:53.710> body<00:06:53.919> weight<00:06:54.129> is<00:06:54.460> good

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 
that using your body weight is good

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.420 
that using your body weight is good
enough<00:06:55.569> to<00:06:56.020> build<00:06:56.229> muscle<00:06:56.680> once<00:06:57.129> you<00:06:57.279> get

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:57.430 
enough to build muscle once you get

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.040 
enough to build muscle once you get
strong<00:06:57.669> enough<00:06:57.819> like<00:06:58.089> for<00:06:58.240> example<00:06:58.330> I've<00:06:58.779> been

00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.050 
strong enough like for example I've been

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:00.959 
strong enough like for example I've been
doing<00:06:59.409> college<00:06:59.710> tanks<00:06:59.919> for<00:07:00.009> over<00:07:00.219> a<00:07:00.250> year<00:07:00.339> so

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:00.969 
doing college tanks for over a year so

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:02.490 
doing college tanks for over a year so
I'm<00:07:01.089> strong<00:07:01.509> enough<00:07:01.539> to<00:07:01.870> just<00:07:02.020> use<00:07:02.169> my<00:07:02.259> body

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:02.500 
I'm strong enough to just use my body

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.529 
I'm strong enough to just use my body
weight<00:07:02.770> and<00:07:02.889> add<00:07:03.430> more<00:07:03.819> weight<00:07:04.000> on<00:07:04.120> top<00:07:04.180> of

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:04.539 
weight and add more weight on top of

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:06.209 
weight and add more weight on top of
that<00:07:04.629> to<00:07:04.810> increase<00:07:05.080> the<00:07:05.229> intensity<00:07:05.500> because
