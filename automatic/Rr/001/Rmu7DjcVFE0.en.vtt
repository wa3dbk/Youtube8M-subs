hey this is mark for text rats calm
today<00:00:03.540> we're<00:00:03.750> going<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:03.929> be<00:00:03.990> starting<00:00:04.290> a<00:00:04.350> new

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
today we're going to be starting a new

today we're going to be starting a new
series<00:00:04.859> called<00:00:04.890> building<00:00:05.609> your<00:00:05.790> own<00:00:05.819> home

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
series called building your own home

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.450 
series called building your own home
network<00:00:06.859> it's<00:00:07.859> important<00:00:08.280> that<00:00:08.309> you

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
network it's important that you

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.580 
network it's important that you
understand<00:00:08.880> conceptually<00:00:09.360> what's<00:00:10.139> going<00:00:10.440> on

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
understand conceptually what's going on

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.730 
understand conceptually what's going on
from<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:10.920> top-down<00:00:11.160> view<00:00:11.960> I'm<00:00:12.960> using<00:00:13.440> this

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
from a top-down view I'm using this

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.560 
from a top-down view I'm using this
diagram<00:00:14.040> in<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.610> video<00:00:14.849> so<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.179> you<00:00:15.330> can

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
diagram in the video so that you can

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.349 
diagram in the video so that you can
kind<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.049> understand<00:00:16.560> what<00:00:17.490> exactly<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.060> going

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
kind of understand what exactly is going

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.269 
kind of understand what exactly is going
on<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.810> internet<00:00:18.840> connecting<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.890> modem

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
on the internet connecting to the modem

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.000 
on the internet connecting to the modem
then<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.550> modem<00:00:20.850> connecting<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.600> router

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
then the modem connecting to the router

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.890 
then the modem connecting to the router
and<00:00:23.010> then<00:00:23.189> all<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.430> devices<00:00:23.760> themselves<00:00:24.330> get

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
and then all the devices themselves get

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.800 
and then all the devices themselves get
connected<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.590> router<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.810> hopefully

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
connected to the router and hopefully

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.689 
connected to the router and hopefully
this<00:00:27.960> helps<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.289> break<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:29.010> habit<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.460> using

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
this helps you break the habit of using

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.820 
this helps you break the habit of using
references<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.689> pipes<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.260> tubes<00:00:31.470> when

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
references to pipes and tubes when

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.430 
references to pipes and tubes when
you're<00:00:31.949> talking<00:00:32.309> about<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.610> internet

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
you're talking about the internet

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.049 
you're talking about the internet
obviously<00:00:34.440> our<00:00:35.070> government<00:00:35.489> has<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> problem

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
obviously our government has a problem

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.880 
obviously our government has a problem
with<00:00:36.239> using<00:00:36.840> those<00:00:37.079> metaphors<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.800> it

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
with using those metaphors and it

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.160 
with using those metaphors and it
doesn't<00:00:38.190> exactly<00:00:38.550> pan<00:00:39.450> out<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.960> more

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
doesn't exactly pan out the more

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.930 
doesn't exactly pan out the more
advanced<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:40.920> get<00:00:41.550> into<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
advanced that you get into the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.229 
advanced that you get into the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
home by an Internet service provider or

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.139 
home by an Internet service provider or
ISP<00:00:54.120> for<00:00:54.719> short<00:00:55.309> now<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.370> problem<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.059> we

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
ISP for short now the problem is that we

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.939 
ISP for short now the problem is that we
have<00:00:57.329> multiple<00:00:57.719> devices<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.590> we<00:00:58.680> want<00:00:58.859> to

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
have multiple devices that we want to

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.310 
have multiple devices that we want to
connect<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.430> internet<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.030> if<00:01:00.870> your<00:01:01.020> ISP

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
connect to the internet so if your ISP

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.599 
connect to the internet so if your ISP
doesn't<00:01:01.739> provide<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.219> with<00:01:02.370> additional

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
doesn't provide you with additional

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.750 
doesn't provide you with additional
services<00:01:03.979> you'll<00:01:04.979> need<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.250> purchase<00:01:05.460> a

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
services you'll need to purchase a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.359 
services you'll need to purchase a
router<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.360> think<00:01:06.869> most<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.350> them<00:01:07.500> are<00:01:07.560> Wireless

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
router I think most of them are Wireless

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.480 
router I think most of them are Wireless
by<00:01:08.580> now<00:01:09.049> if<00:01:10.049> not<00:01:10.380> that's<00:01:10.619> okay<00:01:10.950> too<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.310> can

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
by now if not that's okay too you can

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.450 
by now if not that's okay too you can
you<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:12.090> connect<00:01:12.720> all<00:01:12.930> your<00:01:12.960> devices<00:01:13.460> except

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
you can connect all your devices except

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.960 
you can connect all your devices except
for<00:01:14.670> phones<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.360> stuff<00:01:15.509> like<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:16.400> via<00:01:17.400> cat5

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
for phones and stuff like that via cat5

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.039 
for phones and stuff like that via cat5
cable<00:01:19.369> so<00:01:20.369> basically<00:01:20.820> like<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.330> routers<00:01:21.689> role

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
cable so basically like the routers role

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.320 
cable so basically like the routers role
in<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.470> situation<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.430> basically<00:01:24.000> to

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
in this situation is basically to

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330 
in this situation is basically to
control<00:01:24.450> where<00:01:25.170> traffic<00:01:25.740> gets<00:01:25.950> sent<00:01:26.220> and

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
control where traffic gets sent and

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.940 
control where traffic gets sent and
received<00:01:26.750> if<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.930> want<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.170> think<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.650> in

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
received if you want to think of it in

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.210 
received if you want to think of it in
terms<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:30.200> directly<00:01:31.200> plugging<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.770> computer

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
terms of directly plugging a computer

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.460 
terms of directly plugging a computer
into<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> modem<00:01:32.970> there's<00:01:33.329> really<00:01:33.840> no<00:01:34.140> way<00:01:34.409> to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
into a modem there's really no way to

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.580 
into a modem there's really no way to
share<00:01:35.360> one<00:01:36.360> connection<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.470> have

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
share one connection so you have to have

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.520 
share one connection so you have to have
a<00:01:37.619> device<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.220> allows<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:39.200> to<00:01:40.200> share<00:01:40.350> those

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
a device that allows you to share those

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.380 
a device that allows you to share those
connections<00:01:41.070> which<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.430> exactly<00:01:41.939> what<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
connections which is exactly what the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.999 
connections which is exactly what the
router<00:01:42.680> aims<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.950> do<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.399> situation

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
router aims to do in this situation

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.899 
router aims to do in this situation
typically<00:01:47.009> your<00:01:47.220> router<00:01:47.430> comes<00:01:47.700> with

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
typically your router comes with

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.760 
typically your router comes with
instructions<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.720> how<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.110> supposed<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.619> be

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
instructions on how it's supposed to be

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.469 
instructions on how it's supposed to be

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
configured before you actually use it

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.780 
configured before you actually use it
but<00:01:52.170> more<00:01:52.409> often<00:01:52.590> than<00:01:52.829> not<00:01:52.890> these<00:01:53.280> directions

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790
