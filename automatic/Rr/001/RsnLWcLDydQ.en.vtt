00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.010
 we are the dialogue 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.010
 they point that out 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.560
 blankets 

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:14.339
 he said you can see here already 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.439
 Soybeans make the waves 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.179
 of the water 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.179
 you are very important that in henkel 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.159
 so for example the letter z 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:31.579
 his wife in the water 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.550
 my work that we have from reactor 2 not in the plane otherwise it's going to have 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.550
 effect 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.370
 in the year after being 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.120
 only team goal 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.490
 there are the waves 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.270
 if they look very little 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.990
 for that happens more is the pil 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.480
 the plane 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.659
 and there are who the reactor options 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:56.659
 this union we put a value of 5 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.820
 Ramos hertha and ascend to 1 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.470
 and there it is 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.890
 it's that simple 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.430
 for only the plan 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.430
 we do not lower our plan 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.560
 we go in the place of water and water day 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.560
 if we like the two of us we take out of the dinner 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.790
 we give country 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.840
 and it comes right 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.830
 idesa 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.420
 Now we are going to be a 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.530
 the material 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.530
 on the back of the material editor ejecting m 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.440
 and there we are going to get 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.440
 but what is sure 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.620
 let's change the open standard and sea 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.229
 around the corner of Colon he decided to assume a white 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:14.149
 in it was reflected we are going to put a 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:17.759
 a greeting 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:26.379

 now there is not even in the fraction we are going to choose a target 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:52.859
 we put a value now bakr yet 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.859
 with that material so that my daughter 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:58.759
 sos 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:03.169
 here in your division the reflection let's put a 50 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.249
 in none of its divisions of 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:10.589
 a reflection we are going to put a symbol 

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:13.219
 let's activate the box 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:14.279

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:29.549
 cnel 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:30.969
 relief 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:34.119
 you can only find where your net point sounded 

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:37.119
 in the design area 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.079
 this year my texture folder 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.139
 Latex efe tura 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.289
 the aa the relief preaches 

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:55.829
 that we are going to put out of it 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.159
 for the water that are made 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.159
 we go back and we're going to put a value from 8 to 15 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:06.990
 and in the reflection we are going to put a 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.990
 a value of 50 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:13.939
 it's a little here we have our latex turabo 

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:17.809
 we apply it to the plan 

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:24.509
 we are going to press is if it is for the reconfiguration of Friday of the twin 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:27.509
 of the old herrán engine 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.530
 if you use them you do not have it and 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.740
 we have it all of the virrey render engine 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.849
 activated topo of level 2 and the last thing in common 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.169
 the last the last tree 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.979
 and press on the three points 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.979
 here are mental faa and the default the viceroy 

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:58.120
 schueri you are going to lower the resolution of that because they enter that it does not take much 

00:04:58.119 --> 00:05:00.719
 we go to him 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:03.719

 they went from being a year 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.680
 do not worry that it appears top and sealed but 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:49.150
 that are realistic work 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.180
 I know what you can do a lot this video tutorials a fly in another edition 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.289
 base visa point less
