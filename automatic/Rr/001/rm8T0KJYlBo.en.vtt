you<00:02:28.290> know<00:02:28.350> gets<00:02:28.590> tackled<00:02:28.800> by<00:02:29.040> their<00:02:29.220> kicker<00:02:29.460> I

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
you know gets tackled by their kicker I

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.490 
you know gets tackled by their kicker I
think<00:02:30.480> that's<00:02:30.690> in<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.900> first<00:02:31.110> quarter<00:02:31.350> that's

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
think that's in the first quarter that's

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.400 
think that's in the first quarter that's
a<00:02:31.650> touchdown<00:02:32.010> on<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.160> kickoff<00:02:32.220> return<00:02:32.820> so

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
a touchdown on the kickoff return so

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.270 
a touchdown on the kickoff return so
unfortunately<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.590> you<00:02:34.860> know<00:02:34.950> they<00:02:35.070> ran<00:02:35.220> out

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.310 
they'd given up all year long but yeah
that's<00:02:56.790> that<00:02:57.120> doesn't<00:02:57.540> matter<00:02:57.690> you've<00:02:58.020> got<00:02:58.200> to

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
that's that doesn't matter you've got to

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.510 
that's that doesn't matter you've got to
score<00:02:58.530> more<00:02:58.680> than<00:02:58.739> that<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:59.010> beat<00:02:59.040> those<00:02:59.310> guys

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
score more than that to beat those guys

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.120 
score more than that to beat those guys
and<00:02:59.820> our<00:02:59.970> defense<00:03:00.440> we<00:03:01.440> made<00:03:01.620> some<00:03:01.800> mistakes

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
and our defense we made some mistakes

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.360 
and our defense we made some mistakes
obviously<00:03:02.670> we<00:03:02.790> didn't<00:03:03.030> play<00:03:03.150> great<00:03:03.360> but<00:03:04.290> if<00:03:04.830> we

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
obviously we didn't play great but if we

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.320 
obviously we didn't play great but if we
would<00:03:05.520> have<00:03:05.550> done<00:03:05.760> what<00:03:05.910> we<00:03:06.030> should<00:03:06.209> have<00:03:06.239> done

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
would have done what we should have done

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.420 
would have done what we should have done
on<00:03:06.510> offense<00:03:06.930> I<00:03:07.140> still<00:03:07.500> believe<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:08.100> know<00:03:08.190> even

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
on offense I still believe you know even

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.710 
on offense I still believe you know even
with<00:03:08.700> all<00:03:08.850> that<00:03:08.880> we<00:03:09.180> could<00:03:09.300> have<00:03:09.420> won<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.660> game

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.420 
with all that we could have won the game
and<00:03:10.050> it<00:03:10.110> wouldn't<00:03:10.320> have<00:03:10.410> got<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:11.040> wouldn't<00:03:11.310> got

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
and it wouldn't have got it wouldn't got

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.699 
and it wouldn't have got it wouldn't got
so<00:03:11.580> lopsided<00:03:11.790> there<00:03:12.239> late<00:03:12.420> either<00:03:12.570> they<00:03:13.530> could
