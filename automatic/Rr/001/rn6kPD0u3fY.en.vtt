00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.480
 llama spinach jumble with meat 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:18.020

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.020
 butter spinach 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.780
 like four potatoes cut into strips 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.570

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.360
 tablespoons of chicken salt consommé and 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.910
 pepper to taste we will start to 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.610
 put the potatoes with a bit of the 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.610
 butter and start sautéing 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.070
 ah 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:51.780
 since you have a little 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.620
 French fries not much canned 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.620
 and reservations 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:02.149
 and since you're already golden, you start 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.540
 to see the citing of the pope and as 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.850
 begins to brown once it is golden 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:11.740
 remember that we are going to 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.740
 to withdraw and reserve 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.020
 we can 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:25.610
 apart in that same pan we are going to 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.610
 sauté garlic onion 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.780
 the kitten the onion 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.150
 until the latter is transparent 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.820
 and the golden garlic if necessary add 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.910
 a little more butter once 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.760
 the onion is transparent and the garlic 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.270
 golden we will incorporate the 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.270
 spinach 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.270
 to begin to be soft 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.460
 once they are 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.149
 soft spinach let's add it to 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.149
 the cream 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.459

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:26.049

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.049
 equal taste the pepper 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.850
 and we are going to add them to the straws 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:37.220
 our children are already staying bolt 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:40.520
 now we lack the meat to incorporate 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:44.470
 cold the meat we are going to cut into pieces 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.470
 to incorporate it into the potatoes 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.730
 once you have them you have cut them in 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.480
 two cures or potatoes diaz is precisely 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.349
