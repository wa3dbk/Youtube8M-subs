think<00:01:32.590> people<00:01:32.709> selling<00:01:33.099> the<00:01:33.190> PlayStation<00:01:33.849> 3's

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
think people selling the PlayStation 3's

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.480 
think people selling the PlayStation 3's
now<00:01:34.360> because<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:35.319> playstation<00:01:35.920> network<00:01:35.950> is

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
now because the playstation network is

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.580 
now because the playstation network is
down<00:01:36.670> and<00:01:37.030> they<00:01:37.179> just<00:01:37.420> can't<00:01:37.750> wait<00:01:37.959> to<00:01:38.229> John

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
down and they just can't wait to John

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.800 
down and they just can't wait to John
back<00:01:38.800> on<00:01:38.950> black<00:01:39.130> ops<00:01:39.310> again<00:01:39.610> especially<00:01:40.179> since

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
back on black ops again especially since

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.990

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.980 
know I did find it quite surprising i
didn't<00:02:57.280> know<00:02:57.340> there's<00:02:57.550> still<00:02:57.670> as<00:02:58.090> much<00:02:58.150> hype

didn't know there's still as much hype
as<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.800> wars<00:02:59.980> at<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.250> beginning<00:03:00.460> of<00:03:00.810> black

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
as the wars at the beginning of black

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.750 
as the wars at the beginning of black
ops<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.350> i<00:03:02.500> thought<00:03:02.650> it<00:03:02.800> died<00:03:03.040> down<00:03:03.070> a<00:03:03.310> bit<00:03:03.460> but

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
ops and i thought it died down a bit but

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.400 
ops and i thought it died down a bit but
obviously<00:03:04.240> it<00:03:04.390> hasn't<00:03:04.540> which<00:03:04.930> is<00:03:05.140> you<00:03:05.380> know

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410

obviously it hasn't which is you know
still<00:03:05.830> shocking<00:03:06.250> surprising<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.150> it<00:03:08.080> teaches

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
still shocking surprising and it teaches

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.020 
still shocking surprising and it teaches
me<00:03:08.590> something<00:03:08.740> I<00:03:09.070> thought<00:03:09.250> more<00:03:09.730> people<00:03:09.760> would

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030

why<00:05:16.510> when<00:05:17.080> Cena's<00:05:17.560> found<00:05:17.800> out<00:05:17.980> about<00:05:18.100> it<00:05:18.220> you

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
why when Cena's found out about it you

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.280 
why when Cena's found out about it you
know<00:05:18.610> I<00:05:18.730> was<00:05:18.910> really<00:05:19.210> happy<00:05:19.390> and<00:05:19.870> that<00:05:20.140> was

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
know I was really happy and that was

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.810 
know I was really happy and that was
pretty<00:05:20.650> worth<00:05:20.890> it<00:05:21.160> well<00:05:21.340> then<00:05:21.460> when<00:05:21.610> i<00:05:21.640> made

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
pretty worth it well then when i made

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.550 
pretty worth it well then when i made
the<00:05:21.850> caves<00:05:22.120> one<00:05:22.390> he<00:05:22.900> didn't<00:05:23.140> find<00:05:23.260> out<00:05:23.440> about

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
the caves one he didn't find out about

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.770 
the caves one he didn't find out about
it<00:05:23.860> and<00:05:24.040> so<00:05:24.400> you<00:05:25.030> know<00:05:25.060> it<00:05:25.390> is<00:05:25.510> definitely

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
it and so you know it is definitely

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.960 
it and so you know it is definitely
worth<00:05:25.990> it<00:05:26.410> when<00:05:26.710> they<00:05:26.860> find<00:05:27.100> out<00:05:27.250> about<00:05:27.310> it<00:05:27.760> so

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
worth it when they find out about it so

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.660 
worth it when they find out about it so
if<00:05:28.270> you<00:05:28.780> want<00:05:29.080> me<00:05:29.200> to<00:05:29.410> make<00:05:29.680> it<00:05:30.100> sound<00:05:30.310> boards

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670 
if you want me to make it sound boards

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.640 
if you want me to make it sound boards
of<00:05:30.820> those<00:05:31.120> particular<00:05:31.510> commentators<00:05:32.230> then<00:05:32.470> do

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
of those particular commentators then do

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.440 
of those particular commentators then do
send<00:05:32.950> me<00:05:33.130> the<00:05:33.370> sound<00:05:33.730> clips<00:05:34.090> of<00:05:34.420> the

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
send me the sound clips of the

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.960 
send me the sound clips of the
particular<00:05:34.810> no<00:05:35.770> quotes<00:05:36.070> that<00:05:36.190> you<00:05:36.430> want<00:05:36.640> in<00:05:36.820> it

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
particular no quotes that you want in it

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.120 
particular no quotes that you want in it
and<00:05:37.210> then<00:05:37.330> that<00:05:37.480> will<00:05:37.630> help<00:05:37.660> me<00:05:38.140> produce<00:05:38.740> them

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
and then that will help me produce them

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.040 
and then that will help me produce them
much<00:05:39.310> faster<00:05:39.850> because<00:05:40.060> that<00:05:40.270> is<00:05:40.390> what<00:05:40.870> takes

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
much faster because that is what takes

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.990 
much faster because that is what takes
all<00:05:41.260> the<00:05:41.350> most<00:05:41.560> time<00:05:41.830> really<00:05:42.130> and<00:05:42.430> then<00:05:42.610> i<00:05:42.760> can

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
all the most time really and then i can

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.050 
all the most time really and then i can
just<00:05:43.030> use<00:05:43.360> my<00:05:43.590> magical<00:05:44.590> programming<00:05:45.250> and<00:05:45.490> get

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
just use my magical programming and get

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.060 
just use my magical programming and get
it<00:05:46.180> done<00:05:46.270> and<00:05:46.540> the<00:05:46.930> website<00:05:47.380> to<00:05:47.410> download<00:05:47.770> the

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
it done and the website to download the

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.130 
it done and the website to download the
mp3's<00:05:48.610> of<00:05:49.120> the<00:05:49.240> youtube<00:05:49.510> videos<00:05:49.780> would<00:05:49.990> be

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
mp3's of the youtube videos would be

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.260 
mp3's of the youtube videos would be
keep<00:05:50.410> it<00:05:50.560> calm<00:05:51.040> it's<00:05:51.310> definitely<00:05:51.700> recommended

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
keep it calm it's definitely recommended

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.480 
keep it calm it's definitely recommended
because<00:05:52.780> it<00:05:53.080> just<00:05:53.470> doesn't<00:05:53.740> like<00:05:53.980> convert<00:05:54.370> the

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
because it just doesn't like convert the

because it just doesn't like convert the
video<00:05:54.730> you<00:05:54.850> can<00:05:54.940> just<00:05:55.120> download<00:05:55.240> it<00:05:55.480> straight
