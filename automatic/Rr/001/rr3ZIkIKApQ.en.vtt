squad<00:00:36.690> Brooke<00:00:37.020> truly<00:00:37.559> depends<00:00:37.980> on<00:00:38.160> what<00:00:38.340> your

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
squad Brooke truly depends on what your

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.030 
squad Brooke truly depends on what your
team<00:00:38.700> has<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.120> anyway<00:00:39.600> now<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.500> reason<00:00:40.680> I

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
team has on anyway now the reason I

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.459 
team has on anyway now the reason I
remove<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.120> foregrip<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.079> foregrip

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
remove the foregrip is that the foregrip

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.700 
remove the foregrip is that the foregrip
doubles<00:00:44.010> doubles<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.360> accuracy<00:00:46.140> penalty

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
doubles doubles the accuracy penalty

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.889 
doubles doubles the accuracy penalty
that's<00:00:47.039> really<00:00:47.399> important<00:00:47.820> from<00:00:48.239> having<00:00:48.719> one

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
that's really important from having one

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.029 
that's really important from having one
from<00:00:49.530> honey<00:00:50.360> 100%<00:00:51.360> bullet<00:00:52.140> spread<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.770> go<00:00:52.980> to

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
from honey 100% bullet spread you go to

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.860 
from honey 100% bullet spread you go to
two<00:00:53.399> hundred<00:00:53.550> percent<00:00:54.090> bullet<00:00:54.390> spread<00:00:54.570> so

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
two hundred percent bullet spread so

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.830 
two hundred percent bullet spread so
that<00:00:55.140> means<00:00:55.379> your<00:00:55.710> sks<00:00:56.610> instantly<00:00:57.239> because<00:00:57.719> of

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
that means your sks instantly because of

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.319 
that means your sks instantly because of
the<00:00:57.960> foregrip<00:00:58.350> becomes<00:00:58.890> 2<00:00:59.430> times<00:00:59.460> more

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
the foregrip becomes 2 times more

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.450 
the foregrip becomes 2 times more
inaccurate<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.859> it's<00:01:02.280> really

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
inaccurate so this is it's really

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.670 
inaccurate so this is it's really
logical<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:03.239> remove<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.719> foregrip<00:01:04.110> obviously

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
logical to remove the foregrip obviously

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.920 
logical to remove the foregrip obviously
the<00:01:05.220> guy<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.580> suggested<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.180> did<00:01:06.420> not<00:01:06.630> know

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
the guy that suggested it did not know

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.780 
the guy that suggested it did not know
that<00:01:06.960> shoots<00:01:07.560> penalty<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.430> foregrip

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
that shoots penalty that the foregrip

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.850 
that shoots penalty that the foregrip
gave<00:01:09.119> it's<00:01:09.479> really<00:01:09.840> logical<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.409> bullfrog

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
gave it's really logical to bullfrog

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.429 
gave it's really logical to bullfrog

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
along with the laser sight it's good

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.430

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
really good in close range you got the

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.430 
really good in close range you got the
power<00:03:58.680> of<00:03:59.069> the<00:03:59.130> g3<00:03:59.910> something<00:04:00.540> like<00:04:00.690> a<00:04:00.720> g3<00:04:01.200> like

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
power of the g3 something like a g3 like

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.770 
power of the g3 something like a g3 like
a<00:04:01.590> hybrid<00:04:02.280> between<00:04:02.400> 83<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.209> sniper<00:04:03.510> some

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
a hybrid between 83 and a sniper some

a hybrid between 83 and a sniper some
aromatic<00:04:04.170> sniper<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:05.160> have<00:04:05.310> the

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
aromatic sniper and you have the

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.610 
aromatic sniper and you have the
accuracy<00:04:06.090> of<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.329> bipod<00:04:06.750> did<00:04:06.930> semi-automatic

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.590 
accuracy of a bipod did semi-automatic
sniper<00:04:07.650> it's<00:04:08.280> a<00:04:08.519> triple<00:04:09.000> hybrid<00:04:09.390> in<00:04:09.480> my

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
sniper it's a triple hybrid in my

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.199 
sniper it's a triple hybrid in my
opinion<00:04:09.870> has<00:04:10.079> the<00:04:10.230> hipfire<00:04:10.440> of<00:04:10.859> a<00:04:11.010> PDW<00:04:11.310> the

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
opinion has the hipfire of a PDW the

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.930 
opinion has the hipfire of a PDW the
fire<00:04:12.480> rate<00:04:12.750> damage<00:04:13.380> and<00:04:13.560> strength<00:04:13.920> of<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.370> g3
