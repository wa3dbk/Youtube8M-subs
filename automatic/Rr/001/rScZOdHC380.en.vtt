00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.359
 in this review we will tell you about 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.250
 protective case with design shells for iphone 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.630

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.630
 what does he look like 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.560
 he walked consists of two separate layers 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.760
 soft silicone inner layer 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.380
 which prevents 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.540
 scratching the phone 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.780
 and also for myself just beats and falls 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.700
 and outer layer 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.700

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.700
 you have June 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.130

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.130
 easy to avoid them 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.450
 it is easy to install the phone 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.110
 first you need to put on the side 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.110
 with volume control 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.180
 crush everything is ready 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.600

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.600
 affordable 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.210
 everything is working 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.369
 thanks to having read about 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.680
 performed under the terms of the technology 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.680
 it has good protective properties 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.800
 having a small thickness 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.240
 dimensions really 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.600
 we increased insignificant 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.770
 the phone is comfortable in the hand 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.259
 he does not slip 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.289
 plus the whole of this school is not very 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:14.289
 interesting appearance 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:23.399

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:26.200
