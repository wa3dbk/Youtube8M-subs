00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
I'll actually make it past this

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.949 
I'll actually make it past this
checkpoint<00:02:07.399> you<00:02:07.729> think<00:02:10.630> let's<00:02:11.630> see<00:02:11.750> if<00:02:11.840> I<00:02:11.930> can

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
checkpoint you think let's see if I can

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.610 
checkpoint you think let's see if I can
actually<00:02:12.170> like<00:02:12.410> go<00:02:12.440> on<00:02:12.590> top<00:02:12.920> here<00:02:14.560> okay<00:02:15.560> so

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
actually like go on top here okay so

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.930 
actually like go on top here okay so
there's<00:02:15.799> nothing<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:16.100> go<00:02:16.250> on<00:02:16.280> top<00:02:16.489> it's<00:02:16.730> really

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
there's nothing to go on top it's really

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.340 
there's nothing to go on top it's really
thin

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.040 

I<00:02:20.760> jump<00:02:21.760> over<00:02:21.940> those<00:02:22.060> no<00:02:22.390> I<00:02:22.420> can't<00:02:22.750> dump<00:02:22.900> over

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
I jump over those no I can't dump over

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:30.460 
I jump over those no I can't dump over
those

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.210 

why<00:02:31.130> did<00:02:31.310> I<00:02:31.400> do<00:02:31.460> that<00:02:31.610> I<00:02:32.120> just<00:02:32.870> holy<00:02:33.500> Toledo<00:02:33.770> all

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
why did I do that I just holy Toledo all

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.740 
why did I do that I just holy Toledo all
right<00:02:34.370> I<00:02:34.580> meant<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.090> roll<00:02:35.300> it's<00:02:35.540> still<00:02:35.720> a

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
right I meant to roll it's still a

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.260 
right I meant to roll it's still a
little<00:02:35.900> bit<00:02:36.080> odd<00:02:36.200> getting<00:02:36.560> used<00:02:36.710> to<00:02:36.890> the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
little bit odd getting used to the

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.490 
little bit odd getting used to the
controls<00:02:38.270> you<00:02:38.630> know<00:02:38.720> what<00:02:38.810> I<00:02:38.870> mean<00:02:38.990> because

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
controls you know what I mean because

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
controls you know what I mean because
like<00:02:39.620> I'm<00:02:39.740> used<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:39.980> it's<00:02:40.160> like<00:02:40.280> you're<00:02:40.400> using

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
like I'm used to it's like you're using

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.370 
like I'm used to it's like you're using
two<00:02:40.730> controls<00:02:41.060> at<00:02:41.180> once<00:02:41.330> so<00:02:42.020> that's<00:02:42.170> kind<00:02:42.350> of

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
two controls at once so that's kind of

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
two controls at once so that's kind of
odd<00:02:42.530> but<00:02:43.160> it's<00:02:43.310> uh<00:02:43.520> oh<00:02:43.990> well<00:02:44.990> I<00:02:45.350> got<00:02:46.070> disposed

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
odd but it's uh oh well I got disposed

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.890 
odd but it's uh oh well I got disposed
to<00:02:46.490> buy<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.640> fan<00:02:46.820> I<00:02:46.850> thought<00:02:47.120> once<00:02:47.360> you<00:02:47.810> were

to<00:03:31.560> do<00:03:31.680> that<00:03:31.710> let's<00:03:32.100> see<00:03:32.220> if<00:03:32.280> we<00:03:32.340> can<00:03:32.459> save

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
to do that let's see if we can save

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.860 
to do that let's see if we can save
ourselves<00:03:33.200> no<00:03:34.200> I<00:03:34.230> don't<00:03:34.440> think<00:03:34.470> we<00:03:34.650> can<00:03:35.870> weak

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
ourselves no I don't think we can weak

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.590 
ourselves no I don't think we can weak
sauce<00:03:37.430> weak<00:03:38.430> sauce<00:03:38.730> so<00:03:39.120> I<00:03:39.180> guess<00:03:39.300> decide<00:03:39.510> to

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
sauce weak sauce so I guess decide to

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.699 
sauce weak sauce so I guess decide to
blow<00:03:39.690> myself<00:03:39.870> up<00:03:40.080> there<00:03:40.140> for<00:03:40.350> no<00:03:40.440> apparent

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
blow myself up there for no apparent

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:51.050 
blow myself up there for no apparent
reason

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.530 

well<00:03:52.489> that's<00:03:53.489> what<00:03:53.640> happens<00:03:53.730> when<00:03:54.150> you<00:03:54.270> roll

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.309 
well that's what happens when you roll
around<00:03:56.060> no<00:03:57.060> that<00:03:57.569> is<00:03:57.599> not<00:03:57.780> a<00:03:57.840> good<00:03:57.930> way<00:03:58.110> to<00:03:58.170> do

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:28.930 
this but you know I understand that's
like<00:04:27.349> a<00:04:27.379> gameplay<00:04:27.800> mechanic<00:04:28.280> and<00:04:28.460> you<00:04:28.819> know

that's why you have it in there so maybe

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.020

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
in later levels they put up something

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.700 
in later levels they put up something
where<00:04:32.240> you<00:04:32.330> can<00:04:32.509> get<00:04:32.599> like<00:04:32.810> no<00:04:33.379> cooldown

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
where you can get like no cooldown

where you can get like no cooldown
that's<00:04:34.460> needed<00:04:34.909> or<00:04:35.030> anything<00:04:35.210> like<00:04:35.240> that<00:04:35.389> whoa

neat

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.500 

so<00:04:49.980> far<00:04:50.220> though<00:04:50.430> this<00:04:50.670> game<00:04:50.940> has<00:04:51.240> not

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
so far though this game has not

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.350 
so far though this game has not
challenged<00:04:52.110> me<00:04:52.230> in<00:04:52.260> terms<00:04:52.620> of<00:04:53.090> shit<00:04:54.090> to<00:04:54.210> dodge

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
challenged me in terms of shit to dodge

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.840 
challenged me in terms of shit to dodge
through<00:04:54.920> so<00:04:55.920> we'll<00:04:56.070> see<00:04:56.220> if<00:04:56.250> it<00:04:56.400> gets<00:04:56.490> tougher

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
through so we'll see if it gets tougher

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:57.800 
through so we'll see if it gets tougher
in<00:04:56.910> the<00:04:56.970> later<00:04:57.150> levels<00:04:57.360> but<00:04:57.570> this<00:04:57.720> is

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
in the later levels but this is

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.110 
in the later levels but this is
obviously<00:04:57.930> the<00:04:58.470> earlier<00:04:58.710> levels<00:04:59.070> Oh<00:04:59.340> God<00:04:59.670> has

obviously the earlier levels Oh God has

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.490 
obviously the earlier levels Oh God has
definitely<00:05:00.480> challenged<00:05:00.840> me<00:05:00.960> my<00:05:01.140> ability<00:05:01.470> to

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500
