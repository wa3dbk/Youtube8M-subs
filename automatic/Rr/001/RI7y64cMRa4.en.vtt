00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
connect your fly line to the later

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.130 
connect your fly line to the later
without<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:17.070> knot<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:17.789> it's<00:00:18.539> perfectly

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.240 
smooth it runs through the guides really
easily<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:22.050> comes<00:00:22.320> really<00:00:22.560> handy<00:00:22.680> when

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
easily and it comes really handy when

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.400 
easily and it comes really handy when
fishing<00:00:23.550> with<00:00:23.939> really<00:00:24.390> long<00:00:24.539> letters<00:00:25.019> and

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
my connection to the letter runs through

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.490 
my connection to the letter runs through
the<00:00:34.649> guy's<00:00:34.829> really<00:00:35.130> easily<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:36.120> we'll<00:00:37.110> do<00:00:37.320> this

the guy's really easily so we'll do this

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.630 
the guy's really easily so we'll do this
with<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.890> help<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.420> knitting<00:00:39.420> needle<00:00:39.450> and

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
with the help of a knitting needle and

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.180 
with the help of a knitting needle and
we'll<00:00:41.640> help<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.329> like<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> simple<00:00:43.739> knitting

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
we'll help of like a simple knitting

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.970 
we'll help of like a simple knitting
needle<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.420> superglue<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:46.770> really

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
needle and the superglue so it's really

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.630 
needle and the superglue so it's really
simple<00:00:47.480> so<00:00:48.500> when<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.649> when<00:00:50.250> you're<00:00:50.399> using

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
simple so when you when you're using

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.660 
simple so when you when you're using
four<00:00:51.030> letters<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.809> pre-rigged<00:00:52.800> loop<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
four letters this pre-rigged loop on the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.660 
four letters this pre-rigged loop on the
fly<00:00:53.879> line<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.510> great<00:00:54.809> but<00:00:55.350> quite<00:00:56.070> often<00:00:56.280> I

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
fly line is great but quite often I

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.729 
fly line is great but quite often I
don't<00:00:56.760> want<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.239> big<00:00:57.570> bulky<00:00:58.260> loop<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.680> just

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
don't want this big bulky loop I just

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.799 
don't want this big bulky loop I just
want<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.430> perfectly<00:00:59.940> smooth<00:01:00.210> connection<00:01:00.690> with

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
want a perfectly smooth connection with

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.470 
want a perfectly smooth connection with
a<00:01:00.840> later<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.350> let's<00:01:01.800> do<00:01:01.949> it

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
a later so let's do it

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.149 
a later so let's do it
okay<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.539> first<00:01:03.870> thing<00:01:04.019> we<00:01:04.290> do<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:05.129> just

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
okay so first thing we do is you just

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.140 
okay so first thing we do is you just
clip<00:01:05.729> off<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:07.070> prereqs<00:01:08.070> loop<00:01:08.460> on<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.970> fly

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
clip off the prereqs loop on the fly

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.640 
clip off the prereqs loop on the fly
line<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.049> number<00:01:10.200> five<00:01:10.500> line<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:11.610> just

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
line this is number five line so we just

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.010 
line this is number five line so we just
clip<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:13.799> off<00:01:14.010> like<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.840> way

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
clip this off like this so this way

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.289 
clip this off like this so this way
we'll<00:01:16.200> have<00:01:16.229> briefly<00:01:16.619> then<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.119> take

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
we'll have briefly then you just take

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.719 
we'll have briefly then you just take
needle<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.850> run<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.380> run<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.439> through<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.520> fly

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
needle and run it run it through the fly

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.420 
needle and run it run it through the fly
line<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.900> has<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.110> core<00:01:25.439> inside<00:01:25.830> but<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.280> also

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
line so it has a core inside but it also

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.910 
line so it has a core inside but it also
has<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:27.060> really<00:01:27.860> enough<00:01:28.860> meat<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.820> just<00:01:30.090> run

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
has a really enough meat so you just run

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.870 
has a really enough meat so you just run
your<00:01:31.920> needle<00:01:32.630> just<00:01:33.630> thread<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.770> loop<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.280> mean

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
your needle just thread the loop I mean

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.050 
your needle just thread the loop I mean
the<00:01:36.030> line<00:01:36.210> onto<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.110> needle<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.790> it<00:01:38.790> really

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
the line onto the needle and it really

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.310 
the line onto the needle and it really
doesn't<00:01:39.420> have<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.750> be<00:01:40.189> that<00:01:41.189> much<00:01:41.570> like<00:01:42.570> two<00:01:43.140> or

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
doesn't have to be that much like two or

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.420 
doesn't have to be that much like two or
three<00:01:43.350> centimeter<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:45.240> enough<00:01:46.070> ticket<00:01:47.070> you

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
three centimeter is is enough ticket you

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.020 
three centimeter is is enough ticket you
could<00:01:47.610> use<00:01:47.759> help

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.200 

so<00:01:52.030> now<00:01:52.930> that<00:01:52.990> we<00:01:53.380> threaded<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:53.920> needle<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:55.030> we

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
so now that we threaded the needle so we

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.980 
so now that we threaded the needle so we
just<00:01:55.920> plug<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.160> needle<00:01:57.430> out<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:01.180> help<00:02:01.660> this

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
just plug the needle out and help this

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:15.900 
just plug the needle out and help this
so<00:02:02.770> just<00:02:02.980> plug<00:02:03.190> the<00:02:03.310> needle<00:02:03.520> out<00:02:08.130> like<00:02:09.130> so<00:02:14.910> okay

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
so just plug the needle out like so okay

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.650 
so just plug the needle out like so okay
so<00:02:15.970> now<00:02:16.300> we've<00:02:16.510> threaded<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.410> needle<00:02:18.660> through

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
so now we've threaded the needle through

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.450 
so now we've threaded the needle through
the<00:02:19.690> fly<00:02:19.990> line<00:02:20.260> it<00:02:20.710> doesn't<00:02:21.070> have<00:02:21.160> to<00:02:21.310> be

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
the fly line it doesn't have to be

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.610 
the fly line it doesn't have to be
really<00:02:21.700> far<00:02:22.060> like<00:02:22.300> a<00:02:22.330> one<00:02:22.750> meter<00:02:22.960> one<00:02:23.200> or<00:02:23.410> two

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
really far like a one meter one or two

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.410 
really far like a one meter one or two
centimeters<00:02:24.160> so<00:02:24.670> now<00:02:24.820> we'll<00:02:25.030> just<00:02:25.210> put<00:02:25.390> a

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
centimeters so now we'll just put a

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.610 
centimeters so now we'll just put a
throat<00:02:25.810> flow<00:02:26.170> carbon<00:02:26.460> through<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.610> eye<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:29.170> a

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
throat flow carbon through the eye of a

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.370 
throat flow carbon through the eye of a
needle<00:02:31.620> like<00:02:32.620> so<00:02:33.210> and<00:02:34.210> now<00:02:34.600> we'll<00:02:34.900> just<00:02:35.080> thread

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
needle like so and now we'll just thread

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.370 
needle like so and now we'll just thread
the<00:02:35.880> line<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:38.740> monofilament<00:02:39.810> whoop<00:02:40.810> through

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
the line the monofilament whoop through

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.560 
the line the monofilament whoop through
the<00:02:41.470> line<00:02:43.260> will<00:02:44.260> clip<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.830> excess<00:02:45.340> of<00:02:46.060> flow<00:02:46.510> of

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
the line will clip the excess of flow of

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:53.040 
the line will clip the excess of flow of
carbon<00:02:46.780> off<00:02:48.240> like<00:02:49.240> so<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:51.090> we'll<00:02:52.090> apply<00:02:52.240> a<00:02:52.810> bit

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
carbon off like so and we'll apply a bit

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.260 
carbon off like so and we'll apply a bit
of<00:02:53.200> superglue<00:02:53.560> onto<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:56.850> onto<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:57.970> floor

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
of superglue onto the onto the floor

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:07.220 
of superglue onto the onto the floor
carbon<00:02:58.660> like<00:02:58.870> so<00:03:01.290> okay<00:03:02.489> now<00:03:03.489> we<00:03:04.360> just<00:03:04.980> stick

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
carbon like so okay now we just stick

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.640 
carbon like so okay now we just stick
the<00:03:08.230> flow<00:03:08.470> carbon<00:03:09.190> into<00:03:09.820> the

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
the flow carbon into the

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.300 
the flow carbon into the
so<00:03:12.220> now<00:03:12.430> look<00:03:13.209> it<00:03:13.900> stuck<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:14.470> hard<00:03:14.739> I<00:03:14.920> can<00:03:15.190> have

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
so now look it stuck so hard I can have

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.089 
so now look it stuck so hard I can have
to<00:03:15.430> even<00:03:15.610> move<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:15.940> like<00:03:16.750> so<00:03:17.019> I'll<00:03:17.500> just<00:03:17.739> clip

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
to even move it like so I'll just clip

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:23.270 
to even move it like so I'll just clip
the<00:03:18.400> axis<00:03:18.790> off<00:03:19.830> at<00:03:20.830> the<00:03:21.010> entrance<00:03:21.400> of<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:22.000> bond

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
the axis off at the entrance of the bond

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.880 
the axis off at the entrance of the bond
like<00:03:24.280> so<00:03:24.549> and<00:03:24.790> this<00:03:25.480> is<00:03:25.540> it<00:03:26.970> perfectly<00:03:27.970> strong

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
like so and this is it perfectly strong

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.800 
like so and this is it perfectly strong
connection<00:03:29.890> of<00:03:30.069> your<00:03:30.129> fly<00:03:31.000> line<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.720> your

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
connection of your fly line to your

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.100 
connection of your fly line to your
tippet<00:03:32.230> I<00:03:32.440> use<00:03:33.220> Oh<00:03:33.489> 33<00:03:34.180> millimeter<00:03:34.569> for<00:03:34.930> the

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
tippet I use Oh 33 millimeter for the

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.229 
tippet I use Oh 33 millimeter for the
first<00:03:35.379> section<00:03:35.650> on<00:03:36.010> twitch<00:03:36.459> I<00:03:36.670> start<00:03:37.060> with<00:03:37.209> a

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
first section on twitch I start with a

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.509 
first section on twitch I start with a
boosters<00:03:37.629> not<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.500> thinner<00:03:38.739> lines<00:03:39.040> which<00:03:39.370> I

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
boosters not the thinner lines which I

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.970 
boosters not the thinner lines which I
want<00:03:39.700> to<00:03:39.819> use
