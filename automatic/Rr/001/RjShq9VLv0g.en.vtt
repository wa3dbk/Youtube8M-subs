00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello that such rebellious videos I hope that 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.220
 have had very happy holidays and 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.319
 that this year is an excellent year for 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.750
 all of you and today I'm going to give you a tip 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.610
 of how you can get control of that 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.679
 Depth of field with almost any 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.509
 video camera you know how you want 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.970
 less depth of field you want is the 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.010
 famous blurred background good here I'm going to 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.480
 say how you can get it with almost 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.020
 any video camera so 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.020
 we start 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.300
 CLR cameras like canon t3 and t4 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.280
 and all these have become very popular 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.559
 because with them you can control what 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.629
 is the depth of field you know this 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.489
 effect where you can or can not center the 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.589
 point of focus in your picture to a 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.449
 particular object is to say that the 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:57.850
 object is focused and the rest 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.309
 blurred to that what we call with little 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.960
 depth of field this effect between 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.570
 other things makes watching the video more 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.009
 professional and cinema- like and that's why 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.080
 is that we like the filmmakers so much 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.600
 but what happens if you do not have a camera 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.100
 of slr how are you how can you achieve 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.830
 this effect with a video camera 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.659
 common good here I'll give you a trick 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.150
 with which you can do this effect with 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.590
 almost any video camera if you take 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.020
 an object with the lens completely 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.759
 open is to say without any zoom 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.159
 all open for example suppose that 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.540
 let's record this snow monkey in 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.549
 this take I find myself less than a 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.710
 Object meter with open lens 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.420
 As you can see, everything has been focused 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.430
 because this is what they normally do 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.180
 the video cameras focus everything 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.110
 but 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:44.320
 what happens if I walk away let's say three 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.060
 meters I close my lens is to say I put 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.920
 all the zoom in up to the 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.500
 stop and I make a framing similar to 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.290
 before the same object and nothing else 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.750
 focused a bit and there you have the famous 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.700
 unfocused background you see the difference 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.070
 the two images only with your camera with 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.860
 the zoom and everything to the inside or the 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.140
 zoom and the more closed your 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.940
 you take more you achieve the effect 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.190
 the key is physically moving away from 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.830
 object that you record and make your shots with 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.900
 the zoom all closed all the summit 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.090
 even if I approach a little more 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.920
 physically but with the zoom in and I do 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.110
 more closed shots to the same object is 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.370
 achieves the aesthetic effect works in 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.980
 many of the situations as it is not 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.170
 but it's important for you to come out 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.959
 keep in mind some things like 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.850
 zoom in and zoom out is more 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.770
 It's likely that you could be moved 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.720
 takes so when you do this 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.220
 effect do it with your camera mounted on a 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.060
 tripiÃ© so you have better 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.860
 results 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.799
 2 you will have better results if 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.390
 you put your camera in manual focus 3 this 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.990
 Trick comes out better when you can control 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.120
 the iris 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.980
 and the amount of light that enters the lens 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.870
 your camcorder because what 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.330
 you need is to let a little more of 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.680
 light to do this trick 4 is 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.720
 important that there is good lighting 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.670
 in the place where you're going to record so that 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.780
 go well and then there you have it is the 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.790
 test with your video camera 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.620
 experiment to see in what situation this 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.420
 work and what others do not 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.920
 Of course, it is not equal to the control 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.650
 images that you can achieve with a 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.420
 dslr camera and professional lenses 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.610
 that you can control in any 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.590
 situation but if you do not have this 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.540
 camera at this time you only have one 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.800
 video camera so you can try with 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.090
 this trick I hope it has served you 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.590
