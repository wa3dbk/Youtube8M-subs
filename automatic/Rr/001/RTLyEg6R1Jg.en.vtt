00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.020
 hello to all and the best so 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.349
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:12.840
 put a map dumont solo well he did 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.049
 downloaded to your minecraft server 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.750
 so first of all I'm going first 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.910
 game take the example on a note that 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.619
 I did all there is so you go 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.859
 in the folder hidden by his father to 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.130
 roaming 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:33.390
 you go into the serious poem you 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.300
 go down that lane so you have 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.989
 the parts then you go in 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.739
 your meaning 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:45.149
 kraft you slip through this map 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.370
 in the server that's it and you slip 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.530
 amazing languages ​​including those where you 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.879
 delete as you want next 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.559
 so that's not all because they 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.039
 were wrong about that we have to go 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:04.140
 of a waiter prophesies and it should be noted 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:14.360
 at level name woman was exactly the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:14.360
 same same writing as fairy tail s 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:26.659
 world finals then jean register and 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.030
 flight 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.030
 then a new server 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.200
 changes lane 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.200
 ceret tel 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:02:00.440
 so there the world and transferred for this 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:03.500
 is not obvious I do not think it has 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:09.910
 market because stuff is not 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:14.200
 supposed these lucky generated down 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.200
 So that's stolen on minecraft 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:28.960
 I will test I will see and not I 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.960
 do not think it worked 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:39.130
 it can work but you're ok a problem 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.050
 so you were waiting I 'm going to close 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.860
 so I want to redo the reverse with the 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:03:04.160
 same basics so you go into your 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:05.680
 folder delete a world was going in 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.890
 the hidden folder 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.770
 poll with that will allow me to you 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.650
 remonstrate you go in kraft save 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:19.940
 so lyall record amazing languages 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:26.870
 you slip that you gold extract 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:33.520
 went on then you go in servers 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:42.880
