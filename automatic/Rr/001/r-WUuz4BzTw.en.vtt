remote control which can confuse things
lastly<00:03:00.500> we<00:03:00.709> have<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.310> switch<00:03:01.640> which<00:03:01.940> goes<00:03:02.209> on

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
lastly we have the switch which goes on

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.550 
lastly we have the switch which goes on
the<00:03:02.840> remote<00:03:03.260> control<00:03:03.829> then<00:03:04.640> 73<00:03:05.450> and<00:03:05.600> 74<00:03:06.290> that

you<00:03:54.430> can<00:03:54.490> see<00:03:54.820> the<00:03:54.970> circuit<00:03:55.420> all<00:03:55.900> right<00:03:56.080> here's

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
you can see the circuit all right here's

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.620 
you can see the circuit all right here's
the<00:03:56.950> electrical<00:03:57.490> circuit<00:03:57.880> we<00:03:58.030> all<00:03:58.180> start<00:03:58.510> at

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
the electrical circuit we all start at

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.420 
the electrical circuit we all start at
the<00:03:58.720> battery<00:03:59.110> we're<00:03:59.770> going<00:03:59.890> to<00:03:59.950> end<00:04:00.160> in<00:04:00.310> our

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
the battery we're going to end in our

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.110 
the battery we're going to end in our
solenoid<00:04:01.020> 68<00:04:02.020> through<00:04:02.290> 76<00:04:03.070> we've<00:04:03.730> got<00:04:03.940> the

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
solenoid 68 through 76 we've got the

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.470 
solenoid 68 through 76 we've got the
switch<00:04:04.420> on<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.780> column<00:04:05.700> okay<00:04:06.730> switch<00:04:07.150> on<00:04:07.360> the

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
switch on the column okay switch on the

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.390 
switch on the column okay switch on the
column<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:08.410> then<00:04:08.530> we<00:04:08.560> come<00:04:08.860> down<00:04:09.040> to<00:04:09.100> our

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
column and then we come down to our

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.940 
column and then we come down to our
switch<00:04:09.730> which<00:04:10.420> is<00:04:10.570> our<00:04:10.720> third<00:04:11.020> fourth<00:04:11.380> lockout

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
switch which is our third fourth lockout

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.640 
switch which is our third fourth lockout
switch<00:04:12.370> this<00:04:13.209> is<00:04:13.420> third<00:04:13.660> and<00:04:13.810> fourth<00:04:14.050> blackout

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
switch this is third and fourth blackout

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.610 
switch this is third and fourth blackout
and<00:04:14.920> this<00:04:15.459> is<00:04:15.610> the<00:04:15.730> overdrive<00:04:16.330> switch<00:04:16.600> so<00:04:17.440> this

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
and this is the overdrive switch so this

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.860 
and this is the overdrive switch so this
switch<00:04:17.859> has<00:04:18.100> to<00:04:18.250> be<00:04:18.370> closed<00:04:18.670> and<00:04:18.940> the<00:04:19.630> third

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
switch has to be closed and the third

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.140 
switch has to be closed and the third
fourth<00:04:20.140> lockout<00:04:20.680> switch<00:04:20.950> has<00:04:21.459> to<00:04:21.700> be<00:04:21.730> closed

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
fourth lockout switch has to be closed

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.080 
fourth lockout switch has to be closed
to<00:04:22.840> complete<00:04:23.260> the<00:04:23.470> circuit<00:04:23.920> really<00:04:24.760> easy<00:04:24.910> and

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
to complete the circuit really easy and

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.060 
to complete the circuit really easy and
again<00:04:25.360> this<00:04:25.540> third<00:04:25.780> fourth<00:04:26.110> keeps<00:04:26.740> you<00:04:26.890> from

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
again this third fourth keeps you from

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.110 
again this third fourth keeps you from
engaging<00:04:27.460> in<00:04:27.790> in<00:04:28.030> first<00:04:28.360> second<00:04:28.900> or<00:04:29.020> reverse

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
engaging in in first second or reverse

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.910 
engaging in in first second or reverse
now<00:04:31.120> let's<00:04:31.330> take<00:04:31.510> a<00:04:31.540> look<00:04:31.780> at<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:31.990> 77<00:04:32.740> through

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
now let's take a look at the 77 through

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.640 
now let's take a look at the 77 through
80<00:04:33.160> circuit<00:04:33.880> alright<00:04:34.270> this<00:04:34.510> is<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.840> 77

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
80 circuit alright this is the 77

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.250 
80 circuit alright this is the 77
through<00:04:35.860> 1980<00:04:36.520> circuit<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.660> first<00:04:37.960> switch

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
through 1980 circuit the first switch

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.730 
through 1980 circuit the first switch
that<00:04:39.070> we<00:04:39.280> have<00:04:39.580> is<00:04:39.820> the<00:04:40.480> third<00:04:40.810> fourth<00:04:41.169> lockout

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
that we have is the third fourth lockout

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.820 
that we have is the third fourth lockout
switch<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:43.330> second<00:04:43.780> switch<00:04:44.020> we<00:04:44.230> have<00:04:44.260> on<00:04:44.710> the

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
switch the second switch we have on the

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.400 
switch the second switch we have on the
intermediate<00:04:45.430> models<00:04:45.910> is<00:04:46.450> the<00:04:48.180> reverse

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
intermediate models is the reverse

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.290 
intermediate models is the reverse
second<00:04:50.410> fourth<00:04:51.250> lockout<00:04:52.150> switch<00:04:53.130> and<00:04:54.130> that

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
second fourth lockout switch and that

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.300 
second fourth lockout switch and that
comes<00:04:55.300> down<00:04:55.419> to<00:04:55.600> our<00:04:55.900> T's<00:04:57.270> TCS<00:04:58.270> a<00:04:58.680> circuit<00:04:59.680> from

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
comes down to our T's TCS a circuit from

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.190 
comes down to our T's TCS a circuit from
here<00:05:00.669> we<00:05:00.970> go<00:05:01.150> to<00:05:01.210> the<00:05:01.330> switch<00:05:01.750> up<00:05:02.290> on<00:05:02.710> the<00:05:04.200> gear

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
here we go to the switch up on the gear

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.890 
here we go to the switch up on the gear
look<00:05:05.440> gear<00:05:05.950> lever<00:05:06.250> so<00:05:06.880> our<00:05:07.090> third<00:05:07.330> fourth<00:05:07.690> has

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
look gear lever so our third fourth has

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.350 
look gear lever so our third fourth has
to<00:05:08.080> be<00:05:08.200> closed<00:05:08.700> emptying<00:05:09.700> third<00:05:09.940> or<00:05:10.090> fourth

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
to be closed emptying third or fourth

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.600 
to be closed emptying third or fourth
our<00:05:10.930> reverse<00:05:11.410> second<00:05:11.860> fourth<00:05:12.100> has<00:05:12.340> to<00:05:12.490> be

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
our reverse second fourth has to be

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.300 
our reverse second fourth has to be
closed<00:05:12.940> and<00:05:13.330> the<00:05:14.200> overdrive<00:05:14.440> switch<00:05:14.830> has<00:05:15.160> to

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
closed and the overdrive switch has to

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.960 
closed and the overdrive switch has to
be<00:05:15.340> closed<00:05:15.700> to<00:05:16.300> engage<00:05:16.660> the<00:05:17.169> solenoid<00:05:17.970> later

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
be closed to engage the solenoid later

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.430 
be closed to engage the solenoid later
this<00:05:19.870> was<00:05:20.080> simplified<00:05:21.210> as<00:05:22.210> I<00:05:22.390> said<00:05:22.690> later<00:05:23.020> this

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
this was simplified as I said later this

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.860 
this was simplified as I said later this
was<00:05:23.650> simplified<00:05:24.280> and<00:05:24.550> we<00:05:25.060> went<00:05:25.300> to<00:05:25.450> a<00:05:25.479> switch

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
was simplified and we went to a switch

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.530 
was simplified and we went to a switch
which<00:05:26.560> won't<00:05:26.800> continue

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
which won't continue

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.220 
which won't continue
only<00:05:28.020> in<00:05:28.200> 4th<00:05:28.530> gear<00:05:29.130> so<00:05:29.940> in<00:05:30.120> 4th<00:05:30.420> gear<00:05:30.720> we<00:05:30.960> go<00:05:31.140> up

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
only in 4th gear so in 4th gear we go up

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.020 
only in 4th gear so in 4th gear we go up
to<00:05:31.380> our<00:05:31.410> transmission<00:05:32.190> control<00:05:32.610> spark
