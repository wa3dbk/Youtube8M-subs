radius<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.930> void<00:00:49.350> well<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.129> I'm<00:00:50.250> guessing<00:00:50.460> it

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
radius of void well so I'm guessing it

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.029 
radius of void well so I'm guessing it
would<00:00:50.879> be<00:00:50.940> something<00:00:51.480> like<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:52.469> Wizards

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
would be something like the Wizards

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.920

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
black dome they put over you I guess

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.119 
black dome they put over you I guess
would<00:00:55.050> be<00:00:55.110> something<00:00:55.379> like<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:55.890> mean

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
would be something like that I mean
