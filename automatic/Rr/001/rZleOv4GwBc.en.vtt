00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.080 
that can be quite a handful as well
especially<00:02:43.150> again<00:02:44.150> that<00:02:44.330> country<00:02:44.690> roads

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
especially again that country roads

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.830 
especially again that country roads
motorways<00:02:47.090> can<00:02:47.330> be<00:02:47.420> a<00:02:47.450> pain<00:02:48.110> because<00:02:48.610> all<00:02:49.840> you

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
motorways can be a pain because all you

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.330 
motorways can be a pain because all you
see<00:02:50.870> is<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.260> flashing<00:02:51.590> light<00:02:51.770> they<00:02:52.010> don't<00:02:52.130> see

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
see is the flashing light they don't see

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.210 
see is the flashing light they don't see
the<00:02:52.459> indicators<00:02:53.000> yeah<00:02:53.709> so<00:02:54.709> you<00:02:54.770> end<00:02:54.980> up<00:02:55.070> having

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
the indicators yeah so you end up having

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.699 
the indicators yeah so you end up having
to<00:02:55.580> force<00:02:55.970> your<00:02:56.150> way<00:02:56.209> into<00:02:56.510> traffic<00:02:56.810> you'll

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
to force your way into traffic you'll

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:58.870 
to force your way into traffic you'll
probably<00:02:57.860> know<00:02:58.070> that<00:02:58.190> yourself<00:02:58.550> and<00:02:58.700> then<00:02:58.820> you

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
probably know that yourself and then you

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.830 
probably know that yourself and then you
know<00:02:58.940> when<00:02:59.120> you<00:02:59.150> was<00:02:59.330> driving<00:02:59.480> for<00:02:59.780> the
