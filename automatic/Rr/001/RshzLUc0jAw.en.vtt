Karlsson<00:04:17.790> I'll<00:04:18.790> take<00:04:19.030> a<00:04:19.090> good<00:04:19.269> example<00:04:19.660> I've

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
Karlsson I'll take a good example I've

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.630 
Karlsson I'll take a good example I've
bought<00:04:19.959> one<00:04:20.169> today<00:04:20.290> for<00:04:20.650> about<00:04:20.799> 30<00:04:21.100> k<00:04:21.370> and

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
bought one today for about 30 k and

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.210 
bought one today for about 30 k and
usually<00:04:22.539> he<00:04:22.570> goes<00:04:22.870> for<00:04:23.050> around<00:04:23.169> 60k<00:04:23.830> but<00:04:24.070> now

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
usually he goes for around 60k but now

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.830 
usually he goes for around 60k but now
you'll<00:04:24.430> find<00:04:24.729> him<00:04:24.849> for<00:04:25.000> around<00:04:25.240> 30k<00:04:26.140> 35<00:04:26.860> k

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
you'll find him for around 30k 35 k

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.110 
you'll find him for around 30k 35 k
just<00:04:28.840> because<00:04:29.170> there's<00:04:29.380> a<00:04:29.440> lot<00:04:29.470> is<00:04:30.220> an<00:04:30.550> excess

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
just because there's a lot is an excess

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.420 
just because there's a lot is an excess
amount<00:04:31.300> of<00:04:31.660> good<00:04:31.810> players<00:04:32.020> on<00:04:32.230> the<00:04:32.320> market<00:04:32.740> so

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
amount of good players on the market so

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.730 
amount of good players on the market so
that's<00:04:33.640> why<00:04:33.910> these<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:34.600> players<00:04:34.870> they<00:04:35.590> go

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
that's why these the players they go

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.850 
that's why these the players they go
down<00:04:36.690> but<00:04:37.690> as<00:04:37.810> of<00:04:37.960> right<00:04:38.020> now<00:04:38.170> Michael<00:04:38.530> Quigley

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860
