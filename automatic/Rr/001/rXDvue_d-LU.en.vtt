00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.090
 pinamar 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.889
 for all those who love the 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.690
 animation in general we decided on the 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.129
 new section dedicated entirely to 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.900
 the cartoons movies or 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.210
 short films of which we die of 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.570
 I want to talk so ladies and 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.070
 Gentlemen welcome to the tube views and 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.509
 what better way to inaugurate this new 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.009
 section that with two impressions of the 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.919
 first episode of the mother feels 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.739
 disney xd caricature that is this 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.020
 forced version live where we will see to 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.399
 a piece called star all of life but 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.340
 that compared to the one that already has 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:41.500
 Disney this is crazy wild and clear you 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.110
 like to fight with us and to meet 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.030
 14 give the relics more pressure 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.820
 to the one of his family that is the magic wand 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.890
 of the Welsh but being unable to 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.899
 protect your kingdom with it is to send 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.430
 the store to live with the family Díaz la 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.560
 which has a son called frame that 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.239
 will be the best friend to be and together 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.070
 they will travel by diversity of dimensions 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.530
 fighting the evil that crosses him in his 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.299
 I walk a series that since before his 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.310
 premiere was already gaining a wide 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.590
 amount of fans and that the personal 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.670
 I was dying to see and later learned 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.710
 is that not earlier this year 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.020
 I feel it is time to tell you my 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.789
 points in favor of his first episode 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.070
 to start the protagonists of this 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.229
 cartoons and they give the width this is the 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.850
 typical hyperactive enthusiastic character 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.130
 and fun that fills the show with life 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.450
 although I questioned a little if a 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.130
 Such a character could be a good 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.990
 protagonist but well this first 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.119
 episode I'm pretty sure that 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.920
 will manage to do it but same person 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.479
 staff was the frame character that 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.520
 it is quite far from the typical saiki 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.860
 contributing his personality charisma and 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.569
 humor to the show as well as his movements 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.890
 character in which will leave it out of 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:43.920
 the fights that will undoubtedly be 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.569
 present in each episode of this series 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.860
 so also the animation that although it had 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.500
 quite the fault it feels quite 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.970
 natural to the style of the series as well as 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.220
 the design of the protagonists beings 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.079
 human and intergalactic captures that 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.840
 They are quite different and each is 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.700
 feels unique and that goes according to the wind 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.409
 that has this caricature which demands 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.119
 certain kind of animation for both 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.340
 session calm as for the quick 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.979
 of fight and action fulfilling that makes 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.750
 perfection in this section and 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.760
 speaking in other episodes of this 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.349
 preview I loved that in the 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.120
 We could first look more closely at the 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.920
 history of being as well as changes 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.910
 of face when entering the frame life 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.770
 day 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.810
 looking at the dynamics that both 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.030
 characters have in the course of this 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.370
 show in a very well structured way 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.130
 as well as teach us the humor disagro that 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.120
 have this series in the same way but 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.310
 that in the second episode 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.870
 the truth I stay to see honestly 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.880
 the pony character that I thought was something 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.730
 irritable and of his personality up 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.250
 the dubbing that this character has and 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.990
 I felt something rash this episode that 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.750
 I would have liked to see it more after 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.910
 another 10 or a little more and equally 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.040
 I felt that the friendship between frame and star 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.710
 it was much more developed and just 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.450
 it was the second episode but there was still 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.790
 very good successes since the particular 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.530
 I enjoyed the idea of ​​this episode that 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.930
 he introduced us the trips between different 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.930
 dimensions and especially this scene 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.830
 maybe it was not as good as the 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.580
 first but it was not for nothing either 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.409
 bad only something precipitate and as I saw 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.629
 Initial Benedict I liked what 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:21.299
 proposed this series with its prescribed and 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.860
 I will follow very closely to the track and can 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.510
 that by the middle of this year I can 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.760
 bring them a general neighbor of this 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.739
 caricature which with expectations 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.480
 in my case and promises to be at the height 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.579
 of other disney current productions 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.709
 as are gravity fons or one the lover 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.299
 wonder if you are encouraged to follow the 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.510
 adventures of being against the 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:41.400
 forces of intergalactic evil and that 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.959
 it would be all for this video that is ideal 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.730
 I would greatly appreciate everything you 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.470
 they gave a like and shared it for 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.810
 that more people give a chance to 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.120
 this new caricature and remain outstanding 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.790
 of more videos from our new section and 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.030
 see you soon did not have faithful 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.030
 believers 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.730
 and speaking of the ant artist 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.730
 Bah
