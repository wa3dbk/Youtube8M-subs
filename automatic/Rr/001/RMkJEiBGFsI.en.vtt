00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.880 

so<00:00:04.509> yesterday<00:00:04.779> I<00:00:05.140> showed<00:00:05.560> you<00:00:05.740> this

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:05.890 
so yesterday I showed you this

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.810 
so yesterday I showed you this
demonstration<00:00:07.320> we<00:00:08.320> have<00:00:08.350> a<00:00:09.010> piece<00:00:09.639> of

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:09.820 
demonstration we have a piece of

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.570 
demonstration we have a piece of
aluminum<00:00:10.530> this<00:00:11.530> time<00:00:11.770> I<00:00:11.799> do<00:00:11.980> have<00:00:12.070> a<00:00:12.340> bar

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.580 
aluminum this time I do have a bar

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.549 
aluminum this time I do have a bar
magnet<00:00:12.760> I<00:00:13.150> can<00:00:13.330> show<00:00:13.539> you<00:00:13.600> that<00:00:13.869> this<00:00:14.080> is<00:00:14.289> not

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
magnet I can show you that this is not

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.880 
magnet I can show you that this is not
ferromagnetic<00:00:15.810> I'm<00:00:16.810> not<00:00:17.050> able<00:00:17.320> to<00:00:17.560> pick<00:00:17.740> this

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
ferromagnetic I'm not able to pick this

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:25.500 
ferromagnetic I'm not able to pick this
up<00:00:18.039> with<00:00:18.250> the<00:00:18.340> magnet<00:00:19.800> it's<00:00:20.800> not<00:00:21.070> attracted<00:00:24.510> we

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510 
up with the magnet it's not attracted we

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.210 
up with the magnet it's not attracted we
keep<00:00:25.690> a<00:00:25.780> little<00:00:25.930> pendulum<00:00:26.440> out<00:00:26.740> of<00:00:26.860> it<00:00:26.980> she

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
keep a little pendulum out of it she

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.159 
keep a little pendulum out of it she
swings<00:00:28.090> quite<00:00:28.360> nicely<00:00:30.420> but<00:00:31.420> if<00:00:31.539> I<00:00:31.660> set<00:00:31.930> it<00:00:32.050> up

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
swings quite nicely but if I set it up

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:40.229 
swings quite nicely but if I set it up
to<00:00:32.230> swing<00:00:32.770> through<00:00:33.129> this<00:00:33.820> magnetic<00:00:34.239> field<00:00:39.239> it

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
to swing through this magnetic field it

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.860 
to swing through this magnetic field it
gets<00:00:40.420> stopped<00:00:40.690> and<00:00:41.170> that's<00:00:42.010> because<00:00:42.520> as<00:00:43.030> that

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
gets stopped and that's because as that

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.930 
gets stopped and that's because as that
piece<00:00:44.350> of<00:00:44.530> metal<00:00:44.800> is<00:00:44.950> moving<00:00:45.310> it<00:00:45.940> has<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:47.940> bunch

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
piece of metal is moving it has a bunch

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.180 
piece of metal is moving it has a bunch
of<00:00:49.000> moving<00:00:49.270> charges<00:00:49.600> those<00:00:50.410> charges<00:00:50.920> that<00:00:51.040> are

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
of moving charges those charges that are

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.069 
of moving charges those charges that are
moving<00:00:51.579> through<00:00:51.790> the<00:00:51.820> magnetic<00:00:52.180> field<00:00:52.600> Villa

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
moving through the magnetic field Villa

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.120 
moving through the magnetic field Villa
force<00:00:53.470> and<00:00:54.070> that<00:00:54.100> force<00:00:55.000> causes<00:00:55.870> them<00:00:56.079> to<00:00:56.770> flow

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
force and that force causes them to flow

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.959 
force and that force causes them to flow
and<00:00:57.969> it<00:00:58.180> causes<00:00:58.450> current<00:00:59.079> to<00:00:59.500> be<00:00:59.649> created<00:01:00.130> we

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
and it causes current to be created we

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.569 
and it causes current to be created we
call<00:01:01.300> this<00:01:01.680> we<00:01:02.680> talked<00:01:03.010> about<00:01:03.219> the<00:01:03.340> voltage

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
call this we talked about the voltage

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.380 
call this we talked about the voltage
yesterday<00:01:04.390> call<00:01:05.229> it<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.500> hall<00:01:05.740> voltage<00:01:06.390> but

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
yesterday call it the hall voltage but

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.149 
yesterday call it the hall voltage but
it<00:01:07.509> is<00:01:07.659> also<00:01:08.079> related<00:01:08.380> to<00:01:08.709> what<00:01:08.829> we<00:01:08.920> call<00:01:09.130> the

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
it is also related to what we call the

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:16.710 
it is also related to what we call the
notional<00:01:09.909> be<00:01:10.359> in<00:01:10.539> that

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.650 

it's<00:01:17.110> the<00:01:17.200> same<00:01:17.380> thing<00:01:17.680> really<00:01:17.980> if<00:01:18.640> I<00:01:18.850> have<00:01:19.180> a

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
it's the same thing really if I have a

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.350 
it's the same thing really if I have a
conductor<00:01:21.570> moving<00:01:23.520> through<00:01:24.520> a<00:01:24.550> magnetic

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
conductor moving through a magnetic

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.420 
conductor moving through a magnetic
field<00:01:25.600> as<00:01:26.050> long<00:01:26.440> as<00:01:26.650> the<00:01:26.830> motion<00:01:27.250> is

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
field as long as the motion is

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.050 
field as long as the motion is
perpendicular<00:01:27.880> to<00:01:28.480> the<00:01:28.870> field<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.700> let's<00:01:30.730> say

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
perpendicular to the field so let's say

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.820 
perpendicular to the field so let's say
we<00:01:31.210> have<00:01:31.330> a<00:01:31.420> magnetic<00:01:31.720> field<00:01:32.110> that's<00:01:32.470> pointing

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
we have a magnetic field that's pointing

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.870 
we have a magnetic field that's pointing
out<00:01:32.950> of<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.190> board<00:01:33.430> in<00:01:33.520> this<00:01:33.670> region<00:01:35.880> the

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
out of the board in this region the

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.150 
out of the board in this region the
charges<00:01:37.540> within<00:01:37.960> that<00:01:38.110> conductor<00:01:38.680> are<00:01:38.860> going

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
charges within that conductor are going

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.690 
charges within that conductor are going
to<00:01:39.370> fill<00:01:39.580> forces<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.560> QB<00:01:42.550> v<00:01:42.910> beam<00:01:43.420> to<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:43.720> right

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
to fill forces so QB v beam to the right

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.640 
to fill forces so QB v beam to the right
be<00:01:45.700> out<00:01:45.970> of<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.210> board<00:01:46.510> my<00:01:46.990> thumb<00:01:47.230> is<00:01:47.380> down

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
be out of the board my thumb is down

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.300 
be out of the board my thumb is down
that<00:01:48.490> means<00:01:48.870> positive<00:01:49.870> charges<00:01:50.680> with<00:01:51.100> Phila

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
that means positive charges with Phila

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.970 
that means positive charges with Phila
force<00:01:51.610> downwards<00:01:52.390> negative<00:01:53.350> charges<00:01:53.800> with

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
force downwards negative charges with

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.060 
force downwards negative charges with
film<00:01:54.220> force<00:01:54.460> upwards<00:01:55.260> so<00:01:56.260> we<00:01:56.410> end<00:01:56.590> up<00:01:56.800> with<00:01:56.950> the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
film force upwards so we end up with the

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:04.160 
film force upwards so we end up with the
net<00:01:57.280> separation<00:01:57.850> of<00:01:57.970> charge<00:02:00.960> which<00:02:01.979> results

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
net separation of charge which results

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.560 
net separation of charge which results
or<00:02:05.580> create<00:02:06.870> an<00:02:07.870> electric<00:02:08.470> building<00:02:08.920> here<00:02:09.570> now

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
or create an electric building here now

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.420 
or create an electric building here now
with<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:10.990> electric<00:02:11.410> field<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:13.950> force<00:02:14.950> on<00:02:15.340> the

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
with the electric field the force on the

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.980 
with the electric field the force on the
positive<00:02:15.850> charge<00:02:16.090> internal<00:02:16.570> electric<00:02:16.960> field

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
positive charge internal electric field

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.920 
positive charge internal electric field
is<00:02:17.380> in<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.590> same<00:02:17.800> direction<00:02:17.950> as<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.370> bill<00:02:18.930> so

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
is in the same direction as the bill so

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.199 
is in the same direction as the bill so
what<00:02:20.320> happens<00:02:20.830> is<00:02:20.980> we<00:02:21.100> have<00:02:21.130> a<00:02:21.340> magnetic<00:02:21.850> force

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
what happens is we have a magnetic force

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.449 
what happens is we have a magnetic force
trying<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:22.810> push<00:02:22.959> it<00:02:23.080> down<00:02:23.260> we<00:02:24.130> have<00:02:24.280> an

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
trying to push it down we have an

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.960 
trying to push it down we have an
electric<00:02:25.239> force<00:02:25.510> trying<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:26.020> push<00:02:26.200> them<00:02:26.350> up<00:02:26.970> so

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
electric force trying to push them up so

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.729 
electric force trying to push them up so
if<00:02:28.030> you<00:02:28.150> get<00:02:28.360> this<00:02:28.540> battle<00:02:28.870> between<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.709> two

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
if you get this battle between the two

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.160 
if you get this battle between the two
forces<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.700> electric<00:02:31.150> force<00:02:31.450> will<00:02:32.290> equal

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
forces the electric force will equal

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.550 
forces the electric force will equal
you<00:02:35.170> know<00:02:35.319> the<00:02:35.499> electric<00:02:35.890> force<00:02:36.189> is<00:02:36.280> Q<00:02:36.670> times<00:02:36.879> E

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
you know the electric force is Q times E

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.929 
you know the electric force is Q times E
the<00:02:38.560> magnetic<00:02:39.099> force<00:02:39.340> since<00:02:39.730> we're

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
the magnetic force since we're

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.030 
the magnetic force since we're
perpendicular<00:02:40.659> the<00:02:40.900> magnitude<00:02:41.409> can<00:02:41.680> easily

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
perpendicular the magnitude can easily

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:50.990 
perpendicular the magnitude can easily
be<00:02:42.219> found<00:02:42.400> by<00:02:42.670> GDP

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000

potential difference having a separation

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.830 
potential difference having a separation
of<00:02:54.040> charge<00:02:54.370> means<00:02:54.820> there's<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.240> potential

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
of charge means there's a potential

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.750 
of charge means there's a potential
difference<00:02:56.020> between<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:56.890> two<00:02:57.040> ends<00:02:57.220> voltage

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
difference between the two ends voltage

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.330 
difference between the two ends voltage
difference<00:02:58.410> we<00:02:59.410> call<00:02:59.710> that<00:03:00.100> voltage

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
difference we call that voltage

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.960 
difference we call that voltage
difference<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.330> motional<00:03:02.050> EMF<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:03.520> symbol

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
difference the motional EMF the symbol

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.750

we<00:03:04.120> use<00:03:04.150> for<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:05.440> voltage<00:03:05.800> difference<00:03:06.010> is<00:03:06.520> the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
we use for the voltage difference is the

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.820 
we use for the voltage difference is the
epsilon<00:03:06.940> just<00:03:07.720> like<00:03:07.870> we<00:03:08.050> did<00:03:08.200> for<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:08.500> pattern

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
epsilon just like we did for the pattern

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:15.150 
epsilon just like we did for the pattern
at<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:08.950> ideal<00:03:09.280> battery<00:03:12.540> we<00:03:13.540> know<00:03:13.810> that<00:03:14.710> the

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
at the ideal battery we know that the

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.230 
at the ideal battery we know that the
voltage<00:03:16.020> magnitude<00:03:17.430> is<00:03:18.430> equal<00:03:18.640> to<00:03:19.090> the

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
voltage magnitude is equal to the

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.830 
voltage magnitude is equal to the
electric<00:03:19.390> field<00:03:20.050> over<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.940> distance<00:03:22.540> that

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
electric field over the distance that

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.970 
electric field over the distance that
these<00:03:23.020> charges<00:03:23.290> are<00:03:23.650> separated<00:03:23.860> by<00:03:28.980> sorry

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
these charges are separated by sorry

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.960 
these charges are separated by sorry
that's<00:03:30.340> not<00:03:30.520> right

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:43.460 

it's<00:03:34.570> like<00:03:34.960> before<00:03:35.080> times<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:36.040> distance

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.160 

so<00:03:44.160> it<00:03:44.490> plays<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.820> electric<00:03:45.210> field<00:03:45.900> down<00:03:46.140> here

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
so it plays the electric field down here

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:59.800 
so it plays the electric field down here
we<00:03:46.650> can<00:03:46.860> put<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.280> EMF<00:03:47.900> over<00:03:48.900> L<00:03:53.000> so<00:03:54.000> this<00:03:54.210> EMF

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.350 

depends<00:04:00.590> upon<00:04:00.680> how<00:04:01.099> far<00:04:01.400> apart<00:04:01.550> those<00:04:01.910> charges

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
depends upon how far apart those charges

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.960 
depends upon how far apart those charges
get<00:04:02.480> separated<00:04:03.110> so<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:04.190> size<00:04:04.459> of<00:04:04.790> the

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
get separated so the size of the

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.050 
get separated so the size of the
conductor<00:04:05.450> passing<00:04:05.930> through<00:04:06.050> the<00:04:06.200> film<00:04:07.060> V

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
conductor passing through the film V

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.410 
conductor passing through the film V
depends<00:04:08.840> upon<00:04:08.989> how<00:04:09.319> fast<00:04:09.709> that<00:04:10.670> conductor<00:04:11.270> is

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
depends upon how fast that conductor is

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.289 
depends upon how fast that conductor is
moving<00:04:11.450> and<00:04:12.040> B<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.430> magnetic<00:04:13.580> field<00:04:16.239> this<00:04:17.239> is

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
moving and B the magnetic field this is

what<00:04:17.690> we<00:04:17.810> call<00:04:18.079> an<00:04:18.350> induced<00:04:19.250> voltage<00:04:21.520> there's

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
what we call an induced voltage there's

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.240 
what we call an induced voltage there's
no<00:04:22.700> battery<00:04:23.120> connected<00:04:23.690> to<00:04:23.840> it<00:04:24.070> it's<00:04:25.070> not

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
hooked up to the wall outlet so there's

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.220 
hooked up to the wall outlet so there's
no<00:04:27.950> source<00:04:28.580> no<00:04:29.210> potential<00:04:29.630> difference<00:04:29.900> that's

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
no source no potential difference that's

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.820 
no source no potential difference that's
actually<00:04:30.710> supplied<00:04:31.160> to<00:04:31.400> this<00:04:32.110> conductor<00:04:33.110> yet

it<00:04:33.979> has<00:04:34.250> a<00:04:34.280> voltage<00:04:34.850> difference<00:04:35.180> and<00:04:35.479> that<00:04:35.510> is

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
it has a voltage difference and that is

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.540 
it has a voltage difference and that is
because<00:04:36.470> of<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:38.150> motion<00:04:38.570> to<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:38.930> film<00:04:39.370> so<00:04:40.370> we

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
because of the motion to the film so we

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.990 
because of the motion to the film so we
call<00:04:40.760> it<00:04:40.790> an<00:04:41.060> induced<00:04:41.750> voltage<00:04:42.639> if<00:04:43.639> this

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
call it an induced voltage if this

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.190 
call it an induced voltage if this
conductor<00:04:44.720> were<00:04:45.530> on<00:04:45.979> some<00:04:46.850> sort<00:04:47.180> of<00:04:47.360> circuitry

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
conductor were on some sort of circuitry

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.010 
conductor were on some sort of circuitry
for<00:04:49.130> an<00:04:49.220> example<00:04:49.490> of<00:04:49.729> that<00:04:49.880> couple<00:04:50.330> wires<00:04:50.600> that

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
for an example of that couple wires that

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:57.850 
for an example of that couple wires that
was<00:04:51.290> lying<00:04:52.160> on<00:04:54.790> and<00:04:55.930> it<00:04:56.930> was<00:04:57.080> connected<00:04:57.440> across

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.810 
was lying on and it was connected across
some<00:04:58.160> sort<00:04:58.430> of<00:04:58.490> resistor<00:04:59.620> that<00:05:00.820> potential

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
some sort of resistor that potential

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.150 
some sort of resistor that potential
difference<00:05:01.850> would<00:05:02.510> actually<00:05:03.169> make<00:05:03.470> current

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
difference would actually make current

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:12.070 
difference would actually make current
flow<00:05:04.690> current<00:05:05.690> will<00:05:05.990> flow<00:05:06.169> from<00:05:06.590> high<00:05:08.560> to<00:05:09.560> low

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.659 

and<00:05:12.470> we<00:05:12.740> simply<00:05:13.639> use<00:05:13.789> Ohm's<00:05:14.150> law<00:05:14.389> the

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
and we simply use Ohm's law the

potential difference in this case the

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:22.420 
potential difference in this case the

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
resistance in the wire we can figure out

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.909 
resistance in the wire we can figure out
how<00:05:25.699> much<00:05:25.849> current<00:05:26.270> was<00:05:26.389> flowing<00:05:26.419> and<00:05:26.870> that<00:05:27.110> is

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
how much current was flowing and that is

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.600 
how much current was flowing and that is
called<00:05:28.250> an<00:05:28.550> induced<00:05:29.240> current<00:05:30.610> because

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
called an induced current because

called an induced current because
there's<00:05:31.849> no<00:05:32.030> battery<00:05:32.300> there's<00:05:32.870> more<00:05:33.050> power

there's no battery there's more power

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:36.100 
there's no battery there's more power
source<00:05:33.770> it's<00:05:34.610> all<00:05:34.849> due<00:05:35.120> to<00:05:35.150> motion<00:05:35.629> of<00:05:35.960> the

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
source it's all due to motion of the

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.580 
source it's all due to motion of the
detector<00:05:37.030> they<00:05:38.030> use<00:05:38.240> this<00:05:38.419> concept<00:05:38.990> actually

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
detector they use this concept actually

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:45.959 
detector they use this concept actually
with<00:05:39.740> real<00:05:39.949> guns<00:05:40.190> to<00:05:41.060> accelerate<00:05:42.909> objects<00:05:43.909> I

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:45.969 
with real guns to accelerate objects I

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:48.339 
with real guns to accelerate objects I
know<00:05:46.969> they've<00:05:47.389> been<00:05:47.419> looking<00:05:47.810> at<00:05:47.960> real<00:05:48.110> guns

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:48.349 
know they've been looking at real guns

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:55.370 
know they've been looking at real guns
or<00:05:48.680> different<00:05:49.009> type<00:05:49.250> of<00:05:49.280> projectile

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.090 

they<00:05:55.950> use<00:05:56.160> fields<00:05:56.910> to<00:05:57.270> accelerate

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.100 
they use fields to accelerate

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:04.490 
they use fields to accelerate
projectiles<00:05:59.100> so<00:06:02.660> yeah<00:06:03.660> watch<00:06:04.050> things<00:06:04.350> in

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
projectiles so yeah watch things in

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.830 
projectiles so yeah watch things in
space<00:06:05.750> even<00:06:06.860> looking<00:06:07.860> at<00:06:08.010> the<00:06:08.250> looking<00:06:08.940> at<00:06:09.300> in

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.990 

so<00:06:20.790> motional<00:06:21.420> EMF<00:06:21.540> is<00:06:22.140> an<00:06:22.350> induced<00:06:22.740> voltage

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
so motional EMF is an induced voltage

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.340 
so motional EMF is an induced voltage
because<00:06:24.000> of<00:06:24.150> the<00:06:24.240> motion<00:06:24.450> of<00:06:24.720> the<00:06:24.840> conductors

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:25.350 
because of the motion of the conductors

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.550 
because of the motion of the conductors
through<00:06:25.590> a<00:06:25.620> film<00:06:26.150> which<00:06:27.150> if<00:06:27.750> it's<00:06:28.050> connected

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
through a film which if it's connected

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.740 
through a film which if it's connected
to<00:06:28.800> a<00:06:28.830> full<00:06:29.160> circuit<00:06:29.580> setup<00:06:29.880> it<00:06:30.360> can<00:06:30.570> also

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750 
to a full circuit setup it can also

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.510 
to a full circuit setup it can also
induce<00:06:31.230> current<00:06:31.650> and<00:06:31.980> cost<00:06:32.160> current<00:06:32.550> to<00:06:32.640> close

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 
induce current and cost current to close

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.150 
induce current and cost current to close
we're<00:06:35.520> going<00:06:35.790> to<00:06:35.940> look<00:06:36.150> at<00:06:36.420> another<00:06:36.540> aspect<00:06:37.530> of

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 
we're going to look at another aspect of

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.230 
we're going to look at another aspect of
induction<00:06:38.490> as<00:06:38.790> well<00:06:39.000> and<00:06:39.510> do<00:06:39.690> some<00:06:39.870> voltages

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
induction as well and do some voltages

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.170
