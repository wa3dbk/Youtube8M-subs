00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.790
 Sometimes there are those days that we have it 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.159
 all also equally not see but 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.629
 then more and transferable sense 

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:12.469
 some days in our work are common 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.019
 very nice 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.050
 most happy but increasing 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.830
 crowds also brings more often 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.290
 disproportionate aggression 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.420
 and if you're lucky it will stay with you 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.190
 verbal aggression 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.590
 the first car that passes by here 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.210
 by tidy 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.930
 the second is more of the type 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.930
 cannonball 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.700
 we now know that to come to 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.200
 such a board is not easy 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.900
 we also see him again within the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.430
 built up do n't get the speed there 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.370
 is much lower than outside the built-up area 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.340
 come to note regularly 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.000
 we speeds of around 100 km per hour 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.000
 thresholds or not 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.310
 the driver keeps on driving like that 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.730
 chased by the devil himself 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.730
 is becoming 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.579
 finally when he reached a crossroads 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.869
 doubts about the direction to choose 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:21.549
 we see the car for the first time 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.549
 close by but that doesn't take long 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.880
 each other 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.640

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.110

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.110

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.690

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.630

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.500
 between knowing your rights and it 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.500
