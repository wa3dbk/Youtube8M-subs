00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
taking the first two status and then I'm

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.559 
taking the first two status and then I'm
going<00:02:56.030> to<00:02:56.150> cut<00:02:56.329> it<00:02:56.420> short

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
going to cut it short

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.739 
going to cut it short
just<00:02:58.230> going<00:02:59.189> slow<00:02:59.430> here<00:02:59.459> right<00:03:00.060> some<00:03:00.510> files

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:00.749 
just going slow here right some files

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:03.759 
just going slow here right some files
are<00:03:01.049> an<00:03:01.230> extremely<00:03:01.739> important<00:03:02.340> planet

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
are an extremely important planet

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:12.899 
are an extremely important planet
fighter<00:03:04.769> plane<00:03:05.099> athletes

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:12.909 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.360 

sometimes<00:03:13.629> my<00:03:14.050> sunflowers<00:03:14.530> have<00:03:14.769> the<00:03:15.040> faster

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
sometimes my sunflowers have the faster

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.339 
sometimes my sunflowers have the faster
control<00:03:15.760> pass

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
control pass

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.140 
control pass
but<00:03:17.739> I<00:03:17.769> still<00:03:18.099> don't<00:03:18.249> get<00:03:18.430> why<00:03:18.609> the<00:03:18.670> plans<00:03:18.999> of

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
but I still don't get why the plans of

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.690 
but I still don't get why the plans of
faces<00:03:19.599> closer<00:03:20.019> makes<00:03:20.319> him<00:03:20.439> pupil<00:03:20.920> the

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700

sunflower shoots Sun out of its face

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:33.080 
sunflower shoots Sun out of its face
still<00:03:26.439> annoys<00:03:26.680> me<00:03:26.709> a<00:03:26.920> little<00:03:27.129> bit<00:03:27.280> but<00:03:28.650> back

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.140 

so<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:34.650> slowly<00:03:34.980> building<00:03:35.310> of<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.580> solution

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
so the slowly building of the solution

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.570 
so the slowly building of the solution
Oh<00:03:36.360> No

the first stage so though it's off to a
slow<00:04:10.300> start<00:04:10.330> of<00:04:10.960> course<00:04:11.190> like<00:04:12.190> most<00:04:12.220> games

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
slow start of course like most games

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.170

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
players need to start learning the base

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.020 
players need to start learning the base
