00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.030 
a little bit of a simple eyeshadow
because<00:04:26.900> she<00:04:27.200> has<00:04:27.290> a<00:04:27.320> little<00:04:27.590> bit<00:04:27.830> of<00:04:27.890> eye

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
because she has a little bit of eye

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.780 
because she has a little bit of eye
shadow<00:04:28.070> on<00:04:28.430> and<00:04:28.760> this<00:04:28.880> look<00:04:29.120> only<00:04:30.280> and<00:04:31.280> tight

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.700 
shadow on and this look only and tight
lining<00:04:32.030> is<00:04:32.420> going<00:04:32.900> to<00:04:32.960> make<00:04:33.080> the<00:04:33.110> look<00:04:33.320> darker

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
lining is going to make the look darker

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.260 
lining is going to make the look darker
and<00:04:33.920> then<00:04:34.490> I'm<00:04:34.610> going<00:04:34.730> to<00:04:34.760> take<00:04:34.850> a<00:04:34.910> gel

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.180 
and then I'm going to take a gel
eyeliner<00:04:35.750> I<00:04:35.870> think<00:04:36.230> Joe<00:04:36.440> works<00:04:36.740> better<00:04:36.980> than

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
to do a generally thick line first I

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.120 
to do a generally thick line first I
know<00:04:41.870> I<00:04:42.020> messed<00:04:42.140> up<00:04:42.410> right<00:04:42.560> there<00:04:42.770> I<00:04:42.800> wiped<00:04:43.010> it

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130

line just framing the eyes and then as

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.360
