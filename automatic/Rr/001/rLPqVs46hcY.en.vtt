00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
checkerboard pattern on the back very

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.400 
checkerboard pattern on the back very
reminiscent<00:02:28.000> of<00:02:28.360> like<00:02:28.690> graph<00:02:28.959> paper<00:02:29.200> or

reminiscent of like graph paper or
something<00:02:29.620> like<00:02:29.769> that<00:02:29.830> I<00:02:30.010> believe<00:02:30.370> that's

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
something like that I believe that's

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.320

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
little on the bulky side in my opinion

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.860 
little on the bulky side in my opinion
but<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:05.040> Nexus<00:03:06.040> is<00:03:06.280> such<00:03:06.610> a<00:03:06.879> thin<00:03:07.329> device<00:03:07.660> to

but the Nexus is such a thin device to
begin<00:03:08.140> with<00:03:08.379> that<00:03:08.739> it<00:03:08.980> doesn't<00:03:09.459> add<00:03:10.150> too<00:03:11.049> much

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
begin with that it doesn't add too much

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.009 
begin with that it doesn't add too much
let<00:03:12.370> me<00:03:12.459> see<00:03:12.640> if<00:03:12.700> you<00:03:12.819> can<00:03:12.970> get<00:03:13.150> an<00:03:13.269> idea<00:03:13.720> here

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
let me see if you can get an idea here

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:20.759 
let me see if you can get an idea here
of<00:03:14.049> how<00:03:14.410> thick<00:03:15.069> it<00:03:15.220> is<00:03:17.790> about<00:03:18.790> this<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:20.530> see

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
of how thick it is about this you see

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.259 
of how thick it is about this you see
how<00:03:20.920> thick<00:03:21.190> it<00:03:21.340> is<00:03:21.430> compared<00:03:22.030> to<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:24.850> Nexus

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
how thick it is compared to the Nexus

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.230 
how thick it is compared to the Nexus
without

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:41.080 

so<00:03:32.690> easy<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:33.960> put<00:03:34.200> on<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:37.730> it<00:03:38.730> definitely

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.720 

there's<00:03:42.090> a<00:03:42.180> little<00:03:42.390> bit<00:03:42.630> of<00:03:42.690> a<00:03:42.900> lip<00:03:43.170> on<00:03:43.350> the

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
there's a little bit of a lip on the

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.190 
there's a little bit of a lip on the
underside<00:03:46.340> so<00:03:47.340> that<00:03:47.850> wraps<00:03:48.090> around<00:03:48.360> and<00:03:48.930> grabs

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
underside so that wraps around and grabs

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.870 
underside so that wraps around and grabs
on<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.740> the<00:03:49.980> bezel<00:03:50.400> of<00:03:50.580> the<00:03:50.700> screen<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:52.880> holds

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
on to the bezel of the screen and holds

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.010 
on to the bezel of the screen and holds
it<00:03:53.970> on<00:03:54.090> there<00:03:54.390> so<00:03:54.600> it's<00:03:54.750> not<00:03:54.900> coming<00:03:55.200> off

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020
