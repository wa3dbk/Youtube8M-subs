00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.620
 well in the first 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.389
 pamplona 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.200
 a government is not less 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.020
 with abnormal movements that are under medication with time begin 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.010
 to get complicated because the medications are losing their effectiveness and that's when 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.329
 makes candidates for functional surgery for normal movements 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.469
 the doctor bernardo pérez of euros and urban of the imbanaco medical center in 

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:29.659
 Cali, Colombia 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:34.230
 explained that patients are evaluated to see their health status and verify 

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:36.470
 have no insane process 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.780
 that do not have diabetes, the pressure is controlled in addition 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.780
 verify that there is no other systemic disease 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.020
 the patient is that the dolphins peace temple 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.530
 these structures have stiffness 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.340
 there are other patients who have cough diseases such as 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.030
 dystonias diaz raven fran fernádez every cent 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.160
 there is a difference 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.740
 it was said 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.780
 Parkinson's disease is among the abnormal movements that can be 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.300
 deal with this surgery 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.370
 that manages to improve the quality of life of the patient 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.270
 the images are impressive 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.960
 and they manage to capture the moment when Dr. Bernardo Pérez managed to reduce 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.990
 the movements of parkinson a patient 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.990
 they did it 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.090
 at the end of the current goal com 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.170
 at a press conference 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.470
 but the team 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.390
 during the procedure the patient is awake and follows the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.680
 doctor's instructions 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.080
 if the intensity of the electric moves comes and goes until the 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.310
 recovery of racing 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.250
 it is very sincere how deep is 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.900
 a very very similar technology 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.500
 to cardiac pacemakers where the pacemaker simulated flights in the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.310
 deep 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.340
 it has been located in the same place 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.930
 the pacemaker to raise the electrodes was going to enter the brain 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.170
 17 was shattered to put 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.130
 just that on the site 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.130
 then it will go sizzle with electricity to improve the symptomatology 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.850
 of the tremor 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.240
 gentlemen and has not achieved pérez that explained the improvement in the patient should 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.830
 keep zinc that the only thing that could affect him he has follow up yesterday to 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.470
 other diseases because age is susceptible to it 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.549
 functional surgery for abnormal movements with an electro stimulation 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.450
 deep brain is a good alternative for those who suffer from bad 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.899
 from parkinson odemwingie all normality 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:35.129
 and that can be corroborated by the images of the surgery Dr. Bernardo Pérez 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.339
 the imbanaco medical center in the city of Caracas but still 

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:42.739
 in the same way 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.739
 we will not see 

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:58.869
 but you
