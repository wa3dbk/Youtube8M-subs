00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.760 
the wrong use and you got to join them
together<00:02:03.509> they<00:02:03.840> kind<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.049> overlap<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.560> little

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
together they kind of overlap a little

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.410 
together they kind of overlap a little
bit<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.310> get<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.670> know<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.909> thick<00:02:06.119> spot

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
bit and you get you know a thick spot

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.270 
bit and you get you know a thick spot
and<00:02:06.780> then<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.469> have<00:02:07.649> another<00:02:07.920> one<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.220> you

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
and then you have another one and you

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.050 
and then you have another one and you
join<00:02:08.970> them<00:02:09.119> together<00:02:09.349> these<00:02:10.349> thicknesses<00:02:11.060> see

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
join them together these thicknesses see

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.059 
join them together these thicknesses see
that<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.870> then<00:02:13.319> you<00:02:13.410> try<00:02:13.620> and

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
that and then you try and

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.479 
that and then you try and
wined<00:02:14.640> these<00:02:15.769> things<00:02:16.769> together<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.280> gets

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
wined these things together and gets

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.710 
wined these things together and gets
gets<00:02:18.120> real<00:02:18.299> fat<00:02:18.599> and<00:02:18.989> so<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:20.549> because<00:02:21.450> of

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
gets real fat and so and so because of

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.539 
gets real fat and so and so because of
these<00:02:21.840> little<00:02:22.019> joints<00:02:22.349> to<00:02:22.409> get<00:02:22.560> fat<00:02:22.829> so<00:02:23.129> if<00:02:23.430> you

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
these little joints to get fat so if you

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.990 
these little joints to get fat so if you
want<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.989> fine<00:02:24.989> thread<00:02:25.319> that<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:26.519> have<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.819> use

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
want a fine thread that you have to use

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.990 
want a fine thread that you have to use
longer<00:02:27.930> fibers<00:02:28.560> that's<00:02:29.159> the<00:02:29.340> whole<00:02:29.519> idea<00:02:29.549> with

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
longer fibers that's the whole idea with

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.990 
longer fibers that's the whole idea with
these<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.510> with<00:02:31.349> this<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.950> good<00:02:32.159> cotton<00:02:32.549> it's

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
these and with this the good cotton it's

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.380 
these and with this the good cotton it's
just<00:02:33.180> for<00:02:33.360> instance<00:02:33.799> in<00:02:34.799> these<00:02:34.950> long<00:02:35.269> you<00:02:36.269> know

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
just for instance in these long you know

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.300 
just for instance in these long you know
joint<00:02:36.659> here<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.470> now<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.650> can<00:02:37.860> get<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:37.980> really

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
joint here and now you can get a really

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.390 
joint here and now you can get a really
long<00:02:38.730> thread<00:02:39.170> with<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.470> it's<00:02:40.650> real<00:02:41.040> small

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
long thread with and it's real small

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.770 
long thread with and it's real small
it's<00:02:42.120> real<00:02:42.950> thin<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.129> you<00:02:44.700> can<00:02:44.730> get<00:02:45.359> several

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
it's real thin and you can get several

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.610 
it's real thin and you can get several
of<00:02:46.049> these<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:47.329> wind<00:02:48.329> them<00:02:48.420> together<00:02:48.599> and<00:02:49.379> then

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
of these and wind them together and then

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.589 
of these and wind them together and then
you<00:02:49.650> have<00:02:49.859> a<00:02:49.890> really<00:02:50.370> strong<00:02:50.430> thread<00:02:51.000> so<00:02:51.480> what

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
you have a really strong thread so what

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.449 
you have a really strong thread so what
polyester<00:02:52.230> with<00:02:52.409> what<00:02:52.590> we<00:02:52.680> do<00:02:52.769> with<00:02:52.799> polyester

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
polyester with what we do with polyester

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.559 
polyester with what we do with polyester
is<00:02:54.329> is<00:02:55.489> since<00:02:56.489> it's<00:02:56.639> synthetic<00:02:56.970> they<00:02:57.239> can<00:02:57.389> have

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
is is since it's synthetic they can have

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.860 
is is since it's synthetic they can have
this<00:02:57.690> really<00:02:58.260> long<00:02:59.420> thread<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.629> then<00:03:00.750> they

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
this really long thread and then they

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.360 
this really long thread and then they
get<00:03:00.989> a<00:03:01.049> really<00:03:01.530> long<00:03:01.709> filament<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.310> the

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
get a really long filament and the

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.250 
get a really long filament and the
filament<00:03:02.489> thread<00:03:03.030> order<00:03:03.299> and<00:03:04.049> you<00:03:04.109> get

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
filament thread order and you get

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.280 
filament thread order and you get
another<00:03:04.440> one<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:05.209> you<00:03:06.209> have<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:06.930> know<00:03:07.019> four

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
another one and you have you know four

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.199 
another one and you have you know four
or<00:03:07.319> five<00:03:07.620> depends<00:03:07.980> on<00:03:08.040> how<00:03:08.129> many<00:03:08.190> how<00:03:09.000> thick

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
or five depends on how many how thick

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.449 
or five depends on how many how thick
you<00:03:09.329> want<00:03:09.359> it<00:03:09.709> and<00:03:10.709> they<00:03:11.129> don't<00:03:11.280> have<00:03:11.400> those

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
you want it and they don't have those

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.729 
you want it and they don't have those
little<00:03:11.579> joints<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.150> fall<00:03:12.329> apart<00:03:12.629> and<00:03:12.900> so<00:03:13.109> we

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
little joints to fall apart and so we

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.589 
little joints to fall apart and so we
use<00:03:13.859> the<00:03:14.010> polyester<00:03:14.400> thread<00:03:14.790> because<00:03:15.420> it's

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
use the polyester thread because it's

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.839 
use the polyester thread because it's
easy<00:03:15.750> long<00:03:16.019> continuous<00:03:16.620> filaments<00:03:17.069> UV

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
easy long continuous filaments UV

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.689 
easy long continuous filaments UV
resistant<00:03:18.389> and<00:03:18.540> it's<00:03:19.139> really<00:03:20.069> strong<00:03:20.340> stuff

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:20.699 
resistant and it's really strong stuff

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.960 
resistant and it's really strong stuff
and<00:03:21.349> you<00:03:22.349> wouldn't<00:03:22.590> know<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.799> but<00:03:23.040> we<00:03:23.310> use<00:03:23.549> the

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
and you wouldn't know it but we use the

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.589 
and you wouldn't know it but we use the
best<00:03:24.150> thread<00:03:24.449> weave<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:25.019> you<00:03:25.470> know<00:03:25.970> also<00:03:26.970> it's

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
best thread weave and you know also it's

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.390 
best thread weave and you know also it's
hard<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:27.930> tell<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.109> difference<00:03:28.199> like<00:03:28.650> way

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
hard to tell the difference like way

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.890

for<00:04:45.390> the<00:04:45.600> polyester<00:04:45.960> but<00:04:46.950> he<00:04:47.130> was<00:04:47.220> using<00:04:47.460> nylon

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
for the polyester but he was using nylon

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.430 
for the polyester but he was using nylon
because<00:04:48.030> he<00:04:48.270> was<00:04:48.390> saving<00:04:48.720> a<00:04:48.780> ton<00:04:48.930> of<00:04:48.990> money<00:04:49.080> and

because he was saving a ton of money and

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.320 
because he was saving a ton of money and
so<00:04:50.130> watch<00:04:50.400> out<00:04:50.810> that<00:04:51.810> you're<00:04:51.990> using<00:04:52.170> polyester

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
so watch out that you're using polyester

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.850 
so watch out that you're using polyester
instead<00:04:54.330> of<00:04:54.450> nylon<00:04:54.810> or<00:04:54.960> mixed<00:04:55.200> or<00:04:55.410> in<00:04:55.560> order<00:04:55.740> to

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
instead of nylon or mixed or in order to

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.960 
instead of nylon or mixed or in order to
make<00:04:55.980> sure<00:04:56.010> that<00:04:56.190> don't<00:04:56.580> people<00:04:56.820> aren't

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
make sure that don't people aren't

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.630 
make sure that don't people aren't
substituting<00:04:57.660> that's<00:04:58.200> the<00:04:58.470> killer<00:04:58.710> doing

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
substituting that's the killer doing

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.780 
substituting that's the killer doing
doing<00:05:00.270> the<00:05:00.470> manufacturing<00:05:01.470> in<00:05:01.920> a<00:05:02.550> lot<00:05:02.700> of

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
doing the manufacturing in a lot of

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.460 
doing the manufacturing in a lot of
places<00:05:02.970> is<00:05:03.330> that<00:05:03.360> less<00:05:03.630> they<00:05:03.810> substitute

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
places is that less they substitute

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.840 
places is that less they substitute
materials<00:05:04.920> so<00:05:05.010> that's<00:05:05.190> why<00:05:05.310> we<00:05:05.460> started<00:05:05.760> her

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
materials so that's why we started her

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.940 
materials so that's why we started her
own<00:05:05.970> stuff<00:05:06.300> our<00:05:06.900> own<00:05:07.080> making<00:05:07.500> our<00:05:07.650> own<00:05:07.740> bags

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
own stuff our own making our own bags

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.700 
own stuff our own making our own bags
because<00:05:08.370> we're<00:05:08.550> not<00:05:08.610> substituting<00:05:09.360> also<00:05:10.230> let

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
because we're not substituting also let

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.480 
because we're not substituting also let
me<00:05:10.800> tell<00:05:10.920> you<00:05:10.980> a<00:05:11.010> little<00:05:11.070> bit<00:05:11.190> about<00:05:11.340> the

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
good it's a real good balance between

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.950 
good it's a real good balance between
between<00:06:02.930> thread<00:06:03.930> and<00:06:05.030> in<00:06:06.030> leather<00:06:06.450> and<00:06:06.690> it's

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
between thread and in leather and it's

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.330 
between thread and in leather and it's
not<00:06:07.110> going<00:06:07.290> to<00:06:07.350> be<00:06:07.470> rely<00:06:07.710> too<00:06:07.919> much<00:06:07.950> on<00:06:08.190> either

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
not going to be rely too much on either

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.030 
not going to be rely too much on either
one<00:06:08.520> so<00:06:08.729> the<00:06:08.910> thread<00:06:09.120> tears<00:06:09.419> here<00:06:10.410> but<00:06:10.650> even

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 
one so the thread tears here but even

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.450 
one so the thread tears here but even
even<00:06:11.669> rocks<00:06:12.060> wear<00:06:12.300> away<00:06:12.419> so<00:06:12.570> the<00:06:12.930> thread<00:06:13.169> will

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
even rocks wear away so the thread will

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.700 
even rocks wear away so the thread will
eventually<00:06:14.460> tear<00:06:14.700> snag<00:06:15.710> eventually

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
eventually tear snag eventually

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.440 
eventually tear snag eventually
something's<00:06:17.190> gonna<00:06:17.280> happen<00:06:17.490> even<00:06:17.940> polyester

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.450 
something's gonna happen even polyester

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.770 
something's gonna happen even polyester
is<00:06:18.690> not<00:06:18.930> you<00:06:19.050> fully<00:06:19.530> UV<00:06:20.190> resistant<00:06:20.669> its<00:06:21.270> UV

resistant it's not UV proof okay so but

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.020
