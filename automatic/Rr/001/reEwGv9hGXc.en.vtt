making<00:01:52.950> sure<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.280> we're<00:01:53.460> hearing<00:01:53.880> what<00:01:54.060> our

audience has to say about our game I

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.190 
audience has to say about our game I
think<00:01:56.369> our<00:01:56.460> new<00:01:56.549> Maps<00:01:56.790> address<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.780> we're

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
think our new Maps address that we're

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.420 
think our new Maps address that we're
going<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.590> few<00:01:58.619> different<00:01:58.830> ways

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
going in a few different ways

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.530 
going in a few different ways
we'll<00:01:59.520> get<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.759> definitely<00:02:00.090> going<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.330> a<00:02:00.360> more

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
we'll get you definitely going to a more

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.660 
we'll get you definitely going to a more
intimate<00:02:00.840> feel<00:02:00.960> overall<00:02:01.530> our<00:02:02.130> maps<00:02:02.490> are

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
intimate feel overall our maps are

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.399 
intimate feel overall our maps are
smaller<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.330> this<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:03.990> maps<00:02:04.170> we<00:02:04.350> were

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
smaller and this is the maps we were

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.230 
smaller and this is the maps we were
offered<00:02:04.649> in<00:02:04.740> resistance<00:02:05.130> 2<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.820> we<00:02:06.030> really

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
offered in resistance 2 and we really

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.900 
offered in resistance 2 and we really
wanted<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.509> kind<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.750> up<00:02:06.930> teamwork<00:02:07.440> up<00:02:08.280> like

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
wanted to kind of up teamwork up like

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.300 
wanted to kind of up teamwork up like
strategy<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.750> basically<00:02:10.050> make<00:02:10.770> people<00:02:11.130> feel

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
strategy and basically make people feel

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.920 
strategy and basically make people feel
like<00:02:11.489> they<00:02:11.700> were<00:02:11.760> going<00:02:12.360> head<00:02:12.630> to<00:02:12.660> head<00:02:12.780> with

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
like they were going head to head with

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.780 
like they were going head to head with
people<00:02:13.350> not<00:02:13.440> looking<00:02:13.800> for<00:02:13.950> people<00:02:14.100> in<00:02:14.310> larger

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
people not looking for people in larger

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.670 
people not looking for people in larger
environments<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:15.570> think<00:02:16.080> we<00:02:16.170> get<00:02:16.290> some<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:16.620> that

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
environments I think we get some of that

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.440 
environments I think we get some of that
with<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.830> larger<00:02:17.250> spectacle<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:17.940> resistance

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
with a larger spectacle and resistance

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.759 
with a larger spectacle and resistance
to<00:02:18.630> but<00:02:18.780> we<00:02:18.840> really<00:02:19.080> wanted<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.380> focus<00:02:19.500> on<00:02:19.739> a

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
to but we really wanted to focus on a

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.580 
to but we really wanted to focus on a
smaller<00:02:20.209> game<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:21.420> strategy<00:02:21.840> as<00:02:21.930> well<00:02:22.080> we

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
smaller game and strategy as well we

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.780 
smaller game and strategy as well we
really<00:02:22.620> wanted<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.100> make<00:02:23.220> it<00:02:23.280> feel<00:02:23.489> like<00:02:23.640> you

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
really wanted to make it feel like you

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.160 
really wanted to make it feel like you
were<00:02:23.820> immersed<00:02:24.120> in<00:02:24.269> the<00:02:24.360> resistance<00:02:24.690> universe

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
were immersed in the resistance universe

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.170
