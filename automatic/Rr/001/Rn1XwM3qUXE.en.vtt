00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.820 

all<00:00:00.630> right<00:00:00.810> we're<00:00:01.410> gonna<00:00:01.500> do<00:00:03.440> I'm<00:00:04.440> gonna<00:00:04.529> try

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
all right we're gonna do I'm gonna try

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.980 
all right we're gonna do I'm gonna try
to<00:00:04.859> do<00:00:05.009> all<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.460> scales<00:00:05.779> without<00:00:06.779> there

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
to do all the scales without there

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.450 
to do all the scales without there
really<00:00:07.140> being<00:00:07.379> lessons<00:00:07.890> around<00:00:08.189> them<00:00:08.340> but

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
really being lessons around them but

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.040 
really being lessons around them but
just<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.790> scales<00:00:09.150> and<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.540> order<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:09.840> I

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
just the scales and the order that I

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.830 
just the scales and the order that I
think<00:00:10.290> you<00:00:10.410> should<00:00:10.440> start<00:00:10.889> learning<00:00:11.880> them<00:00:12.059> the

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
think you should start learning them the

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.109 
think you should start learning them the
first<00:00:13.080> one<00:00:13.410> is<00:00:14.929> the<00:00:16.039> minor<00:00:17.039> pentatonic<00:00:17.609> scale

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
first one is the minor pentatonic scale

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.220 
first one is the minor pentatonic scale
I<00:00:18.240> think<00:00:18.270> that's<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.660> best<00:00:18.869> one<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.170> start

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
I think that's the best one to start

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:41.869 
I think that's the best one to start
with<00:00:37.160> the<00:00:38.160> root<00:00:38.340> on<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.520> e<00:00:38.640> string<00:00:40.670> so<00:00:41.670> if<00:00:41.790> I

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
with the root on the e string so if I

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.850 
with the root on the e string so if I
played<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> minor<00:00:42.809> pentatonic<00:00:43.260> but<00:00:43.739> there

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
played the a minor pentatonic but there

00:00:43.860 --> 00:01:04.030 
played the a minor pentatonic but there
was<00:00:43.950> on<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.129> E<00:00:44.160> string

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.590 

so<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.880> root<00:01:06.119> 5th<00:01:06.509> frets<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.259> five<00:01:07.560> eight

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
so a is the root 5th frets of five eight

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.620 
so a is the root 5th frets of five eight
five<00:01:09.600> seven<00:01:10.229> five<00:01:10.860> seven<00:01:11.930> five<00:01:12.930> seven<00:01:14.630> five

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
five seven five seven five seven five

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.070 
five seven five seven five seven five
eight<00:01:15.990> five<00:01:16.619> eight<00:01:17.600> it's<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.689> first<00:01:18.899> thing

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
eight five eight it's the first thing

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.039 
eight five eight it's the first thing
you<00:01:19.140> want<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.500> learn<00:01:19.649> then<00:01:20.640> after<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.330> we

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
you want to learn then after that we

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.080 
you want to learn then after that we
want<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.289> learn<00:01:22.470> its<00:01:22.770> extension<00:01:23.520> which<00:01:23.880> would

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
want to learn its extension which would

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.969 
want to learn its extension which would
the<00:01:24.179> roots<00:01:24.360> still<00:01:24.630> there<00:01:24.810> go<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> whole<00:01:25.679> step

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
the roots still there go a whole step

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.649 
the roots still there go a whole step
below<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.700> three<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.149> five<00:01:27.360> with<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
first and ring then three to five on the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.309 
first and ring then three to five on the
next<00:01:33.659> one<00:01:33.840> slide<00:01:34.679> with<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.950> ring<00:01:35.100> finger<00:01:36.319> now

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
next one slide with the ring finger now

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.260 
next one slide with the ring finger now
five<00:01:38.159> seven<00:01:38.610> on<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.200> d-57<00:01:40.200> on<00:01:40.440> the<00:01:40.530> G<00:01:41.270> note

five seven on the d-57 on the G note

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.999 
five seven on the d-57 on the G note
instead<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.720> going<00:01:43.140> which<00:01:43.350> still<00:01:43.709> part<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
instead of going which still part of the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.730 
instead of going which still part of the
scale<00:01:44.250> up<00:01:44.549> here<00:01:44.819> but<00:01:45.000> we're<00:01:45.090> gonna<00:01:45.179> slide<00:01:45.600> up

when<00:02:09.690> you're<00:02:09.810> playing<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:11.160> scale<00:02:11.489> slide

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
when you're playing the that scale slide

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.390 
when you're playing the that scale slide
with<00:02:12.000> your<00:02:12.120> ring<00:02:12.269> fingers<00:02:12.629> start<00:02:12.900> with<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:13.920> get

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
with your ring fingers start with so get

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.670 
with your ring fingers start with so get
comfortable<00:02:14.790> with<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.390> even<00:02:16.349> if<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.500> don't

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680

comfortable with that even if you don't
know<00:02:16.769> how<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:16.920> use<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.340> yet<00:02:17.459> that's<00:02:17.730> something

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
know how to use it yet that's something

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.100 
know how to use it yet that's something
that's<00:02:18.239> really<00:02:18.300> worthwhile<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:19.260> practice

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.170
