figure<00:00:35.180> just<00:00:36.180> for<00:00:36.329> like<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.510> size<00:00:36.780> comparison

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
figure just for like a size comparison

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.130 
figure just for like a size comparison
like<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.469> usually<00:00:37.590> do<00:00:38.690> here<00:00:39.690> we<00:00:39.989> have

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
like I usually do here we have

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.910 
like I usually do here we have
generation<00:00:40.800> 1<00:00:41.690> sideswipe<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.649> can<00:00:43.770> see

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
generation 1 sideswipe so you can see

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.110 
generation 1 sideswipe so you can see
the<00:00:44.190> size<00:00:44.610> difference<00:00:44.640> there

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
the size difference there

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.139 
the size difference there
he's<00:00:48.120> got<00:00:48.390> says<00:00:49.309> one<00:00:50.309> weapon<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.670> one<00:00:50.879> nor

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
he's got says one weapon in one nor

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.950 
he's got says one weapon in one nor
shield<00:00:51.480> his<00:00:52.020> shield<00:00:52.320> basically<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.280> whole

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
shield his shield basically is the whole

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.930 
shield his shield basically is the whole
top<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.110> his<00:00:55.230> roof<00:00:55.410> plus<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.949> back<00:00:56.190> back

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
top of his roof plus the back back

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.930 
top of his roof plus the back back
window<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.809> it's<00:00:58.109> alright<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.670> they<00:00:59.670> kind<00:00:59.879> of

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
window so it's alright it's they kind of

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.250 
window so it's alright it's they kind of
just<00:01:00.120> threw<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.420> there<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.660> think<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:01.079> to

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
just threw it in there I think just to

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.470 
just threw it in there I think just to
use<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.039> at<00:01:02.340> least<00:01:02.370> it's<00:01:02.699> being<00:01:02.969> used<00:01:03.210> and

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
use it so at least it's being used and

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.479 
use it so at least it's being used and
it's<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.899> know<00:01:04.019> it's<00:01:04.650> not<00:01:04.769> just<00:01:04.830> something

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
it's you know it's not just something

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.420 
it's you know it's not just something
you<00:01:05.610> don't<00:01:06.030> use<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.869> robot<00:01:07.140> form<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.740> we

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
you don't use in the robot form and we

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.719 
you don't use in the robot form and we
also<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:09.210> very<00:01:09.659> nice<00:01:09.979> weapon<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.159> as

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
usual this is a representative of his

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.160 
usual this is a representative of his
motor<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.250> actually<00:01:14.400> has<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.810> Mitchie<00:01:15.810> BC

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
would see in an Evo in terms of the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:30.440 
would see in an Evo in terms of the
engine<00:01:22.490> here's<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.640> weapon<00:01:28.040> and<00:01:29.040> if<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.939> see

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
engine here's the weapon and if you see

engine here's the weapon and if you see
my<00:01:30.600> other<00:01:30.659> robot<00:01:31.079> reviews<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.530> know<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.890> and

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
my other robot reviews you know this and

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.770 
my other robot reviews you know this and
car<00:01:32.700> mode<00:01:32.850> gets<00:01:33.060> stored<00:01:33.240> inside<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.659> engine

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780

here so it's pretty nice and let's go

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.330 
here so it's pretty nice and let's go
ahead<00:02:20.239> and<00:02:20.360> take<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.480> look<00:02:20.690> give<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.470> 360<00:02:22.040> like<00:02:22.220> I

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
ahead and take a look give a 360 like I

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:30.040 
ahead and take a look give a 360 like I
usually<00:02:22.489> do<00:02:27.819> and<00:02:28.819> now<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.150> back<00:02:29.450> here<00:02:29.780> is

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050
