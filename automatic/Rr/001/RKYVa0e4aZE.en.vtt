00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.430
 Oh 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.939
 well it's friends that is more 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.460
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.580
 new video for episode 32 dirt or 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.290
 damage so that's good 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.820
 had gone to sleep finally we are 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.460
 there for episode 32 you guys are in 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.960
 division 2 and largely means of 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.769
 go into division one and we stay 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.510
 four matches we need at 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:37.830
 minimum six points again so it turns 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.480
 two wins in four matches that's 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.620
 largely feasible and I think you 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.650
 think about it but I think that a way 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.699
 to shit he's hurt what we read 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.870
 to lower it's not serious we played with 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.309
 the other team even if it's even 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.089
 same can go over very 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.440
 competitive 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.760
 you will see that we will get there 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.559
 not even changed anymore but she did not 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.260
 of contract is definitely not going well 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.120
 it's not very close we're going to him 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.280
 put a little contract manolas I have 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.269
 yes weekend so here we will continue 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.960
 this team there even if it is not 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.280
 competitive 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.629
 you will see that we will win the match 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.159
 I feel it I'm hot there you 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.479
 imagine you do not imagine I'm too 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.950
 young and I do not do that to do it 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.390
 you need corner I'm like so it's 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.040
 we made this cable I hope that you 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.180
 Please anyway maybe I 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.880
 do not recognize that at the end of these two seen 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.960
 that there is the head that is available at 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.880
 the team of the tournament 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.770
 we have little by little English is 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.030
 the team can just with 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.320
 the best players in the hold then to 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.250
 also the usual team of the week 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.800
 which is available in the bins 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.090
 so here we go for this first 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.480
 match maybe I would open to 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.850
 Easter 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.230
 I can run two ways at the end of 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.690
 video and there we fall against a team 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.120
 not bad at all a series is not bad 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.160

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.290
 Puffin mousse a beautiful series ya 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.880
 not bad to aim mart mine at the oci 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.710
 which was also good time you go 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.050

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.710
 partes 0.6 but to see if it's not 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.500

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.190

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:18.299
 to say here I am not to Italian see 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:20.040
 how does it make 1-0 you have to win the 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:23.610
 match takes the three points this is the 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.900
 basis of a budget its basis by cons 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.910
 be careful not to be too confident if you 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.700
 is too confident mertens let's keep these 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.660

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:05.120
 pelo I knew at fault but it's not 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.790
 it's not voluntary on my part what 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.840
 I did not make the move finally me I did not 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.489

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.760
 empty to win without taking but it's 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:33.290

 maybe not good care of there in the 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.730
 finish but in any case action was 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.950
 not my part when we give them but 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:52.639
 it was well played in the game not fucking 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:54.380

 we managed to take the three points 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.570
 it's essential 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.460
 so that means we miss him 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.970
 a victory to access division 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.770

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.240
 we can still hope otis ya not 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.440

 share of which one falls against a team 2 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.780
 ppl series has Brazilian to a small mix 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.860
 we're going to say that with mario 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.930
 balotelli in tip but we have 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.400
 the team in not the things I hope 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.200
 we will win that just go on 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.880
 intercepts do not intercept attention 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.840
 will quickly go against the attack is not 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.150
 that he manages to give his balloon for 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:36.060
 balotelli it's blocked it's downright 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:40.110
 thrown benzema the little roulette our 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.070
 hooks oh yes karim yes we open the 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.290
 score is well played 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:47.310
 he did it alone he made 1-0 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:50.910
 nor did she like it niquette but here 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:53.970
 he even fell this fragile tension 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.100
 penalty penalty penalty at beautiful pass 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.830
 they equalize they equalize it 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:01.310
 well played it's deserved it sucks 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.310
 but it's deserved 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:09.900
 go again 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:12.000
 pol pot by sop advantage before the break 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.020
 well played that's griezmann who has 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.870
 tried to do a little lonely raid 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:22.200
 did not happen but pop baïla he finished 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:25.980
 the perfect job and he did the 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.750
 bad technical choices win 2 goals 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.100
 at 1 it is not exceptional but 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.590
 the main thing is the three points like 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.910
 usually friends that means that 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.560
 we go to division 1 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.360
 we have two games left to win 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.590
 the title I think I'll check 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.880
 how many points is it exactly I 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.080
 know no more so the old ones 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.250
 the bottom line is that we are already in d1 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.630
 it's already quite a good thing 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.470
 I want to tell you so announce me 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.510
