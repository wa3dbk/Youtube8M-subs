00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.560
 Evaluation of a contest but now 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.980
 is it so far I will get you now 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.090
 right after all all videos 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.480
 would say no, of course not 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.810
 all background pictures show me 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.880
 were sent in and by the way would like 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.410

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.550
 that they can buy the land 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.399
 more information is also available in one 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.670
 separate video so as I said 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.760
 Now show you the backgrounds 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.040
 The selection is therefore the channel 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.440
 design that should then win you are allowed 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.170
 you can decide each time once 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.280

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.960
 and for all those who vote there 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.600

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.890
 videos for all that 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.820
 diligently watching all channels backgrounds 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.340
 You can see that at the runtime of the video 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.220
 is not that long that means you can 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:23.340

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.170
 So then have fun with the videos and 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.820

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.159
