you

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.990 

all<00:00:27.340> right<00:00:27.910> here's<00:00:28.300> the<00:00:28.390> saturn<00:00:28.900> vue<00:00:29.110> cv<00:00:30.000> t

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
all right here's the saturn vue cv t

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.630 
all right here's the saturn vue cv t
that<00:00:31.360> we<00:00:31.480> we<00:00:31.869> put<00:00:32.050> the<00:00:32.200> CBT<00:00:32.650> inside<00:00:33.010> this<00:00:33.190> car

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
that we we put the CBT inside this car

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.240 
that we we put the CBT inside this car
here<00:00:33.880> we're<00:00:34.660> going<00:00:34.809> to<00:00:34.870> drive<00:00:35.170> this<00:00:35.440> remember

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
here we're going to drive this remember

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.030 
here we're going to drive this remember
what<00:00:36.400> I<00:00:36.430> did<00:00:36.760> to<00:00:37.000> that<00:00:37.150> primary<00:00:37.960> variator<00:00:38.739> I

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
what I did to that primary variator I

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.910 
what I did to that primary variator I
took<00:00:39.730> the<00:00:39.879> balls<00:00:40.090> out<00:00:40.360> and<00:00:40.629> put<00:00:41.410> those<00:00:41.590> rods

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
took the balls out and put those rods

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.860 
took the balls out and put those rods
there<00:00:42.340> in<00:00:42.550> place<00:00:42.910> for<00:00:43.239> it<00:00:43.330> to<00:00:43.420> slide<00:00:43.660> up

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
there in place for it to slide up

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.610 
there in place for it to slide up
against<00:00:44.230> the<00:00:44.320> rods<00:00:44.559> now<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.930> way<00:00:47.080> the<00:00:47.230> CVT

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
against the rods now the way the CVT

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.369 
against the rods now the way the CVT
operates<00:00:48.449> it<00:00:49.449> doesn't<00:00:49.780> shift<00:00:49.930> like<00:00:50.140> a<00:00:50.170> regular

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
operates it doesn't shift like a regular

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.350 
operates it doesn't shift like a regular
transmission<00:00:51.160> in<00:00:51.250> fact<00:00:51.460> it<00:00:51.610> doesn't<00:00:51.790> shift<00:00:52.150> at

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
transmission in fact it doesn't shift at

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.950 
transmission in fact it doesn't shift at
all<00:00:52.510> it<00:00:53.350> just<00:00:53.410> kind<00:00:53.890> of<00:00:54.420> does<00:00:55.420> what<00:00:55.449> to<00:00:55.690> say<00:00:55.839> it

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
all it just kind of does what to say it

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.340 
all it just kind of does what to say it
variates<00:00:56.500> the<00:00:56.800> ratio<00:00:57.220> is<00:00:58.120> very<00:00:58.180> smooth<00:00:58.719> just

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
variates the ratio is very smooth just

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.130 
variates the ratio is very smooth just
like<00:00:59.500> a<00:00:59.530> scooter<00:01:00.010> so<00:01:00.270> what<00:01:01.270> we're<00:01:01.420> gonna<00:01:01.570> do<00:01:01.809> we

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
like a scooter so what we're gonna do we

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:09.630 
like a scooter so what we're gonna do we
you<00:01:02.469> look<00:01:02.649> at<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:02.920> RPMs<00:01:03.460> and<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.869> RPMs<00:01:08.610> when<00:01:09.610> I

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
you look at the RPMs and the RPMs when I

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.340 
you look at the RPMs and the RPMs when I
first<00:01:10.000> start<00:01:10.330> off<00:01:10.450> should<00:01:11.940> go<00:01:12.940> up<00:01:13.149> past<00:01:13.539> 2,000

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
first start off should go up past 2,000

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.270 
first start off should go up past 2,000
rpms<00:01:14.860> taking<00:01:15.280> off<00:01:15.430> however<00:01:16.390> as<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
rpms taking off however as the

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.350 
rpms taking off however as the
transmission<00:01:19.060> begins<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:19.750> vary<00:01:20.399> the<00:01:21.399> ratio<00:01:21.880> it

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
transmission begins to vary the ratio it

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.960 
transmission begins to vary the ratio it
should<00:01:22.720> drop<00:01:23.580> below<00:01:25.500> 2000<00:01:26.500> if<00:01:26.710> it<00:01:27.310> is<00:01:27.430> dropping

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
should drop below 2000 if it is dropping

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.130 
should drop below 2000 if it is dropping
below<00:01:28.180> 2000<00:01:29.140> and<00:01:29.350> I'm<00:01:29.800> going<00:01:30.599> the<00:01:31.599> faster<00:01:32.020> that

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
below 2000 and I'm going the faster that

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.999 
below 2000 and I'm going the faster that
I<00:01:32.200> go<00:01:32.700> then<00:01:33.700> it<00:01:34.240> is<00:01:34.869> doing<00:01:35.200> its<00:01:35.380> job<00:01:35.590> so<00:01:35.890> we're

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
I go then it is doing its job so we're

00:01:36.009 --> 00:02:50.060 
I go then it is doing its job so we're
gonna<00:01:36.130> see<00:01:36.340> how<00:01:36.459> this<00:01:36.640> work

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.760 

this<00:02:51.070> is<00:02:51.310> your<00:02:51.550> end<00:02:51.790> in<00:02:52.300> fire<00:02:52.630> then<00:02:52.660> we<00:02:53.620> should

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
this is your end in fire then we should

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:38.700 
this is your end in fire then we should
all<00:02:53.980> burn<00:02:54.190> together

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:04:04.390 

halation

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:50.110 

that<00:04:04.909> would<00:04:05.150> be<00:04:05.269> sweet

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.840 

that<00:04:51.120> means<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:51.540> variator<00:04:52.020> is<00:04:52.350> very<00:04:52.850> to

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
that means the variator is very to

00:04:53.850 --> 00:06:32.959 
that means the variator is very to
settle<00:04:54.720> down<00:04:54.870> on<00:04:55.170> no<00:04:55.350> chef

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:32.969 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:50.300 

variator

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.310 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.490 

pretty<00:06:50.940> good

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.500 
pretty good

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.560 
pretty good
you
