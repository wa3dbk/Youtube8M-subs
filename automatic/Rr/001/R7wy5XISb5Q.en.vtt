 in a small town that became famous 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.960

 the houses are far from each other and 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.790
 because of the cold there is no movement in the 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.000
 streets

 still almost everyone has seen something 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.110
 of the sky that has no explanation 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.629
 this man of 78 years claims to have 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.930
 witnessed more than 100 phenomena 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.829
 strangers tokic he says that in the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.230
 first time 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.320
 were three lights on the horizon but 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.989
 suddenly began to change places and 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.379
 has re-established with the increasingly 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.660
 from 1981 onwards. 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.080
 suffered an invasion of the curious and

 fires with so many different people around here 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.700
 unexplained phenomenon and the lack of 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.500
 employment many people have decided 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.350
 abandon their homes 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.470
 the community today has about 120 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.549
 families living here for half of the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.950
 which existed in 1980 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.380
 in this bar a poster accuses the curiosity 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.750
 of the visitors on the dance floor a

 painting depicts another phenomenon without 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.799
 explanation 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.150
 the owner says that at the top of the mountain a 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:42.210
 ship may have landed sound informed one 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.329
 two-tonne earth plate was 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.149
 withdrawing a surgical cut none 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.689
 machine was used and to this day no one 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.520
 You know what happened here from the top of one of the 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.189
 mountains of rescue and we got 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.380
 have a panoramic view of the valley 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.340
 there was a time when they happened in this 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.130
 between 20 and 28 phenomena per 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.979
 week and the explanation for all this may 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.330
 be right under our feet in a 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.300
 15 kilometers away 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.550
 This university professor of the phone 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.980
 searched the area and found that 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.860
 area is rich in minerals the funk pop 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.320
 mendonça tries to find out if the basement has 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.360
 some relation with the phenomena 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.060
 he is part of the group that installed this 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.110
 container on top of a mountain is a 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.820
 observatory with sensor radars 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.840
 electromagnetic radiation and cameras 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:40.270
 everything that happens 24 hours a day 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.320
 and classified the apparitions in three 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.600
 groups 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.370
 big yellow lights that stay in the sky 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.350
 for up to two hours 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.120
 white and blue flashes that 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.580
 fast moving 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.140
 there are still the lights that seem 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.140
 attract other light points 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.810
 everything was documented by the researchers 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.510
 objects captured in images and 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.520
 radars 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.310
 Some lights even move to a 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.240
 speed of 30 thousand kilometers per 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.220
 hour 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.590
 a lot of people think these are things 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.080
 very crazy says the teacher 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.500
 in this time he thinks that the apparitions 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.590
 are real but the silent lights of 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.769
 remain still remain as a great 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.769
 mystery
