00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:16.410
 in front of the TV cameras were in Switzerland and more 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.359
 especially in the zurich region known for that only for the 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:20.330
 presentation 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.330
 the third on yesterday's editions 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.310
 so I want to give up 17 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.789
 the q5 here is now the q3 at the style level 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:38.659
 it's still classic and a step of revolution we are less used to 

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:41.479
 drop out of high school and especially since five by deduction 

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:44.319
 we find some characteristic features of the brand when by 

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:46.129
 example the grille 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.149
 if the fn 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.149
 but also diode lights in the front but also in the back 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.500
 so here we are intel audi q3 disappointed for the moment relatively 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.650
 classical 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.800
 no problem at the level of the assembly small flat concerning the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.909
 used materials 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.289
 especially the bottom of the center console 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:03.479
 push a little too hard 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:07.930
 knowing that a small of products audi the ball satisfactory presentation of the 

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:10.740
 equipment and remains very complete from the first level of finish with 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.049
 for example air conditioning you have a multimedia system with screen 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.410
 retractable policemen for example globally so it's a good pack etc 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.620
 from the entry level 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.270
 then no problem at the level of the back vitality of the believe that one can 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.080
 find it instead that it is at the level of the legs of the roof guard and 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.080
 good point the transmission tunnel this is not very important 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.230
 in one month it's in front of the q3's safe 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.110
 positive points its volume that oscillates between 460 and 1300 on the second 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.280
 plot larger than its main competitor a symbol of new 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.310
 investors 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.700
 good point also regarding its precarious forms and patina still for 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.630
 change 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.100
 blame the relatively high loading threshold 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.470
 and finally walking here 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.580
 you do not know that did not embarrass you 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.900
 the q3 will be available on console with three engines two most gasoline 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.940
 quickly possible 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.040
 270 and 200 horsepower and a diesel the tdi estimate of 177 horses will follow 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.830
 then in a few months the quote tdi 140 horses graze peacefully in 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.759
 mechanical gearbox and two-wheel drive and then 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:19.599
 the pounds 5 9 and 6 of 300 horses for our test we had between the 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.699
 hands the summer of 2005 on the 7 horses coupled to the box s tronic the 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:26.290
 quattro transmission a rather happy marriage 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.329
 half-time thanks in particular to the engine torque growth in 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:30.629
 conditionings 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.379
 body movements are well controlled which makes it comfortable 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.859
 pity that the box react parcels strangely gone from his 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.309
 over-verse couplet 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:41.859
 even if q3 does not adopt a terrified aesthetic bias he responds 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.929
 perfectly to the expectations of the owners follow me with a 

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:49.079
 comfortable vehicle livable but abercrombie a good synthesis and 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:53.849
 the q3 is marketed on October 20 next rates also the amf the 29 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.619
 May 1901 regroups and 44 minutes 150 euros
