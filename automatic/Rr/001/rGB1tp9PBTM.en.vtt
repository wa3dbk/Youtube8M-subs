using<00:00:14.320> control<00:00:14.770> points<00:00:15.160> and<00:00:15.309> how<00:00:15.790> we<00:00:15.850> can

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.180 
using control points and how we can

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.750 
using control points and how we can
selectively<00:00:16.810> apply<00:00:17.410> filters<00:00:17.980> or<00:00:18.430> maybe

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.760 
selectively apply filters or maybe

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.260 
selectively apply filters or maybe

the infrared film filter in this case

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.750 
the infrared film filter in this case
which<00:00:31.810> is<00:00:32.080> then<00:00:32.260> applied<00:00:32.410> to<00:00:32.949> our<00:00:32.980> preview<00:00:33.580> and

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
which is then applied to our preview and

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.130 
which is then applied to our preview and
you<00:00:33.820> can<00:00:34.000> see<00:00:34.210> in<00:00:34.420> our<00:00:34.510> stack<00:00:34.900> on<00:00:35.110> the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
you can see in our stack on the

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.650 
you can see in our stack on the
right-hand<00:00:35.650> side<00:00:35.739> of<00:00:36.070> the<00:00:36.129> interface<00:00:36.660> from

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.270 
right-hand side of the interface from
there<00:00:37.930> we're<00:00:38.230> going<00:00:38.350> to<00:00:38.410> just<00:00:38.590> adjust<00:00:38.739> it<00:00:39.160> as

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
there we're going to just adjust it as

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.000 
there we're going to just adjust it as
we<00:00:39.550> see<00:00:39.790> fit<00:00:40.120> and<00:00:40.300> in<00:00:40.840> this<00:00:41.020> case<00:00:41.320> I<00:00:41.559> want<00:00:41.920> to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
we see fit and in this case I want to

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.110 
we see fit and in this case I want to
use<00:00:42.190> my<00:00:42.430> infrared<00:00:42.850> film<00:00:43.329> color<00:00:43.809> number<00:00:44.559> 5<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:46.090> I

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
use my infrared film color number 5 so I

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.209 
use my infrared film color number 5 so I
changed<00:00:46.540> my<00:00:46.660> method<00:00:47.050> make<00:00:47.800> all<00:00:47.950> of<00:00:47.980> our

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
changed my method make all of our

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:49.350 
changed my method make all of our
different<00:00:48.550> adjustments<00:00:49.059> I'm<00:00:49.180> going<00:00:49.300> to

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
different adjustments I'm going to

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.729 
different adjustments I'm going to
increase<00:00:49.660> the<00:00:49.840> highlight<00:00:50.230> or<00:00:50.410> lighten

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
increase the highlight or lighten

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.470 
increase the highlight or lighten
highlights<00:00:51.100> I'm<00:00:51.760> going<00:00:51.910> to<00:00:51.969> brighten<00:00:52.329> up<00:00:52.420> the

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
highlights I'm going to brighten up the

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.810 
highlights I'm going to brighten up the
whole<00:00:52.840> image<00:00:53.170> to<00:00:53.410> about<00:00:53.590> 50%<00:00:53.950> in<00:00:54.430> this<00:00:54.579> case

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
whole image to about 50% in this case

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.190 
whole image to about 50% in this case
then<00:00:55.239> I'm<00:00:55.300> just<00:00:55.450> going<00:00:55.570> to<00:00:55.600> reduce<00:00:55.750> a<00:00:56.050> little

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
then I'm just going to reduce a little

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.670 
then I'm just going to reduce a little
bit<00:00:56.350> of<00:00:56.500> contrast<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:58.239> to<00:00:58.329> apply<00:00:58.660> our<00:00:59.200> filters

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
bit of contrast so to apply our filters

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.369 
bit of contrast so to apply our filters
selectively<00:01:00.250> only<00:01:00.910> on<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.120> leaves<00:01:01.329> we<00:01:02.200> turn

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
selectively only on the leaves we turn

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.320 
selectively only on the leaves we turn
to<00:01:02.500> control<00:01:02.860> points<00:01:03.190> you<00:01:03.940> have<00:01:04.030> two<00:01:04.210> different

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
to control points you have two different

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.760 
to control points you have two different
kinds<00:01:04.509> of<00:01:04.839> control<00:01:05.199> points<00:01:05.470> on<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.649> right

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
kinds of control points on the right

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.800 
kinds of control points on the right
hand<00:01:05.979> side<00:01:06.070> you<00:01:06.700> have<00:01:06.820> plus<00:01:07.060> control<00:01:07.479> points

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
hand side you have plus control points

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.510 
hand side you have plus control points
which<00:01:08.110> will<00:01:08.289> allow<00:01:08.470> us<00:01:08.649> to<00:01:08.680> put<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.039> filter<00:01:09.250> in

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
which will allow us to put the filter in

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.760 
which will allow us to put the filter in
in<00:01:09.789> a<00:01:09.850> particular<00:01:10.119> area<00:01:10.479> and<00:01:10.720> a<00:01:11.110> minus<00:01:11.410> control

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
in a particular area and a minus control

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.740 
in a particular area and a minus control
point<00:01:11.979> which<00:01:12.340> will<00:01:12.490> actually<00:01:12.610> remove<00:01:13.539> the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
point which will actually remove the

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.279 
point which will actually remove the
effect<00:01:14.050> from<00:01:14.380> a<00:01:14.470> particular<00:01:14.770> area<00:01:15.300> now<00:01:16.300> we

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
effect from a particular area now we

want<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:17.590> effect<00:01:17.860> just<00:01:18.039> on<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.310> leaves<00:01:18.550> so<00:01:19.030> we

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
want the effect just on the leaves so we

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.419 
want the effect just on the leaves so we
click<00:01:19.330> the<00:01:19.539> plus<00:01:19.720> button<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.860> turns<00:01:21.220> our

software's<00:01:52.509> doing<00:01:52.720> a<00:01:52.780> great<00:01:52.959> job<00:01:53.020> to<00:01:53.649> really

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
software's doing a great job to really

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.760 
software's doing a great job to really
just<00:01:54.220> put<00:01:54.489> the<00:01:54.610> effect<00:01:54.940> in<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.209> leaves<00:01:55.560> but<00:01:56.560> if

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
just put the effect in the leaves but if

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.469 
just put the effect in the leaves but if
we<00:01:57.009> toggle<00:01:57.369> this<00:01:57.610> on<00:01:57.759> and<00:01:57.940> off<00:01:58.000> a<00:01:58.030> couple<00:01:58.330> times

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
we toggle this on and off a couple times

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.330 
we toggle this on and off a couple times
you'll<00:01:58.810> notice<00:01:59.110> the<00:01:59.259> background<00:01:59.500> is<00:02:00.009> being

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
you'll notice the background is being

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.300 
you'll notice the background is being
affected<00:02:00.880> ever<00:02:01.090> so<00:02:01.390> slightly<00:02:01.690> and<00:02:02.140> we<00:02:03.099> don't

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
affected ever so slightly and we don't

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.889 
affected ever so slightly and we don't
want<00:02:03.520> that<00:02:03.759> filter<00:02:04.179> to<00:02:04.209> be<00:02:04.360> applied<00:02:04.630> in<00:02:04.810> the

background

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.850 
background
so<00:02:06.099> we<00:02:06.759> click<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.209> minus<00:02:07.390> button<00:02:07.569> and<00:02:07.989> we

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
so we click the minus button and we

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.160 
so we click the minus button and we
simply<00:02:09.069> place<00:02:09.700> a<00:02:09.729> minus<00:02:10.300> control<00:02:10.750> point<00:02:10.989> in

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
simply place a minus control point in

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.870 
simply place a minus control point in
the<00:02:11.260> background<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.130> what<00:02:12.550> that's<00:02:12.700> going<00:02:12.819> to

the background and what that's going to

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.330 
the background and what that's going to
do<00:02:13.090> is<00:02:13.360> remove<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:14.200> filter<00:02:14.590> effect<00:02:14.739> from<00:02:15.220> the

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.280 
particular image in this case there's
only<00:03:27.700> one<00:03:28.030> control<00:03:28.239> point<00:03:28.660> so<00:03:29.019> that's<00:03:29.140> all

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
only one control point so that's all

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.830 
only one control point so that's all
you're<00:03:29.410> seeing<00:03:29.590> now<00:03:30.400> what<00:03:31.300> you're<00:03:31.510> able<00:03:31.690> to

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
you're seeing now what you're able to

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.170 
you're seeing now what you're able to
see<00:03:32.080> is<00:03:32.260> anything<00:03:32.920> in<00:03:33.100> white<00:03:33.400> is<00:03:33.610> what's<00:03:33.970> being

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
see is anything in white is what's being

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.540 
see is anything in white is what's being
selected<00:03:34.720> that's<00:03:35.440> what<00:03:35.769> has<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.190> infrared

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.880 
selected that's what has the infrared
film<00:03:36.820> filter<00:03:37.239> applied<00:03:37.630> anything<00:03:38.500> in<00:03:38.620> black

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
film filter applied anything in black

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.100 
film filter applied anything in black

does not have the particular filter

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.140 
does not have the particular filter
applied<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:41.830> then<00:03:42.220> anything<00:03:42.580> that's<00:03:42.760> grey

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
applied and then anything that's grey

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.080 
applied and then anything that's grey
has<00:03:43.660> a<00:03:44.050> certain<00:03:44.410> percentage<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.760> light<00:03:45.970> of

has a certain percentage the light of
the<00:03:46.180> gray<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.870> more<00:03:47.140> the<00:03:47.410> control<00:03:47.950> point<00:03:48.160> or

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
the gray the more the control point or

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.400 
the gray the more the control point or
the<00:03:48.519> more<00:03:49.000> that<00:03:49.330> filter<00:03:49.690> effect<00:03:50.019> is<00:03:50.230> being

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
the more that filter effect is being

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.490 
the more that filter effect is being
added<00:03:50.650> in<00:03:51.209> we<00:03:52.209> only<00:03:52.239> really<00:03:52.840> want<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:53.230> effect

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
added in we only really want the effect

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.890 
added in we only really want the effect
on<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.739> leaves<00:03:53.980> so<00:03:54.970> again<00:03:55.209> what<00:03:55.360> we<00:03:55.480> do<00:03:55.630> is

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
on the leaves so again what we do is

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.289 
on the leaves so again what we do is
take<00:03:56.110> a<00:03:56.170> -<00:03:56.500> control<00:03:57.040> point<00:03:57.340> and<00:03:57.580> you<00:03:58.030> can<00:03:58.150> see

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
take a - control point and you can see

00:03:58.299 --> 00:03:59.759 
take a - control point and you can see
as<00:03:58.450> soon<00:03:58.480> as<00:03:58.750> we<00:03:58.870> click<00:03:59.140> and<00:03:59.410> drop<00:03:59.560> this

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
as soon as we click and drop this

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.560 
as soon as we click and drop this

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
this point will remove the filter effect

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.990 
this point will remove the filter effect

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
point on in this case we're still

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.330 
point on in this case we're still
affecting<00:05:15.259> the<00:05:15.380> background<00:05:15.860> a<00:05:16.009> little<00:05:16.190> bit

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
affecting the background a little bit

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.360 
affecting the background a little bit
and<00:05:16.699> if<00:05:17.660> we<00:05:17.780> didn't<00:05:18.020> want<00:05:18.259> that<00:05:18.500> we<00:05:19.160> take

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
and if we didn't want that we take

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.370 
and if we didn't want that we take
another<00:05:19.669> control<00:05:20.120> point<00:05:20.389> place<00:05:20.990> it<00:05:21.169> in<00:05:21.289> this

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
another control point place it in this

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.230 
another control point place it in this
gray<00:05:21.710> area<00:05:21.740> back<00:05:22.340> here<00:05:22.370> and<00:05:22.910> I<00:05:23.000> would<00:05:23.120> just

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
gray area back here and I would just

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.450 
gray area back here and I would just
expand<00:05:23.660> that<00:05:23.690> one<00:05:24.050> out<00:05:24.250> that's<00:05:25.250> going<00:05:25.370> to

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
expand that one out that's going to

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.089 
expand that one out that's going to
clean<00:05:25.729> up<00:05:25.849> that<00:05:25.880> selection<00:05:26.539> even<00:05:26.660> more<00:05:27.020> and<00:05:27.259> as

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:28.099 
clean up that selection even more and as

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:30.969 
clean up that selection even more and as
we<00:05:28.490> add<00:05:28.639> more<00:05:28.669> control<00:05:29.419> points<00:05:29.449> each<00:05:30.410> one<00:05:30.800> can

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
we add more control points each one can

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:32.230 
we add more control points each one can
get<00:05:31.130> more<00:05:31.280> intelligent<00:05:31.789> so<00:05:31.910> it<00:05:31.970> can<00:05:32.090> figure

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
get more intelligent so it can figure

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.850 
get more intelligent so it can figure
out<00:05:32.300> exactly<00:05:32.509> what<00:05:33.020> it<00:05:33.110> should<00:05:33.289> be<00:05:33.320> affecting

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
out exactly what it should be affecting

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.520 
out exactly what it should be affecting
and<00:05:34.009> what<00:05:34.520> it<00:05:34.610> shouldn't<00:05:34.940> be<00:05:35.110> now<00:05:36.110> as<00:05:36.229> we<00:05:36.349> turn

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
and what it shouldn't be now as we turn

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.070 
and what it shouldn't be now as we turn
off<00:05:36.740> our<00:05:36.919> selection<00:05:37.550> and<00:05:37.699> we<00:05:38.330> actually<00:05:38.810> take<00:05:39.020> a

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
off our selection and we actually take a

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.080 
off our selection and we actually take a
look<00:05:39.320> at<00:05:39.470> what<00:05:39.680> the<00:05:39.860> infrared<00:05:40.370> film<00:05:40.639> filter<00:05:40.970> is

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
look at what the infrared film filter is

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.439 
look at what the infrared film filter is
doing<00:05:41.360> to<00:05:41.510> our<00:05:41.539> leaves<00:05:41.870> there's<00:05:42.560> the<00:05:42.800> before

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
doing to our leaves there's the before

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:45.969 
doing to our leaves there's the before
there's<00:05:44.449> the<00:05:44.690> after<00:05:45.050> you<00:05:45.500> can<00:05:45.650> see<00:05:45.830> we're

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979 
there's the after you can see we're

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:47.620 
there's the after you can see we're
getting<00:05:46.190> this<00:05:46.280> incredibly<00:05:46.820> photographic

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
getting this incredibly photographic

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.750 
getting this incredibly photographic
selection<00:05:48.110> and<00:05:48.229> then<00:05:48.349> adjustment<00:05:48.949> so<00:05:49.400> as<00:05:49.550> we

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
selection and then adjustment so as we

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.520 
selection and then adjustment so as we
add<00:05:49.909> in<00:05:50.150> even<00:05:50.870> though<00:05:50.960> it's<00:05:51.110> a<00:05:51.169> very<00:05:51.199> dramatic

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
add in even though it's a very dramatic

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.800 
add in even though it's a very dramatic
adjustment<00:05:52.220> as<00:05:52.310> we<00:05:52.490> add<00:05:52.699> it<00:05:52.940> in<00:05:53.090> it<00:05:53.270> still

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
adjustment as we add it in it still

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.770 
adjustment as we add it in it still
looks<00:05:54.050> very<00:05:54.110> natural<00:05:54.440> in<00:05:54.800> photographic<00:05:55.479> now<00:05:56.479> I

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
looks very natural in photographic now I

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.620 
looks very natural in photographic now I
don't<00:05:57.500> want<00:05:57.830> all<00:05:58.010> of<00:05:58.070> this<00:05:58.639> adjustment<00:05:59.419> to<00:05:59.539> be

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
don't want all of this adjustment to be

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.260 
don't want all of this adjustment to be
added<00:05:59.990> into<00:06:00.229> the<00:06:00.320> leaves<00:06:00.560> so<00:06:01.310> if<00:06:01.610> we<00:06:01.849> click<00:06:02.090> on

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
added into the leaves so if we click on

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.060 
added into the leaves so if we click on
our<00:06:02.449> control<00:06:02.870> point<00:06:03.080> you<00:06:03.530> of<00:06:03.620> course<00:06:03.800> have

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
our control point you of course have

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.730 
our control point you of course have
your<00:06:04.250> size<00:06:04.550> slider<00:06:04.970> which<00:06:05.630> is<00:06:05.810> the<00:06:06.050> size<00:06:06.409> of

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
your size slider which is the size of

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.870 
your size slider which is the size of
the<00:06:06.860> area<00:06:07.070> that<00:06:07.460> we're<00:06:07.580> going<00:06:07.610> to<00:06:07.759> be

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
the area that we're going to be

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.730 
the area that we're going to be
affecting<00:06:08.300> but<00:06:08.750> you<00:06:08.840> also<00:06:08.990> have<00:06:09.320> an<00:06:09.470> opacity

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
affecting but you also have an opacity

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.370 
affecting but you also have an opacity
slider<00:06:10.190> which<00:06:11.030> is<00:06:11.210> the<00:06:11.360> strength<00:06:11.840> that<00:06:12.169> that

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
slider which is the strength that that

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.040 
slider which is the strength that that
control<00:06:13.159> point<00:06:13.430> will<00:06:13.699> put<00:06:13.970> on<00:06:14.210> the<00:06:14.330> object<00:06:14.840> of

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
control point will put on the object of

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.310 
control point will put on the object of
our<00:06:15.830> given<00:06:16.190> filter<00:06:16.520> so<00:06:17.449> in<00:06:17.570> this<00:06:17.690> case<00:06:17.960> our

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:18.320 
our given filter so in this case our

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.040 
our given filter so in this case our
opacity<00:06:19.070> is<00:06:19.460> set<00:06:19.639> to<00:06:19.759> 100%<00:06:20.210> which<00:06:20.720> is<00:06:20.870> going<00:06:20.990> to

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
opacity is set to 100% which is going to

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.930 
opacity is set to 100% which is going to
put<00:06:21.199> the<00:06:21.289> entire<00:06:21.590> infrared<00:06:22.159> film<00:06:22.400> filter<00:06:22.729> in

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
put the entire infrared film filter in

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.089 
put the entire infrared film filter in
on<00:06:23.240> that<00:06:23.360> leaf<00:06:23.570> but<00:06:24.320> let's<00:06:24.500> say<00:06:24.650> we<00:06:24.800> wanted<00:06:25.039> to

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:25.099 
on that leaf but let's say we wanted to

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:27.700 
on that leaf but let's say we wanted to
dial<00:06:25.370> it<00:06:25.520> back<00:06:25.550> a<00:06:25.729> bit<00:06:26.030> well<00:06:26.900> I<00:06:27.050> just<00:06:27.139> click<00:06:27.680> and

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
dial it back a bit well I just click and

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.710 
dial it back a bit well I just click and
drag<00:06:27.949> the<00:06:28.310> opacity<00:06:28.880> slider<00:06:29.030> down<00:06:29.419> to<00:06:29.570> maybe

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 
drag the opacity slider down to maybe

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.589 
drag the opacity slider down to maybe
50%<00:06:30.500> and<00:06:30.680> now<00:06:31.130> we're<00:06:31.310> putting<00:06:31.479> 50%<00:06:32.479> of<00:06:32.539> that

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:32.599 
50% and now we're putting 50% of that

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:34.830 
50% and now we're putting 50% of that
infrared<00:06:33.050> film<00:06:33.409> filter<00:06:33.740> just<00:06:34.250> on<00:06:34.370> the<00:06:34.460> leaves

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.820 
infrared film filter just on the leaves
so<00:06:35.840> now<00:06:35.990> when<00:06:36.139> we<00:06:36.259> take<00:06:36.409> a<00:06:36.440> look<00:06:36.500> at<00:06:36.740> the

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
so now when we take a look at the

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.589 
so now when we take a look at the
before-and-after<00:06:37.159> we're<00:06:37.909> still<00:06:38.240> getting

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:38.599 
before-and-after we're still getting

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:40.270 
before-and-after we're still getting
this<00:06:38.690> additional<00:06:39.139> contrast<00:06:39.620> but<00:06:40.070> we're

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 
this additional contrast but we're

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.820 
this additional contrast but we're
