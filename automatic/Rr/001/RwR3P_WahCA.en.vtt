00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.700
 tutorial like in this fifth tutorial the 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.330
 idea is to install applications through 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.430
 of ojÃ©n then earlier in the room 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.160
 tutorial I told them to start for a 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.370
 Place play are of the idea please not 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.650
 that application eliminate the we're going here 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.290
 where it says uninstall we give it 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.450
 uninstall if that 's the first thing that 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.520
 we have to do and we will install it 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:38.040
 this new application via web 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.040
 how we do it we enter 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.290
 we are directly to google chrome if 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.770
 we search here 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.770
 Google Chrome 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.719
 and in google chrome 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.770
 we go every hour the time to enter here 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.770
 let's place 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:06.780
 morbid and I was not suggesting 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:09.870
 after that we look for the version here 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.780
 official that arrives here tri but then in 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.060
 the point with we go in there and look for a 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.500
 file here comes to you almost that 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.930
 automatic has to appear like this not 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.270
 then the voice to download yes 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.370
 let's accept and I hope at the time 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.850
 while he unloads ready you will happen 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.430
 the video while doing the download ready 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.260
 then the download is over 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.590
 enter here again to the application 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:40.310
 Let's go to look for the option 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.950
 here from file manager there 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.700
 we enter and there in file manager 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.399
 let's go to the option that says downloads if 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.009
 there are downloads we select and finish 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.110
 the application to install appears 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.119
 let's read package program 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.689
 Facilities offered here there 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.369
 and we selected only once and 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:05.330
 he starts doing the normal installation 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:08.470
 you start doing it 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.470
 we hope you do it 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.510
 right now let's handle a little remember 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:17.430
 we need to also need a 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.049
 cell phone any for 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.220
 take them out in the parking lot here we're going to 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.320
 take to open 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.650
 of the is working this application 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.650
 work horizontally yes 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.090
 we go to 8 where it says apps to career 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.090
 pp 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.800
 and it takes the top option so 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.300
 first is whatsapp 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.790
 we are going to download 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.100
 there is downloading something else if 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.500
 you want recommendation increase the 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.660
 wait time the screen because it is 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:53.770
 that can be very short with the 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:55.940
 configuration we go to screen and here 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.090
 suspend and nativity we have what by 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.989
 there 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.989
 of minutes 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.290
 meanwhile let's do one thing 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.900
 let's turn the tablet 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.879
 let's get it out without 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.340
 while doing whatsapp downloads 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:16.829
 but what happens if we take the 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.920
 sim and we do the process in another 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.780
 device we cellular never us 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.180
 will get text table where confirms 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.099
 whatsapp's mobile number is 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.859
 say that we will never be able to use 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.849
 the other application then that says that 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.849
 I made here 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.370
 look at us, let's try to 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.830
 place 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.870
 this micro will return again without normal 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.180
 to be able to place it on a telephone 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.129
 cellular anybody in this case is going to 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.170
 place in this cell phone the can 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:49.180
 place where they want or if they have a 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.849
 the smartphone can place their sim card 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.470
 no need to convert the normal sim 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.650
 it depends on the size then there the 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.540
 They make it super easy to do it in a 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.299
 flat surface to support and 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.459
 place it well then it will pause the 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.549
 video while you place it here 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.260
 I have my team back then 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:11.019
 if we do not know the number and not what 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:15.160
 we find nowhere is very easy 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:17.910
 we mark asterisk numeral 61 numeral and 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.910
 we get in number 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.879
 there appears the number that appears 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:27.860
 then we will automatically that already 

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:29.259
 download the application here in the 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.969
 screen appears the option to install 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:35.389
 almost immediately we took out another 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:38.479
 once only once and installed by art 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.340
 of magic our whatsapp is based 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.789
 any kind of game application then 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.789
 that we are 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.380
 you hope they are installed you can 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:52.380
 delay a bit 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.630
 remember recommendation with that with this 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:59.640
 tablet not letting it download totally 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:02.880
 We will not cancel it will take time to open and 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:06.590
 there it opened us quite we must accept 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.590
 and automatically it was us 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:14.639
 I do not know if it reaches the area code without 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:18.280
 have placed 57 that is the one of colombia 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:21.210
 and you can go to other countries the same thing 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.260
 and we will place the cell number 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.940
 list then here already with what the 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.060
 cell number because I did not do it 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.510
 to show everything we will give here ok yes 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.510
 okay 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.310
 then ask me to confirm 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.900
 it tells me that if the number I'm 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.320
 activating is that 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:49.100
 that number I say ok here too 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:49.100
 I get that there is someone who starts from that 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.770
 think that number starts to 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.199
 squaring in death can be delayed or 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.570
 It may take around up to 5 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.880
 minutes and he no longer just did not arrive at mass 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.040
 text 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.300
 you as we verify it 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.300
 phone center 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.950

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.610
 that we can place that number ready 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:37.560
 at the end here we are going to place the 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.560
 Verification code 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.940
