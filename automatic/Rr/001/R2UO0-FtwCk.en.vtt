00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.590
 / a 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.590
 for mulberry 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.910
 dawn 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.860
 or small or very good little ones to 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.869
 all vaquitas welcome to a new 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.580
 departure in ska equal which one there is 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.560
 trap but good let's do something 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.810
 super epic that is to do a trick that you 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.980
 allows you to fly from one island to another without 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.349
 have to make bridges that can 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.779
 throw in sky war or without having on the pallet 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.180
 with the bow points flames and bows bots 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.980
 to see to see is around here is basically 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.239
 a bow with push 3 that what you 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.250
 lets is to nail you the arrow in the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.020
 ass and goes off like crazy 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.390
 like a fucking crazy really that is 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.829
 Well then, good to see, look, I have 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.410
 2 sanders ppl I will not even use them 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.329
 you'll see and well at the beginning it was a 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.780
 bank because I did not leave I had to 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.220
 go to a player to try this and you 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.560
 caught the trick and now I get very 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.820
 well it is worth it is something is an advantage 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.010
 because nobody expects you to go to 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.260
 arrive with the bow and instead of throwing it to 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.380
 the people that what most of 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.439
 people what I do is surprise the 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.790
 enemy let's go for that and fall 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.159
 over without you notice, look what I'm going 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.610
 careful here to do here we go to the 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.659
 first 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.130
 It's worth small quiet 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.570
 stayed there with a face of four fac 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.920
 little quiet you're going to die or 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.720
 little bye 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.700
 ok I'll explain it now because 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.400
 basically it is to put the bow as in 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.960
 vertical which you have to go 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.970
 running towards the ante with double jump 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.770
 and the arrow sticks you in the back 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.689
 ok you have to be faster than the 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.670
 own arrow is something strange but it's 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.580
 so seriously to see to see if there is anything 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.860
 here and let's do them is the second 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.140
 low value is attentive has been released the 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.090
 arrow first we do like this and now 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.590
 first again or little toddler 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.320
 look east this does not even know that I've arrived 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.000
 I'm here, you see , I'm not using 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.740
 terpel nor am I making bridges is that 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.420
 I go from one island to another, even 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.619
 here on the angelique map because I've 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.090
 seen that the islands are the most 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.600
 separated from each other 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.850
 now I see salander for grief and the 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.649
 fails or seriously uncle or did not fail in 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.299
 the bow putts and missed with lander pele or 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.729
 small homer simpson what care this 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.709

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:08.130
 recording from small or small to 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.989
 to catch to catch here I am very touched 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.630
 de mata kills me no no no no 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.680
 marini that seeing the past uncle is already 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.680
 that I am super tocadísimo 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.900
 It's worth how much crap I have, I have a sword 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.790
 now from sharp to I'll go 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.650
 pretty good we're going to try to kill 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.390
 another one with the puig bow but good I already 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.940
 what is explained is called sites that is a 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.620
 strange name uncle I've seen tutorials but 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.200
 good is this which will you throw the 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.090
 arrow so vertical and I will order 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.410
 this this obviously this here all the 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.510
 trash look keep the night areas 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.730
 that is, what will work for me? 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.010
 one there because there are seven in the 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.080
 starting the bad of the ope games 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.450
 is that the people who are very much alive are 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.550
 brutal what they grow but good of 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.170
 same way I will try to win and if not 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.610
 I do not and I'm happy because 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.960
 kills two with the putt bow that was what 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.640
 I wanted vale I wanted to kill three but 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.640
 good to see is going to throw me up 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.570
 to the first one that has seen him as 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.340
 twisted so you can see that the bow does not 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.520
 only works straight right 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.810
 left not so that it also works 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.460
 sideways we're going to stick or 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.510
 little one you are going to catch you do 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.550
 It really what was campeando 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.500
 considering the uncle the people who would 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.570
 it takes very seriously this is the people what 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.430
 attack that yes I will not go this guy where 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.930
 you go 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.810
 I have seen an arrow 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.400
 the fact is that uncle looks at me 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.840
 removing up to the bridge if I have the 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.640
 bow putts 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.440
 my mother okay let's go there and what 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.629
 that I'm afraid that he pulls me look what 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.420
 thoughtful is that they are very expensive uncle already 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:40.910
 fight if a man or a woman but 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.810
 Uncle fight if you demand that you fight 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.340
 Stands uncle look at him nothing for nothing not 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.980
 can not climb the tree either because if 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.799
 I upload the same thing and I do not want to 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.540
 see that I can mess it up 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.160
 you'll see at the end what the campers this 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.959
 they always win uncles that is the milk this 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.910
 they are throwing arrows at him 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.069
 where are you guys spending arrows now 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.500
 I do not know what triggers me neither nor nor 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.940

 It's not small, it's not, it's not lucky, uncle 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.440
 a supposed bad luck but I do not know 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.660
 the times that the arch is more functional 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.639
 punch itself that works very well when you 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.650
 you catch the trick of truth no longer fails 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.930
 one you become a serious probé 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.310
 but it does not matter in the same way, but what 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.380
 point is like it has been very good 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.789
 topped pretty people but good the 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.289
 tutorial more or less I think you have 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:35.330
 understood and I recommend you why 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:37.369
 player and try it yourself 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.749
 love is the arc and what tests I hope 

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:40.430
