 in the aesthetic part that is the first video of a series of videos where 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:22.769
 This is demonstrating all my experience in skin care 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.460
 but I will be focused on homemade masks 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.329

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.070
 suitable 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.240
 for each type of skin 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.630

 you can adjust both budgets 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.110
 but with constancy and knowledge of each type of skin 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.110
 well now if we make known the types of skin 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.760
 first we have oily skin 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.710
 it stands out for the weight of its file 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.030
 for their protests to have armenti blackheads 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.340
 for this type of skin it is necessary to use a fat-free moisturizer 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.800
 very good cosmetics 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.310
