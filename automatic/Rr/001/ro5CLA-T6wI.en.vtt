00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
once again even on the downturns if you

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.359 
once again even on the downturns if you
donít<00:01:03.750> be<00:01:04.080> going<00:01:04.320> through<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.680> corner<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.220> it's

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
donít be going through a corner and it's

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.310 
donít be going through a corner and it's
starting<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.790> die<00:01:06.060> down<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.080> want<00:01:07.229> to

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.539 
starting to die down and you want to
jump<00:01:07.500> down<00:01:08.060> against<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.210> but<00:01:10.130> we<00:01:11.130> get<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> lower

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
jump down against it but we get a lower

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.590 
jump down against it but we get a lower
gear<00:01:12.080> so<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.710> know<00:01:13.770> stuff<00:01:14.070> like<00:01:14.220> that

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
gear so you know stuff like that

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.350 
gear so you know stuff like that
everything's<00:01:15.600> very<00:01:15.869> very<00:01:16.170> simple<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.770> use<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
everything's very very simple to use and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
got a hydraulic handbrake here so on

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.940 
got a hydraulic handbrake here so on
tight<00:01:30.780> corners<00:01:31.229> will<00:01:31.380> just<00:01:31.530> pull<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.920> up

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
tight corners will just pull that up

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.830 
tight corners will just pull that up
which<00:01:32.610> swings<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.060> back<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.450> car<00:01:33.659> around

which swings the back of the car around

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.170 
which swings the back of the car around
then<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.259> can<00:01:34.409> accelerate<00:01:34.740> as<00:01:35.549> much<00:01:35.880> as<00:01:36.060> we

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
then we can accelerate as much as we

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.069 
then we can accelerate as much as we
want<00:01:36.439> you'll<00:01:37.439> notice<00:01:37.650> all<00:01:38.040> all<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.210> wiring

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
want you'll notice all all the wiring

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.319 
want you'll notice all all the wiring
and<00:01:40.530> switches<00:01:41.130> everything's<00:01:41.610> down<00:01:41.790> as<00:01:42.000> low<00:01:42.180> as

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
and switches everything's down as low as

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.850 
and switches everything's down as low as
possible<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.960> get<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.140> center<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.439> gravity
