quick<00:00:06.089> here<00:00:06.830> the<00:00:07.830> faucet<00:00:08.340> I<00:00:08.490> like<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.790> finish

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
quick here the faucet I like the finish

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.870 
quick here the faucet I like the finish
of<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.330> faucet<00:00:09.889> especially<00:00:10.889> this<00:00:11.280> handle<00:00:11.730> I

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
of the faucet especially this handle I

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.759 
of the faucet especially this handle I
mean<00:00:12.030> this<00:00:12.150> handle<00:00:12.480> basically<00:00:12.809> swivels<00:00:13.500> all

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
mean this handle basically swivels all

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.400 
mean this handle basically swivels all
the<00:00:13.980> way<00:00:14.130> around<00:00:14.750> that's<00:00:15.750> one<00:00:16.170> good<00:00:16.379> thing

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
the way around that's one good thing

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.080 
the way around that's one good thing
because<00:00:16.830> especially<00:00:17.310> if<00:00:17.609> you're<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.760> tall

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
because especially if you're a tall

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.790 
because especially if you're a tall
person<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.630> don't<00:00:18.810> want<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.020> be<00:00:19.109> reaching<00:00:19.410> way

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
basically this drain that comes with it

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.979 
basically this drain that comes with it
I've<00:01:03.130> read<00:01:03.460> a<00:01:03.490> couple<00:01:03.700> other<00:01:03.970> reviews<00:01:04.510> that

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
coming out under here so I had to seal

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.140 
coming out under here so I had to seal
up<00:01:19.180> the<00:01:19.300> silicone<00:01:19.870> a<00:01:20.170> lot<00:01:20.620> up<00:01:20.920> here<00:01:21.150> I'm

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.570 
that come with with this faucet is
actually<00:02:13.000> this<00:02:13.150> green<00:02:13.450> one<00:02:13.660> here<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:15.340> you<00:02:15.430> can

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
actually this green one here and you can

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.000 
actually this green one here and you can
see<00:02:15.730> just<00:02:15.760> by<00:02:15.970> using<00:02:16.210> my<00:02:16.360> thumb<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:17.230> see<00:02:17.440> how

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
see just by using my thumb you see how

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.050 
see just by using my thumb you see how
easy<00:02:18.390> easy<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:19.660> bends<00:02:20.880> okay

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
easy easy it bends okay

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.140 
easy easy it bends okay
that<00:02:22.240> is<00:02:22.390> not<00:02:22.630> good<00:02:23.020> for<00:02:23.350> right<00:02:23.800> here<00:02:24.150> because

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
that is not good for right here because

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.390 
that is not good for right here because
what's<00:02:25.360> gonna<00:02:25.450> happen<00:02:25.569> is<00:02:26.200> this<00:02:26.830> green<00:02:27.160> thing

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
what's gonna happen is this green thing

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.820 
what's gonna happen is this green thing
just<00:02:27.730> basically<00:02:28.290> when<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:29.380> open<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:29.800> close

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
just basically when you open and close

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.940 
just basically when you open and close
that<00:02:30.220> stopper<00:02:30.819> up<00:02:30.940> there<00:02:31.090> it<00:02:31.300> just<00:02:31.540> bends

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
that stopper up there it just bends

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.980 
that stopper up there it just bends
really<00:02:32.950> easy<00:02:33.280> so<00:02:33.670> you're<00:02:34.390> gonna<00:02:34.480> either<00:02:34.840> have

this<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:50.610> tightened<00:02:51.610> this<00:02:51.730> down<00:02:51.970> much<00:02:52.420> as<00:02:52.569> I

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
this I tightened this down much as I

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.470 
this I tightened this down much as I
could<00:02:52.750> you<00:02:53.290> know<00:02:54.160> being<00:02:54.520> plastic<00:02:55.150> you<00:02:55.300> don't

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
could you know being plastic you don't

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.690 
could you know being plastic you don't
want<00:02:55.600> to<00:02:55.660> tighten<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:56.020> too<00:02:56.230> much<00:02:56.340> but<00:02:57.340> I<00:02:57.550> did

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
want to tighten it too much but I did

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.089 
want to tighten it too much but I did
the<00:02:58.030> best<00:02:58.060> I<00:02:58.390> could<00:02:58.500> but<00:02:59.500> I'll<00:02:59.620> probably<00:02:59.770> have

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
the best I could but I'll probably have

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.860 
the best I could but I'll probably have
to<00:03:00.129> run<00:03:00.340> some<00:03:00.519> silicone<00:03:01.030> under<00:03:01.330> here<00:03:01.629> too

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
to run some silicone under here too

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.440 
to run some silicone under here too
because<00:03:02.140> it's<00:03:02.319> still<00:03:02.620> leaking<00:03:03.040> just

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
because it's still leaking just

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.540 
because it's still leaking just
a<00:03:03.480> little<00:03:04.110> bit<00:03:04.290> right<00:03:04.319> here<00:03:04.819> so<00:03:05.819> this<00:03:06.410> drain<00:03:07.550> no
