00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
felt paper would dissolve so we got this

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.499 
felt paper would dissolve so we got this

products right here to people is always

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.109 
products right here to people is always
a<00:02:02.399> plus<00:02:02.759> because<00:02:03.030> if<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.079> sticks<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.680> itself

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
a plus because if it sticks to itself

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.779 
a plus because if it sticks to itself
man<00:02:06.119> you're<00:02:06.840> messed<00:02:07.140> up<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.979> have<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.580> throw

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
man you're messed up you have to throw

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.249 
man you're messed up you have to throw
it<00:02:08.879> away<00:02:08.970> like<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.270> one<00:02:09.629> piece<00:02:09.840> over<00:02:10.110> there

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
it away like that one piece over there

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.770 
it away like that one piece over there
we<00:02:10.379> stuck<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:11.009> itself<00:02:11.340> by<00:02:11.640> accident<00:02:12.209> so<00:02:12.750> we

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
we stuck it to itself by accident so we

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.850 
we stuck it to itself by accident so we
threw<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.230> away

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
threw it away

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.860 
threw it away
let's<00:02:14.190> see<00:02:14.400> I'm<00:02:14.520> gonna<00:02:14.640> cover<00:02:14.940> this<00:02:15.150> one<00:02:15.360> here

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
let's see I'm gonna cover this one here

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.540 
let's see I'm gonna cover this one here
and<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.890> looks<00:02:17.880> about<00:02:19.010> all<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.310> looks

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
and that looks about all that looks

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.060 
and that looks about all that looks
about<00:02:20.790> right<00:02:21.260> I'll<00:02:22.260> show<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:22.560> what<00:02:22.710> happens

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
about right I'll show you what happens

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.070 
about right I'll show you what happens
if<00:02:23.220> we<00:02:23.540> overlap<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.950> too<00:02:25.950> much<00:02:26.160> okay<00:02:27.000> well<00:02:27.360> if

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
if we overlap it too much okay well if

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.480 
if we overlap it too much okay well if
we<00:02:28.260> were<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.440> overlap<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:28.920> I<00:02:29.160> would<00:02:29.400> have

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
we were to overlap that I would have

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:37.190 
we were to overlap that I would have
took<00:02:29.670> out<00:02:29.820> my<00:02:29.970> utility<00:02:30.480> knife<00:02:34.730> tonight<00:02:36.200> all

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
took out my utility knife tonight all

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.720 
took out my utility knife tonight all
right<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:38.670> why<00:02:38.880> do<00:02:38.940> we<00:02:39.090> cut<00:02:39.330> that<00:02:39.540> because

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
right and why do we cut that because

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.990 
right and why do we cut that because
that's<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.850> drip<00:02:42.120> edge<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.600> drip<00:02:42.930> screed<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:44.000> we

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
that's a drip edge a drip screed and we

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.850 
that's a drip edge a drip screed and we
are<00:02:45.090> doing<00:02:45.240> porous<00:02:45.780> stucco<00:02:46.170> on<00:02:46.440> here<00:02:46.830> now<00:02:47.570> the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
are doing porous stucco on here now the

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.410 
are doing porous stucco on here now the
stucco<00:02:49.860> is<00:02:50.190> gonna<00:02:50.400> be<00:02:50.520> porous<00:02:50.910> meaning<00:02:51.270> it's

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
stucco is gonna be porous meaning it's

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.010 
stucco is gonna be porous meaning it's
maintenance-free

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
maintenance-free

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.770 
maintenance-free
water<00:02:52.890> goes<00:02:53.130> straight<00:02:53.430> through<00:02:53.490> it<00:02:53.760> it<00:02:54.420> comes

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
water goes straight through it it comes

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.690 
water goes straight through it it comes
out<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:55.230> weeps<00:02:55.530> through<00:02:55.890> these<00:02:56.070> holes<00:02:56.370> here

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
out and weeps through these holes here

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.360 
out and weeps through these holes here
and<00:02:56.880> ends<00:02:57.600> up<00:02:57.720> harmlessly<00:02:58.500> on<00:02:58.740> this<00:02:58.950> membrane

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
and ends up harmlessly on this membrane

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.550 
and ends up harmlessly on this membrane
right<00:02:59.730> here<00:03:00.150> because<00:03:00.750> we<00:03:00.870> are<00:03:01.080> gonna<00:03:01.230> put<00:03:01.530> a

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
right here because we are gonna put a

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.160 
right here because we are gonna put a
stucco<00:03:02.160> cap<00:03:02.459> on<00:03:02.670> this<00:03:02.850> anyway<00:03:03.660> that's<00:03:03.870> just

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
stucco cap on this anyway that's just

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.570 
stucco cap on this anyway that's just
how<00:03:04.320> you<00:03:04.380> do<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.830> there<00:03:05.010> we're<00:03:05.160> gonna<00:03:05.280> wire

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
how you do it there we're gonna wire

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.550 
how you do it there we're gonna wire
this<00:03:05.880> cap<00:03:06.180> here<00:03:06.570> and<00:03:06.720> we're<00:03:07.200> gonna<00:03:07.320> put

this cap here and we're gonna put
corners<00:03:08.010> on<00:03:08.190> this<00:03:08.400> it's<00:03:08.940> really<00:03:09.209> simple<00:03:09.600> the

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
corners on this it's really simple the

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.620 
corners on this it's really simple the
complicated<00:03:11.190> thing<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.550> and<00:03:11.760> these<00:03:12.060> fail<00:03:12.420> I

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
complicated thing is and these fail I

fail so we've got it about this is

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.030 
fail so we've got it about this is
actually<00:03:20.880> double<00:03:21.209> what<00:03:21.390> is<00:03:21.540> up<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:22.140> code<00:03:22.350> some
