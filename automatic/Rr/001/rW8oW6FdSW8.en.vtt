00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
better things than that and as I was

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:18.880 
better things than that and as I was
walking<00:01:17.300> around<00:01:17.509> that<00:01:17.750> afternoon<00:01:18.050> possibly

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
walking around that afternoon possibly

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:19.840 
walking around that afternoon possibly
with<00:01:19.009> heatstroke<00:01:19.160> because<00:01:19.550> there<00:01:19.640> was<00:01:19.759> about

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
with heatstroke because there was about

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.460 
with heatstroke because there was about
a<00:01:19.910> hundred<00:01:20.240> degrees<00:01:20.330> in<00:01:20.509> London<00:01:20.930> that<00:01:21.020> day<00:01:21.229> I

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
a hundred degrees in London that day I

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.380 
a hundred degrees in London that day I
just<00:01:21.800> had<00:01:22.100> this<00:01:22.220> entire<00:01:22.490> idea<00:01:22.880> all<00:01:23.090> at<00:01:23.210> once

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
just had this entire idea all at once

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.359 
just had this entire idea all at once
that<00:01:23.539> if<00:01:23.899> there<00:01:24.140> were<00:01:24.260> ghosts<00:01:24.530> in<00:01:24.590> London<00:01:24.950> they

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
that if there were ghosts in London they

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:26.890 
that if there were ghosts in London they
would<00:01:25.520> be<00:01:25.640> much<00:01:25.790> better<00:01:25.850> organized<00:01:26.570> because

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
would be much better organized because

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.420 
would be much better organized because
the<00:01:26.990> English<00:01:27.229> have<00:01:27.350> a<00:01:27.380> system<00:01:27.799> for<00:01:27.830> everything

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
the English have a system for everything

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.000 
the English have a system for everything
and<00:01:28.729> there<00:01:29.630> would<00:01:29.750> be<00:01:29.780> policing<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:30.740> there

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
and there would be policing and there

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.130 
and there would be policing and there
would<00:01:31.130> be<00:01:31.180> there<00:01:32.180> would<00:01:32.210> be<00:01:32.299> a<00:01:32.390> procedure<00:01:32.780> and

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
would be there would be a procedure and

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.170 
would be there would be a procedure and
I<00:01:33.409> thought<00:01:33.590> what's<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:33.920> worst<00:01:34.190> ghost<00:01:34.909> to<00:01:35.150> come

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
I thought what's the worst ghost to come

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.520 
I thought what's the worst ghost to come
back<00:01:35.510> who<00:01:35.720> would<00:01:35.840> you<00:01:35.960> not<00:01:36.110> want<00:01:36.290> to<00:01:36.320> deal<00:01:36.470> with

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
back who would you not want to deal with

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.130 
back who would you not want to deal with
and<00:01:36.920> then<00:01:37.549> I<00:01:37.580> thought<00:01:37.850> of<00:01:38.000> Jack<00:01:38.150> the<00:01:38.180> Ripper<00:01:38.299> so

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
and then I thought of Jack the Ripper so

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.660 
and then I thought of Jack the Ripper so
I<00:01:39.200> was<00:01:39.320> always<00:01:39.470> fascinated<00:01:39.740> with<00:01:40.189> as<00:01:40.369> kid<00:01:40.640> I

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
I was always fascinated with as kid I

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.490 
I was always fascinated with as kid I
used<00:01:40.700> to<00:01:40.909> read<00:01:41.030> all<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.390> Jack<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.260> Ripper

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
used to read all the Jack the Ripper

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.050 
used to read all the Jack the Ripper
stuff<00:01:42.740> there<00:01:42.950> was<00:01:43.040> a<00:01:43.100> lot<00:01:43.280> of<00:01:43.310> that<00:01:43.520> when<00:01:43.880> I<00:01:43.909> was

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
stuff there was a lot of that when I was

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.730 
stuff there was a lot of that when I was
a<00:01:44.119> little<00:01:44.330> there

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
a little there

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.310 
a little there
always<00:01:45.460> new<00:01:45.610> theories<00:01:46.030> and<00:01:46.689> that's<00:01:47.079> where<00:01:47.259> it

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
always new theories and that's where it

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.109 
always new theories and that's where it
started<00:01:47.680> and<00:01:47.860> then<00:01:47.950> for<00:01:48.159> the<00:01:48.220> next<00:01:48.520> two<00:01:48.970> months

I<00:01:59.619> mean<00:01:59.829> it's<00:01:59.979> essentially<00:02:00.509> in<00:02:01.509> a<00:02:01.630> lot<00:02:01.750> of<00:02:01.780> ways

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
I mean it's essentially in a lot of ways

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.529 
I mean it's essentially in a lot of ways
in<00:02:02.049> the<00:02:02.259> first<00:02:02.500> big<00:02:02.710> media<00:02:03.070> creation<00:02:04.060> you<00:02:04.509> know

in the first big media creation you know

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.260 
in the first big media creation you know
a<00:02:04.630> lot<00:02:05.020> of<00:02:05.140> it<00:02:05.229> he<00:02:05.320> was<00:02:05.470> he<00:02:05.890> was<00:02:06.039> sold<00:02:06.310> by<00:02:07.210> the

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.270 
a lot of it he was he was sold by the
media<00:02:07.659> in<00:02:08.050> reality<00:02:08.679> he<00:02:08.800> didn't<00:02:09.039> kill<00:02:09.250> that

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
media in reality he didn't kill that

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.430 
media in reality he didn't kill that
many<00:02:09.519> people<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.300> he<00:02:10.509> might<00:02:10.690> be<00:02:10.989> one<00:02:11.200> or<00:02:11.410> two

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
many people and he might be one or two

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.979 
many people and he might be one or two
or<00:02:11.769> three<00:02:11.800> people<00:02:12.160> I<00:02:12.400> mean<00:02:12.550> he<00:02:12.670> could<00:02:12.880> be<00:02:12.989> and

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
or three people I mean he could be and

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.690 
or three people I mean he could be and
he<00:02:14.050> was<00:02:14.230> really<00:02:14.470> just<00:02:14.500> a<00:02:14.680> grubby<00:02:15.010> man<00:02:15.190> who<00:02:15.550> went

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
he was really just a grubby man who went

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.460 
he was really just a grubby man who went
around<00:02:15.849> killing<00:02:16.150> some<00:02:16.510> really<00:02:16.959> unfortunate

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
around killing some really unfortunate

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.280 
around killing some really unfortunate
people<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.420> only<00:02:19.510> reason<00:02:19.750> he's<00:02:19.959> famous

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
people and the only reason he's famous

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.449 
people and the only reason he's famous
is<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:20.590> they<00:02:20.799> wanted<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.250> sell<00:02:21.430> some

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
is that they wanted to sell some

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.780 
is that they wanted to sell some
newspapers<00:02:22.470> so<00:02:23.470> then<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.040> became<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.340> boarding

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
newspapers so then it became a boarding

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.110

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
Twitter's interesting because when I

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.149 
Twitter's interesting because when I
first<00:02:56.140> heard<00:02:56.290> about<00:02:56.409> it<00:02:56.560> I<00:02:56.709> thought<00:02:56.890> it<00:02:57.040> was

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
first heard about it I thought it was

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.580 
first heard about it I thought it was
the<00:02:57.280> worst<00:02:57.400> idea<00:02:57.670> I've<00:02:58.120> ever<00:02:58.150> heard<00:02:58.599> because<00:02:59.290> I

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
think when they first brought it out it

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:02.640 
think when they first brought it out it
was<00:03:01.060> like<00:03:01.269> you<00:03:01.480> can<00:03:01.840> tell<00:03:01.989> your<00:03:02.170> friends<00:03:02.530> where

if they want to do that let them do it

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.260 
if they want to do that let them do it
it<00:06:16.580> doesn't<00:06:16.760> matter

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
it doesn't matter

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.000 
it doesn't matter

I'm a guru I know it so show them social
media<00:06:51.620> works<00:06:51.830> I<00:06:52.130> think<00:06:52.940> they're<00:06:53.270> like<00:06:53.510> three

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:53.780 
media works I think they're like three

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.630 
media works I think they're like three
or<00:06:54.050> four<00:06:54.080> people<00:06:54.530> that<00:06:54.860> know<00:06:55.010> how<00:06:55.220> social

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:55.640 
or four people that know how social

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.850 
or four people that know how social
media<00:06:55.670> works<00:06:55.970> you<00:06:56.750> know<00:06:56.870> Cory<00:06:57.170> Doctorow<00:06:57.410> knows

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:57.860 
media works you know Cory Doctorow knows

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.360 
media works you know Cory Doctorow knows
how<00:06:58.040> social<00:06:58.430> media<00:06:58.460> works<00:06:58.760> maybe<00:06:59.210> but<00:07:00.370> there

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.370 
how social media works maybe but there

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.790 
how social media works maybe but there
aren't<00:07:01.520> too<00:07:01.700> many<00:07:01.730> others<00:07:02.240> and

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:03.800 
aren't too many others and

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.320 
aren't too many others and
so<00:07:04.280> I<00:07:04.310> think<00:07:04.460> there's<00:07:04.669> a<00:07:04.729> lot<00:07:04.849> of<00:07:04.879> bad<00:07:05.150> advice

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:05.330 
so I think there's a lot of bad advice

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.990 
so I think there's a lot of bad advice
going<00:07:05.870> around<00:07:06.139> so<00:07:07.069> I<00:07:07.099> don't<00:07:07.160> want<00:07:07.400> to<00:07:07.460> add<00:07:07.669> to
