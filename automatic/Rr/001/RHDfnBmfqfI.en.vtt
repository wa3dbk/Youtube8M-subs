once<00:00:07.910> we<00:00:08.059> removed<00:00:08.510> the<00:00:08.690> internals<00:00:09.139> from<00:00:09.349> the

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
once we removed the internals from the

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.449 
once we removed the internals from the
canister<00:00:10.009> we<00:00:10.759> can<00:00:10.910> start<00:00:11.179> to<00:00:11.330> look<00:00:11.599> for<00:00:12.459> areas

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:13.459 
canister we can start to look for areas

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:15.909 
canister we can start to look for areas
on<00:00:13.820> the<00:00:14.059> sprinkler<00:00:14.570> that<00:00:15.230> will<00:00:15.379> make<00:00:15.559> it<00:00:15.740> work

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:15.919 
on the sprinkler that will make it work

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:19.089 
on the sprinkler that will make it work
correctly<00:00:16.129> and<00:00:16.760> in<00:00:17.210> some<00:00:17.840> cases<00:00:18.080> make<00:00:18.529> it<00:00:18.710> not

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:19.099 
correctly and in some cases make it not

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.300 
correctly and in some cases make it not
work<00:00:19.430> correctly<00:00:20.199> in<00:00:21.199> this<00:00:21.349> particular<00:00:21.890> case<00:00:22.130> I

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
work correctly in this particular case I

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.919 
work correctly in this particular case I
want<00:00:22.490> to<00:00:22.580> show<00:00:22.789> you<00:00:22.849> that<00:00:23.210> this<00:00:23.390> particular

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:23.929 
want to show you that this particular

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.740 
want to show you that this particular
product<00:00:24.560> on<00:00:24.830> the<00:00:25.039> right<00:00:25.279> would<00:00:26.119> not<00:00:26.330> reverse

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
product on the right would not reverse

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.620 
product on the right would not reverse
correctly<00:00:27.439> and<00:00:27.650> the<00:00:28.160> reason<00:00:28.789> behind<00:00:28.910> that<00:00:29.390> it

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
correctly and the reason behind that it

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.260 
correctly and the reason behind that it
has<00:00:30.019> to<00:00:30.230> do<00:00:30.349> with<00:00:30.500> this<00:00:30.650> trip<00:00:31.070> tab<00:00:31.519> area<00:00:31.880> and

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
has to do with this trip tab area and

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.970 
has to do with this trip tab area and
I'm<00:00:32.330> going<00:00:32.509> to<00:00:32.540> move<00:00:32.780> the<00:00:32.990> trip<00:00:33.230> tab<00:00:33.470> up<00:00:33.680> in<00:00:33.860> the

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
I'm going to move the trip tab up in the

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.580 
I'm going to move the trip tab up in the
full<00:00:34.190> circle<00:00:34.580> position<00:00:35.120> so<00:00:35.960> that<00:00:35.990> we<00:00:36.380> can

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
full circle position so that we can

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.150 
full circle position so that we can
focus<00:00:37.100> in<00:00:37.670> on<00:00:37.700> the<00:00:38.420> specific<00:00:39.050> little<00:00:39.350> area<00:00:39.860> of

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
focus in on the specific little area of

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.860 
focus in on the specific little area of
this<00:00:41.200> tripping<00:00:42.200> mechanism<00:00:42.920> and<00:00:43.210> we<00:00:44.210> can<00:00:44.390> see

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
this tripping mechanism and we can see

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.410 
this tripping mechanism and we can see
on<00:00:45.110> a<00:00:45.550> known<00:00:46.550> good<00:00:46.930> example<00:00:47.930> here<00:00:49.030> that<00:00:50.030> when

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
on a known good example here that when

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.980 
on a known good example here that when
we<00:00:50.450> trip<00:00:51.020> it<00:00:51.370> it<00:00:52.370> actually<00:00:52.640> clears<00:00:53.270> this<00:00:53.570> post

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:53.990 
we trip it it actually clears this post

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.640 
we trip it it actually clears this post
and<00:00:54.380> will<00:00:55.220> allow<00:00:55.550> it<00:00:55.820> to<00:00:55.850> reverse<00:00:56.650> correctly

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
and will allow it to reverse correctly

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.600 
and will allow it to reverse correctly
on<00:00:58.780> this<00:00:59.780> product<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.440> suspect<00:01:00.920> product<00:01:01.400> when

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
on this product the suspect product when

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.000 
on this product the suspect product when
I<00:01:01.640> try<00:01:01.940> to<00:01:02.000> do<00:01:02.240> that<00:01:02.480> it's<00:01:03.140> locked<00:01:03.590> in<00:01:03.830> position

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
I try to do that it's locked in position

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.810 
I try to do that it's locked in position
and<00:01:04.640> it<00:01:05.479> cannot<00:01:05.899> move<00:01:06.289> so<00:01:07.070> that<00:01:07.429> was<00:01:07.640> one<00:01:07.789> of

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
and it cannot move so that was one of

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.969 
and it cannot move so that was one of
the<00:01:07.969> reasons<00:01:08.299> why<00:01:08.509> it<00:01:08.570> didn't<00:01:08.899> work<00:01:09.170> and<00:01:09.469> we're

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
the reasons why it didn't work and we're

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.459 
the reasons why it didn't work and we're
going<00:01:10.130> to<00:01:10.189> see<00:01:10.280> if<00:01:10.369> we<00:01:10.429> can<00:01:10.670> fix<00:01:10.969> this<00:01:11.469> by

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:12.469 
going to see if we can fix this by

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.169 
going to see if we can fix this by
actually<00:01:12.890> forcing<00:01:13.369> it<00:01:13.490> back<00:01:13.700> into<00:01:14.060> the

00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:14.179 
actually forcing it back into the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:19.060 
actually forcing it back into the
position<00:01:14.750> by<00:01:15.710> moving<00:01:16.310> that<00:01:16.670> tab<00:01:17.950> into<00:01:18.950> the

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
position by moving that tab into the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.830 
position by moving that tab into the
correct<00:01:19.310> position<00:01:19.490> you<00:01:19.939> see<00:01:20.119> I<00:01:20.149> levered<00:01:20.689> it

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
correct position you see I levered it

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.050 
correct position you see I levered it
back<00:01:21.079> into<00:01:21.350> position<00:01:21.979> and<00:01:22.189> now<00:01:22.609> it<00:01:22.670> has<00:01:22.880> that

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
back into position and now it has that

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.310 
back into position and now it has that
free<00:01:23.359> movement<00:01:23.869> just<00:01:23.990> like<00:01:24.259> the<00:01:24.409> other<00:01:25.240> known

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
free movement just like the other known

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.529 
free movement just like the other known
working<00:01:27.320> product<00:01:27.590> did<00:01:28.009> so<00:01:28.820> just<00:01:29.119> by<00:01:29.509> taking

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
working product did so just by taking

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.020 
working product did so just by taking
the<00:01:30.200> screwdriver<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:31.039> forcing<00:01:31.579> that<00:01:31.700> over

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
the screwdriver and forcing that over

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.270 
the screwdriver and forcing that over
Center<00:01:32.420> now<00:01:32.780> I<00:01:32.840> have<00:01:33.140> free<00:01:33.439> movement<00:01:33.649> of<00:01:34.069> this

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
Center now I have free movement of this

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.539 
Center now I have free movement of this
and<00:01:34.520> it<00:01:34.609> now<00:01:34.729> should<00:01:35.030> reverse<00:01:35.409> correctly<00:01:36.549> so

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
and it now should reverse correctly so

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:38.919 
and it now should reverse correctly so
that<00:01:37.579> was<00:01:37.819> one<00:01:37.969> of<00:01:37.999> the<00:01:38.149> things<00:01:38.329> that<00:01:38.630> we<00:01:38.719> want

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
that was one of the things that we want

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:41.590 
that was one of the things that we want
to<00:01:39.049> see<00:01:39.969> when<00:01:40.969> you<00:01:41.090> take<00:01:41.270> it<00:01:41.359> out<00:01:41.450> of<00:01:41.539> the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
to see when you take it out of the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.300 
to see when you take it out of the
canister<00:01:42.109> you<00:01:42.140> can<00:01:42.469> see<00:01:42.710> things<00:01:43.039> that

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
canister you can see things that

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.069 
canister you can see things that
normally<00:01:43.729> you<00:01:43.759> can't<00:01:44.119> see<00:01:44.359> once<00:01:44.630> it's<00:01:44.840> in<00:01:44.960> the

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
normally you can't see once it's in the

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.160 
normally you can't see once it's in the
canister<00:01:45.700> so<00:01:46.700> knowing<00:01:47.090> that<00:01:47.119> now<00:01:47.899> I'm<00:01:48.020> going

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
canister so knowing that now I'm going

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.660 
canister so knowing that now I'm going
to<00:01:48.229> show<00:01:48.350> you<00:01:48.380> a<00:01:48.530> couple<00:01:48.799> different<00:01:48.979> areas

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
to show you a couple different areas

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.389 
to show you a couple different areas
here<00:01:49.909> to<00:01:50.030> look<00:01:50.210> for<00:01:50.560> that<00:01:51.560> potentially<00:01:52.249> can

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
here to look for that potentially can

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.999 
here to look for that potentially can
make<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:52.639> product<00:01:52.999> work<00:01:53.210> in<00:01:53.859> correctly<00:01:54.859> and

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
make the product work in correctly and

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.980 
make the product work in correctly and
not<00:01:55.100> reverse<00:01:55.639> the<00:01:56.299> first<00:01:56.539> thing<00:01:56.719> we're<00:01:56.869> going

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
not reverse the first thing we're going

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.559 
not reverse the first thing we're going
to<00:01:57.049> focus<00:01:57.499> on<00:01:57.709> is<00:01:57.920> this<00:01:58.100> return<00:01:58.549> spring<00:01:59.030> you'll

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
to focus on is this return spring you'll

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:01.929 
to focus on is this return spring you'll
see<00:01:59.840> that<00:01:59.990> it's<00:02:00.170> wrapped<00:02:00.700> starting<00:02:01.700> at<00:02:01.819> the

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
see that it's wrapped starting at the

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.989 
see that it's wrapped starting at the
top<00:02:02.179> counterclockwise<00:02:03.139> around<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:04.520> the

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:04.999 
top counterclockwise around and the

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:06.429 
top counterclockwise around and the
first<00:02:05.149> thing<00:02:05.420> you're<00:02:05.569> going<00:02:05.689> to<00:02:05.749> notice<00:02:05.959> here

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
first thing you're going to notice here

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.330 
first thing you're going to notice here
is<00:02:06.590> that<00:02:07.429> the<00:02:07.759> end<00:02:07.969> of<00:02:08.090> that<00:02:08.240> spring<00:02:08.810> is<00:02:09.340> free

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
is that the end of that spring is free

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.490 
is that the end of that spring is free
you<00:02:11.090> can<00:02:11.240> see<00:02:11.420> right<00:02:11.660> in<00:02:11.870> this<00:02:11.990> area<00:02:12.200> right

example that there's a small hole in the

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.979 
example that there's a small hole in the

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.680 
pall and a small amount of a clearance
that<00:02:49.260> that<00:02:49.440> hook<00:02:49.680> goes<00:02:49.920> in<00:02:50.160> there<00:02:50.370> now<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.450> has

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
that that hook goes in there now it has

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.410 
that that hook goes in there now it has
adequate<00:02:52.200> amount<00:02:52.709> of<00:02:52.799> spring<00:02:53.160> pressure<00:02:53.519> that

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
adequate amount of spring pressure that

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.800 
adequate amount of spring pressure that
it<00:02:54.599> reverses<00:02:55.670> correctly<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.209> has<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.390> real

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
it reverses correctly and it has a real

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.110 
it reverses correctly and it has a real
good<00:02:58.079> snap<00:02:58.500> back<00:02:58.829> feature<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.519> that<00:02:59.549> spring

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
good snap back feature of that spring

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.120 
good snap back feature of that spring
and<00:03:00.299> that's<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.989> normal<00:03:01.170> position<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:02.010> you

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
and that's the normal position that you

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.309 
and that's the normal position that you
would<00:03:02.280> see<00:03:02.519> it<00:03:02.640> in<00:03:02.790> so<00:03:03.750> if<00:03:03.840> your<00:03:03.959> sprinkler

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
would see it in so if your sprinkler

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.620 
would see it in so if your sprinkler
doesn't<00:03:04.650> reverse<00:03:04.950> or<00:03:05.250> doesn't<00:03:05.610> act<00:03:05.819> like<00:03:06.390> it's

doesn't reverse or doesn't act like it's

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.729 
doesn't reverse or doesn't act like it's
working<00:03:07.110> correctly

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
working correctly

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.100 
working correctly
check<00:03:08.489> that<00:03:08.700> spring<00:03:09.120> in<00:03:09.269> that<00:03:09.420> location<00:03:09.989> of

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
check that spring in that location of

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.680 
check that spring in that location of
that<00:03:10.140> hook<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:11.060> correct<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.239> if<00:03:12.360> you<00:03:12.480> have

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
that hook and correct it if you have

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.720 
that hook and correct it if you have
high<00:03:12.870> pressure<00:03:13.290> it's<00:03:13.709> recommended<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.519> you

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
high pressure it's recommended that you

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.009 
high pressure it's recommended that you
use<00:03:14.930> this<00:03:15.930> higher<00:03:16.610> step<00:03:17.610> so<00:03:18.599> that<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:18.840> get

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
use this higher step so that you get

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.199 
use this higher step so that you get
added<00:03:19.350> spring<00:03:19.829> pressure<00:03:20.130> so<00:03:20.519> again<00:03:20.850> you<00:03:20.970> just

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
added spring pressure so again you just

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.229 
added spring pressure so again you just
compress<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.810> spring<00:03:22.100> pull<00:03:23.100> it<00:03:23.250> out<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:23.639> hook

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
compress the spring pull it out and hook

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.970 
compress the spring pull it out and hook
it<00:03:24.389> up<00:03:24.540> on<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.870> higher<00:03:25.200> end<00:03:25.620> of<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:27.450> tab<00:03:27.980> just

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
it up on the higher end of the tab just

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.319 
it up on the higher end of the tab just
like<00:03:29.220> so<00:03:29.549> and<00:03:30.950> I<00:03:31.950> overdid<00:03:32.730> it<00:03:32.790> a<00:03:32.970> little<00:03:33.000> bit

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
like so and I overdid it a little bit

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.420 
like so and I overdid it a little bit
but<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:33.630> can<00:03:33.810> see<00:03:34.019> that<00:03:34.620> now<00:03:34.859> it's<00:03:35.220> got<00:03:35.400> a

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
but you can see that now it's got a

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.970 
but you can see that now it's got a
higher<00:03:35.730> spring<00:03:36.420> rate<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:36.989> it<00:03:37.470> takes<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.799> little

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
higher spring rate and it takes a little

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.430 
higher spring rate and it takes a little
bit<00:03:38.160> more<00:03:38.299> to<00:03:39.299> push<00:03:39.540> it<00:03:39.720> out<00:03:39.810> of<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.049> way

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
bit more to push it out of the way

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.140 
bit more to push it out of the way
under<00:03:40.950> normal<00:03:41.100> conditions<00:03:41.310> we're<00:03:41.970> going<00:03:42.090> to

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
under normal conditions we're going to

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.449 
under normal conditions we're going to
leave<00:03:42.329> it<00:03:42.480> in<00:03:42.569> that<00:03:42.720> one<00:03:42.959> position<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:43.769> that

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
leave it in that one position and that

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.360 
leave it in that one position and that
should<00:03:44.700> be<00:03:44.850> fine<00:03:45.090> you<00:03:45.359> can<00:03:45.510> see<00:03:45.690> that<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:46.370> moved

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
should be fine you can see that I moved

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.030 
should be fine you can see that I moved
it<00:03:47.519> into<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.910> correct<00:03:48.269> position<00:03:48.510> now<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.319> for

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
it into the correct position now and for

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.920 
it into the correct position now and for
higher<00:03:50.190> pressures<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:50.970> allows<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:51.660> the

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
higher pressures that allows the the

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.190 
higher pressures that allows the the
spring<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.350> compress<00:03:52.709> a<00:03:52.739> little<00:03:53.010> bit<00:03:53.280> more<00:03:53.579> and

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
spring to compress a little bit more and

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.569 
spring to compress a little bit more and
you<00:03:55.200> know<00:03:55.290> that's<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.590> tip<00:03:55.799> that<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.100> can<00:03:56.280> use

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
you know that's a tip that you can use

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.309 
you know that's a tip that you can use
under<00:03:57.150> most<00:03:57.389> conditions<00:03:57.540> we're<00:03:57.989> going<00:03:58.109> to<00:03:58.170> put

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
under most conditions we're going to put

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.259 
under most conditions we're going to put
it<00:03:58.410> back<00:03:58.560> down<00:03:58.799> in<00:03:59.010> this<00:03:59.130> low<00:03:59.340> low<00:03:59.760> position

it back down in this low low position
here<00:04:00.569> and<00:04:01.519> that's<00:04:02.519> going<00:04:02.700> to<00:04:02.760> be<00:04:02.880> normal

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
here and that's going to be normal

move<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.590> tab<00:04:16.859> in<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.549> upward<00:04:17.880> position<00:04:18.090> and

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
move the tab in the upward position and

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.909 
move the tab in the upward position and
it's<00:04:18.690> always<00:04:19.019> going<00:04:19.139> to<00:04:19.200> go<00:04:19.410> in<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.680> same

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
it's always going to go in the same

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.550 
it's always going to go in the same
direction<00:04:20.220> all<00:04:20.729> the<00:04:20.910> time<00:04:21.150> but<00:04:21.900> in<00:04:22.079> order<00:04:22.320> for

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
direction all the time but in order for

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.890 
direction all the time but in order for
it<00:04:22.620> to<00:04:22.650> reverse<00:04:23.099> this<00:04:23.640> little<00:04:24.000> tab<00:04:24.300> has<00:04:24.720> to

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
it to reverse this little tab has to

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.189 
it to reverse this little tab has to
interface<00:04:25.409> with<00:04:25.770> these<00:04:26.610> little<00:04:27.060> spring<00:04:27.479> tabs

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
interface with these little spring tabs

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:32.330 
interface with these little spring tabs
and<00:04:29.120> when<00:04:30.120> it<00:04:30.469> reverses<00:04:31.469> you<00:04:31.680> can<00:04:31.860> see<00:04:32.039> that<00:04:32.219> it

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
and when it reverses you can see that it

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.520 
and when it reverses you can see that it
hits<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:32.639> tab<00:04:32.969> on<00:04:33.120> one<00:04:33.180> side<00:04:33.689> and<00:04:34.020> it<00:04:34.199> hits<00:04:34.379> it

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
hits the tab on one side and it hits it

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.529 
hits the tab on one side and it hits it
on<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.710> other<00:04:35.039> so<00:04:35.759> you're<00:04:35.999> going<00:04:36.240> from<00:04:36.419> a

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
on the other so you're going from a

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:39.469 
on the other so you're going from a
clockwise<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.439> a<00:04:37.469> counterclockwise<00:04:38.449> right

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
clockwise to a counterclockwise right

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.300 
clockwise to a counterclockwise right
arc<00:04:39.779> left<00:04:40.650> art<00:04:40.919> position<00:04:41.520> now<00:04:42.120> many<00:04:42.389> times<00:04:43.310> the

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
arc left art position now many times the

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.119 
arc left art position now many times the
product<00:04:44.699> will<00:04:44.849> stop<00:04:45.180> on<00:04:45.479> the<00:04:46.050> right<00:04:46.349> side<00:04:46.800> so

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:47.129 
product will stop on the right side so

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:49.429 
product will stop on the right side so
it's<00:04:47.249> transitioning<00:04:48.029> from<00:04:48.180> a<00:04:48.330> clockwise<00:04:48.870> to<00:04:49.409> a

00:04:49.429 --> 00:04:49.439 
it's transitioning from a clockwise to a

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:51.980 
it's transitioning from a clockwise to a
counterclockwise<00:04:50.069> position<00:04:50.580> and<00:04:51.150> that<00:04:51.840> would

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
counterclockwise position and that would

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.809 
counterclockwise position and that would
be<00:04:52.110> this<00:04:52.289> tab<00:04:52.590> that's<00:04:52.770> located<00:04:53.340> on<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:53.580> left

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:53.819 
be this tab that's located on the left

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:56.239 
be this tab that's located on the left
right<00:04:54.090> here<00:04:54.360> that<00:04:55.259> controls<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:56.039> right

00:04:56.239 --> 00:04:56.249 
right here that controls the right

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:59.600 
right here that controls the right
border<00:04:56.759> stop<00:04:57.090> point<00:04:57.680> you<00:04:58.680> can<00:04:58.889> see<00:04:59.189> that<00:04:59.460> in

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
border stop point you can see that in

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.320 
border stop point you can see that in
this<00:04:59.819> position<00:05:00.680> the<00:05:01.680> lever<00:05:02.009> and<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.909> spring

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
this position the lever and the spring

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.300 
this position the lever and the spring
are<00:05:03.599> up<00:05:03.990> on<00:05:04.199> the<00:05:04.379> upper<00:05:05.099> portion<00:05:06.289> almost

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
are up on the upper portion almost

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.559 
are up on the upper portion almost
midpoint<00:05:08.310> so<00:05:08.699> you<00:05:08.729> don't<00:05:08.969> have<00:05:09.150> a<00:05:09.180> lot<00:05:09.419> of

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:09.569 
midpoint so you don't have a lot of

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:11.959 
midpoint so you don't have a lot of
leverage<00:05:09.779> there<00:05:10.289> so<00:05:10.620> if<00:05:10.770> you<00:05:10.919> experience<00:05:11.580> this

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:11.969 
leverage there so if you experience this

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:15.769 
leverage there so if you experience this
the<00:05:12.659> best<00:05:12.960> thing<00:05:13.229> to<00:05:13.259> do<00:05:13.590> is<00:05:14.360> to<00:05:15.360> move<00:05:15.539> the

00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:15.779 
the best thing to do is to move the

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:22.909 
the best thing to do is to move the
springs<00:05:17.090> 180<00:05:18.090> degrees<00:05:18.569> and<00:05:19.009> get<00:05:20.629> the<00:05:21.629> tab<00:05:21.930> to

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
springs 180 degrees and get the tab to

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.490 
springs 180 degrees and get the tab to
interface<00:05:23.490> on<00:05:23.819> the<00:05:23.939> right<00:05:24.180> at<00:05:24.509> the<00:05:25.020> lowest

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
interface on the right at the lowest

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.529 
interface on the right at the lowest
position<00:05:25.740> using<00:05:26.279> the<00:05:26.550> fullest<00:05:27.060> amount<00:05:27.389> of

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
position using the fullest amount of

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.519 
position using the fullest amount of
lever<00:05:27.900> and<00:05:28.879> leverage<00:05:29.900> so<00:05:30.900> that<00:05:31.110> when<00:05:31.319> it<00:05:31.439> gets

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:31.529 
lever and leverage so that when it gets

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:35.269 
lever and leverage so that when it gets
to<00:05:31.710> that<00:05:31.919> right<00:05:32.189> position<00:05:32.849> it<00:05:33.569> clicks<00:05:34.560> down<00:05:34.979> on

00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:35.279 
to that right position it clicks down on

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:38.029 
to that right position it clicks down on
the<00:05:35.490> lower<00:05:35.759> portion<00:05:36.150> of<00:05:36.509> it<00:05:36.659> and<00:05:36.779> on<00:05:37.710> the<00:05:37.830> left

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
the lower portion of it and on the left

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.409 
the lower portion of it and on the left
portion<00:05:38.339> it's<00:05:38.610> still<00:05:38.819> going<00:05:39.000> to<00:05:39.060> be<00:05:39.180> a<00:05:39.210> little

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
portion it's still going to be a little

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.179 
portion it's still going to be a little
bit<00:05:39.599> higher<00:05:39.810> but<00:05:40.110> we<00:05:40.139> don't<00:05:40.409> experience<00:05:40.800> as

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:41.189 
bit higher but we don't experience as

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:45.769 
bit higher but we don't experience as
many<00:05:41.599> issues<00:05:42.830> with<00:05:43.879> the<00:05:44.879> left<00:05:45.120> border<00:05:45.389> as<00:05:45.629> we

00:05:45.769 --> 00:05:45.779 
many issues with the left border as we

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:47.329 
many issues with the left border as we
do<00:05:45.930> the<00:05:46.080> right<00:05:46.229> border<00:05:46.589> so<00:05:46.770> the<00:05:46.800> trick<00:05:47.159> is<00:05:47.310> to

00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:47.339 
do the right border so the trick is to

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:50.779 
do the right border so the trick is to
get<00:05:47.610> this<00:05:47.819> spring<00:05:48.270> in<00:05:48.830> the<00:05:49.830> lowest<00:05:50.219> contact

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
get this spring in the lowest contact

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.959 
get this spring in the lowest contact
area<00:05:51.300> this<00:05:51.569> lever<00:05:51.930> to<00:05:52.259> allow<00:05:53.129> leverage<00:05:53.580> occur

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:53.969 
area this lever to allow leverage occur

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:56.059 
area this lever to allow leverage occur
and<00:05:54.210> now<00:05:54.779> we'll<00:05:54.990> get<00:05:55.139> the<00:05:55.259> product<00:05:55.649> to<00:05:55.710> work

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:56.069 
and now we'll get the product to work

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:58.070 
and now we'll get the product to work
much<00:05:56.490> better<00:05:56.789> and<00:05:57.060> reverse<00:05:57.599> on<00:05:57.810> the<00:05:57.899> right

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
much better and reverse on the right

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.409 
much better and reverse on the right
side
