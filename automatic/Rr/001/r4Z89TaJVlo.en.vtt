00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
they're not scientific I'm a science

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.090 
they're not scientific I'm a science
major<00:02:55.610> i'm<00:02:56.000> an<00:02:56.150> engineer<00:02:56.780> they<00:02:57.739> are<00:02:57.890> not

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
major i'm an engineer they are not

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:06.610 
major i'm an engineer they are not
scientific<00:03:00.069> so<00:03:04.870> so<00:03:05.870> what<00:03:06.080> should<00:03:06.319> what<00:03:06.590> should

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
scientific so so what should what should

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.960 
scientific so so what should what should
we<00:03:07.010> do<00:03:07.190> then<00:03:07.430> they<00:03:07.730> came<00:03:07.970> out<00:03:08.000> with<00:03:08.209> the<00:03:08.890> 2005

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
we do then they came out with the 2005

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.560 
we do then they came out with the 2005
my<00:03:10.970> pyramid<00:03:11.420> they<00:03:12.080> refined<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.650> somewhat<00:03:13.130> and

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
my pyramid they refined to somewhat and

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.270 
my pyramid they refined to somewhat and
you<00:03:14.570> were<00:03:14.690> told<00:03:14.989> to<00:03:15.170> adjust<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.709> pyramid

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
you were told to adjust the pyramid

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.380 
you were told to adjust the pyramid
specifically<00:03:17.239> for<00:03:18.230> your<00:03:18.410> condition<00:03:19.390> what

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
specifically for your condition what

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.970 
specifically for your condition what
happened<00:03:21.459> diabetes<00:03:22.459> went<00:03:22.730> up<00:03:23.769> obesity<00:03:24.769> went

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
happened diabetes went up obesity went

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.410 
happened diabetes went up obesity went
up<00:03:25.299> help<00:03:26.299> went<00:03:26.660> down<00:03:27.430> people<00:03:28.430> tried<00:03:28.760> more<00:03:29.239> and

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
up help went down people tried more and

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.210 
up help went down people tried more and
more<00:03:29.630> to<00:03:29.840> comply<00:03:30.340> with<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.519> pyramid<00:03:32.829> so<00:03:33.829> this

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
more to comply with the pyramid so this

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.110 
more to comply with the pyramid so this
recently<00:03:35.150> they<00:03:35.329> come<00:03:35.540> out<00:03:35.690> with<00:03:35.720> my<00:03:36.290> plate

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
recently they come out with my plate

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.170 
recently they come out with my plate
this<00:03:38.120> is<00:03:38.180> nothing<00:03:38.750> but<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.079> same<00:03:39.320> thing<00:03:40.180> sixty

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
this is nothing but the same thing sixty

it<00:03:50.930> sugar<00:03:51.230> diabetes<00:03:51.530> for<00:03:52.100> good<00:03:52.340> reason<00:03:53.680> it's

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
it sugar diabetes for good reason it's

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.840 
it sugar diabetes for good reason it's
glucose<00:03:55.690> too<00:03:56.690> much<00:03:56.870> glucose<00:03:57.440> that<00:03:57.829> causes<00:03:58.670> you

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
glucose too much glucose that causes you

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.509 
glucose too much glucose that causes you
to<00:03:59.060> get<00:03:59.239> diabetes<00:04:00.880> how<00:04:01.880> do<00:04:01.940> you<00:04:02.060> prevent<00:04:02.120> that

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
to get diabetes how do you prevent that

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.319 
to get diabetes how do you prevent that
you<00:04:04.519> stop<00:04:05.000> eating<00:04:05.530> glucose<00:04:06.819> so<00:04:07.819> my<00:04:08.090> book

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
you stop eating glucose so my book

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.220 
you stop eating glucose so my book
presents<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:09.170> science<00:04:09.680> that<00:04:09.950> will<00:04:10.100> hopefully

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
presents the science that will hopefully

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.800 
presents the science that will hopefully
convince<00:04:12.230> you<00:04:12.590> to<00:04:13.010> switch<00:04:13.400> to<00:04:14.120> a<00:04:14.150> more<00:04:14.209> healthy

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
convince you to switch to a more healthy

standing<00:04:30.229> by<00:04:30.590> this<00:04:30.800> wood<00:04:31.130> pile<00:04:31.460> I<00:04:32.530> tried<00:04:33.530> to

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
standing by this wood pile I tried to

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.620 
standing by this wood pile I tried to
split<00:04:33.979> this<00:04:34.250> log<00:04:34.580> yesterday<00:04:35.330> on<00:04:35.659> my<00:04:35.900> video<00:04:36.320> and

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
split this log yesterday on my video and

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.820 
split this log yesterday on my video and
the<00:04:38.630> axe<00:04:39.039> got<00:04:40.039> stuck<00:04:40.490> in<00:04:40.760> the<00:04:40.789> log<00:04:41.680> so<00:04:42.680> I'm

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
the axe got stuck in the log so I'm

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.330 
the axe got stuck in the log so I'm
going<00:04:43.070> to<00:04:43.130> give<00:04:43.310> it<00:04:43.340> one<00:04:43.610> more<00:04:43.640> try<00:04:45.159> now<00:04:46.159> I've

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
going to give it one more try now I've

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.120 
going to give it one more try now I've
got<00:04:46.580> this<00:04:46.970> wood<00:04:47.300> here<00:04:47.810> that's<00:04:48.020> I<00:04:48.349> had<00:04:48.950> to

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
got this wood here that's I had to

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.920 
got this wood here that's I had to
purchase<00:04:49.370> because<00:04:50.000> I<00:04:50.360> ran<00:04:50.539> low<00:04:50.780> on<00:04:50.810> wood<00:04:51.229> I

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
purchase because I ran low on wood I

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.409 
purchase because I ran low on wood I
split<00:04:53.930> all<00:04:54.169> Mike's<00:04:54.500> most<00:04:55.340> of<00:04:55.490> my<00:04:55.610> smaller<00:04:56.060> ones

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
split all Mike's most of my smaller ones

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.250 
split all Mike's most of my smaller ones
here<00:04:56.900> I've<00:04:57.229> come<00:04:57.560> all<00:04:57.860> big<00:04:58.340> ones<00:04:58.580> left<00:04:59.260> which

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
here I've come all big ones left which

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.399 
here I've come all big ones left which
really<00:05:00.710> too<00:05:01.610> wet<00:05:01.820> to<00:05:02.210> green<00:05:02.479> to<00:05:02.510> burn<00:05:02.840> so<00:05:03.140> I<00:05:03.260> had

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:03.409 
really too wet to green to burn so I had

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:05.680 
really too wet to green to burn so I had
to<00:05:03.470> buy<00:05:03.650> this<00:05:03.710> stuff<00:05:04.190> pull<00:05:05.060> it<00:05:05.240> back<00:05:05.419> here

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
to buy this stuff pull it back here

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.210 
to buy this stuff pull it back here
stack<00:05:05.990> it<00:05:06.200> up<00:05:06.909> but<00:05:07.909> i<00:05:08.210> think<00:05:08.720> i'll<00:05:08.840> give<00:05:09.050> this

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
stack it up but i think i'll give this

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.899 
stack it up but i think i'll give this
long<00:05:10.220> big<00:05:10.550> log<00:05:10.789> another<00:05:11.120> try<00:05:11.539> see<00:05:11.960> if<00:05:12.020> we<00:05:12.050> can

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:12.909 
long big log another try see if we can

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:16.719 
long big log another try see if we can
see<00:05:13.909> if<00:05:13.970> we<00:05:14.000> can't<00:05:14.270> split<00:05:14.570> it<00:05:14.810> I<00:05:15.520> got<00:05:16.520> some

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
see if we can't split it I got some

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:24.519 
see if we can't split it I got some
safety<00:05:16.970> equipment<00:05:17.659> I<00:05:18.190> want<00:05:19.190> to<00:05:19.280> put<00:05:19.430> on<00:05:19.550> here

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:24.529 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:27.959 

first<00:05:25.219> of<00:05:25.459> all<00:05:25.609> I<00:05:25.939> need<00:05:26.389> to<00:05:26.479> get<00:05:26.659> this<00:05:26.809> acts<00:05:27.139> out

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:27.969 
first of all I need to get this acts out

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:31.599 
first of all I need to get this acts out
it's<00:05:28.969> wedged<00:05:29.269> in<00:05:29.629> there<00:05:29.809> so<00:05:30.049> tight<00:05:30.489> look<00:05:31.489> at

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:31.609 
it's wedged in there so tight look at

00:05:31.609 --> 00:05:34.959 
it's wedged in there so tight look at
that<00:05:32.349> so<00:05:33.349> I<00:05:33.649> really<00:05:34.039> brought<00:05:34.249> some<00:05:34.699> heavy

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:34.969 
that so I really brought some heavy

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:42.669 
that so I really brought some heavy
equipment<00:05:35.119> on<00:05:36.609> hopefully<00:05:37.609> I<00:05:37.639> can<00:05:37.759> do<00:05:38.119> this<00:05:41.679> try

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:42.679 
equipment on hopefully I can do this try

00:05:42.679 --> 00:05:45.459
