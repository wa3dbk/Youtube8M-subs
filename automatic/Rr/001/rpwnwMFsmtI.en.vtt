basically<00:00:12.889> the<00:00:13.309> SAT<00:00:13.639> is<00:00:13.849> a<00:00:14.299> form<00:00:14.660> of<00:00:14.750> a<00:00:14.869> spiral

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.289 
basically the SAT is a form of a spiral

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:17.529 
basically the SAT is a form of a spiral
of<00:00:15.500> course<00:00:15.949> you<00:00:16.129> add<00:00:16.820> break<00:00:17.119> your<00:00:17.360> weight

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
of course you add break your weight

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.679 
of course you add break your weight
shifting<00:00:17.990> and<00:00:18.169> as<00:00:18.740> you<00:00:19.099> turn<00:00:19.789> the<00:00:19.820> glider<00:00:20.390> if

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
shifting and as you turn the glider if

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.470 
shifting and as you turn the glider if
we're<00:00:20.930> turning<00:00:21.289> right<00:00:21.590> the<00:00:22.430> turn<00:00:22.699> swings<00:00:23.210> your

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
we're turning right the turn swings your

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.120 
we're turning right the turn swings your
body<00:00:23.689> out<00:00:23.840> to<00:00:24.110> the<00:00:24.199> left<00:00:24.439> and<00:00:24.650> you<00:00:24.770> start<00:00:25.070> to

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
body out to the left and you start to

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.210 
body out to the left and you start to
cause<00:00:25.699> maybe<00:00:26.090> a<00:00:26.240> dive<00:00:26.800> what<00:00:27.800> you're<00:00:27.949> doing

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
cause maybe a dive what you're doing

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.919 
cause maybe a dive what you're doing
this<00:00:28.369> your<00:00:28.730> break<00:00:29.029> on<00:00:29.210> the<00:00:29.300> right<00:00:29.480> is<00:00:29.599> on<00:00:29.750> the

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
this your break on the right is on the

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.619 
this your break on the right is on the
low<00:00:30.140> side<00:00:30.439> of<00:00:30.650> your<00:00:30.800> arm<00:00:31.039> for<00:00:31.880> a<00:00:31.939> set<00:00:32.269> you've

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
low side of your arm for a set you've

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.729 
low side of your arm for a set you've
got<00:00:32.839> to<00:00:33.019> turn<00:00:33.290> so<00:00:34.129> far<00:00:34.550> that<00:00:35.120> the<00:00:35.360> tip<00:00:35.739> that

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
got to turn so far that the tip that

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.229 
got to turn so far that the tip that
you're<00:00:36.920> not<00:00:36.980> giving<00:00:37.280> break<00:00:37.460> on<00:00:37.640> goes<00:00:37.940> down

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
you're not giving break on goes down

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:39.790 
you're not giving break on goes down
towards<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:38.809> horizon<00:00:38.960> and<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:39.500> break

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
towards the horizon and the break

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.070 
towards the horizon and the break
becomes<00:00:40.190> on<00:00:40.370> the<00:00:40.489> high<00:00:40.670> side<00:00:41.000> so<00:00:41.329> you<00:00:41.360> turn<00:00:41.839> it

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
becomes on the high side so you turn it

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.369 
becomes on the high side so you turn it
and<00:00:42.350> as<00:00:42.949> it<00:00:43.190> comes<00:00:43.460> down<00:00:43.760> from<00:00:44.089> 45<00:00:44.869> to<00:00:44.930> straight

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
and as it comes down from 45 to straight

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.799 
and as it comes down from 45 to straight
down<00:00:45.589> you<00:00:45.830> need<00:00:45.949> to<00:00:46.070> quickly<00:00:46.400> pull<00:00:47.150> a<00:00:47.390> lot<00:00:47.629> of

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
down you need to quickly pull a lot of

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.560 
down you need to quickly pull a lot of
break<00:00:48.019> to<00:00:48.199> get<00:00:48.379> the<00:00:48.559> tip<00:00:48.799> down<00:00:49.250> and<00:00:49.760> the<00:00:50.360> break

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
break to get the tip down and the break

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.030 
break to get the tip down and the break
on<00:00:50.720> the<00:00:50.809> high<00:00:50.960> side<00:00:51.260> and<00:00:51.500> you<00:00:51.589> starting<00:00:51.979> to

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
on the high side and you starting to

00:00:52.040 --> 00:01:01.380 
on the high side and you starting to
rotate<00:00:52.400> backwards

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.850 

the<00:01:02.390> penalties<00:01:02.810> are<00:01:02.840> messing<00:01:03.290> a<00:01:03.380> SAT<00:01:03.650> up

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
the penalties are messing a SAT up

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.010 
the penalties are messing a SAT up
you're<00:01:04.400> going<00:01:04.700> to<00:01:04.760> end<00:01:04.880> up<00:01:04.970> with<00:01:05.030> a<00:01:05.210> very<00:01:05.240> fast

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
you're going to end up with a very fast

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.770 
you're going to end up with a very fast
spiral<00:01:06.620> which<00:01:07.310> needs<00:01:07.580> to<00:01:07.700> be<00:01:07.790> exited<00:01:08.270> properly

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
spiral which needs to be exited properly

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.050 
spiral which needs to be exited properly
or<00:01:09.260> you're<00:01:09.710> going<00:01:09.830> to<00:01:09.890> end<00:01:09.950> up<00:01:10.190> in<00:01:10.400> a<00:01:10.520> negative

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
or you're going to end up in a negative

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.390 
or you're going to end up in a negative
spin<00:01:12.970> talk<00:01:13.970> a<00:01:14.000> little<00:01:14.180> bit<00:01:14.360> about<00:01:14.510> the<00:01:14.840> posture

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
spin talk a little bit about the posture

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.740 
spin talk a little bit about the posture
which<00:01:16.400> is<00:01:16.640> basically<00:01:17.180> how<00:01:17.420> you're<00:01:17.570> going<00:01:17.660> to

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
which is basically how you're going to

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.180 
which is basically how you're going to
hold<00:01:17.930> your<00:01:18.110> body<00:01:18.470> and<00:01:18.740> how<00:01:18.860> you're<00:01:19.010> going<00:01:19.100> to

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
hold your body and how you're going to

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.840 
hold your body and how you're going to
hold<00:01:19.340> your<00:01:19.430> brakes<00:01:21.100> depending<00:01:22.100> on<00:01:22.310> your

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
hold your brakes depending on your

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.320 
hold your brakes depending on your
glider<00:01:23.320> what<00:01:24.320> I<00:01:24.350> do<00:01:24.500> is<00:01:24.950> I<00:01:25.250> take<00:01:25.520> a<00:01:25.580> half<00:01:25.940> wrap

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
glider what I do is I take a half wrap

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.770 
glider what I do is I take a half wrap
reach<00:01:27.320> my<00:01:27.560> hand<00:01:27.830> through<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:29.180> break<00:01:29.390> tug<00:01:29.630> on

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
reach my hand through the break tug on

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.630 
reach my hand through the break tug on
grab<00:01:30.080> it<00:01:30.230> at<00:01:30.320> forefinger<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:31.070> then<00:01:31.310> i'll<00:01:31.430> take

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
grab it at forefinger and then i'll take

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.240 
grab it at forefinger and then i'll take
another<00:01:31.760> wrap<00:01:32.240> on<00:01:32.450> top<00:01:32.660> of<00:01:32.840> that<00:01:32.990> if<00:01:33.800> you<00:01:33.979> do<00:01:34.130> it

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
another wrap on top of that if you do it

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.969 
another wrap on top of that if you do it
too<00:01:34.430> slowly<00:01:34.780> you<00:01:35.780> get<00:01:35.930> a<00:01:35.960> lot<00:01:36.110> of<00:01:36.170> rotation<00:01:36.800> and

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
too slowly you get a lot of rotation and

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.410 
too slowly you get a lot of rotation and
neither<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:37.340> outside<00:01:37.790> tipple<00:01:38.270> deflate<00:01:38.660> and

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
neither the outside tipple deflate and

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.030 
neither the outside tipple deflate and
it'll<00:01:41.420> throw<00:01:41.630> your<00:01:41.900> weight<00:01:42.080> shift<00:01:42.350> out<00:01:42.590> and

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
it'll throw your weight shift out and

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.460 
it'll throw your weight shift out and
you<00:01:43.430> can't<00:01:43.700> make<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.090> tip<00:01:44.300> dig<00:01:44.600> in<00:01:44.840> and<00:01:45.290> you've

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
you can't make the tip dig in and you've

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.830 
you can't make the tip dig in and you've
probably<00:01:46.250> seen<00:01:46.640> people<00:01:46.970> attempt<00:01:47.300> ten<00:01:47.510> sets

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
probably seen people attempt ten sets

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.130 
probably seen people attempt ten sets
for<00:01:48.440> the<00:01:48.530> tip<00:01:48.740> deflates<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:50.630> other<00:01:50.780> side<00:01:51.110> of

for the tip deflates the other side of
that<00:01:51.380> is<00:01:51.760> you<00:01:52.760> are<00:01:53.030> turning<00:01:53.330> it<00:01:53.600> towards<00:01:53.869> the

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
that is you are turning it towards the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.440 
that is you are turning it towards the
spiral<00:01:54.619> and<00:01:54.800> as<00:01:55.040> you<00:01:55.220> pull<00:01:55.460> that<00:01:55.640> large<00:01:56.150> amount

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
spiral and as you pull that large amount

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.670 
spiral and as you pull that large amount
of<00:01:56.510> break<00:01:56.720> in<00:01:56.840> weight<00:01:56.990> shift<00:01:57.229> when<00:01:57.410> it's<00:01:57.530> going

of break in weight shift when it's going

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.620 
of break in weight shift when it's going
from<00:01:57.890> 45<00:01:58.280> to<00:01:58.340> straighten<00:01:58.670> out<00:01:58.790> you<00:01:59.030> rotate<00:01:59.600> it

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
from 45 to straighten out you rotate it

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.530 
from 45 to straighten out you rotate it
too<00:01:59.990> far<00:02:00.290> in<00:02:00.500> it<00:02:00.619> spins<00:02:01.130> and<00:02:02.060> goes<00:02:02.090> into<00:02:02.420> a

too far in it spins and goes into a

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.450 
too far in it spins and goes into a
negative<00:02:02.960> spin

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460

a sad is very dynamic feeling for the

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.660 
a sad is very dynamic feeling for the
pilot<00:02:09.479> because<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.500> start<00:02:10.920> out<00:02:11.100> with<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.340> very

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
pilot because you start out with a very

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.840 
pilot because you start out with a very
large<00:02:12.090> circle<00:02:12.810> arc<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.350> when<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.190> enter<00:02:14.700> into
