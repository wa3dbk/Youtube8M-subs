00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.160 
but um the fifth one is run Edie run and
it's<00:01:16.530> basically<00:01:17.100> where<00:01:17.850> they<00:01:18.630> think<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
it's basically where they think that the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.090 
it's basically where they think that the
sky<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.500> falling<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:20.460> guess<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.920> think<00:01:22.920> that's

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
sky is falling I guess I think that's

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.780

Harbor<00:01:23.520> it

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
Harbor it

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
Harbor it
it's<00:01:24.479> where<00:01:25.640> Sarah<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.880> Jimmy<00:01:27.240> tried<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.689> get

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
the front seats on the bus so they can

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.280 
the front seats on the bus so they can
have<00:01:29.640> dibs<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> jawbreakers<00:01:30.750> at<00:01:31.079> the
