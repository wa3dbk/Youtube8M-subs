destination you have to do two different

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.620 
destination you have to do two different
spaces<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.549> make<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.850> work<00:01:21.119> too<00:01:21.360> but

leaves<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:24.090> lot<00:01:24.630> less<00:01:24.900> chance<00:01:25.259> for<00:01:25.380> error<00:01:25.710> so

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
leaves a lot less chance for error so

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.039
