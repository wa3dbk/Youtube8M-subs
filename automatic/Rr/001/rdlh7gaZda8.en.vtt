00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.200
 do not know how to take this crumb off 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.950

 take the kernel you have come here 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:39.250
 my here o 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.790
 let the battery cable connect 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.790
 to do this service 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.460
 after you unplugged the cable from the 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.700

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.380
 if you do not, fold a thin nail 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.829
 but a key is better, right? 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:04.760
 there is a hole here in this hole 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:08.420

 hole leaves here if you force no 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.490
 Nothing happens because you have to 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.600

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.600
