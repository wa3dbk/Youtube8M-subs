00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.540
 is here 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.650

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.650
 to open it 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.000

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.090
 as if it were the flames at the desk 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.610

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.280

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.850

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.140

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.159
 cut them out 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.159
 they will cut manually 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:48.009
 and it will fit so you can add a text 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.009
