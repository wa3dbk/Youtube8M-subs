00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
raised it with the stock springs so I

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.590 
raised it with the stock springs so I
went<00:00:57.640> up<00:00:57.790> a<00:00:57.910> little<00:00:57.940> bit<00:00:58.210> and<00:00:58.269> then<00:00:58.329> it<00:00:58.480> came

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
went up a little bit and then it came

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.770 
went up a little bit and then it came
down<00:00:58.840> right<00:00:58.870> now<00:00:59.140> with<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.500> batteries<00:01:00.780> so

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.869 
down right now with the batteries so
hopefully<00:01:02.170> with<00:01:02.320> the<00:01:02.410> subs<00:01:02.680> it'll<00:01:02.949> go<00:01:03.100> even

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
hopefully with the subs it'll go even

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:29.010 
hopefully with the subs it'll go even

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
access to their to the splitter we got

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.670 
access to their to the splitter we got
the<00:02:09.980> sky<00:02:10.160> high<00:02:10.310> wire<00:02:10.520> to<00:02:11.090> watch<00:02:11.620> there's<00:02:12.620> a

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
the sky high wire to watch there's a

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.330 
the sky high wire to watch there's a
black<00:02:12.920> with<00:02:13.070> it<00:02:13.160> round<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:14.080> Bible<00:02:15.080> right<00:02:15.410> here

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:27.970 

disappointing

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.910 

as<00:02:28.489> you<00:02:28.610> can<00:02:28.670> see<00:02:28.909> we<00:02:29.060> have<00:02:29.170> 20<00:02:30.170> gauge<00:02:30.379> runs<00:02:30.680> and

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
as you can see we have 20 gauge runs and

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.970 
as you can see we have 20 gauge runs and
I'm<00:02:30.980> going<00:02:31.099> to<00:02:31.159> put<00:02:31.400> two<00:02:31.970> two-out<00:02:32.420> runs<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:33.920> we

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
I'm going to put two two-out runs so we

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.339 
I'm going to put two two-out runs so we
just<00:02:34.099> have<00:02:34.190> just<00:02:34.489> enough<00:02:34.640> room<00:02:34.819> for<00:02:35.000> another

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
just have just enough room for another

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.380 
just have just enough room for another
12<00:02:36.349> what<00:02:38.319> one<00:02:39.319> is<00:02:39.379> all<00:02:39.500> be<00:02:39.590> down<00:02:39.739> to<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:39.890> frame

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
12 what one is all be down to the frame

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.360 
12 what one is all be down to the frame
solder<00:02:41.390> it<00:02:41.629> with<00:02:41.780> terminal<00:02:42.170> we<00:02:42.980> won't<00:02:43.190> finish

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
solder it with terminal we won't finish

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.680 
solder it with terminal we won't finish
it<00:02:43.489> on<00:02:43.610> there<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:43.849> send<00:02:44.030> off<00:02:44.209> all<00:02:44.299> the<00:02:44.420> excess

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
it on there and send off all the excess

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.940 
it on there and send off all the excess
paint<00:02:46.720> will<00:02:47.720> be<00:02:47.750> good<00:02:48.910> physical<00:02:49.910> right<00:02:50.060> here

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
paint will be good physical right here

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.289 
paint will be good physical right here

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
if I make this one go right here since
