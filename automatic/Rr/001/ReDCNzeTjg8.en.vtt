Ultron and of course the Hulk it was a
good<00:00:23.640> opportunity<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.600> build<00:00:24.990> on<00:00:25.199> what<00:00:25.380> they

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
good opportunity to build on what they

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.670 
good opportunity to build on what they
done<00:00:25.740> on<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.980> first<00:00:26.220> Avengers<00:00:26.730> Hulk<00:00:27.689> was<00:00:28.050> well

done on the first Avengers Hulk was well

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.790 
done on the first Avengers Hulk was well
realized<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.550> film<00:00:29.820> for<00:00:30.119> sure<00:00:30.300> but<00:00:31.289> the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
realized in that film for sure but the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.410 
realized in that film for sure but the
challenge<00:00:32.250> coming<00:00:32.460> into<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:32.790> was<00:00:33.000> ok<00:00:33.270> well

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
challenge coming into this was ok well

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.270 
challenge coming into this was ok well
how<00:00:33.540> can<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:33.750> improve<00:00:34.020> upon<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.590> here<00:00:34.770> make<00:00:35.130> it

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
how can we improve upon it here make it

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.209 
how can we improve upon it here make it
better<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.090> we<00:00:36.719> pretty<00:00:37.380> much<00:00:37.469> rebuild<00:00:38.100> him

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
better and so we pretty much rebuild him

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.310 
better and so we pretty much rebuild him

involved<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.100> sub<00:00:44.370> mesh<00:00:44.640> on<00:00:44.879> top<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.780> muscle

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
involved a sub mesh on top of the muscle

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.619 
involved a sub mesh on top of the muscle
shapes<00:00:46.469> more<00:00:47.129> like<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.489> facial<00:00:48.090> skin<00:00:48.420> layer

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629

Mark Ruffalo actually wore cricket
gloves<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.689> Scarlett<00:01:25.259> Johansson<00:01:25.860> had

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
gloves so that Scarlett Johansson had

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.310 
gloves so that Scarlett Johansson had
something<00:01:26.400> roughly<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.540> right<00:01:27.750> size<00:01:27.990> to

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
something roughly the right size to

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.490 
something roughly the right size to
touch<00:01:28.970> well<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.000> think<00:01:30.119> we<00:01:30.420> paved<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.229> ground

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
touch well I think we paved the ground

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.620 
touch well I think we paved the ground
with<00:01:32.040> Avengers<00:01:32.610> 1<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:33.150> know<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.450> was<00:01:33.570> very

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
with Avengers 1 you know it was very

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.569 
with Avengers 1 you know it was very
well<00:01:34.020> received<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.710> terms<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.280> his

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
well received in terms of his

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.789 
well received in terms of his
performance<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.329> his<00:01:36.390> believability<00:01:37.049> we

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
performance and his believability we

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.100 
performance and his believability we
took<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.460> as<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> challenge<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.540> we<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:39.960> make

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
took that as a challenge of we can make

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.230 
took that as a challenge of we can make
it<00:01:40.229> better<00:01:40.380> we<00:01:40.860> revamp<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.640> entire<00:01:41.670> model

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
it better we revamp the entire model

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.289 
it better we revamp the entire model
including<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.079> facial<00:01:43.470> shapes<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.299> really

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
including the facial shapes and really

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.510 
including the facial shapes and really
kind<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.689> matching<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.560> intent<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.130> we<00:01:47.310> saw

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
kind of matching the intent that we saw

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.550 
kind of matching the intent that we saw
from<00:01:47.759> Mark<00:01:47.970> Ruffalo<00:01:48.450> when<00:01:48.630> he<00:01:48.810> was<00:01:48.930> on<00:01:49.110> set<00:01:49.380> or

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
from Mark Ruffalo when he was on set or

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.520 
from Mark Ruffalo when he was on set or
pushing<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.520> where<00:01:50.790> jaws<00:01:51.180> needed<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.810> for

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
pushing it to where jaws needed to for

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.550 
pushing it to where jaws needed to for
the<00:01:52.710> comic<00:01:53.159> action<00:01:53.399> beats<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.720> explored

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
the comic action beats we explored

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.459 
the comic action beats we explored
definitely<00:01:56.340> making<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.630> more<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.110> comic

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
definitely making it more in that comic

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.859 
definitely making it more in that comic
