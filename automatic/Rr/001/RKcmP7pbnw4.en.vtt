they<00:01:35.009> played<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> much<00:01:35.460> simpler<00:01:35.850> game<00:01:36.060> they

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
they played a much simpler game they

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.120 
they played a much simpler game they

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
chances in the first game but it just

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.830 
chances in the first game but it just
seems<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.000> you-know-what<00:02:09.360> Niemi<00:02:09.720> has

guys<00:02:52.670> like<00:02:52.880> Dustin<00:02:53.240> Byfuglien<00:02:53.390> get<00:02:53.630> in<00:02:53.690> the

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
guys like Dustin Byfuglien get in the

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.240 
guys like Dustin Byfuglien get in the
front<00:02:53.930> they<00:02:54.410> have<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.740> take<00:02:54.920> a<00:02:54.980> more

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
front they have to take a more

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.910 
front they have to take a more
workmanlike<00:02:55.580> attitude<00:02:56.290> they<00:02:57.290> are<00:02:57.470> moving<00:02:57.710> the

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
workmanlike attitude they are moving the

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.590

puck<00:02:58.040> around<00:02:58.220> very<00:02:58.640> well<00:02:58.730> but<00:02:59.480> their

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
puck around very well but their

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.180 
puck around very well but their
finishers<00:02:59.990> have<00:03:00.140> to<00:03:00.260> finish<00:03:00.410> guys<00:03:00.830> like<00:03:00.890> Joe

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190

step up to the plate but it all starts
with<00:03:09.500> generating<00:03:10.010> that<00:03:10.160> shot<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.640> getting<00:03:10.970> to

a<00:03:17.990> lot<00:03:18.290> of<00:03:18.320> actually<00:03:18.800> breaking<00:03:19.460> up<00:03:19.760> that<00:03:19.970> big

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.210 
a lot of actually breaking up that big

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.670 
a lot of actually breaking up that big
line<00:03:20.480> and<00:03:20.510> moving<00:03:20.960> guys<00:03:21.110> around<00:03:21.140> because

the road you're not going to get the

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
matches you want their Chicago has the

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.790 
matches you want their Chicago has the
less<00:03:26.000> change<00:03:26.330> you<00:03:26.810> maybe<00:03:27.020> move<00:03:27.290> heatley<00:03:27.680> the

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
less change you maybe move heatley the

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.380 
less change you maybe move heatley the
one<00:03:27.980> line<00:03:28.220> model<00:03:28.550> to<00:03:28.700> another<00:03:28.910> line<00:03:29.090> just<00:03:29.300> to

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
one line model to another line just to

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.210 
one line model to another line just to
just<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:29.900> change<00:03:30.230> things<00:03:30.560> around<00:03:30.710> when<00:03:31.130> you

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
just to change things around when you

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.530 
just to change things around when you
aren't<00:03:31.400> scoring<00:03:31.670> I'm<00:03:31.940> surprised<00:03:32.300> there<00:03:32.480> isn't

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
aren't scoring I'm surprised there isn't

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.230 
aren't scoring I'm surprised there isn't
more<00:03:32.750> tinkering<00:03:33.140> going<00:03:33.530> along<00:03:33.770> I<00:03:34.190> that's<00:03:35.090> what

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
more tinkering going along I that's what

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.790 
more tinkering going along I that's what
it's<00:03:35.390> there<00:03:35.420> for<00:03:35.540> it<00:03:35.810> and<00:03:35.930> it's<00:03:36.140> not<00:03:36.320> set<00:03:36.770> in

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
it's there for it and it's not set in

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.350 
it's there for it and it's not set in
stone<00:03:36.890> that<00:03:37.340> three<00:03:37.610> guys<00:03:37.790> have<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.180> play

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
stone that three guys have to play

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.180 
stone that three guys have to play
together<00:03:38.540> and<00:03:38.840> sometimes<00:03:39.050> you<00:03:39.770> need<00:03:40.010> a<00:03:40.070> little

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
together and sometimes you need a little

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.670 
together and sometimes you need a little
break<00:03:40.910> up<00:03:41.150> of<00:03:41.240> that<00:03:41.420> monotony<00:03:41.930> sometimes<00:03:42.320> it

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
break up of that monotony sometimes it

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.110 
break up of that monotony sometimes it
gets<00:03:42.890> a<00:03:43.040> little<00:03:43.160> stale<00:03:43.400> and<00:03:43.550> maybe<00:03:43.760> get<00:03:44.000> the

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
gets a little stale and maybe get the

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.550 
gets a little stale and maybe get the
other<00:03:44.240> guys<00:03:44.480> going<00:03:44.900> absolutely<00:03:45.410> there's

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
other guys going absolutely there's

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.130 
other guys going absolutely there's
other<00:03:45.710> guys<00:03:45.950> that<00:03:45.980> maybe<00:03:46.820> you<00:03:47.450> throw<00:03:47.690> a<00:03:47.750> shift

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
other guys that maybe you throw a shift

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.270 
other guys that maybe you throw a shift
to<00:03:48.230> here<00:03:48.380> and<00:03:48.470> there<00:03:48.590> we<00:03:48.710> see<00:03:48.740> it<00:03:48.980> happen<00:03:49.220> all

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
to here and there we see it happen all

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.310 
to here and there we see it happen all
the<00:03:49.340> time<00:03:49.460> I'm<00:03:50.060> surprised<00:03:50.570> he<00:03:50.750> hasn't<00:03:50.900> done

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
the time I'm surprised he hasn't done

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.440 
the time I'm surprised he hasn't done
more<00:03:52.040> in<00:03:52.310> this<00:03:52.640> round<00:03:52.940> I<00:03:53.060> thought<00:03:53.210> he<00:03:53.300> did<00:03:53.330> a

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
more in this round I thought he did a

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.030 
more in this round I thought he did a
great<00:03:53.600> job<00:03:53.720> like<00:03:54.020> we<00:03:54.140> set<00:03:54.350> off<00:03:54.470> camera<00:03:54.770> yeah

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
great job like we set off camera yeah

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.980 
great job like we set off camera yeah
and<00:03:55.340> really<00:03:56.000> doing<00:03:56.420> a<00:03:56.480> great<00:03:56.570> job<00:03:56.660> through<00:03:56.960> the

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
and really doing a great job through the

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.930 
and really doing a great job through the
first<00:03:57.260> two<00:03:57.410> rounds<00:03:57.440> in<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:58.430> third<00:03:58.610> round<00:03:58.730> I

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
first two rounds in the third round I

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.370 
first two rounds in the third round I
think<00:03:59.180> he's<00:03:59.300> been<00:03:59.510> out<00:03:59.660> coached<00:03:59.930> I<00:04:00.170> think

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
think he's been out coached I think

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.230 
think he's been out coached I think
quintals<00:04:00.800> dot<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.190> matchups<00:04:01.610> he<00:04:01.730> wanted<00:04:02.150> I

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
quintals dot the matchups he wanted I

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.640 
quintals dot the matchups he wanted I
don't<00:04:02.420> think<00:04:02.630> he's<00:04:02.780> that<00:04:02.900> enough<00:04:03.140> tinkering

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
don't think he's that enough tinkering

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.500 
don't think he's that enough tinkering
and<00:04:03.770> I<00:04:04.520> really<00:04:04.790> addressed<00:04:05.120> the<00:04:05.210> plan<00:04:05.390> of

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
and I really addressed the plan of

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.090 
and I really addressed the plan of
getting<00:04:05.630> to<00:04:05.810> the<00:04:05.870> front<00:04:06.050> of<00:04:06.140> the<00:04:06.200> net<00:04:06.350> well

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
getting to the front of the net well

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.070 
getting to the front of the net well
it's<00:04:07.670> going<00:04:07.880> to<00:04:07.940> be<00:04:08.060> a<00:04:08.090> big<00:04:08.270> game<00:04:08.450> again<00:04:08.780> like

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
it's going to be a big game again like

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.470 
it's going to be a big game again like
