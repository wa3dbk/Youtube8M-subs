but back to the buckle we use the buckle
for<00:00:33.510> one<00:00:33.690> major<00:00:33.870> reason<00:00:34.170> get<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.219> same

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
spot every time with Velcro you really

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.060 
spot every time with Velcro you really
don't<00:00:37.230> know<00:00:37.350> where<00:00:37.530> you're<00:00:37.680> going<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.890> be

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
don't know where you're going to be

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.160

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
but this is the exact same thing every

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.590 
but this is the exact same thing every
time<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.860> next<00:00:44.100> thing<00:00:44.219> we<00:00:44.370> use<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.910> their<00:00:45.120> NCS

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
time the next thing we use is their NCS

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.930

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
pretty good so the next thing is I use a

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.149 
pretty good so the next thing is I use a
dual<00:01:17.970> caliper<00:01:18.479> see<00:01:19.020> right<00:01:19.200> here<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.890> Klaus

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
dual caliper see right here to Klaus

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.359 
dual caliper see right here to Klaus
very<00:01:21.060> rounded<00:01:21.390> up<00:01:21.479> front<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:22.159> like<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> lot

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
very rounded up front I like it a lot

one<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.909> silver<00:01:27.689> horn<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.710> one<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.040> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
one is the silver horn this one is the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.700 
one is the silver horn this one is the
saber-tooth<00:01:29.720> you<00:01:30.720> can<00:01:30.869> see<00:01:31.079> two<00:01:31.350> similar

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
saber-tooth you can see two similar

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.340 
saber-tooth you can see two similar
items<00:01:32.280> on<00:01:32.490> them<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.090> forward<00:01:33.570> neural<00:01:33.990> trigger

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
items on them the forward neural trigger

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.300 
items on them the forward neural trigger
system<00:01:34.850> that<00:01:35.850> allows<00:01:36.150> us<00:01:37.040> when<00:01:38.040> we<00:01:38.159> actually

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
system that allows us when we actually

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.980 
system that allows us when we actually
are<00:01:38.780> getting<00:01:39.780> into<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.049> shot<00:01:40.290> here<00:01:41.750> one<00:01:42.750> thing

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
are getting into the shot here one thing

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.719 
are getting into the shot here one thing
with<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.259> dual<00:01:43.409> caliper<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.130> first<00:01:44.399> getting<00:01:44.670> a

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
with the dual caliper is first getting a

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.210 
with the dual caliper is first getting a
hooked<00:01:44.880> on<00:01:45.030> but<00:01:46.020> I'm<00:01:46.110> actually<00:01:46.350> able<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.920> get

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
hooked on but I'm actually able to get

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.399 
hooked on but I'm actually able to get
that<00:01:47.460> get<00:01:47.759> my<00:01:47.909> finger<00:01:48.299> up<00:01:48.540> into<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.170> trigger

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
sometimes I just execute my shot a
