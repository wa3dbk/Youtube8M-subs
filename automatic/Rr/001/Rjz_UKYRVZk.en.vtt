00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:25.569 
and the idea here is to maximize surface

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:28.710 
and the idea here is to maximize surface
area<00:01:26.050> so<00:01:26.800> that<00:01:26.830> when<00:01:27.130> we're<00:01:27.369> making<00:01:27.720> our

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
area so that when we're making our

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.540 
area so that when we're making our
popcorn<00:01:29.140> when<00:01:29.500> we're<00:01:29.679> finishing<00:01:29.920> our<00:01:30.099> popcorn

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
that this salt sticks in every little

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:36.419 
that this salt sticks in every little
nook<00:01:34.929> and<00:01:35.229> cranny<00:01:35.500> of<00:01:35.619> that<00:01:35.800> popcorn<00:01:36.280> you<00:01:36.369> can

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.260 
wait for this to where it gets hot
enough<00:02:17.440> to<00:02:17.590> where<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:17.920> just<00:02:17.950> begins<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:18.849> smoke

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
enough to where it just begins to smoke

enough to where it just begins to smoke
I<00:02:19.510> mean<00:02:20.110> bacon<00:02:20.800> grease<00:02:21.040> has<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.310> lower<00:02:21.790> smoke

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
I mean bacon grease has a lower smoke

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.990 
I mean bacon grease has a lower smoke
point<00:02:22.960> than<00:02:23.770> cooking<00:02:24.550> oil

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
point than cooking oil

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.610

scratches on it so just give it a swirl
and<00:03:57.670> then<00:03:57.910> set<00:03:58.150> it<00:03:58.180> back<00:03:58.390> on<00:03:58.570> there<00:03:58.840> and<00:03:58.989> just

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
and then set it back on there and just

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.780 
and then set it back on there and just
vent<00:04:00.489> it<00:04:00.640> just<00:04:00.880> a<00:04:01.000> wee<00:04:01.329> little<00:04:01.510> bit<00:04:01.920> now<00:04:02.920> it

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
vent it just a wee little bit now it

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.690 
vent it just a wee little bit now it
just<00:04:03.850> so<00:04:04.060> happens<00:04:04.450> that<00:04:04.510> my<00:04:04.720> burner<00:04:04.989> cycles<00:04:05.890> on

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
just so happens that my burner cycles on

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.610 
just so happens that my burner cycles on
my<00:04:06.850> electric<00:04:07.239> stove<00:04:07.540> about<00:04:08.049> the<00:04:08.200> time<00:04:08.410> that<00:04:08.590> I

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
my electric stove about the time that I

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.250 
my electric stove about the time that I
need<00:04:09.010> to<00:04:09.910> pick<00:04:10.180> this<00:04:10.269> up<00:04:10.420> and<00:04:10.540> Swizzle<00:04:10.989> it<00:04:11.110> so<00:04:11.230> I

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
need to pick this up and Swizzle it so I

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.840 
need to pick this up and Swizzle it so I
watched<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:11.709> burner<00:04:11.920> cycles<00:04:12.400> here<00:04:12.519> don't

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
watched the burner cycles here don't

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.120 
watched the burner cycles here don't
walk<00:04:13.510> away<00:04:13.780> from<00:04:13.989> it<00:04:14.140> though<00:04:14.260> you<00:04:14.530> really

would<00:04:30.340> be<00:04:30.370> a<00:04:30.490> bad<00:04:30.520> idea

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.009 

and<00:04:34.759> very<00:04:34.969> shortly<00:04:35.029> we're<00:04:35.509> going<00:04:35.629> to<00:04:35.689> start<00:04:35.929> to

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:36.019 
and very shortly we're going to start to

00:04:36.019 --> 00:04:38.859 
and very shortly we're going to start to
hear<00:04:36.169> this<00:04:36.319> pop<00:04:37.099> and<00:04:37.610> once<00:04:38.239> it<00:04:38.360> starts<00:04:38.599> to<00:04:38.689> pop

00:04:38.859 --> 00:04:38.869 
hear this pop and once it starts to pop

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:40.540 
hear this pop and once it starts to pop
then<00:04:39.169> you<00:04:39.259> really<00:04:39.800> got<00:04:39.919> to<00:04:39.979> watch<00:04:40.219> it<00:04:40.429> because

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
then you really got to watch it because

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:47.259 
then you really got to watch it because
this<00:04:40.849> sugar<00:04:41.539> in<00:04:41.719> it<00:04:41.839> and<00:04:41.869> it<00:04:42.169> will<00:04:42.349> burn<00:04:46.269> the

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:47.269 
this sugar in it and it will burn the

00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:49.239 
this sugar in it and it will burn the
closer<00:04:47.509> you<00:04:47.749> get<00:04:47.869> to<00:04:47.929> done<00:04:48.259> the<00:04:48.619> less<00:04:48.800> popping

00:04:49.239 --> 00:04:49.249 
closer you get to done the less popping

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:53.409 
closer you get to done the less popping
you're<00:04:49.369> gonna<00:04:49.519> hear<00:04:49.939> and<00:04:52.209> it's<00:04:53.209> going<00:04:53.360> to

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
you're gonna hear and it's going to

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.149 
you're gonna hear and it's going to
start<00:04:53.629> to<00:04:53.749> sound<00:04:53.929> muted<00:04:54.379> and<00:04:54.589> you<00:04:54.679> don't<00:04:54.919> want

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:55.159 
start to sound muted and you don't want

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:58.329 
start to sound muted and you don't want
to<00:04:55.249> go<00:04:55.539> beyond<00:04:56.539> popping<00:04:57.229> because<00:04:58.219> you're

00:04:58.329 --> 00:04:58.339 
to go beyond popping because you're

00:04:58.339 --> 00:05:00.820 
to go beyond popping because you're
gonna<00:04:58.429> burn<00:04:58.729> so<00:04:59.539> it<00:04:59.869> might<00:04:59.989> take<00:05:00.229> you<00:05:00.379> a<00:05:00.409> couple

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
gonna burn so it might take you a couple

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.529 
gonna burn so it might take you a couple
of<00:05:00.919> tries<00:05:01.129> to<00:05:01.429> get<00:05:01.580> this<00:05:01.729> just<00:05:01.969> right<00:05:04.360> this<00:05:05.360> is

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
of tries to get this just right this is

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:14.819 
of tries to get this just right this is
almost<00:05:05.839> done<00:05:06.110> I<00:05:10.209> don't<00:05:11.209> want<00:05:11.360> to<00:05:11.419> burn<00:05:11.599> this

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:14.829 

00:05:14.829 --> 00:05:17.259 

get<00:05:15.829> a<00:05:15.860> few<00:05:16.129> more<00:05:16.219> popping<00:05:16.669> in<00:05:16.759> there<00:05:16.879> but<00:05:17.209> it

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:17.269 
get a few more popping in there but it

00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:20.409 
get a few more popping in there but it
might<00:05:17.509> not<00:05:17.539> even<00:05:17.749> be<00:05:18.019> worth<00:05:18.349> it<00:05:18.589> -<00:05:19.519> if<00:05:20.179> I<00:05:20.300> was

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
might not even be worth it - if I was

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:21.729 
might not even be worth it - if I was
going<00:05:20.539> to<00:05:20.599> burn<00:05:20.749> this<00:05:20.959> well<00:05:21.229> you<00:05:21.469> know<00:05:21.559> what

less than you think you'll need this and

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:19.959 
less than you think you'll need this and

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:28.219 
pretty good okay where to start I think

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:30.729
