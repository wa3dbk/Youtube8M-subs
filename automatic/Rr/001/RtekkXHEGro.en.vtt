00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.110 
British guy who builds a the joke was he
builds<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.920> rocket<00:02:35.250> in<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.489> basement<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.030> his

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
builds a rocket in the basement of his

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.610 
builds a rocket in the basement of his
house<00:02:36.360> and<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:36.780> was<00:02:37.049> kind<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.440> joke

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
house and that was kind of the joke

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.399 
house and that was kind of the joke
basically<00:02:38.959> builds<00:02:39.959> it<00:02:40.049> in<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.200> wrong<00:02:40.379> place

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409

basically builds it in the wrong place
and<00:02:41.629> and<00:02:42.629> then<00:02:42.750> I<00:02:42.810> thought<00:02:42.989> maybe<00:02:43.200> he<00:02:43.890> needs<00:02:44.099> an

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
and and then I thought maybe he needs an

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.970 
and and then I thought maybe he needs an
assistant<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.090> maybe<00:02:45.959> an<00:02:46.110> animal<00:02:46.230> he<00:02:46.890> was

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
assistant and maybe an animal he was

going to be a cat at first but there I

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.020 
going to be a cat at first but there I
found<00:02:49.049> a<00:02:49.230> dog<00:02:49.470> easier<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.099> make<00:02:50.310> heard<00:02:50.910> of

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030

that<00:03:33.269> day<00:03:33.510> though<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.440> don't<00:03:34.739> need<00:03:34.950> this<00:03:35.160> so

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
that day though I don't need this so

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.240 
that day though I don't need this so
Gromit<00:03:36.180> was<00:03:36.329> born<00:03:36.630> in<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:36.959> moment<00:03:37.250> and

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
Gromit was born in that moment and

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.809 
Gromit was born in that moment and
that's<00:03:38.340> why<00:03:38.519> I<00:03:38.549> think<00:03:38.819> he<00:03:39.380> he<00:03:40.380> came<00:03:40.680> from<00:03:41.340> clay

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
that's why I think he he came from clay

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.849 
that's why I think he he came from clay
really<00:03:42.359> from<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.810> use<00:03:42.989> of<00:03:43.200> clay<00:03:43.410> that's<00:03:43.650> why<00:03:43.829> I

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
really from the use of clay that's why I

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.909 
really from the use of clay that's why I
find<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.250> medium<00:03:44.700> very<00:03:45.299> important<00:03:45.900> that<00:03:46.620> I

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
find the medium very important that I

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.280 
find the medium very important that I
think<00:03:46.980> that<00:03:47.400> wouldn't<00:03:47.849> have<00:03:47.970> happened<00:03:48.120> if<00:03:48.630> I

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
think that wouldn't have happened if I

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.380 
think that wouldn't have happened if I
was<00:03:49.440> using<00:03:49.650> another<00:03:50.099> technique

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.890 

oh<00:03:55.240> gosh

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900
