00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 but then still believes in the victorious 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.410
 then you can risk more points 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 can also be the half time speech 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.820
 still comes once a can sit on 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.620
 say okay now remains in my opinion 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.000
 the winner is definitely and on 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.980
 the white one is stronger again or 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.180
 you row back so you can do it 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:25.080
 stop at the end so not where it was 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:26.599
 but something very interesting okay then 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.519
 is just about the assistant 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.890
 an exciting topic because you always 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.320
 again so area ever forget the 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.320
 In parallel please aim I will not 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.570
 if it's just what we reach 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.710
 performed 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.710
 when I'm fit you really play 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:55.260
 Badly it's out there saving ours 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:03.090
 scouting though it is actually improving 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:06.299
 Alright I just interrupted 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.369
 it's about a tiresome topic in 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.470
 Playing form of manager is always has 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.180
 man if you like the move 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.590
 you just want to finish one 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.479
 I have a bad feeling about everything 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.799
 thought 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.950
 and there are two things we do now 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.570
 have come up with this year 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.750
 that is guaranteed that you really 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.729
 thought of everything the first is that 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.650
 short-term that means you can here 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.329
 see below now there is one 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.250
 quickstart bar sometimes has it all 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.159
 as their names but if the 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.780
 quickstart bar and what to do 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.210
 is here you have all the menu items 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.009
 they are important to you 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.530
 within a normal move in the 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.479
 principle executes listed 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.240
 and there are different things about it 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.799
 that's the first time I'm up 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.619
 the calendar now kicker and the 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.030
 point then there is a hook that 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.280
 means finished 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.960
 so in the end you have everything ideally 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.159
 what is it ? 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.140
 and there are a few 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.420
 obstacles, for example, here 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.220
 is so red things accordingly 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.500
 for example, with a one in it 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.300
 that simply means that is with this 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.959
 menÃ¼punkt specifically still a problem 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.739
 gives that you have to solve before 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.630
 that may be that for example 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.769
 Sponsors offer gives that one still 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.090
 did not care or that the 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.470
 exhibition is not complete or that 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.000
 you have not edited all mails yet 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.700
 something in that direction and then 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.140
 which has red completed as everything 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.150
 you have down there in principle only 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.170
 green hook and can continue 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.390
 The whole thing is really total 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.799
 then there is a free sound 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.230
 you can just enter the menu items 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.160
 which one would like to have then 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.420
 So I have the second one 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.489
 Team not so interested 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.319
 usually knows about it or 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:49.060
 then the point disappears everything 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.709
 What is important to me is me in the 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.950
 pull the bar and pay 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.959
 then red is actually an important one 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.610
 green problem is still changing 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.130
 okay the so nothing further is okay 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.780
 and if I were the orange stop 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.400
 I'll dedicate myself to it sooner or later 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.959
 I just move it I can do all 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.160
 grab items under it and then have 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.989
 I really guaranteed each one yet 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.720
 once on salary not more 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.340
 Survey card but then the man 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.930
 then at least there is fast 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.970
 so to speak, it's faster than through 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.989
 menu usually but there are still 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.370
 a second point of one 's life 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.620
 as well as they should know 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.640
 assistants, the one that is out 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.739
 point out if you want something totally 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.900
 Forget about it, you think so 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.340
 I do everything first but then 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.260
 one realizes one may any 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.060
 program part is not for example 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.670
 not so interested in the stadium now 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.750
 expansion or at the club grounds and then 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.100
 you will be on it sometime now 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.139
 pointed out that you just nothing 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.970
 makes and is politely asked again 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:44.550
 Whether you like the wizard 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.970
 in addition it seems okay that's it 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.099
 cool 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.420
 Let's go the next questions here 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.410
 usually come to the players still one 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.900
 a little bit further, I think 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.060
 times to texts murder match 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.640
 there are some questions to what arrived 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.940
 in text mode new zb what has happened 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:05.060
 changed and also where one short one yes 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:07.319
 question, there are new texts in text mode 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.920
 and you can continue playing now 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.560
 commands 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.209
 that means you can do more 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.630
 still interact in text mode before 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.519
 all there were big without pants 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.440
 of course, in the forum poll what to wish 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.600
 our players are in text mode ours 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.460
 do and the most important topic whatever 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.290
 came again was the area 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.540
 decisions so that you really 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.530
 can actively intervene in the game 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.600
 and yes any situation 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.550
 becomes where somehow fox as a trainer 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.820
 then decide right or wrong 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.220
 can and we thought we build there like that 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.729
 much as possible and in particular 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.229
 also playing situations so completely 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.490
 crucial or the classic 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.110
 situation is a short for example 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.800
 conclusion comes somehow a further ball 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.539
 Forward 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.250
 you can already see the defender 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.880
 now in a duel against the 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.919
 striker 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:01.620
 and he always has the chance to go now 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:04.320
 I'm safe and lazy on number 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.000
 For example, he definitely 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.130
 so that he can not incur a gate take 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.860
 possibly the place reference in purchase 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.120
 or I say okay then you go one 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.700
 report by fininvest duell 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.050
 loses and risks the whole and that 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.640
 are just decision where you just 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.140
 so to speak, one can and then will 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.250
 it behaves accordingly but then 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.460
 you really have the choice 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.840
 between the place reference and the 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.270
 risk that it stops in the end 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.810
 Book loss returns or that two points 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.850
 are gone or somehow retires 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.850
 exactly the same is true in particular 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:38.460
 area when you strengthen the player 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.980
 can set against each other , for example 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.750
 one has an open situation that of the 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:46.350
 outsiders on the side where you yourself 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:49.170
 then gets the ball and you can 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.820
 stop saying pass or over 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.300
 play inside or do something 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.920
 other 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.060
 and then you have to know then whether 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.160
 the corresponding dribbling and 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.580
 then the player's speed values 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.140
 in comparison to the opponent then 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.520
 are higher and that if you have a chance 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.440
 then has to win this duel too 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.090
 if you know and then 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.760
 really in with his team 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.560
 know then you have as appealing 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.120
 benefits so there are a total of 20 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.580
 various such decisions 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.830
 situation with a lot of variety 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.120
 we still have interactivity for that 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.890
 further increased by the 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.530
 can indicate penalty shootout 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.530
 how strong the shot should be 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.530
 perhaps
