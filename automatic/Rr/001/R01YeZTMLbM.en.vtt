00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:13.080
 finished pencil writing sheets of paper 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.650
 I finished the column we all throw out 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.839
 this 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.160
 but you could save yourself from 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.529
 gas dependence 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.630
 already from the name it is clear that the fuel 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.730
 briquettes or euro wood is actually 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.990
 what you can heat the house or 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.359
 cook food in nature 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.320
 their length of only 100 millimeters the leg 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.539
 not more abruptly 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.250
 coal while doing briquettes almost 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.079
 garbage thrown out of furniture 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.180
 caps of industrial sawdust children 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.440
 the wood pores of the nutshell and even 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.930
 sunflower seeds 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.690
 they are considered environmentally friendly 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.160
 why remember it all starts with 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.840
 moment of sorting garbage here we have 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.090
 there are metal structures 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.680
 plastic boxes have any 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.850
 cardboard boxes are from the same dough 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.149
 wood trash itself is interesting what 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.420
 I managed to find guys 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.420
 sushi sticks 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.710
 and one day such a small factory 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.600
 recycle up to 20 tons of garbage after 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.360
 how all the garbage will sort out all 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.590
 waste wood 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.350
 plunge year into this bucket and 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.860
 send tree abundant car 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.860
 let's watch 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.160
 grinding toothy grinder also with 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.480
 using a magnet selects all 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.150
 metal objects 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.250
 whether it's nails or something else but all 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.670
 wood pulp transmits Moscow 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.390
 after the right car arbors fall 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.880
 here and you can learn 1 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.880
 one of a kind woody shower 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.850
 as 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.340
 well and further along the line all the chips fall 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.080
 directly to press mother nature 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.979
 it took millions of years to 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.960
 create no here is coal and this apparatus by 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.460
 children temperature in seconds 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.979
 convert wood waste 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.990
 Here are such alternative sources of heat 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.330
 then sawdust cut pack and 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.910
 transports but how does sawdust hold 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.009
 together there is not one hot air about 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.050
 this is exactly the secret technology at 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.910
 compression is not used the glue 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.080
 resin 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.790
 binding element is lignin 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.070
 which is contained in plant cells 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.830
 therefore, only that gets on the conveyor 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.690
 what does this substance contain 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.270
 but the farthest in this issue 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.030
 Germany, she even produces briquettes from 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.470
 Christmas trees thus eliminating 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.980
 the problem of landfills after 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.110
 christmas 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.300
 heating braces of a private house 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.640
 OK, but I found a man who 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.410
 manages to heat the whole with sawdust 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.209
 enterprise today 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.180
 using waste briquette we completely 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.320
 refused to use gas 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.269
 predominantly colossal it and 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.950
 understandable businessman told me 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.489
 that going to sawdust he spends on 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.930
 heating is exactly five times less 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.590
 what are the guys here she is energetic 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.660
 independence 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.120
 here is such an ordinary wood chip which 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.470
 served on auger can heat whole 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.390
 plant and everything comes automatically 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.280
 don't need to get anything with your hands 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.570
 the car itself understands when needed 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.570
 add firewood 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.030
 never mind going to the country to fry 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.800
 kebabs and drown sunbathed house or from 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.080
 whole factories modern technology 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.390
 they allow you to make yourself loved 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.390
 pleasant warmth and save mother nature
