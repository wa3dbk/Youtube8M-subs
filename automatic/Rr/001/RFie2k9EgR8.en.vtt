 this is a turn towards its inner realism 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.730
 politicians but he noted that with the current 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.459
 government personnel decide 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.230
 assigned tasks impossible need and 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.060

 financial and economic policy 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.860
 social pronounced but for this you need 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.120
 completely different cabinet 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.120

 the Russian economy must break out 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.650
 traps zero growth rates and over 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.780
 three to four years increase the share of Russia in 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.160

 today's speech president 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.370
 paid special attention to the state 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.200
 education and medicine mentioning that 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.470
 just care about the younger generation 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.000
 will provide Russia with a decent future as in 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.889
 really live those from whom 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.680

 United Russia in the bath lane 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:44.190
 keep watch the teacher and the doctor young 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.230
 Mother Phirousse and Daria left 7 to 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.150
 defend their right to housing because 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.400
 negligence officials women can not 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.620
 get a set of documents us 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.079
 I repeatedly invite letters like 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.959

 housing we can not move in because 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.459
 that we do not give documents for this housing 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.530
 the fact that people are not in a hurry to move in without 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.239
 well-formed documents gives the right 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.160
 officials to deprive them of housing therefore 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.229
