 we had ended up not seeing each year for ten years it was said 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.920
 leaving but this time it's been there for three months in August 

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:15.669
 he trains himself gets ready rises 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:18.669
 every morning proforma only one thing 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.769
 more than I'm a kid% and it's a test that is important to me it's a 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.749
 destined to deposit the world 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:28.139
 year of the bike we take the speed to do it at least three times because 

00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:31.649
 that France paid with her life for the first time and then after I know 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.680
 not if their treatment 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.450
 mickaël pichon whole brian passed on the edge of motocross pitches 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.500
 the little family slung the charts a little thicker each 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.080
 year 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.040
 a first bike to 5 years for a first title of champion of France to 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.200
 18 but what query fission the rocket a nickname that says a lot but 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.390
 who does not say everything 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.840
 the manceau is not only an ultra talented driver it's also 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.730
 a champions mental one of our all emotions are in four years 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.680
 for a lot of sport so from my fight it may be this state 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.540
 spirit 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.540
 we will overcome the competitive world in the soul 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.880
 the high point of his career 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.570
 the seasons 2 and a half billion 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.720
 crowned by two world champion titles he was then the pilot 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.550
 french most famous 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.240
 but repeated injuries will slow his ascent and when he 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.650
 returns to the race three years ago in pursuit of his past successes 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.840
 passion 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.360
 is no longer the same 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.920
 it's true that the constraints of departure choice of the world are are too much 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.630
 heavy 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.890
 the power now because that's physically and mentally 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.940
 the ball in the middle 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.050
 exit the world championship fim grand prix 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.830
 to travel across europe 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.980
 from March to September 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.950
 mickaël pichon free of this asset 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.680
 these one-day races 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.670
 three hours 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.720
 nothing to do with those he has known for fifteen years it really changes the 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.060
 motocross starting three weeks of campaign 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.340
 at the haye serbia in three hours at the pump 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.310
 we did not necessarily know a little bit faster it's a little bit 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.960
 has been going on for a few years since 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.360
 timotei potisek is certainly the fastest of all pilots each year 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.569
 but hey, he's made some minor mistakes 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.989
 the coach arnaud demeester artists who win what is the last mission 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.319
 I think we are here and elsewhere I was convinced that I was a little 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.190
 little ones and put them aside because that's what was preparing his 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:21.959
 ranking 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.549
 but I think that two-wheeled pilots have sinned by his grace to 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.729
 everyone in the long run we will talk 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:32.339
 and for those who still doubt his ability to win on the sand 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:34.349
 here is a first answer 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.859
 it was January 18 last also wore in a race comparable to 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:38.489
 their office 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.879
 applied for six years to prevail before Arnaud Finistere 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.109
 The message is clear 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:44.459
 it will not come only click and
