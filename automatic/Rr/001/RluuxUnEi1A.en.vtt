different shaped glitters I think it's

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.509 
different shaped glitters I think it's
called<00:00:09.780> Orly<00:00:10.080> FX<00:00:10.559> but<00:00:10.860> this<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.309> one<00:00:11.490> I

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
called Orly FX but this is the one I

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.839 
called Orly FX but this is the one I
chose<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.540> it<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.349> called<00:00:13.650> be<00:00:13.980> brave<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.370> it's

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
chose and it is called be brave and it's

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.540 
chose and it is called be brave and it's
a<00:00:14.940> bunch<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.330> hot<00:00:15.630> pink<00:00:16.080> sparkly<00:00:16.710> bar<00:00:17.100> glitters

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
a bunch of hot pink sparkly bar glitters

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.029 
a bunch of hot pink sparkly bar glitters
so<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.150> actually<00:00:18.600> don't<00:00:18.869> have<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.230> single<00:00:19.560> polish

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
so I actually don't have a single polish

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.590 
so I actually don't have a single polish
in<00:00:20.160> my<00:00:20.279> collection<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.910> bar<00:00:21.119> glitter<00:00:21.449> so

in my collection that is bar glitter so

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.910 
in my collection that is bar glitter so
this<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.050> definitely<00:00:22.260> something<00:00:22.650> different

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
this is definitely something different

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.189
