00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
it seemed very very expensive and while

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.770 
it seemed very very expensive and while
all<00:03:58.769> of<00:03:58.950> that<00:03:58.980> is<00:03:59.280> still<00:03:59.579> very<00:03:59.609> much<00:04:00.090> true<00:04:00.599> I

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
all of that is still very much true I

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.470
