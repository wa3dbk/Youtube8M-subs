drying<00:03:33.380> with<00:03:34.070> the<00:03:34.430> Moroccan<00:03:34.970> oil<00:03:35.239> oil

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
drying with the Moroccan oil oil

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.990 
drying with the Moroccan oil oil
treatment<00:03:36.380> so<00:03:37.100> this<00:03:37.400> is<00:03:37.549> a<00:03:37.579> creamy

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
treatment so this is a creamy

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.490 
treatment so this is a creamy
consistency<00:03:38.709> let<00:03:39.709> me<00:03:39.799> open<00:03:39.950> it<00:03:40.190> up<00:03:40.310> for<00:03:40.549> you

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.090 

I'm<00:03:46.190> not<00:03:46.310> sure<00:03:46.550> if<00:03:46.670> you<00:03:46.760> can<00:03:46.910> see<00:03:47.800> but<00:03:48.800> it<00:03:49.070> is

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
I'm not sure if you can see but it is

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.220 
I'm not sure if you can see but it is
quite<00:03:49.490> creamy<00:03:49.880> it's<00:03:50.300> actually<00:03:50.690> very<00:03:50.870> similar

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
quite creamy it's actually very similar

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.680 
quite creamy it's actually very similar
to<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.530> conditioner<00:03:52.250> this<00:03:53.060> is<00:03:53.270> obviously

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
to the conditioner this is obviously

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:02.040 
to the conditioner this is obviously
oily<00:03:54.320> and<00:03:54.550> thick<00:03:58.570> it's<00:03:59.570> very<00:04:00.050> syrupy<00:04:00.640> and

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
oily and thick it's very syrupy and

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.360 
oily and thick it's very syrupy and
again<00:04:03.050> this<00:04:03.260> will<00:04:03.410> last<00:04:03.530> you<00:04:03.800> a<00:04:03.890> lifetime

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
again this will last you a lifetime

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.690 
again this will last you a lifetime
I<00:04:04.580> think<00:04:05.030> this<00:04:05.120> is<00:04:05.240> my<00:04:05.420> second<00:04:05.810> bottle<00:04:06.140> in

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
I think this is my second bottle in

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:13.210 
I think this is my second bottle in

year<00:06:58.699> was<00:06:58.849> getting<00:06:59.089> really<00:06:59.330> really<00:06:59.629> dry<00:06:59.839> so

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:00.680 
year was getting really really dry so

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.369 
year was getting really really dry so
I'm<00:07:01.159> doing<00:07:01.369> a<00:07:01.519> wintertime<00:07:01.789> and<00:07:02.240> she<00:07:03.110> told<00:07:03.289> me

00:07:06.609 --> 00:07:06.619 
to use almond oil again this is the

00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:08.350 
to use almond oil again this is the
Vichy<00:07:07.129> instead<00:07:07.430> of<00:07:07.519> Vichy<00:07:07.849> ball<00:07:08.029> but<00:07:08.329> I
