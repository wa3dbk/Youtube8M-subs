let me know what you'd want me to play
but<00:01:07.260> I'm<00:01:07.350> pretty<00:01:07.530> sure<00:01:07.650> those<00:01:07.950> are<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.189> main

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
but I'm pretty sure those are the main

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.330 
but I'm pretty sure those are the main
games<00:01:08.909> up<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.510> docket<00:01:09.780> for<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:11.159> live

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
games up on the docket for the live

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.980 
games up on the docket for the live
stream<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.330> think<00:01:12.540> there'll<00:01:12.689> be<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.810> lot<00:01:12.930> of

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
stream and I think there'll be a lot of

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.410 
stream and I think there'll be a lot of
fun<00:01:13.229> now<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.860> won't<00:01:14.040> necessarily<00:01:14.159> be<00:01:14.700> 12<00:01:15.119> hours

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
fun now it won't necessarily be 12 hours

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.760 
fun now it won't necessarily be 12 hours
straight<00:01:15.630> through<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.259> will<00:01:16.439> be<00:01:16.560> here<00:01:16.710> on

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
straight through it will be here on

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.770 
straight through it will be here on
YouTube<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.880> think<00:01:18.119> what<00:01:18.240> I'm<00:01:18.330> gonna<00:01:18.420> do<00:01:18.750> is

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
YouTube and I think what I'm gonna do is

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.350 
YouTube and I think what I'm gonna do is
probably<00:01:19.500> stream<00:01:19.920> for<00:01:20.130> four<00:01:20.310> hours<00:01:20.340> stop<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
probably stream for four hours stop the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.179 
probably stream for four hours stop the
stream<00:01:21.570> take<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> break<00:01:22.140> for<00:01:22.380> 15<00:01:22.500> minutes<00:01:22.920> and

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
stream take a break for 15 minutes and

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.760 
stream take a break for 15 minutes and
start<00:01:23.610> up<00:01:23.790> again<00:01:23.880> for<00:01:24.150> another<00:01:24.299> four<00:01:24.600> hours

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
start up again for another four hours

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.960 
start up again for another four hours
stop<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.040> then<00:01:26.130> do<00:01:26.250> another<00:01:26.340> four<00:01:26.670> hours<00:01:26.850> and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
stop and then do another four hours and

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.880 
stop and then do another four hours and
that<00:01:27.060> should<00:01:27.240> be<00:01:27.299> 12<00:01:27.509> hours<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.439> we'll<00:01:28.680> see<00:01:28.860> how

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
that should be 12 hours so we'll see how

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.260 
that should be 12 hours so we'll see how
it<00:01:29.040> goes<00:01:29.159> but<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.579> think<00:01:29.790> that's<00:01:29.970> how<00:01:30.119> it's

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
it goes but I think that's how it's

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.700 
it goes but I think that's how it's
going<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.420> work<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:31.110> at<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> end<00:01:31.380> you'll

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
going to work so at the end you'll

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.249 
going to work so at the end you'll
probably<00:01:31.920> see<00:01:32.369> three<00:01:33.000> separate<00:01:33.780> live<00:01:33.960> stream

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
probably see three separate live stream

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.410 
probably see three separate live stream

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
pretty overdue for an extended

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.470 
pretty overdue for an extended
livestream<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.820> longest<00:02:23.090> light<00:02:23.209> room<00:02:23.420> I've

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
livestream the longest light room I've

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.270 
livestream the longest light room I've
ever<00:02:23.600> did<00:02:23.870> was<00:02:24.050> that<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:24.350> tower<00:02:24.680> stream<00:02:24.980> on<00:02:25.100> call

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
ever did was that a tower stream on call

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.970 
ever did was that a tower stream on call
of<00:02:25.310> duty<00:02:25.550> ghosts<00:02:26.030> but<00:02:26.540> I<00:02:26.570> think<00:02:26.959> 12<00:02:27.320> hours<00:02:27.709> is<00:02:27.950> a

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
of duty ghosts but I think 12 hours is a

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.370 
of duty ghosts but I think 12 hours is a
pretty<00:02:28.310> good<00:02:28.580> length<00:02:28.970> to<00:02:29.510> warm<00:02:29.780> me<00:02:29.990> up<00:02:30.020> for

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
pretty good length to warm me up for

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.020 
pretty good length to warm me up for
something<00:02:30.560> like<00:02:30.770> a<00:02:30.830> 24<00:02:31.459> hour<00:02:31.640> livestream

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
something like a 24 hour livestream

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.550 
something like a 24 hour livestream
which<00:02:32.330> I've<00:02:32.450> always<00:02:32.600> wanted<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:33.170> do<00:02:33.320> and<00:02:33.530> I

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
which I've always wanted to do and I

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.740 
which I've always wanted to do and I
haven't<00:02:33.800> done<00:02:33.950> that<00:02:33.980> yet<00:02:34.130> so<00:02:34.580> I<00:02:34.940> will<00:02:35.450> see<00:02:35.630> how

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
haven't done that yet so I will see how

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.870 
haven't done that yet so I will see how
this<00:02:35.900> 12<00:02:36.170> hour<00:02:36.290> stream<00:02:36.620> goes<00:02:36.920> internet

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
this 12 hour stream goes internet

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.630 
this 12 hour stream goes internet

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900
