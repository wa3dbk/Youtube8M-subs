00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
would be easy and fairly cost effective

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.170 
would be easy and fairly cost effective
to<00:01:53.240> keep<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.570> truck<00:01:53.810> drivers<00:01:54.320> safe<00:01:54.670> but<00:01:55.670> it's

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
it's just not on their radar but it's on

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.630 
it's just not on their radar but it's on
our<00:01:58.340> radar<00:01:58.550> and<00:01:59.119> so<00:01:59.270> it<00:01:59.390> should<00:01:59.630> be<00:02:00.400> now<00:02:01.400> all

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
a gun but one thing is certain the guys

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.780 
a gun but one thing is certain the guys
that<00:02:20.300> killed<00:02:20.570> him<00:02:20.980> got<00:02:21.980> their<00:02:22.250> guns<00:02:22.489> from

that killed him got their guns from

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.729 
that killed him got their guns from
somewhere<00:02:23.239> and<00:02:23.420> probably<00:02:23.959> not<00:02:24.140> a<00:02:24.200> retail

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
somewhere and probably not a retail

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.670 
somewhere and probably not a retail
store<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:27.190> arming<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.310> truck<00:02:28.550> drivers<00:02:29.000> I

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
store so arming the truck drivers I

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.710 
store so arming the truck drivers I
don't<00:02:30.680> know<00:02:30.769> if<00:02:30.890> that's<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.459> answer<00:02:31.760> or<00:02:32.180> not

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
don't know if that's the answer or not

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.160 
don't know if that's the answer or not
but<00:02:33.290> one<00:02:33.440> thing<00:02:33.940> certainly<00:02:34.940> jumps<00:02:35.390> out<00:02:35.570> in

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
but one thing certainly jumps out in

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.970 
but one thing certainly jumps out in

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
needed the money he was fairly new there

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.420

the pole I guess and that's why he took
