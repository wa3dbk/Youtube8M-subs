decisions<00:01:01.539> I<00:01:02.100> think<00:01:03.100> that<00:01:03.160> folks<00:01:03.730> who

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
decisions I think that folks who

practice in small groups and

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.620 
practice in small groups and
we'll<00:01:07.750> find<00:01:08.050> that<00:01:08.260> once<00:01:08.500> they<00:01:08.770> get

right<00:01:35.980> so<00:01:36.790> until<00:01:37.120> the<00:01:37.210> sight<00:01:37.450> of<00:01:37.480> that<00:01:37.600> as<00:01:37.960> well

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
right so until the sight of that as well

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.590 
right so until the sight of that as well
so<00:01:38.530> you<00:01:38.920> know<00:01:39.040> it's<00:01:39.220> really<00:01:39.340> hard<00:01:39.490> to<00:01:39.820> move

what the documentation
all<00:02:30.129> those

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
all those

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.880 
all those
we<00:02:32.800> think<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.190> attestation<00:02:33.610> is

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
we think the attestation is

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.840 
we think the attestation is
fairly<00:02:35.430> straightforward

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
fairly straightforward

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.880 
fairly straightforward
a<00:02:37.000> lot<00:02:37.450> of<00:02:37.480> people<00:02:37.590> worry<00:02:38.590> about<00:02:38.710> some<00:02:39.670> hokey

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
a lot of people worry about some hokey

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.240 
a lot of people worry about some hokey
the<00:02:41.100> experience<00:02:41.760> this

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.430 

based<00:02:45.850> on<00:02:46.090> what

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
based on what

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.380 
based on what
which<00:02:47.770> doctors<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:48.520> nurses<00:02:48.700> enter

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
which doctors and nurses enter

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.789 
which doctors and nurses enter
themselves

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.470 

later

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
later

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.700 
later
so

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
so

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:05.200 
so
very<00:02:59.370> rapid<00:02:59.730> feedback

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.910 

now<00:03:52.629> they<00:03:53.019> all<00:03:53.230> can<00:03:53.439> think<00:03:53.650> of<00:03:53.769> ways<00:03:53.890> to

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920

we<00:03:59.280> expect<00:03:59.610> with<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.880> right

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.059 

they're<00:04:04.310> sorta

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
they're sorta

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.950 
they're sorta
and<00:04:06.430> also<00:04:06.700> now<00:04:07.030> there<00:04:07.719> are<00:04:07.840> goals

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
and also now there are goals

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.250 
and also now there are goals
basically<00:04:10.680> performance

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
basically performance

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.789

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
and so those that have been through it

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.430 
and so those that have been through it
are<00:04:28.530> seeing<00:04:28.860> that<00:04:29.100> value

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440
