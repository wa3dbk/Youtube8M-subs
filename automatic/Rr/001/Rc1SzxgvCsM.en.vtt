00:00:01.729 --> 00:00:04.440
 nonetheless these are friends of the building who 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.870
 today we talk 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.150
 correspondent 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.099
 I will tell all of them as a rule eliminate 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.599
 before ii tell what 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.549
 forecast of proteases of the tender countries 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:15.980
 same problem 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.199
 laid the beginning of the second revision 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.500
 attention to run it 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.910
 they probably don't start up like a problem 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.810
 happens 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.460
 This is due to the fact that he did not even 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.099
 I know what this is about as long as 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.130
 provided quite simply 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.050
 this will not show her say 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.410
 right now 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.740
 so we continue 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.520
 First you need to find a partner 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.010
 parrot could 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.469
 while on the wall 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:42.450
 abs system 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.320
 with smarts 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.170
 proper 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.410
 and then this file is the import volume 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.410
 and this value is my wife 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.470
 save 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.900
 us properties 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.600
 choosing security 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.770
 to change 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.560
 and select users 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.620
 Well, I do not know, but in principle it is possible and 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.690
 administrators basically and the market 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.700
 I don't see much difference 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.440
 but let's leave our ministry 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.410
 the minister 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.940
 the game will play 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.120
 for myself the same 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.140
 so after that goes just Berezovsky steam 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.560
 so that the OSCE probably did not come all 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.100
 by the way n when you start and sting east would 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.680
 have changed 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.300
 file he can dive a little 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.570
 but can run into heels 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.760
 sets a new house 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.180
 so let's see 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.890
 so after all already 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.290
 this 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.980
 start button does not prepare for shooting 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.920
 country 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.370
 rbk turner smog 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.030
 we see that the aggregates and the violin works 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.770
 often show a little 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.219
 their actions to wretchedness convinced 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.030
 what 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.260
 the way that provided 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.710
 but quite good 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.590
 so here after installing the revision 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.979
 can bounce you off automatically 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.069
 in the message n type need to install half 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.099
 pipe babaev 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.619
 and without match 

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:18.359
 also 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:22.049
 besides strike source after those parameters 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.729
 whom have changed there 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:27.229
 every time 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:29.329
 if need be we will have a good one 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:30.109
 the harvest 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:32.939
 download from 4 reports Rosstat 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.170
 however in the government are compressed 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:39.169
 deadlines 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.319
 Of course I must assume to decorate 3 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:49.829
 all the same 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.239
 in his work 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.079
 the climate of course is always an agenda this when 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.019
 first minutes of the game 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.019
 of course I saw 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:15.499
 am, in principle, the law of conversation continued and 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:16.809
 two times users here 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:19.239
 importantly did not ask pyrotechnics 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.010
 because with such users 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.790
 Internet director says 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.219
 cinematography who will be shown 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:28.819
 yes the same removal of funds there 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.899
 the numbers are generally unclear who is 

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:34.269
 someone who decided to settle down 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.269
 generally 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.989
 nearly 

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:46.399
 I play without a goal 

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:49.399
 I made increased install 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:54.389
 and by the way two notes I have to undress also 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:55.989
 Igor from water 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.959
 tenth and generally all arrested for this 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.539
 write me later 

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:03.709
 in particular, because now 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:04.979
 Now 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:07.989
 now that according to 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.189
 article 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:11.680
 and it is necessary to run apologies so much 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.680
 much money 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.959
 It was 

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:23.289
 imagine something 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.740
 leave life news 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.740
 in black 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.099
 if to speak 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:32.019
 according to all rights protection
