00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
them on monsters so I guess this is the

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.959 
them on monsters so I guess this is the
on<00:06:04.090> switch<00:06:04.360> and<00:06:06.000> let's<00:06:07.000> check<00:06:07.270> this<00:06:07.449> out

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:08.969 
on switch and let's check this out

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:17.249 
on switch and let's check this out
nothing<00:06:11.729> nothing<00:06:13.440> yeah<00:06:15.569> it<00:06:16.569> probably<00:06:17.050> was

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:17.259

used<00:06:17.590> oh<00:06:18.539> there<00:06:19.539> we<00:06:19.659> go<00:06:20.009> don't<00:06:21.009> know<00:06:21.250> what<00:06:21.430> I

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
used oh there we go don't know what I

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:29.159

monster
yeah<00:06:31.940> so<00:06:32.180> apparently<00:06:32.450> shaking<00:06:33.200> is<00:06:33.500> not<00:06:33.620> enough

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
yeah so apparently shaking is not enough

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.330
