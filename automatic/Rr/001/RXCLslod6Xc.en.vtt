00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
as a modem now to actually get the

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.410 
as a modem now to actually get the
device<00:03:11.010> talking<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.849> each<00:03:11.940> other<00:03:12.090> what<00:03:12.329> we

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
device talking to each other what we

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.240 
device talking to each other what we
gonna<00:03:12.569> have<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:12.720> do<00:03:12.840> is<00:03:12.959> create<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.319> network<00:03:13.980> of

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
gonna have to do is create a network of

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.879 
gonna have to do is create a network of
connection<00:03:15.079> so<00:03:16.079> what<00:03:16.230> we'll<00:03:16.349> do<00:03:16.500> would<00:03:16.709> just
