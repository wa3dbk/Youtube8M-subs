00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:10.889 
to be honest you I'm not really sure

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:12.610 
to be honest you I'm not really sure
what<00:05:11.340> the<00:05:11.460> difference<00:05:11.550> is<00:05:11.849> between<00:05:11.910> the<00:05:12.300> two

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
what the difference is between the two

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.379 
what the difference is between the two
because<00:05:13.620> you<00:05:14.190> know<00:05:14.460> you<00:05:14.520> go<00:05:14.729> into<00:05:14.910> one<00:05:15.180> place

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
because you know you go into one place

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.689 
because you know you go into one place
and<00:05:15.720> it<00:05:15.900> has<00:05:16.139> the<00:05:16.410> same<00:05:16.590> sorting<00:05:17.130> of<00:05:17.250> one

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
and it has the same sorting of one

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.450 
and it has the same sorting of one
versus<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.090> other<00:05:18.830> but<00:05:19.830> they<00:05:19.979> see<00:05:20.340> the

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
versus the other but they see the

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.770 
versus the other but they see the
content<00:05:20.789> here<00:05:20.910> is<00:05:20.940> a<00:05:21.000> little<00:05:21.180> bit<00:05:21.389> different

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
content here is a little bit different

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.100

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
and there's not as many selections I

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.510 
and there's not as many selections I
usually<00:05:25.110> to<00:05:25.560> be<00:05:25.650> honest<00:05:25.919> I<00:05:26.009> usually<00:05:26.490> just

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
usually to be honest I usually just

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.839 
usually to be honest I usually just
choose<00:05:26.910> the<00:05:27.090> new<00:05:27.210> menu<00:05:27.680> and<00:05:28.680> I<00:05:29.190> usually<00:05:29.669> stand
