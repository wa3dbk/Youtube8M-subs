00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.690
 we very often 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.820
 and in the past, I think they have sinned 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.810
 almost all of the emergency school 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.619
 we single out such a driver as a woman 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.360
 woman driving girl driving and 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.470
 are trying 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:33.200
 in every possible way dissociate itself from 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.090
 road situations in which participated 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.210
 girls we are trying in every way to show 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.410
 that girl she's here somehow differently 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.180
 refers to the car to her need 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.270
 completely different approach during 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.990
 studying driving and so 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.920
 further I am a supporter 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:53.920
 the idea that all the same today is not 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:59.200
 drivers need to be divided into men and women 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:01.540
 and some special techniques for 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.930
 teaching women in person at my school 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.650
 Missing explain why here is very 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.140
 it is important to understand the degree of perception 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.180
 women and men in the learning process 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.490
 after which the line itself 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.120
 behaviors that women choose on 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.130
 road so here during the process 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.830
 learning is usually efficiency 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.040
 occupying women she oddly enough 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.950
 higher in most cases why because 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.960
 that a woman comes to class in order 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.990
 so in most cases again for 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.190
 order to gain knowledge and carefully 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.970
 listening instructor 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:43.300
 not trying to argue with him not trying 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.280
 show that she already knows hers 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.330
 on this account has an opinion and this 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.770
 her opinion is quite correct 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.830
 confirmed and practice and so on 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.009
 so she absorbs more knowledge 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.220
 another question is a little harder for her later 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:04.380
 put this knowledge into practice here 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:07.810
 probably it is about how much 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.830
 physiological we are different men and 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:15.130
 women that is a man he got behind the wheel he 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.140
 he drives the car more 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.800
 aware that the car 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.470
 he is iron he is a vehicle and 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.080
 as if such a man when performed 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.330
 when performing serious duties 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.540
 a woman sometimes just learned 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.910
 knows everything knows everything but more 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.890
 calmly more loyal to 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.530
 car control itself 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.560
 but we are now talking very general 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.380
 phrases in very general terms because 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:50.060
 that among women there are also 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.860
 how do we call a woman in pants or how 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.890
 it's like it is right to say that is 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.870
 absolutely adequate girls 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.740
 which the so-called male approach to 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.350
 driving is what we 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.330
 call don't want to offend anyone 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.700
 blonde driving but blonde driving 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.650
 this is probably not the problem of this blonde 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.180
 This is primarily the problem of absence 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.530
 culture road 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.210
 driving culture and second place it 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.210
 widespread practice to get right 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.730
 buy a car and then forget 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.170
 go and work out properly 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.500
 driving school to school 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.460
 increase driving skills 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.380
 emotionally controlled woman 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.110
 car that is more emotionally 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.450
 yes it is possible but again I repeat it is not 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.050
 requires some methodological delights 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:42.740
 in order to convey to her knowledge 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.660
 so my approach is he general approach is there 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.440
 features there are categories 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:51.670
 but these categories are not m and w and it is much 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.670
 more categories and 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.550
 the cadet should already be his instructor 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.770
 which the 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.320
 kind of a good instructor should be 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.380
 psychologist, he should in the first 10-15 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.200
 minutes of the first class to realize how 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.660
 type of psychological type in this 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.370
 case he has a case and find the key 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.470
 find an approach to this person in order 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.950
 to transfer the maximum amount 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.200
 knowledge and consolidate them into practice on 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.830
 practical driving lessons 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.830
 the car
