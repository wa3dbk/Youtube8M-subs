of these SR performance lowering springs

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.230 
of these SR performance lowering springs
on<00:01:04.170> our<00:01:04.379> GT<00:01:04.799> which<00:01:05.280> lowered<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.790> about<00:01:06.000> an<00:01:06.119> inch

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
on our GT which lowered it about an inch

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.690 
on our GT which lowered it about an inch
and<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> half<00:01:06.540> or<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.080> on<00:01:07.200> all<00:01:07.350> four<00:01:07.560> corners<00:01:07.920> now

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
and a half or so on all four corners now

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.010 
and a half or so on all four corners now
that<00:01:08.850> lower<00:01:09.030> center<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.390> gravity<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.869> going<00:01:09.960> to

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
that lower center of gravity is going to

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.050 
that lower center of gravity is going to
do<00:01:10.140> two<00:01:10.380> things<00:01:10.409> for<00:01:10.950> us<00:01:11.010> first<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.970> most

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
do two things for us first and most

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.429 
do two things for us first and most
importantly<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:12.900> going<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.110> greatly

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
importantly it's going to greatly

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.710 
importantly it's going to greatly
improve<00:01:13.650> our<00:01:14.040> handling<00:01:14.549> but<00:01:15.150> another<00:01:15.479> nice

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
improve our handling but another nice

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.749 
improve our handling but another nice
thing<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.200> also<00:01:16.530> improved<00:01:16.979> our<00:01:17.130> appearance<00:01:17.610> as

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
thing it also improved our appearance as

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.300 
thing it also improved our appearance as
well<00:01:17.970> by<00:01:18.420> getting<00:01:18.479> rid<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.140> 4x4<00:01:19.830> status

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
well by getting rid of that 4x4 status

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.510 
well by getting rid of that 4x4 status
in<00:01:20.490> eliminating<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.420> ugly<00:01:21.750> wheel<00:01:21.960> gap<00:01:22.520> last

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
in eliminating that ugly wheel gap last

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.340 
in eliminating that ugly wheel gap last
but<00:01:23.759> not<00:01:23.850> least<00:01:24.150> are<00:01:24.330> these<00:01:24.450> front<00:01:24.720> rear<00:01:24.990> sway

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
but not least are these front rear sway

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.380 
but not least are these front rear sway
bars<00:01:25.619> from<00:01:25.890> Eibach<00:01:26.310> now<00:01:26.729> sway<00:01:26.939> bars<00:01:27.180> are<00:01:27.299> one

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
bars from Eibach now sway bars are one

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.120 
bars from Eibach now sway bars are one
of<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.540> biggest<00:01:27.720> factors<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.290> reducing<00:01:28.920> body

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130

your car comes around to turn a lot
quicker<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:51.329> actually<00:01:51.689> makes<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.899> little<00:01:51.990> bit

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110

car feels so much more solid steering
response<00:02:19.870> has<00:02:20.110> been<00:02:20.140> greatly<00:02:20.650> improved<00:02:21.220> it

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
response has been greatly improved it

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.390

so<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.489> understeer<00:02:27.790> has<00:02:27.970> definitely<00:02:28.329> been

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
so the understeer has definitely been

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.759 
so the understeer has definitely been
reduced<00:02:28.870> as<00:02:29.079> a<00:02:29.140> matter<00:02:29.290> of<00:02:29.349> fact<00:02:29.560> we've<00:02:29.739> got

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.979 
reduced as a matter of fact we've got
some<00:02:29.980> turns<00:02:30.250> coming<00:02:30.610> up<00:02:30.730> here<00:02:31.060> see<00:02:31.780> how<00:02:31.900> she

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
some turns coming up here see how she

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.259 
some turns coming up here see how she
does<00:02:32.260> in<00:02:32.620> terms<00:02:32.799> of<00:02:32.950> our<00:02:33.040> handling<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:33.970> even

now<00:03:10.290> with<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.500> install<00:03:10.800> these<00:03:11.070> parts<00:03:11.430> we're

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
now with the install these parts we're

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.820 
now with the install these parts we're
looking<00:03:11.790> at<00:03:11.850> about<00:03:11.940> six<00:03:12.300> to<00:03:12.420> eight<00:03:12.450> hours

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
looking at about six to eight hours

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
looking at about six to eight hours
basically<00:03:13.830> because<00:03:14.070> those<00:03:14.220> Springs<00:03:14.550> take<00:03:14.820> a

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
basically because those Springs take a

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.820 
basically because those Springs take a
little<00:03:15.090> bit<00:03:15.180> longer<00:03:15.360> to<00:03:15.660> install<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:16.620> of

little bit longer to install and of

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.020 
little bit longer to install and of
