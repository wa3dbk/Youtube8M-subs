00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.920
 step more than pulling from the forum 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:24.719
 by moncada and all this and then when 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.060

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:28.380

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.979
 full moon I do not know if you see you see or you do not see 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.509
 the road has been pulling very well not 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.349
 I know where the fuck we are but here the 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.869
 thing is already narrow and remains such thing 

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:42.259
 we have found angelina lad 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.259
 behind 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.020
 this is a fucking mother route because 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.030
 we made all the noise until moncada 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.429
 to the new so it catches past moncada 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.670
 15 kilometers or so until I know it's 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.530
 just back to the lighthouse and Forum 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.500
 come to catch beach and the lateral 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.790
 now we are days in vilassar and until 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.440
 now like who says we have not stepped 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.450
 road stop usual to put 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.459
 gasoline will put up from the 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.590
 our final with the end is going to be a 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.620
 some eggs with sausage given a 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.840
 little and so you have to hydrate a cubito 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.060
 talking about night coaching the subject 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.470
 a lot of people these days are hanging us 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.540
 a tweet and fuck makes fun and 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.160
 thanks so much that we've seen 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.780
 that you have at night and now we are 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.590
 doing the same look is I do not know that 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.650
 you are older 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.660
 you are head to do what comes out 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.610
 of the cock would miss more than pepillos 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.900
 we had to advise nothing but not 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.940
 what it is to have we want to say is 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.360
 that train at night is a fucking shit 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.520
 that is to say 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.380
 it is true that it is cooler is 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.820
 true that there are not so many people but 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.440
 level there are also tweets from people who 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.880
 he says he hears us but this does not affect the 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.010
 performance this is not bad for the 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.630
 d'health this will not esquadra ostia and pos 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.580
 then why are we doing this 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.980
 to train better not because we're going to 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.800
 make a career that is 55 hours not 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.960
 this to do 775 kilometers in the 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.270
 that will be two days plus two more nights 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.840
 of the beginning of a third day so for 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.000
 balls 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.200
 we have to train the dream we have 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.700
 that train your head and have that 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.830
 we have to train the body to 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.080
 when we take a chuck donkey bored 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.880
 of many kilometers that the body to 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.010
 despite being punished then follow 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.130
 pulling is all about surviving 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.470
 for two and a half days without surrendering 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.330
 because in the end when we arrive before 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.520
 of life we will be dead already but 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.390
 try to get up to lisboa as 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.390
 either within 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.450
 and then here there will be people who will say 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:50.730
 but sport is not something that has 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.510
 that be healthy to go better head 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.640
 for themselves but sometimes there is a challenge because 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.400
 that looks that takes you beyond what 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.780
 it would be healthy so to speak it means 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.150
 that we advise to do things of these 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.549
 does not mean that you have to do them 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.400
 wants to leave is forbidden to do them or 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.079
 What do we have to be ashamed of? 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.629
 them but hell are the days of 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.760
 adults we have more or less head but 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.380
 we have a little amman remove them 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.209
 wisdom teeth but I still have two 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.209
 with which a little judgment city and 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.910
 is our choice is criticizable is 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.289
 praiseworthy or is it neutral so everyone who 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.940
 think what you want but we feel like 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.380
 do it so I think we had to 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.539
 say it so people do not think 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.860
 I support with your train at night is 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:35.250
 an example to follow and you have to do it 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.009
 It is not no good saying this to us 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.419
 itching and we had to scratch the 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:44.370
 as we are look, we have come to 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:46.770
 dock what we have we have some 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.610
 cookies we had a lot of man I would catch 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.610
 the princesses 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.810
 two 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.660
 jellyfish that would be of these training without 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.830
 some technical stops for chocolate and 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.290
 what is it that has brought you that was going 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.660
 churruca another half in the morning as 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.970
 If we were hamsters, we'll be back 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:13.430
 here in the Besòs river we have passed the 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:16.080
 kilometer 100 went down 23 and a half on average 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:19.080
 well very roller all this is clear 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.600
 how easy we have gone the way and I 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.520
 it is wrong today not to have recorded images 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.140
 but he started knives like that and 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.370
 then someone the road is difficult 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.370
 Strongest bastard 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.670
 Enbridge known as bridge 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.650
 santa co 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:39.420
 until I run out of stuff 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:42.170
 obstacles if we go to a gas station to 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:46.200
 put on our boots again very strong 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:47.820
 to the coffee on the t4 aquarius to the lord 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.740
 repsol could not tell you that not 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.480
 sponsor us that we take that day 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.880
 stopping at gas stations and Mr. Repsol 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.850
 he could sponsor nine thousand euros not 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.280
 just today but the sponsorship thing was going 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:04.830
 seriously , he wants to ask 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:07.170
 it's not safe but pass an instance 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.060
 I know the rule, not for that we are 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:13.430
 economic always if a couple of bars 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.430
 of bread and one of jb of these 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:17.770
 do not 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:20.530
 that you exist master 5 of average of the 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.720
 tomorrow fifth commandment 'reynaud and 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:25.210
 so far the adventure is nothing 6 of 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.450
 the morning and judging by the cost of 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.289
 sneakers the bicycle legs and the 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:34.009
 face 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:35.960
 has completed seven and a half hours since 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:38.149
 that we got out of which five and a half 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:42.969
 they have been training 120 and peak 

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:42.969
 kilometers and a pretty pretty average
