00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.759
 hello very good to all welcome a 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.279
 more time to my channel here that is a 

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:08.410
 playing the quad z this time I'm going to 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.480
 make a guide to teach them how 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.570
 get crafter all the weapons in a 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.030
 only day is to say in a single session not 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.990
 we can die 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.240
 let's put this here 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.460
 there are many of the many things 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.410
 what 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.460
 what we need we can get them 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.460
 here behind the house 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.559
 and he put me the jetpack and the other one for 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.379
 to get to the fastest sites 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.880
 but they can do it without this 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.830
 perfectly 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.420
 to carry this is a lot of things 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.840
 what we need are right behind 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.840
 this house 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.340
 we already got the chewing gum the machine 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.160
 chewing gums 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.860
 I'm going to take it 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.670
 and I'm going to look for a drop every time 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.460
 let's build something we need to look for the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.770
 drops because we need to eat 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.190
 the electros are supplies that fall 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.830
 from the sky 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.110
 and here we only have this and a weapon 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.390
 for now we do not need it but I'm going to 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.890
 leave near our house because 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.180
 we can get to need the most 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.980
 ahead 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.430
 I recommend here there was also a cake 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.430
 no this 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.120
 up to normal 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.120
 for our house 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.930
 I was 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.390
 and we leave the cake now we see that 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.240
 we need to give them a stick is no longer a 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.090
 stick 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.340
 is a doll like a snowman 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.219
 voodoo a rare thing 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.030
 I go first for the airdrop that because 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:47.030
 I'm already without food 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.810
 in the stickman was here here 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.409
 there is also food so we can 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:05.179
 take to eat was not here not 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.179
 the stick doll is here 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.760
 and with this we already have a new weapon 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.550
 the heartbreaker by now we have 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.700
 only two weapons is very important what 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.950
 go taking or going drops but if you 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.540
 Clueless and non- advisory you will die and 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.650
 you have to start all over again like I said 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:31.239
 rather this is weird to get 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.239
 we will need this later 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.200
 and it's pretty weird to get the 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.200
 potion is a crystal ball 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.850
 that is in the tent of the seer of 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.430
 here 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.580
 ok here is one and here in the box there 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.580
 plus 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:02.299
 ok we welcome this ball and we go here 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.840
 the ball must be eating all the 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:08.380
 while it is not very easy to die and also 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.590
 you have to be careful 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.210
 with zombies and others with fire too 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.220
 what 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.800
 as we are used to 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.790
 to play the other collector at least to me 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.460
 It happens to me 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.990
 we do not consider that we can die 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.990
 up here is the radio 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.379
 we have here 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:39.190
 with this and a ball 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:42.470
 we already have the mental controller 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.350
 we already have 3 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.450
 three weapons of five now we have 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.819
 it 's easy to do because I think that 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.579
 even here comes one time 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:55.519
 and here we have the components 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:57.410
 needed for the next next 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.360
 here 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.100
 this weapon here 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:06.210
 and we already make the relaxant 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.210
 to know what we need 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.870
 we lack the trap and the flour is worth 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.980
 and be able poets bunch of food that 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.940
 there is one of the components here 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.940
 required 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.350
 nothing else 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.020
 where was my house is now is 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.229
 important here we go give me time gives me 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.229
 weather 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.389
 and the flour to the de cesc here in there 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.389
 is 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:58.760
 come on let's go yes 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.590
 Antiquarian and that's it 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.690
 Well, we would have already achieved it already 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.240
 we have the five weapons of the game that 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.270
 we can create and that's why they would give us the 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.050
 achievement 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.370
 of flipping the five weapons in one 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.889
 departure 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.690
 remember that it has to be all followed 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.310
 we can not die if we die we have to 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.560
 start from scratch again catching 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.680
 all weapons but now that they know the 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.780
 Location of each item is easier 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.960
 I hope you liked it and even the 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.960
 next
