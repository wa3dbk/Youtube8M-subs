00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
okay as you can see we're doing a nice

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.380 
okay as you can see we're doing a nice
technique<00:00:17.440> today<00:00:17.619> now<00:00:18.460> here's<00:00:19.060> the<00:00:19.210> thing

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
technique today now here's the thing

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.720 
technique today now here's the thing
with<00:00:19.570> the<00:00:19.690> snipe<00:00:19.930> if<00:00:20.650> your<00:00:21.220> opponent<00:00:21.610> has

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
with the snipe if your opponent has

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.070 
with the snipe if your opponent has
imagined<00:00:22.240> his<00:00:22.330> right<00:00:22.570> hand

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 
imagined his right hand

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.960 
imagined his right hand
more<00:00:24.040> than<00:00:24.250> likely<00:00:24.460> you're<00:00:24.730> going<00:00:24.820> to<00:00:24.880> be

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
more than likely you're going to be

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.580 
more than likely you're going to be
standing<00:00:25.390> with<00:00:25.540> your<00:00:25.689> left<00:00:25.930> foot<00:00:26.110> forward<00:00:26.320> and

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
standing with your left foot forward and

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.500 
standing with your left foot forward and
the<00:00:26.920> reason<00:00:27.279> is<00:00:27.460> if<00:00:27.640> I<00:00:27.730> have<00:00:27.910> my<00:00:28.029> right<00:00:28.270> foot

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 
the reason is if I have my right foot

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.689 
the reason is if I have my right foot
forward<00:00:28.840> it<00:00:28.930> stabs<00:00:29.320> in<00:00:29.560> here<00:00:29.800> the<00:00:30.310> knife<00:00:30.520> is

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
forward it stabs in here the knife is

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.240 
forward it stabs in here the knife is
going<00:00:30.910> to<00:00:31.029> get<00:00:31.180> there<00:00:31.390> typically<00:00:32.199> before<00:00:32.410> I<00:00:32.680> do

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
going to get there typically before I do

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.180 
going to get there typically before I do
so<00:00:33.489> the<00:00:33.790> idea<00:00:34.150> and<00:00:34.930> Isis<00:00:35.530> I<00:00:35.680> need<00:00:35.860> to<00:00:35.980> get

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
so the idea and Isis I need to get

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.070 
so the idea and Isis I need to get
inside<00:00:36.370> the<00:00:37.000> knife<00:00:37.180> see<00:00:37.540> what's<00:00:37.720> happening

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
inside the knife see what's happening
