00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.200
 the robert 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.200
 e 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.020
 videos and then 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.700
 no more so today I just want to 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.960
 you do a little unpacking the nokia 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.250
 lumia 535 that I received a moment 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.689
 then I tested a few days and 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.150
 after I'll do a video test like 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.890
 I used to do so before giving you 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.620
 strong points weak points 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.290
 finally help you decide if you 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.940
 want to buy it or not just 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.350
 so already having started by the box 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.629
 so she looks like that so 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.790
 wrote him but a 535 hanger of the alkine 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.550
 knowing game by day knowing I believe 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.870
 that even a mono sim model so the 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.760
 city is due to cindy naugle long 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.350
 you will have the opportunity to put 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.089
 micro sim what is interesting if you 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.519
 have a personal target or sign for 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.140
 work or so one if you are 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.030
 cross- border his recent potatoes that's 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.670
 are features we'll see when 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.199
 of my video test next time so 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.530
 now you see the microsoft ccri 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.430
 1 security nokia will launch microsoft 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.930
 then one's presence when one 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.810
 not see like all the last light 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.979
 so there we are number ine number of 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.299
 series he sees well that at box is 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.950
 sealed so I 'll open it with you 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.170
 at the same time we will discover that 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.430
 behind there is what barrier like he 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.850
 there is the phone and different colors 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.580
 to have blue blue from the green of the 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.670
 black of the plane oranje so here 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.640
 how is the box 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.640
 then will open the coup then it is 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:40.040
 do it fast and clean 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.870
 tarek while then we play the box 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.260
 so we have it here so we discover the 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.700
 535 light in his blue dress then 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.470
 why blue is a color that I like 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.730
 a lot simply and I know that 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.590
 anyway if one day I change 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.220
 color bah why not pass on the 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.480
 duverne orange this possibility 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.130
 to be able to change the roosters 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.080
 So it is not by inherent inherent 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.060
 finally let's say that nokia started as 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.369
 so with these different types of 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.659
 of color so I think it plays very 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.789
 very friendly which we can call 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.480
 there we will see inside so at 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.640
 within what we have been the 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.830
 blow the battery so the battery that 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:24.410
 is a 1905 milliamperes hours tac on 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:31.200
 has a manual so quick start 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:33.989
 on the other side we suddenly have the 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.209
 so charger is that micro usb jack 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.910
 so the charger that is in one block 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.650
 ok relatively long I 'm like all 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.310
 the nokia the lights lately he 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.080
 is relatively long 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.239
 so maybe open it for really 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.860
 see attention me I used it all 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.510
 way so that's it there is it is 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.019
 regarding names and against it 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.130
 has a block 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.220
 so if you want to make transfers 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:56.849
 two dates with the usb redeem you 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.930
 a micro usb incarnate or so knowing 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.560
 that in this phone you can put 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.569
 a micro sd 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.390
 if you have a report will do by microsd 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:06.750
 to also transfer the files that 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.970
 that music videos or photos via the 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.970
 microsd and then we have a kit 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.780
 Handsfree headset fabien cd intra 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.060
 auricular so we removed it both 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.579
 hands free at microsoft 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.200
 so so here is a presentation of 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.200
 the box unpacking 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.920
 and now we're going to move on or 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.260
 phone I'm going to open it up we're going 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.150
 look how to win at the level 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.920
 aesthetic 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.540
 so here we have a big phone by a 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.340
 big yes by the way jets good I 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.820
 not put the battery on to tf1 of 5 inches 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.170
 1 so here so if I can compare 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.120
 with my current phone 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.170
 we are at what level possible village 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.180
 and a galaxy note 3 light but in term 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.459
 of height it is a little like this in 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.340
 width necessarily and then there are three 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.620
 in the thickness is thicker than 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.770
 our offer 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.810
 here is the 3 light pensions not that I 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.300
 wrong it's ours ours three neo or 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.040

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.360
 bigger and good it makes 5,056 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.120
 the ai does that five or six 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.769
 but for the moment I find it is 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.760
 nice we will take charge of it 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.490
