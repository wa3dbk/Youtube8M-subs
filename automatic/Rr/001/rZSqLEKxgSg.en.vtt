building our camera first time out of
the<00:00:51.449> gate<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.989> think<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.680> know<00:00:53.000> unabashedly

the gate I think you know unabashedly
I'll<00:00:54.449> say<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.690> did<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> pretty<00:00:55.140> damn<00:00:55.379> absolutely

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309

crazy perfect no it is not perfect does

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.319 
crazy perfect no it is not perfect does
it<00:00:58.890> need<00:00:59.039> more<00:00:59.100> work<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.699> certain<00:00:59.879> areas<00:01:00.059> of

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
it need more work in certain areas of

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.510 
it need more work in certain areas of
course<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.930> does<00:01:01.109> first<00:01:01.890> time<00:01:02.190> out<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.399> the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
course it does first time out of the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.009 
course it does first time out of the
game<00:01:02.699> right<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.180> we're<00:01:03.300> only<00:01:03.390> two<00:01:03.660> years<00:01:03.780> into

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
game right and we're only two years into

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.420 
game right and we're only two years into
it<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.350> red<00:01:04.559> one<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:04.979> still<00:01:05.129> going<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.309> keep

always<00:01:12.150> worked<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.570> red<00:01:12.750> one<00:01:13.460> but<00:01:14.460> epic<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.880> all

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
always worked on red one but epic is all

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.030 
always worked on red one but epic is all
the<00:01:15.420> things<00:01:15.600> we<00:01:15.720> learned<00:01:15.900> about<00:01:16.020> how<00:01:16.439> can<00:01:16.950> we

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
the things we learned about how can we

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.859 
the things we learned about how can we
make<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.280> better<00:01:17.490> if<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.390> look<00:01:18.509> at<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.630> Mac

make it better if you look at the Mac

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.810 
make it better if you look at the Mac
you<00:01:19.049> own<00:01:19.170> ten<00:01:19.409> years<00:01:19.680> ago<00:01:19.890> right<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.460> Mac<00:01:20.640> you

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
you own ten years ago right on Mac you

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.760 
you own ten years ago right on Mac you
own<00:01:20.939> today<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.750> gets<00:01:21.930> better<00:01:22.080> you're<00:01:22.350> not<00:01:22.500> mad

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
own today it gets better you're not mad

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.710 
own today it gets better you're not mad
that<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.280> mac<00:01:23.520> from<00:01:23.880> 10<00:01:24.030> years<00:01:24.180> ago<00:01:24.299> doesn't

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
that the mac from 10 years ago doesn't

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.270 
that the mac from 10 years ago doesn't
work<00:01:24.900> as<00:01:25.110> good<00:01:25.200> or<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.560> might<00:01:25.650> be<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.890> know<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
work as good or it might be you know the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.780 
work as good or it might be you know the
magnet<00:01:26.610> or<00:01:26.700> six<00:01:26.909> months<00:01:27.090> ago<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.450> work<00:01:27.869> is

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
magnet or six months ago that work is

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.640 
magnet or six months ago that work is
exactly<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.509> that's<00:01:30.720> that's<00:01:30.990> where<00:01:31.290> all<00:01:31.439> this

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
exactly so that's that's where all this

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.080 
exactly so that's that's where all this
sits<00:01:31.979> right<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.460> evolution<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.880> things

losses<00:03:11.500> however<00:03:12.250> as<00:03:12.519> we<00:03:12.850> evolve<00:03:13.180> we<00:03:13.510> see

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
losses however as we evolve we see

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.050 
losses however as we evolve we see
reasons<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:14.769> advantages<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.340> go<00:03:15.459> even<00:03:15.700> higher

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
reasons and advantages to go even higher

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.810 
reasons and advantages to go even higher
on<00:03:16.360> the<00:03:17.140> bit<00:03:17.530> rate<00:03:17.709> which<00:03:17.920> means<00:03:18.130> lower<00:03:18.430> on<00:03:18.700> the

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
on the bit rate which means lower on the

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.640 
on the bit rate which means lower on the
compression<00:03:19.239> so<00:03:19.360> higher<00:03:19.570> bit<00:03:19.780> mate<00:03:19.989> equals

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
compression so higher bit mate equals

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.259 
compression so higher bit mate equals
lower<00:03:20.920> aggression<00:03:21.430> ratio<00:03:21.670> right<00:03:23.100> so<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.640> epic

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
lower aggression ratio right so the epic

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.710 
lower aggression ratio right so the epic
is<00:03:25.450> designed<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:26.560> go<00:03:26.709> up<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:27.100> 100<00:03:27.910> megabytes<00:03:28.450> a

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
that megabits is kind of in the AGF

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
you're gonna see that that's all going

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.630 
you're gonna see that that's all going
to<00:04:07.050> come<00:04:07.170> because<00:04:07.560> that's<00:04:07.709> not<00:04:07.890> a<00:04:07.950> storage

to come because that's not a storage

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.460 
to come because that's not a storage
definitely<00:04:09.120> still<00:04:09.390> be<00:04:09.510> an<00:04:09.570> option<00:04:09.750> on<00:04:10.080> Epic

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
definitely still be an option on Epic

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.620 
definitely still be an option on Epic
because<00:04:10.740> it's<00:04:10.890> so<00:04:11.100> wonderful<00:04:11.580> to<00:04:11.610> use<00:04:11.940> compact

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
because it's so wonderful to use compact

little mini digital film ads right and

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.860 
little mini digital film ads right and
that<00:04:17.609> that's<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.180> storage<00:04:18.450> business<00:04:18.630> is

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
that that's the storage business is

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.509 
that that's the storage business is

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
evolves at light speed so you're going

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.340 
evolves at light speed so you're going

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
to watch that evolved over the next year

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.040
