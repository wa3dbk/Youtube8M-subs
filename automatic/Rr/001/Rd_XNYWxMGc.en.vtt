00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.700 
have decided to call the style the flame
because<00:01:05.940> of<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.479> way<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.020> color<00:01:07.320> is

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
because of the way that the color is

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.460 
because of the way that the color is
darker<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.790> sides<00:01:09.120> and<00:01:09.420> then<00:01:09.900> gradually

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
darker on the sides and then gradually

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.459 
darker on the sides and then gradually
goes<00:01:11.070> up<00:01:11.250> into<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.610> burst<00:01:11.969> of<00:01:12.240> color<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:12.990> I'm
