00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.690 
then suddenly lo and behold I got goals
I'll<00:02:00.210> have<00:02:00.390> menthols<00:02:00.810> yeah<00:02:00.990> I'll<00:02:01.079> be<00:02:01.170> fine<00:02:01.700> you

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
I'll have menthols yeah I'll be fine you

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.859 
I'll have menthols yeah I'll be fine you
know<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:02.969> then<00:02:03.090> also<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.659> then<00:02:03.719> also

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
know and then also and then also

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.389 
know and then also and then also
European<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.500> know<00:02:04.530> also<00:02:04.770> scientists<00:02:05.280> also

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
European you know also scientists also

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.889 
European you know also scientists also
point<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.060> environmental<00:02:06.450> consequences

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
point to the environmental consequences

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.749 
point to the environmental consequences
of<00:02:07.259> farming<00:02:07.770> genetically

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
of farming genetically

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.100 
of farming genetically
crops<00:02:09.060> as<00:02:09.209> we've<00:02:09.360> talked<00:02:09.599> about<00:02:09.689> with<00:02:09.989> the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
crops as we've talked about with the

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.899 
crops as we've talked about with the
bees<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.349> things<00:02:10.739> like<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:10.950> but<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.879> know

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
bees and things like that but you know

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.539 
bees and things like that but you know
these<00:02:12.330> things<00:02:12.599> are<00:02:12.930> inherently<00:02:13.590> dangerous

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
these things are inherently dangerous

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.970 
these things are inherently dangerous
yeah<00:02:15.209> you<00:02:15.659> know<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:15.810> mean<00:02:16.110> there's<00:02:16.290> enough<00:02:16.590> to

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
yeah you know I mean there's enough to

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.259 
yeah you know I mean there's enough to
me<00:02:17.129> there's<00:02:17.370> enough<00:02:17.519> science<00:02:17.879> on<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.060> side

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
me there's enough science on the side

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.839 
me there's enough science on the side
this<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.450> let's<00:02:18.780> not<00:02:19.379> just<00:02:19.680> cram<00:02:20.430> these<00:02:20.670> on

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
this is let's not just cram these on

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.490 
this is let's not just cram these on
every<00:02:21.030> there's<00:02:21.209> more<00:02:21.420> research<00:02:21.689> pointing

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
every there's more research pointing

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.619 
every there's more research pointing
toward<00:02:22.829> possible<00:02:23.670> serious<00:02:24.360> long-term

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
toward possible serious long-term

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.740 
toward possible serious long-term
effects<00:02:25.379> not<00:02:25.829> only<00:02:26.150> individually<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.390> human

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
effects not only individually to human

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.009 
effects not only individually to human
beings<00:02:28.019> but<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.590> our<00:02:28.920> species<00:02:29.670> as<00:02:29.849> a<00:02:29.879> whole

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
beings but to our species as a whole

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.339 
beings but to our species as a whole
there<00:02:31.019> are<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.260> lot<00:02:31.590> of<00:02:31.620> fears<00:02:31.980> about<00:02:32.159> what

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
there are a lot of fears about what

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.690 
there are a lot of fears about what
consuming<00:02:34.349> these<00:02:34.590> kinds<00:02:35.069> of<00:02:35.129> foods<00:02:35.430> and

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
consuming these kinds of foods and

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.369 
consuming these kinds of foods and
genetically<00:02:36.090> engineered<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:36.959> modified

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
genetically engineered and modified

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.550 
genetically engineered and modified
foods<00:02:37.680> could<00:02:37.950> have<00:02:38.220> because<00:02:38.879> we<00:02:39.180> feed<00:02:39.750> cows<00:02:40.170> we

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
foods could have because we feed cows we

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.099 
foods could have because we feed cows we
feed<00:02:40.829> livestock<00:02:41.159> the<00:02:42.060> things<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:42.989> are

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
feed livestock the things that are

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.699 
feed livestock the things that are
genetically<00:02:44.040> modified<00:02:44.609> and<00:02:45.150> which<00:02:46.140> is<00:02:46.349> comes

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
genetically modified and which is comes

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.349 
genetically modified and which is comes
down<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:47.069> like<00:02:47.220> corn<00:02:47.459> starch<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:47.909> we<00:02:48.090> are

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
down to like corn starch and we are

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:49.490 
down to like corn starch and we are
those<00:02:48.540> things<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:48.900> you're<00:02:49.019> going<00:02:49.170> oh<00:02:49.379> it

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
those things that you're going oh it

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.080 
those things that you're going oh it
doesn't<00:02:49.650> say<00:02:49.829> GMO<00:02:50.250> but<00:02:50.459> it's<00:02:50.579> actually<00:02:50.849> made

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
doesn't say GMO but it's actually made

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.270 
doesn't say GMO but it's actually made
from<00:02:51.120> something<00:02:51.840> that's<00:02:51.989> from<00:02:52.200> an<00:02:52.319> exam<00:02:52.829> there

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
from something that's from an exam there

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.180 
from something that's from an exam there
and<00:02:53.519> and<00:02:53.790> livestock<00:02:54.629> now<00:02:54.900> our<00:02:55.139> meat<00:02:55.500> is<00:02:55.799> having

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
and and livestock now our meat is having

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.490 
and and livestock now our meat is having
issues<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.940> it's<00:02:57.299> it's<00:02:57.599> being<00:02:57.930> pointed<00:02:58.319> back

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
issues and it's it's being pointed back

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.509 
issues and it's it's being pointed back
and<00:02:58.709> now<00:02:58.799> they're<00:02:58.980> doing<00:02:59.159> more<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.430> more

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
and now they're doing more and more

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.170 
and now they're doing more and more
research<00:02:59.909> long-term<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:01.170> feeding<00:03:01.920> cows<00:03:02.430> and

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
research long-term that feeding cows and
