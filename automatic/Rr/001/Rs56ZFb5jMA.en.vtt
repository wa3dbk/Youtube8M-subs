00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.499 
2 duos the advantage yeah you you may
get<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.560> know<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.710> lot<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:06.119> know<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.240> lot

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
get you know a lot of you know a lot

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.290 
get you know a lot of you know a lot
more<00:02:06.689> out<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.020> your<00:02:07.320> your<00:02:07.649> hardware<00:02:08.069> but<00:02:08.819> you

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
more out of your your hardware but you

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.229 
more out of your your hardware but you
know<00:02:09.420> for<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.140> most<00:02:10.289> part<00:02:10.679> we<00:02:11.670> haven't<00:02:11.879> gotten

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
know for the most part we haven't gotten

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.640 
know for the most part we haven't gotten
to<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.450> point<00:02:12.629> where

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
to the point where

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.710 
to the point where
you<00:02:13.920> know<00:02:14.040> it's<00:02:14.430> twice<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.939> is<00:02:14.970> twice<00:02:15.390> as<00:02:15.420> fast

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
you know it's twice it is twice as fast

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.600 
you know it's twice it is twice as fast
some<00:02:16.019> people<00:02:16.230> would<00:02:16.349> argue<00:02:16.409> the<00:02:16.680> opposite<00:02:17.400> but

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
some people would argue the opposite but

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.550 
some people would argue the opposite but
for<00:02:18.060> most<00:02:18.180> working<00:02:18.750> day<00:02:18.840> applications<00:02:19.439> like

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
for most working day applications like

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.460 
for most working day applications like
web<00:02:19.769> surfing<00:02:20.010> email<00:02:20.489> and<00:02:20.700> whatnot<00:02:21.470> going

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
web surfing email and whatnot going

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.809 
web surfing email and whatnot going
between<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.769> single<00:02:23.069> core<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.400> dual<00:02:23.549> core

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
between a single core and a dual core

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.380 
between a single core and a dual core
the<00:02:24.209> difference<00:02:24.569> is<00:02:24.689> not<00:02:24.810> all<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.500> great

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
the difference is not all that great

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.699 
the difference is not all that great
at<00:02:27.390> least<00:02:27.599> that's<00:02:27.780> been<00:02:27.989> my<00:02:28.110> experience<00:02:28.140> and

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
at least that's been my experience and

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:29.990 
at least that's been my experience and
I'm<00:02:28.799> sure<00:02:28.829> benchmarks<00:02:29.489> would<00:02:29.640> lead<00:02:29.819> you<00:02:29.909> to

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
I'm sure benchmarks would lead you to

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.069 
I'm sure benchmarks would lead you to
believe<00:02:30.120> otherwise<00:02:30.540> but<00:02:30.750> there's<00:02:30.870> something

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
believe otherwise but there's something

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.259 
believe otherwise but there's something
to<00:02:31.140> be<00:02:31.230> said<00:02:31.260> about<00:02:31.620> actually<00:02:32.519> using<00:02:32.909> a<00:02:32.970> system

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
to be said about actually using a system

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.339 
to be said about actually using a system
with<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.480> software<00:02:33.780> in<00:02:33.900> that<00:02:34.049> environment

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
with the software in that environment

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.539 
with the software in that environment
compared<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.510> you<00:02:36.510> know<00:02:36.829> reading<00:02:37.829> numbers<00:02:38.280> and

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
compared to you know reading numbers and

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.490 
compared to you know reading numbers and
that<00:02:38.849> say<00:02:39.150> well<00:02:39.329> this<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:39.599> twice<00:02:39.840> as<00:02:40.049> fast<00:02:40.260> well

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
that say well this is twice as fast well

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.250 
that say well this is twice as fast well
in<00:02:40.709> theory<00:02:41.069> it<00:02:41.489> may<00:02:41.760> be<00:02:41.819> twice<00:02:42.120> as<00:02:42.329> fast<00:02:42.540> my

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
in theory it may be twice as fast my

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.479 
in theory it may be twice as fast my
recommendation<00:02:43.859> if<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.040> were<00:02:44.129> going<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.400> wait

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
recommendation if you were going to wait

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.550 
recommendation if you were going to wait
specifically<00:02:45.060> on<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.180> Macbook<00:02:45.659> I<00:02:45.810> would<00:02:46.019> wait<00:02:46.260> I

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
specifically on a Macbook I would wait I

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.470 
specifically on a Macbook I would wait I
would<00:02:47.069> rather<00:02:47.220> wait<00:02:47.489> for<00:02:47.879> the<00:02:48.090> next<00:02:48.329> release

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
would rather wait for the next release

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.470 
would rather wait for the next release
of<00:02:48.810> OS<00:02:49.079> 10<00:02:49.440> leopard<00:02:50.340> which<00:02:50.609> will<00:02:50.849> knock<00:02:51.299> on

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
of OS 10 leopard which will knock on

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.569 
of OS 10 leopard which will knock on
would<00:02:51.750> be<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.019> a<00:02:52.079> few<00:02:52.260> months<00:02:52.409> to<00:02:53.340> actually

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
would be in a few months to actually

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.849 
would be in a few months to actually
upgrade<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.420> get<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.569> new<00:02:54.720> system<00:02:54.930> then<00:02:55.829> I

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
upgrade and get a new system then I

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.149 
upgrade and get a new system then I
would<00:02:56.280> upgrade<00:02:56.849> to<00:02:57.480> get<00:02:57.629> a<00:02:57.690> new<00:02:57.810> processor<00:02:58.379> up

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
would upgrade to get a new processor up

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.910 
would upgrade to get a new processor up
until<00:02:59.579> last<00:03:00.180> year<00:03:00.420> I<00:03:00.930> was<00:03:01.230> still<00:03:01.319> running<00:03:01.590> on

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
until last year I was still running on

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.330 
until last year I was still running on
an<00:03:02.099> Intel<00:03:02.549> Pentium<00:03:03.510> 4<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.409> first<00:03:04.709> hyper

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
an Intel Pentium 4 the first hyper

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.039 
an Intel Pentium 4 the first hyper
threaded<00:03:05.819> processor<00:03:06.030> that<00:03:06.480> they<00:03:06.599> released<00:03:06.900> I

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
threaded processor that they released I

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.080 
threaded processor that they released I
think<00:03:07.200> was<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:07.379> 3<00:03:07.590> gigahertz<00:03:07.859> and<00:03:08.819> just

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
think was the 3 gigahertz and just

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.179 
think was the 3 gigahertz and just
recently<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.599> had<00:03:09.870> upgraded<00:03:10.349> well<00:03:10.980> I'm

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
recently it had upgraded well I'm

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.640 
recently it had upgraded well I'm
running<00:03:11.549> a<00:03:11.730> quad<00:03:12.090> FX<00:03:12.420> system<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:13.349> be<00:03:13.439> quite

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
running a quad FX system and be quite

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.399 
running a quad FX system and be quite
effective<00:03:13.859> right<00:03:14.340> now<00:03:14.930> and<00:03:15.930> in<00:03:16.319> the

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
effective right now and in the

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.949 
effective right now and in the
differences<00:03:16.799> there<00:03:17.430> they're<00:03:17.730> noticeable<00:03:18.329> but

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
differences there they're noticeable but

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.949 
differences there they're noticeable but
not<00:03:19.379> like<00:03:19.819> huge<00:03:20.819> night<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.120> day<00:03:21.419> like

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
not like huge night and day like

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.059 
not like huge night and day like
differences<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:22.680> you<00:03:22.799> would<00:03:22.919> necessarily

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
differences that you would necessarily

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.509 
differences that you would necessarily
notice<00:03:23.609> when<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.209> comes<00:03:24.449> to<00:03:24.780> as<00:03:25.079> I<00:03:25.260> said<00:03:25.319> before

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
notice when it comes to as I said before

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.339 
notice when it comes to as I said before

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180

disk<00:03:30.900> operations<00:03:31.349> or<00:03:31.680> applications<00:03:32.549> that

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
disk operations or applications that

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:35.119 
disk operations or applications that
really<00:03:33.239> write<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.629> the<00:03:33.720> disk<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:33.959> lot<00:03:34.109> a<00:03:34.349> faster

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129

system<00:03:35.280> usually<00:03:35.730> does<00:03:36.030> translate<00:03:36.480> into<00:03:36.659> more

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
system usually does translate into more

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.220 
system usually does translate into more
productivity<00:03:38.060> so<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.419> guess<00:03:39.900> that's<00:03:40.169> the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
productivity so I guess that's the

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.990 
productivity so I guess that's the
that's<00:03:40.620> what<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.799> dual<00:03:40.980> core<00:03:41.250> means<00:03:41.459> is<00:03:41.730> it<00:03:41.879> is

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
that's what the dual core means is it is

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.789 
that's what the dual core means is it is
it<00:03:42.120> worth<00:03:42.239> doing<00:03:42.449> yeah<00:03:43.079> if<00:03:43.229> you<00:03:43.379> if<00:03:43.620> you're

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
it worth doing yeah if you if you're

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.559 
it worth doing yeah if you if you're
wanting<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.430> upgrade<00:03:44.549> now<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.180> it's<00:03:45.359> been<00:03:45.510> a

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
wanting to upgrade now and it's been a

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.349 
wanting to upgrade now and it's been a
while<00:03:45.780> sure<00:03:46.139> it's<00:03:46.319> worth<00:03:46.470> doing<00:03:46.859> but<00:03:47.489> again<00:03:48.030> it

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
while sure it's worth doing but again it

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.899 
while sure it's worth doing but again it
all<00:03:48.479> really<00:03:48.959> depends<00:03:49.319> on<00:03:49.590> you<00:03:50.400> know<00:03:50.489> how<00:03:50.760> much

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
all really depends on you know how much

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.069 
all really depends on you know how much
you<00:03:51.030> want<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.239> spend<00:03:51.709> is<00:03:52.709> is<00:03:53.099> the<00:03:53.400> gigahertz

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
you want to spend is is the gigahertz

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.509 
you want to spend is is the gigahertz
everything<00:03:55.079> it's<00:03:55.260> cracked<00:03:55.379> up<00:03:55.620> to<00:03:55.680> be<00:03:55.799> which

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
everything it's cracked up to be which

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.159 
everything it's cracked up to be which
is<00:03:56.549> I<00:03:56.879> guess<00:03:57.030> that's<00:03:57.479> the<00:03:57.599> next<00:03:57.720> question<00:03:57.840> that

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
is I guess that's the next question that

00:03:58.169 --> 00:03:59.449 
is I guess that's the next question that
would<00:03:58.290> probably<00:03:58.470> spring<00:03:59.040> to<00:03:59.159> mind

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
would probably spring to mind

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.819 
would probably spring to mind
not<00:03:59.849> really<00:04:00.060> just<00:04:00.989> because<00:04:01.560> you<00:04:01.680> have<00:04:01.799> a

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
not really just because you have a

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.969 
not really just because you have a
faster<00:04:02.510> system<00:04:03.510> processor<00:04:04.199> I<00:04:04.319> mean<00:04:04.709> every

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:04.979 
faster system processor I mean every

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:06.289 
faster system processor I mean every
other<00:04:05.010> part<00:04:05.400> of<00:04:05.459> that<00:04:05.519> system<00:04:05.760> is<00:04:05.970> going<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.180> be

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
other part of that system is going to be

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.360 
other part of that system is going to be
just<00:04:06.449> as<00:04:06.599> important<00:04:06.959> including<00:04:07.079> the<00:04:07.919> way<00:04:08.069> that

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
just as important including the way that

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.849 
just as important including the way that
commands<00:04:08.849> are<00:04:09.030> handled<00:04:09.510> by<00:04:09.659> the<00:04:10.199> actual

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
commands are handled by the actual

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.460 
commands are handled by the actual
processor<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.579> input<00:04:12.060> of<00:04:12.239> the<00:04:12.930> commands<00:04:13.229> and

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
processor the input of the commands and

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.229 
processor the input of the commands and
and<00:04:13.590> that's<00:04:13.889> the<00:04:14.280> large<00:04:14.549> difference<00:04:14.760> between

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
and that's the large difference between

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.170 
and that's the large difference between
Intel<00:04:15.659> Intel's<00:04:16.530> multiple<00:04:17.190> core<00:04:17.430> systems<00:04:17.940> and

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
Intel Intel's multiple core systems and

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.229 
Intel Intel's multiple core systems and
AMD's<00:04:19.019> multiple<00:04:19.440> core<00:04:19.590> systems<00:04:19.979> and<00:04:20.820> by<00:04:21.090> and

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
AMD's multiple core systems and by and

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.120 
AMD's multiple core systems and by and
large<00:04:21.269> again<00:04:21.750> it<00:04:21.930> boils<00:04:22.500> down<00:04:22.529> to<00:04:22.650> software

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
large again it boils down to software

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.800 
large again it boils down to software
and<00:04:23.250> which<00:04:23.370> software<00:04:23.729> has<00:04:23.880> specifically<00:04:24.599> been

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
and which software has specifically been

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:25.970 
and which software has specifically been
optimized<00:04:25.229> for<00:04:25.380> one

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980
