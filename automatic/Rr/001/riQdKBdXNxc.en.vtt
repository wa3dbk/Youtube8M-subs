00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
do this but the way we merge this pose

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.600 
do this but the way we merge this pose
is<00:00:29.490> we<00:00:30.210> first<00:00:30.539> start<00:00:30.810> out<00:00:30.929> by<00:00:31.080> just<00:00:31.289> dragging

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
is we first start out by just dragging

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.780 
is we first start out by just dragging
one<00:00:32.610> right<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.570> top<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.050> other<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.790> then

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
one right on top of the other and then

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.660 
one right on top of the other and then
you're<00:00:35.969> going<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:37.070> turn<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.190> opacity<00:00:38.399> down

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
you're going to turn the opacity down

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.369 
you're going to turn the opacity down
just<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.390> see<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.719> layer<00:00:39.960> underneath

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
just so you can see the layer underneath

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.209 
just so you can see the layer underneath
and<00:00:40.940> move<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.629> top<00:00:42.899> image<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.680> kind<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.980> line

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
and move the top image to kind of line

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.450 
and move the top image to kind of line
up<00:00:44.430> with<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.910> bottom<00:00:45.030> image<00:00:46.100> and<00:00:47.100> drag<00:00:47.340> your

up with the bottom image and drag your

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.720 
up with the bottom image and drag your
opacity<00:00:47.730> back<00:00:48.090> up<00:00:48.800> and<00:00:49.800> now<00:00:49.980> you're<00:00:50.219> going<00:00:50.550> to

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
opacity back up and now you're going to

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.680 
opacity back up and now you're going to
do<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> layer<00:00:51.120> mask<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:53.000> I<00:00:54.000> always<00:00:54.180> like<00:00:54.480> the
