00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.990
 hello my dear , welcome here is the great 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.010
 online courses 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.150
 Let's start our course here of the law. 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.609
 2529 of 2011 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.470
 the new antitrust law which 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.990
 I'm a teacher, I'm going to work 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.060
 this subject that with you is right 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.439
 preparation for the competition of the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.360
 Sponsored links 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.360
 the economic cade 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.379
 the case of it is a high kia or a 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.390
 administrative entity not empowered 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.280
 special autarchy under special regime 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.770
 not to be confused with agencies 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.940
 regulators because it acts broadly 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.760
 in the market 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.300
 limiting ducts and preventing 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.329
 pipes that may cause any 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.760
 some unbalance in the competitive order 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.460
 in the market adjustment mechanism 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.659
 then it is important that you have already 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.770
 in mind the importance of this institution 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.630
 to realize some values 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.070
 then before constitutional 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.080
 let's study the law let's talk quickly 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.110
 with the constitutional assumptions that 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.640
 justify the adoption of a local authority 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:24.270
 With this power, it's okay, so good. 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.450
 that 2529 is based on conditioning the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.430
 article 170 of the constitution tac speaks that 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.780
 the economic order based on the valorisation 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.850
 human effort and free enterprise 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.619
 the possibility of entering the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.750
 develop an activity 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.579
 for the purpose of ensuring 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.860
 dignified existence according to the 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.780
 dictates of social justice observed in the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.380
 following principles the principle of 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.060
 free competition is a result of the 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.439
 principle of free enterprise then this 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.439
 is an aspect that you already have to take into 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.259
 has already been charged in evidence to defend 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.350
 free competition is a result of one 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.240
 consequence of free enterprise because 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.030
 so I can come in and stay in the 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.580
 I need to be free to 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.649
 able to enter and remain without 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.690
 there are barriers to my entry into 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.500
 market without the existence of 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.190
 that prevents me 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.200
 where to stay in that market so free 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.450
 competition is a result of a 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.340
 product is a result of the free 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.150
 initiative and it was already a matter of 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.000
 we will see 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.990
 furthermore, Article 173 of the 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.770
 constitution 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.720
 March that the principle of subsidiarity 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.270
 of the state in the economic order 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.790
 from the constitution of 88 the state 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.310
 ceased to be the main economic actor 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.220
 to be regulator of the activity 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.950
 economic order that currently fits 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.770
 to the subject private seek there perform 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.350
 the economic activities then its 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.180
 state to do some activity 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.489
 he will do so in conditions of 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.500
 equality with the private is what says 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.660
 here is article 173 he will tell you that 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.209
 subject to the cases provided for in this 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.250
 constitution is certain the performance of 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.280
 direct economic activity by the state 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.760
 will only be allowed for subjects there 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.130
 relevant interest is collective or 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.209
 national security imperatives 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.769
 certain and even in those cases that 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.170
 are not necessarily aimed at 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.480
 The state is going to have to pay 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.040
 of their public companies and companies 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.130
 mixed economy ie its 1 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.049
 companies will not be able to enjoy 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.420
 no tax privilege than 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.769
 the private sector, that is to say, 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.640
 to do on equal terms 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:41.519
 and the fourth paragraph of Article 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.160
 163 so that the law will repress abuse of 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:47.730
 economic power aimed at the domination of 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.470
 markets to the elimination of competition 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.049
 arbitrary increase in profits 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.940
 this law of which Article 73 speaks 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.100
 paragraph 4 is precisely the law of 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.470
 defense of competition taccetti 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.200
 other criminal laws in the field of 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.200
 administrative and defense 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.810
 competition that represses the abuse of 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.570
 economic power then write and not the people 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.700
 have economic power is not a problem the 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.400
 problem is to have to abuse the 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.350
 cesp has already done this collection so save 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.690
 for the test by itself is not any 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.609
 problem having economic power what is having 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.860
 economic power is to have the possibility of 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.650
 increase the market price 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.190
 It is right on the supply side if 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.890
 you hold there 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.500
 the exclusivity of production or is the 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.720
 main economic actor in the market 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.190
 big part of sales is you who does 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.310
 and the other competitors do not have 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.800
 condition to absorb demand if you 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.620
 ceases to produce this of conferring power 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.170
 possibility of determining the 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.150
 market price this alone is not a 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.650
 problem or problem or abuse of power 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.480
 economic is right 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.340
 well here you have a representation 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.640
 of the problems that occur when 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.710
 there are competitive problems 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:03.250
 It's okay when you have look here 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:05.230
 demand the depreciated curve of normal goods 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.050
 is the demand curve the consumption curve 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:12.250
 while here the curve that is growing 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:14.530
 the cost of production is the supply of color to 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.150
 supply and demand I give equal value 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.760
 reached a balance point in the 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.510
 competitive quantity is right in this 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.460
 that both the producer and the 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.890
 consumer is of the same value for the 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.780
 when there is any demand whatsoever 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.640
 some artificial reduction of the 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.200
 what happens 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.330
 the competitive quantity is 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.280
 artificially reduced so that 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.740
 only people who are willing to 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:42.030
 pay a higher price is that they could 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:45.310
 consume in a way that these people here 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.980
 would stop consuming the whole band 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.350
 which would then be excluded from consumption 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.669
 when I have problems 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:55.540
 anticompetitive I decrease the quantity 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:57.160
 offered price increase and reduce the 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.230
 public consumer 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.900
 therefore these are three problems that 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:04.000
 justify the existence of the chair 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.640
 It's okay, he'll try. 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.220
 is it will not set prices for 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.770
 market he does not control prices he goes 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.480
 do what you seek to ensure the environment 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.820
 competitive environment so that the 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:19.180
 competitive 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:21.240
 can generate competitive prices 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.190
 increased product quality 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.440
 product differentiation around the way 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.340
 increasing the welfare of the 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.640
 consumer 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.640
 OK
