cotton<00:05:34.730> Boyle<00:05:35.030> a<00:05:35.330> Swiss<00:05:35.690> cotton<00:05:36.050> Boyle<00:05:36.290> and<00:05:36.800> I

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
cotton Boyle a Swiss cotton Boyle and I

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.250 
cotton Boyle a Swiss cotton Boyle and I
used<00:05:37.490> to<00:05:37.670> think<00:05:37.940> that<00:05:38.090> batiste<00:05:38.630> was<00:05:38.900> about<00:05:39.110> the

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
used to think that batiste was about the

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.080 
used to think that batiste was about the
lightest<00:05:39.650> fabric<00:05:40.100> that<00:05:40.220> you<00:05:40.400> could<00:05:40.550> find<00:05:40.790> but

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
lightest fabric that you could find but

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.000 
lightest fabric that you could find but
until<00:05:41.480> I<00:05:41.510> discovered<00:05:42.230> Boyle<00:05:42.530> and<00:05:42.890> it's

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
until I discovered Boyle and it's

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.610 
until I discovered Boyle and it's
actually<00:05:43.580> more<00:05:43.850> sheer<00:05:44.270> and<00:05:44.570> more<00:05:45.320> lightweight

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
actually more sheer and more lightweight

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:51.010 
actually more sheer and more lightweight
than<00:05:47.590> batiste<00:05:49.330> when<00:05:50.330> you<00:05:50.450> look<00:05:50.630> at<00:05:50.750> a<00:05:50.780> lot<00:05:50.990> of

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
than batiste when you look at a lot of

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.170 
than batiste when you look at a lot of
vintage<00:05:51.800> clothing<00:05:52.220> I<00:05:52.670> used<00:05:52.850> to<00:05:52.910> think<00:05:53.060> that

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
vintage clothing I used to think that

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.030 
vintage clothing I used to think that
vintage<00:05:53.630> clothing<00:05:53.930> was<00:05:54.200> petites<00:05:54.620> that<00:05:54.860> had

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
vintage clothing was petites that had

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.400 
vintage clothing was petites that had
just<00:05:55.160> been<00:05:55.340> worn<00:05:55.670> thinned<00:05:56.090> but<00:05:56.480> now<00:05:56.900> I<00:05:56.930> know

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
just been worn thinned but now I know

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.410 
just been worn thinned but now I know
that<00:05:57.590> they<00:05:57.890> were<00:05:57.950> made<00:05:58.250> it<00:05:58.550> was<00:05:58.670> made<00:05:58.880> from<00:05:59.120> oil

00:05:59.410 --> 00:05:59.420 
that they were made it was made from oil

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.050 
that they were made it was made from oil
so<00:06:00.410> that's<00:06:00.890> what<00:06:01.220> we're<00:06:01.340> using<00:06:01.520> on<00:06:01.820> this

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
so that's what we're using on this
