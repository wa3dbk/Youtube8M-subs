00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
killers out there she said that it takes

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.170 
killers out there she said that it takes
years<00:01:30.990> for<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.220> develop<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.790> he<00:01:32.880> did<00:01:33.060> it

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
years for that to develop and he did it

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.819 
years for that to develop and he did it
as<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> young<00:01:33.780> kid<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.079> like<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.590> so

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
as a young kid just like that so

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
potential to be more and of course as

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.100 
potential to be more and of course as
you<00:01:41.130> know<00:01:41.159> he<00:01:41.400> was<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.549> child<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:41.909> all<00:01:42.060> he<00:01:42.990> has

you know he was a child and all he has
to<00:01:43.259> learn<00:01:43.439> how<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.770> know<00:01:44.040> what<00:01:44.759> he<00:01:45.000> wants<00:01:45.390> to

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
to learn how you know what he wants to

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.600 
to learn how you know what he wants to
do<00:01:45.600> instead<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.869> what<00:01:45.960> he<00:01:46.200> should<00:01:46.500> do<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.950> kind

do instead of what he should do and kind

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.609 
do instead of what he should do and kind
of<00:01:47.670> get<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.570> comparator<00:01:49.200> differences

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
of get the comparator differences

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.429 
of get the comparator differences
between<00:01:49.770> those<00:01:50.130> two<00:01:50.340> because<00:01:50.960> if<00:01:51.960> he<00:01:52.110> doesn't

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
between those two because if he doesn't

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.590 
between those two because if he doesn't
he'll<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:52.740> be<00:01:52.890> become<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.729> simple<00:01:54.210> killing

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
he'll just be become a simple killing

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.840 
he'll just be become a simple killing
machine<00:01:54.869> like<00:01:55.110> natalia<00:01:56.009> says<00:01:57.740> so<00:01:58.740> um<00:01:59.159> another

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
machine like natalia says so um another

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.429 
machine like natalia says so um another
