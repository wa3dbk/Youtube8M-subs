only<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.000> loop<00:00:48.180> actually<00:00:48.360> but<00:00:48.750> put<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.500> a

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
only a loop actually but put is a

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.250 
only a loop actually but put is a
taxpayer<00:00:50.010> tak<00:00:50.250> on<00:00:50.399> speed<00:00:50.610> up<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.329> because<00:00:52.230> of

the idea he's running on it it negates

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.250 
the idea he's running on it it negates

know how fast my Shoebat was because he

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.300 
know how fast my Shoebat was because he
-<00:01:18.479> he<00:01:18.689> he<00:01:19.259> could<00:01:19.439> have<00:01:19.530> went<00:01:19.680> for<00:01:19.770> an<00:01:19.860> aqua<00:01:20.100> jet

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
- he he could have went for an aqua jet

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.480 
- he he could have went for an aqua jet
but<00:01:20.729> he<00:01:20.880> thought<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.299> slightly<00:01:21.720> faster<00:01:22.110> so

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
but he thought a slightly faster so

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.300 
but he thought a slightly faster so
there<00:01:23.490> we<00:01:23.610> go<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:24.600> was<00:01:24.810> faster<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:26.070> is

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
there we go it was faster and this is

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.359 
there we go it was faster and this is
ninjask<00:01:26.939> we've<00:01:27.240> seen<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.869> before<00:01:28.130> very<00:01:29.130> few

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
ninjask we've seen it before very few

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.190 
ninjask we've seen it before very few
people<00:01:29.520> use<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.090> because<00:01:30.299> it's<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.689> very<00:01:30.720> risky

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
people use it because it's a very risky

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.090 
people use it because it's a very risky
tactic<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:32.579> ninjask<00:01:33.270> has<00:01:33.540> leftovers<00:01:34.320> does

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
tactic this ninjask has leftovers does

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.700 
tactic this ninjask has leftovers does
baton<00:01:35.549> pass<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.509> dance<00:01:36.840> speed<00:01:37.619> boost<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.340> I

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
baton pass so dance speed boost and I

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.819 
baton pass so dance speed boost and I
think

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
think

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.160 
think
agilities<00:01:41.729> on<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.060> or<00:01:42.270> some<00:01:42.630> some<00:01:43.049> other

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
agilities on it or some some other

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.560 
agilities on it or some some other
status<00:01:43.890> boosting<00:01:44.399> mood<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.360> going<00:01:45.509> to

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
status boosting mood so this is going to

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.160 
status boosting mood so this is going to
be<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> battle<00:01:45.899> on<00:01:46.140> passing<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.840> ninjas<00:01:48.840> I

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
be a battle on passing and ninjas I

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.010 
be a battle on passing and ninjas I
fought<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.740> before<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:51.329> go<00:01:51.570> for<00:01:51.720> my<00:01:51.810> car

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
fought it before and I go for my car

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.920 
fought it before and I go for my car
mind<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.560> already<00:01:52.939> stored<00:01:53.939> power<00:01:54.149> boosts<00:01:54.869> for

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
mind and already stored power boosts for

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.679 
mind and already stored power boosts for
every<00:01:55.439> positive<00:01:56.070> stat<00:01:56.610> changing<00:01:57.030> through<00:01:57.210> 20

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
every positive stat changing through 20

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.600 
every positive stat changing through 20
so<00:01:58.110> if<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.290> use<00:01:58.439> one<00:01:58.469> car<00:01:58.860> mine<00:01:59.070> that's<00:01:59.219> an<00:01:59.369> extra

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
so if I use one car mine that's an extra

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.940 
so if I use one car mine that's an extra
82<00:02:00.180> it's<00:02:00.299> family<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:00.719> it's<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.960> hundred<00:02:01.320> as<00:02:01.530> a

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
82 it's family so it's a hundred as a

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.359 
82 it's family so it's a hundred as a
hundred<00:02:02.219> base<00:02:02.520> power<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:03.090> know<00:02:04.070> that<00:02:05.070> he's

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
hundred base power I know that he's

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.190 
hundred base power I know that he's
gonna<00:02:05.549> think<00:02:05.759> I'm<00:02:05.969> gonna<00:02:06.149> go<00:02:06.390> for<00:02:06.630> another<00:02:06.750> car

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
gonna think I'm gonna go for another car

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.000 
gonna think I'm gonna go for another car
mind

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
my stored power that's gonna burn off

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.120 
my stored power that's gonna burn off
the<00:02:32.400> CQ<00:02:32.940> so<00:02:33.600> now<00:02:33.840> I've<00:02:34.140> got<00:02:34.350> my<00:02:34.380> sauce<00:02:34.680> sheet<00:02:34.980> up

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.920 
the CQ so now I've got my sauce sheet up
so<00:02:35.430> no<00:02:35.550> matter<00:02:35.700> what's<00:02:36.120> happening<00:02:36.780> with<00:02:37.020> him

so no matter what's happening with him

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.690 
so no matter what's happening with him
if<00:02:39.930> he<00:02:40.170> hits<00:02:40.350> me<00:02:40.530> takes<00:02:40.800> on<00:02:40.920> my<00:02:41.040> substitute<00:02:41.460> I'm

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700

those gone so I think he knew that was

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.830 
those gone so I think he knew that was
coming<00:02:46.530> so<00:02:46.770> instead<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.370> losing<00:02:47.730> his<00:02:47.820> hero<00:02:48.240> he

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
coming so instead of losing his hero he

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.250 
coming so instead of losing his hero he
wanted<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.350> run<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.650> YouTube<00:02:50.010> take<00:02:50.610> off<00:02:50.820> my<00:02:51.260> my

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
wanted to run the YouTube take off my my

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.840 
wanted to run the YouTube take off my my

substitute with this whole dance
everything<00:02:54.210> I<00:02:54.450> think<00:02:54.630> it<00:02:54.750> would<00:02:54.870> have<00:02:54.960> done<00:02:55.110> it

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200
