 hello guys well found in this 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:08.950
 new video by iphoneitalia.com 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.950
 today we talk about the tweak western board 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.020
 hello guys well found in this 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.170
 new video by iphoneitalia.com 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.750
 today I'm talking about the water board water board 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.610
 is a tweak that allows you to enter as 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.010
 animated wallpapers on our screen 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.949
 home effects very similar to those 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.390
 aires 7 o. weather application 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:39.190
 even some of these are 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.230
 right from the weather application 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.980
 while others are made by 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.690
 developer 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.850
 as you see right now I'm 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.190
 using a custom theme that 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.500
 it has nothing to do with the tweak as it is not 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.899
 the arrangement of the five has to do with it 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.239
 icons in the dock if you are interested this is 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.969
 was obtained thanks to sprint or corn 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.910
 we made a video on the subject but 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:04.030
 going to westerbork than the tweak of 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.100
 we see this video already in operation 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.289
 you see that arrows are flowing 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.649
 right now on my screen 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:11.680
 home 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:13.780
 but we can clearly customize it 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.780
 the tweak we see that here there are 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.580
 so many whiteboards can now be activated 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.770
 and disable tweak operation 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.599
 so quickly if we get upset 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.149
 of the effect clearly needed 

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:26.380
 perform a respring though the backgrounds 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.179
 animated go away 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.750
 we then have the opportunity to choose 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:34.090
 between conditions and nights conditions 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.780
 then in the connections we find i 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.959
 several are more than 80 according to what 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.170
 the developer says more than 80 backgrounds 

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:46.989
 animated background excuse the game of 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.149
 then meteorological words 

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:53.610
 we had for example installed if there 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:58.330
 thunderstorm we put smoke for example 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:01.360
 you see there is more or less healthy fog e 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.330
 clearly sunny most miss years 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.149
 rather sunny monsters claudi 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.209
 rather cloudy and nothing and so on 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.790
 so there was rain for heavy rain 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.280
 in short, they are a whole lot of effects 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.230
 very nice and made precisely on 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.560
 along the lines of those we have from 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.440
 always tried in the app 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.770
 ios weather set the effects right in 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.360
 where there are rain storms, etc. 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.610
 I think the most successful ones are 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.280
 because clearly a good time 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.370
 sunny it can also be nice 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.840
 as in the background of the home, however, yes 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.450
 note the dynamism that there is 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.090
 come in these cases then as I told you 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.220
 the backgrounds work both in the home and in the home 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.290
 in the lock screen this tweak 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.230
 If you are interested and gelli locke set features a 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.110
 video already on the channel on this topic 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.420
 so western board is a very tweak 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.770
 cute very cute because you have seen 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.930
 what allows us to add 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.230
 so many animated effects on the screen 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.590
 home 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.820
 practically become animated backgrounds e 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.430
 all at a relatively low price 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.790
 contained one euro and 49 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.290
 sorry one dollar and 49 subsidies 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.150
 bigboss repository 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.500
 at the same time the developer already does 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.560
 know you are at work on 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.300
 possibility of practically introducing 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.800
 the weather already localized according to 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.870
 position we are in 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.090
 automatic inside the home then 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.740
 if we move from a place where it is 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.510
 peaceful in a place where it rains 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.819
 practically our home will come 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.040
 updated automatically and precisely 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.069
 will change the background reproducing the 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.630
 effects of the weather despite the 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.580
 the characteristics of the click are a lot 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.800
 good should be noted that clearly 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.319
 these animated wallpapers have a weight 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.630
 noticeable on battery life 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.569
 as you see in my case it is also put 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.880
 pretty bad and I didn't load it much 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.020
 long ago so be careful if you 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.660
 used on your device 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.430
 main because especially if you have 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.490
 an iphone this tweak can consume 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.500
 heavy 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.660
 the autonomy of your device too 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.700
 if in this case the developer has pur 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.420
 always confirmed that he is working for 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.270
 improve this aspect of water board 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.010
 so this is heather bown boys a 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.750
 tweak to give a slightly look 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.020
 different to your home screen a 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.000
 look more dynamic and more cute you can 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.360
 buy at a dollar and 49 on 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.740
 repository of bigboss in cydia 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.710
 clearly if you have a device 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.690
 jailbroken good guys so also for 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.980
 today everything is a greeting from andrea cervone
