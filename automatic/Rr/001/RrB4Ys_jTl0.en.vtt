00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:03.549
 roj 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.779
 a lot in the news and of course I am going to check again 

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:12.589
 fiat this large top club in the run-up to having it yourself 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:15.649
 and experienced ajax after a tsunami 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:18.649
 you know what you stood yourself finds the power and influence 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:23.900
 yes, not exactly of course because 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.759
 I think more is known about it now 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.259
 the players are in the belly of player foreign competitions than then 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:32.760
 but 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.760
 yes it can also be comparable to scooters 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.360
 is big 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.890
 Dutch 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.270
 soccer player 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.010
 top scorer you come there in the national languages ​​drag the Spaniard 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.260
 Immediately you are also looking not to what extent your situation toulouse 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.750
 can be compared with the crash of neymar 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.940
 because imagine you like that 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.700
 being seen as a real star is itself 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.730
 what a bad moment 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.940
 yes she is sure 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.440
 we came then after milan when i am happy i play 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.210
 possibly of course 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.020
 also because all unknown which 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.330
 to get in with ajax the tropics two regular bus 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.390
 yes i can be better than expected 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.390
 Councilor Jan de Players 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.640
 Klaas Jan Amsterdam to change entry who can't but turn 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.450
 look back at championships or try cup already agree 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.050
 but of course he has averaged 30 in the last three years 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.930
 percent so 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.609
 which is because you do not need the 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:40.640
 the garage inside 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.960
 and everyone there is thinking or convinced that 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.740
 arsenal has written 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.340
 brussel anp go with red cross after sowing 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.230
 it indicates her fellow countryman 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.570
 is also important 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.440
 before 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.440
 Abroad 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.540
 will deliver 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.500
 almost italy went you had no internet you had no newspapers you had no brake and 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.500
 However, as television music did not ground and you had to 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.199
 genuine Italian leather and I came to life there 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:20.139
 that is something else 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.619
 that would be easier that way 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:24.590
 in the country 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.789
 now yourself 

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:27.469
 to feel at home 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:30.219
 on the other hand and this is also not easy 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:33.179
 you stay informed of everything and everyone 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:34.419
 translate uri geller 

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:35.999
 the bike to school 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:37.809
 the only thing that suits you well 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:41.269
 with a number of Dutchmen not back who with his nose 6 are approximately 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:47.489
 Spanish newspapers reported that not all fans of the three points were after 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.789
 a stay in a full evening too many foreigners might not be too 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:51.639
 see 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.909
 it is in politics that you have the frisian police 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.179
 the tax authorities 50 scheme 

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:04.179
 I thought that proposal myself 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:09.829
 that everyone has been an advocate of vandals think the English club 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.400
 for the most part English word and the Spanish club the largest 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.849
 number of Spaniards and set that 7 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.499
 only and the european 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:19.849
 at the committee 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.509
 he does not agree with that 

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:26.609
 and a delicious lunch jump higher it is vidic not good for it 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:27.459
 football 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.969
 but as long as they don't want to be where there is no chance how far do you think the bike is 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:33.209
 were and therefore final 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.619
 Management wants to go focused on the morning 

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:38.330
 i think i just come 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.479
 part of the sport 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:43.479
 this is typically a sporting affair this helps 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:46.299
 in this case of football 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.489
 yes and the politics that world so not in it and 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.119
 yes to take good care of 

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:55.359
 where you can get from the vyver the weaver he or she will read 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.549
 I only think positive but whether they are strong enough 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:03:59.490
 it is waiting 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.459
 what you give them could 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.179
 the result toppers 

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:07.279
 all the selections of the first teams that he made up 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:10.290
 fifteen players may exist at whatever time you do 

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:16.729
 i'm just limiting because now big clubs just have 35 or even more 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:17.939
 players in 

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:19.249
 selection 

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:22.300
 then you already have some more that it comes together 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.390
 and so you also need a sort of football scheme once 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.809
 use football rule 

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:30.430
 it's not so much 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.530
 let's say it is very susceptible to european legislation, but just 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.289
 japan also plays with a referee and a keeper and 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:40.969
 and that's how you play the narrow selection of fifteen people 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:45.360
 so much about football 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.360
 I say it together 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:54.689
 clubs that get as allowed as possible 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.289
 the small plus 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.790
 have been thrown off without a chance there is actually for it 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.809
 a bit more 

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:04.229
 fair share 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.849
 we have to make many rules in the netherlands so that means 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.449
 the equality 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:10.990
 say increases and 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.300
 at the same time, a talent competition makes more interesting and fun 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.819
 and there you have to 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:19.819
 safety must again 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.729
 be filled in so that the competitions
