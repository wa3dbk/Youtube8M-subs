hey<00:00:00.269> guys<00:00:00.480> welcome<00:00:01.410> to<00:00:01.589> another<00:00:01.709> redstone

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
hey guys welcome to another redstone

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.940 
hey guys welcome to another redstone
tutorial<00:00:02.879> this<00:00:03.870> is<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:04.080> second<00:00:04.440> episode<00:00:04.529> and

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
tutorial this is the second episode and

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.190 
tutorial this is the second episode and
we'll<00:00:05.100> be<00:00:05.250> learning<00:00:05.670> about<00:00:06.049> inverters<00:00:07.049> this

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
we'll be learning about inverters this

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.990 
we'll be learning about inverters this
time<00:00:07.529> that's<00:00:08.160> another<00:00:08.370> fairly<00:00:08.760> essential

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
time that's another fairly essential

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.790 
time that's another fairly essential
thing<00:00:09.330> that<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:09.660> should<00:00:09.809> you<00:00:10.170> probably<00:00:10.620> need

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
thing that you should you probably need

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.700 
thing that you should you probably need
to<00:00:10.920> use<00:00:10.950> in<00:00:11.400> most<00:00:11.820> redstone<00:00:12.269> circuits<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:12.870> it

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
to use in most redstone circuits and it

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.930 
to use in most redstone circuits and it
may<00:00:13.830> be<00:00:13.889> one<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.340> first<00:00:14.490> problems<00:00:14.639> you

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
may be one of the first problems you

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.400 
may be one of the first problems you
encounter<00:00:14.969> that<00:00:15.509> you're<00:00:15.630> not<00:00:15.780> quite<00:00:16.109> sure<00:00:16.139> how

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
encounter that you're not quite sure how

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.769 
encounter that you're not quite sure how
to<00:00:16.440> fix<00:00:16.730> so<00:00:17.730> what<00:00:17.880> we<00:00:17.970> did<00:00:18.119> last<00:00:18.240> time<00:00:18.390> was<00:00:18.539> we

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
to fix so what we did last time was we

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.390 
to fix so what we did last time was we
put<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.990> torch<00:00:19.230> on<00:00:19.380> top<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.800> block<00:00:20.010> just<00:00:20.279> like

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
put a torch on top of a block just like

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.060 
put a torch on top of a block just like
this<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:21.060> we<00:00:21.420> managed<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.779> turn<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.170> off<00:00:22.320> by

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
this and we managed to turn it off by

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.130 
this and we managed to turn it off by
putting<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.640> power<00:00:23.850> source<00:00:24.150> through<00:00:24.750> redstone

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
putting a power source through redstone

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.320 
putting a power source through redstone
into<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.590> block<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:26.640> turns<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.000> off<00:00:27.090> we<00:00:27.210> can

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
into the block that turns it off we can

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.210 
into the block that turns it off we can
also<00:00:27.449> do<00:00:27.599> this<00:00:27.689> with<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.869> lever<00:00:28.170> just<00:00:28.439> like<00:00:29.010> that

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
also do this with a lever just like that

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.710 
also do this with a lever just like that
we<00:00:29.760> can<00:00:29.880> also<00:00:30.029> do<00:00:30.179> with<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.330> pressure<00:00:30.510> plate

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
we can also do with a pressure plate

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.359 
we can also do with a pressure plate
just<00:00:31.260> like<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.009> course<00:00:32.189> with<00:00:32.340> a

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
just like that and the course with a

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.720 
just like that and the course with a
button<00:00:32.730> now<00:00:33.630> now<00:00:34.230> what<00:00:34.380> we<00:00:34.500> want<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.710> do<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.100> say

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
button now now what we want to do is say

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.780 
button now now what we want to do is say
that<00:00:35.910> we<00:00:36.000> have<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:37.160> have<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.309> signal<00:00:38.640> coming

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
that we have to have the signal coming

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.229 
that we have to have the signal coming
out<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.120> way<00:00:39.270> like<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.820> well<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.059> first

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
out this way like this well the first

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.479 
out this way like this well the first
thing<00:00:42.329> you'll<00:00:42.480> notice<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.219> this<00:00:44.219> signal

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
thing you'll notice is that this signal

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.529 
thing you'll notice is that this signal
here<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.570> opposite<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.200> signal

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
here is the the opposite of this signal

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.260 
here is the the opposite of this signal
this<00:00:48.539> may<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.899> problem<00:00:49.289> in<00:00:49.410> some<00:00:49.649> cases

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
this may be a problem in some cases

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.150 
this may be a problem in some cases
where<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.420> need<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:52.260> signal<00:00:52.649> here<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.860> be<00:00:52.949> on

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
where you need this signal here to be on

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.520 
where you need this signal here to be on
as<00:00:53.430> well<00:00:53.730> or<00:00:54.570> maybe<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.050> need<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.230> one<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.410> be

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
as well or maybe you need this one to be

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.049 
as well or maybe you need this one to be
off<00:00:55.680> as<00:00:55.829> well<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.190> they<00:00:56.399> need<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.579> be<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.850> same

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
off as well so they need to be the same

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.180 
off as well so they need to be the same
state<00:00:57.360> at<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.690> same<00:00:57.870> time<00:00:58.109> pretty<00:00:58.410> much<00:00:58.559> which

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
state at the same time pretty much which

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.799 
state at the same time pretty much which
is<00:00:59.219> where<00:00:59.609> we<00:00:59.730> delve<00:00:59.940> into<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.329> realm<00:01:00.600> of

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
is where we delve into the realm of

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.680 
is where we delve into the realm of
repeaters<00:01:01.789> before<00:01:02.789> before<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.359> repeater

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
repeaters before before the repeater

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.200 
repeaters before before the repeater
block<00:01:03.930> was<00:01:04.110> introduced<00:01:04.619> which<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:05.970> one

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
block was introduced which is this one

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.530 
block was introduced which is this one
right<00:01:06.540> here<00:01:08.150> repeaters<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.299> be<00:01:09.390> made

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
right here repeaters have to be made

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.820 
right here repeaters have to be made
manually<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.080> sometimes<00:01:10.470> they're<00:01:10.619> still

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
manually and sometimes they're still

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.920 
manually and sometimes they're still
used<00:01:11.100> because<00:01:11.310> there<00:01:12.030> are<00:01:12.180> actually<00:01:12.510> there's

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
used because there are actually there's

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.380 
used because there are actually there's
sometimes<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.350> better<00:01:13.530> option<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.610> maybe

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
sometimes a better option and maybe

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.330 
sometimes a better option and maybe
they're<00:01:15.570> used<00:01:15.750> for<00:01:15.810> different<00:01:15.990> purposes

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
they're used for different purposes

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.039 
they're used for different purposes
however<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.670> can<00:01:17.820> use<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:18.119> for<00:01:18.360> an<00:01:18.450> an

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
however you can use this for an an

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.740 
however you can use this for an an
inverter<00:01:19.439> because<00:01:19.710> sometimes<00:01:20.640> say<00:01:21.270> if<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.540> have

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
inverter because sometimes say if I have

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.310 
inverter because sometimes say if I have
a<00:01:22.250> lever<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.520> like<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.930> reason<00:01:25.229> you

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
a lever just like this the reason you

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.830 
a lever just like this the reason you
need<00:01:25.470> an<00:01:25.650> inverter<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.310> for<00:01:27.030> usually

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
need an inverter is for usually

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.109 
need an inverter is for usually
situations<00:01:28.500> where<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.490> Signet<00:01:29.850> there

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
situations where you the Signet there

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.010 
situations where you the Signet there
the<00:01:30.869> lever<00:01:31.110> or<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.439> button<00:01:32.540> by<00:01:33.540> default<00:01:33.600> you

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
the lever or the button by default you

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.600 
the lever or the button by default you
don't<00:01:34.200> want<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.530> be<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:34.829> or<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.280> don't<00:01:35.460> want

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
don't want it to be on or you don't want

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.069 
don't want it to be on or you don't want
it<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.759> be<00:01:35.820> off<00:01:36.000> by<00:01:36.240> default<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.720> need<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.960> to

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
it to be off by default you need it to

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.890 
it to be off by default you need it to
be<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.200> opposite<00:01:38.509> sometimes<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.659> can<00:01:39.840> be

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
be the opposite sometimes this can be

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.149 
be the opposite sometimes this can be
the<00:01:40.020> case<00:01:40.229> when<00:01:40.470> you're<00:01:40.680> trying<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.950> use<00:01:41.130> a

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
the case when you're trying to use a

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.670 
the case when you're trying to use a
door<00:01:41.840> maybe<00:01:42.840> because<00:01:43.079> if<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.290> place<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.619> over

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
door maybe because if I place it over

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.219 
door maybe because if I place it over
here<00:01:44.270> you<00:01:45.270> can<00:01:45.390> see<00:01:45.509> now<00:01:45.659> it's<00:01:45.840> powered<00:01:46.020> on

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
here you can see now it's powered on

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.210 
here you can see now it's powered on
it's<00:01:46.470> closed<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:48.560> now<00:01:49.560> I'm<00:01:49.619> powered<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.009> it's

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
it's closed and now I'm powered on it's

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.370 
it's closed and now I'm powered on it's
actually<00:01:50.280> open<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:51.329> by<00:01:51.630> default<00:01:51.840> we<00:01:52.049> want

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
actually open so by default we want

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.620 
actually open so by default we want
because<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.610> leave<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.060> actually<00:01:54.360> switched

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
because this leave is actually switched

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.319 
because this leave is actually switched
on<00:01:55.399> so<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.579> case<00:01:56.790> we<00:01:56.969> don't<00:01:57.090> actually

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
on so in this case we don't actually

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.840 
on so in this case we don't actually
need<00:01:57.630> an<00:01:57.780> inverter<00:01:58.310> however<00:01:59.310> if<00:01:59.490> we<00:01:59.610> wanted

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
need an inverter however if we wanted

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.170 
need an inverter however if we wanted
this<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.930> be<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.740> other<00:02:01.860> way<00:02:02.040> around<00:02:02.180> so

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
this it to be the other way around so

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.999 
this it to be the other way around so
when<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.780> lever<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.170> off<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.680> door<00:02:04.860> is

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
when the lever is off the door is

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.180 
when the lever is off the door is
actually<00:02:05.430> closed<00:02:06.530> we'd<00:02:07.530> all<00:02:07.770> we<00:02:07.890> have<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.069> do

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
actually closed we'd all we have to do

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.710 
actually closed we'd all we have to do
that<00:02:08.310> in<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.489> situation<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:09.300> just<00:02:09.420> go<00:02:09.569> like

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
that in that situation is just go like

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.710 
that in that situation is just go like
that<00:02:09.750> however<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:11.400> purpose<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.790> rápida<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.420> to

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
that however the purpose of rápida is to

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.030 
that however the purpose of rápida is to
simply<00:02:13.260> just<00:02:13.410> invert

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
simply just invert

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.100 
simply just invert
the<00:02:14.220> red<00:02:14.909> sign<00:02:15.090> signal<00:02:15.450> I'm<00:02:15.629> sorry<00:02:15.870> what<00:02:16.019> am<00:02:16.049> i

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
the red sign signal I'm sorry what am i

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.220 
the red sign signal I'm sorry what am i
doing<00:02:17.000> but<00:02:18.000> yes<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.299> can<00:02:18.329> do<00:02:18.629> it<00:02:18.750> just<00:02:19.110> like

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
doing but yes you can do it just like

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.770 
doing but yes you can do it just like
this<00:02:19.439> as<00:02:19.590> well<00:02:19.790> this<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:20.849> a<00:02:20.970> simple<00:02:21.269> version<00:02:21.689> of

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
this as well this is a simple version of

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.660 
this as well this is a simple version of
creating<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.170> repeater<00:02:22.470> with<00:02:23.159> only<00:02:23.370> one<00:02:23.489> block

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
creating a repeater with only one block

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.789 
creating a repeater with only one block
and<00:02:23.909> a<00:02:23.970> torch<00:02:24.209> so<00:02:25.049> you<00:02:25.140> flick<00:02:25.379> that<00:02:25.470> on<00:02:25.620> that

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
and a torch so you flick that on that

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.559 
and a torch so you flick that on that
block<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.159> off<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.489> torch<00:02:26.670> goes<00:02:26.849> off<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.269> it

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
block is off the torch goes off and it

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.089 
block is off the torch goes off and it
goes<00:02:27.689> around<00:02:27.930> like<00:02:28.049> that<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:28.650> basically<00:02:28.769> just

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
goes around like that so basically just

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.630 
goes around like that so basically just
inverse<00:02:29.549> a<00:02:29.730> signal<00:02:30.090> from<00:02:31.010> so<00:02:32.010> each<00:02:32.159> section<00:02:32.489> is

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
inverse a signal from so each section is

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.360 
inverse a signal from so each section is
the<00:02:32.730> opposite<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.390> other<00:02:34.099> now<00:02:35.099> if<00:02:35.250> you're

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
the opposite of the other now if you're

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.339 
the opposite of the other now if you're
not<00:02:35.430> looking<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.760> do<00:02:35.879> this<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.989> want<00:02:37.200> it

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
not looking to do this and you want it

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.020 
not looking to do this and you want it
to<00:02:37.379> and<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.069> want<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.280> repeat<00:02:38.489> it<00:02:38.519> that<00:02:38.760> that's

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
to and you want to repeat it that that's

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.000 
to and you want to repeat it that that's
a<00:02:39.239> that's<00:02:39.569> an<00:02:39.750> inverter<00:02:40.109> if<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:40.799> want<00:02:40.950> to

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
a that's an inverter if you want to

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.869 
a that's an inverter if you want to
repeat<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.489> can<00:02:41.670> do<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:41.819> the

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
repeat it you can do it the

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.089 
repeat it you can do it the
old-fashioned<00:02:42.480> way<00:02:42.510> just<00:02:42.810> just<00:02:43.769> like<00:02:43.859> this

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
old-fashioned way just just like this

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.860 
old-fashioned way just just like this
this<00:02:44.430> will<00:02:44.609> repeat<00:02:44.909> the<00:02:45.000> signal<00:02:45.299> so<00:02:45.420> each<00:02:45.599> side

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
this will repeat the signal so each side

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.490 
this will repeat the signal so each side
has<00:02:46.079> the<00:02:46.290> same<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:47.459> same<00:02:47.870> current<00:02:48.870> state

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
has the same the same current state

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.920 
has the same the same current state
however<00:02:50.489> there's<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.150> much<00:02:51.269> simpler<00:02:51.510> way<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:51.720> do

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
however there's a much simpler way to do

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.879 
however there's a much simpler way to do
that<00:02:52.079> and<00:02:52.230> that<00:02:52.349> that's<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.650> very

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
that and that that's a very

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:54.589 
that and that that's a very
old-fashioned<00:02:53.340> way<00:02:53.459> of<00:02:53.579> doing<00:02:53.790> it<00:02:53.909> the

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
old-fashioned way of doing it the

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.300 
old-fashioned way of doing it the
easiest<00:02:54.930> way<00:02:55.109> of<00:02:55.139> course<00:02:55.500> is<00:02:55.650> using<00:02:55.889> the

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
easiest way of course is using the

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.430 
easiest way of course is using the
repeater<00:02:56.670> block<00:02:56.909> which<00:02:57.750> we<00:02:57.930> can<00:02:58.079> place<00:02:58.230> like

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
repeater block which we can place like

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.920 
repeater block which we can place like
that<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.889> repeats<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.340> signal<00:02:59.670> for<00:02:59.849> us

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
that and that repeats the signal for us

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.869 
that and that repeats the signal for us
because<00:03:00.930> as<00:03:01.079> we<00:03:01.260> know<00:03:01.409> that<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:02.099> little<00:03:02.700> some<00:03:02.849> of

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
because as we know that a little some of

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.580 
because as we know that a little some of
you<00:03:03.000> may<00:03:03.120> not<00:03:03.269> know<00:03:03.329> redstone<00:03:04.109> signals<00:03:04.440> can

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
you may not know redstone signals can

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.220 
you may not know redstone signals can
only<00:03:04.709> travel<00:03:05.010> for<00:03:05.310> 15<00:03:05.760> blocks<00:03:06.060> before<00:03:06.299> they've

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
only travel for 15 blocks before they've

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.780 
only travel for 15 blocks before they've
run<00:03:07.440> out<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.590> powers<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.220> it's<00:03:08.370> not<00:03:08.459> it's<00:03:08.670> not

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
run out of powers so it's not it's not

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.599 
run out of powers so it's not it's not
an<00:03:08.940> infinite<00:03:09.420> distance<00:03:10.139> that<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.829> power<00:03:11.340> can

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
an infinite distance that the power can

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.970 
an infinite distance that the power can
travel<00:03:11.819> as<00:03:12.420> you<00:03:12.569> can<00:03:12.690> see<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:13.079> fades<00:03:13.379> out<00:03:13.560> as<00:03:13.769> it

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
travel as you can see it fades out as it

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.710 
travel as you can see it fades out as it
gets<00:03:14.129> a<00:03:14.340> weaker<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:14.940> weaker<00:03:15.090> until<00:03:15.420> it

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
gets a weaker and weaker until it

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.330 
gets a weaker and weaker until it
eventually<00:03:15.930> just<00:03:16.109> turns<00:03:16.409> off<00:03:16.590> so<00:03:17.190> in<00:03:17.280> a

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
eventually just turns off so in a

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.439 
eventually just turns off so in a
situation<00:03:17.790> like<00:03:17.879> this<00:03:17.970> you<00:03:18.150> might<00:03:18.269> need<00:03:18.389> a

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
situation like this you might need a

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:19.819 
situation like this you might need a
repeater<00:03:18.780> just<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.049> make<00:03:19.139> the<00:03:19.260> wire<00:03:19.440> longer

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
repeater just to make the wire longer

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.830 
repeater just to make the wire longer
and<00:03:20.010> then<00:03:20.489> you<00:03:20.639> can<00:03:20.760> go<00:03:20.849> for<00:03:20.970> another<00:03:21.150> 15<00:03:21.629> block

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
and then you can go for another 15 block

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.559 
and then you can go for another 15 block
before<00:03:22.079> you'll<00:03:22.410> need<00:03:22.620> a<00:03:22.650> repeater<00:03:23.040> again<00:03:23.340> and

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
before you'll need a repeater again and

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.759 
before you'll need a repeater again and
then<00:03:24.569> of<00:03:24.660> course<00:03:24.840> if<00:03:25.049> somewhere<00:03:25.470> along<00:03:25.620> the

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
then of course if somewhere along the

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.460 
then of course if somewhere along the
line<00:03:25.919> you<00:03:26.160> might<00:03:26.910> need<00:03:27.030> an<00:03:27.299> inverter<00:03:27.629> we<00:03:28.349> can

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
line you might need an inverter we can

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.990 
line you might need an inverter we can
just<00:03:28.650> do<00:03:28.769> it<00:03:28.889> simply<00:03:29.099> like<00:03:29.340> this<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:29.760> now<00:03:29.940> the

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
just do it simply like this and now the

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.390 
just do it simply like this and now the
signal<00:03:30.359> is<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.569> opposite<00:03:30.930> of<00:03:31.079> the<00:03:31.919> one<00:03:32.069> we<00:03:32.280> are

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
signal is the opposite of the one we are

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.240 
signal is the opposite of the one we are
sending<00:03:32.609> into<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.230> so<00:03:34.230> that<00:03:34.410> that<00:03:34.590> wraps<00:03:34.980> up

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
sending into it so that that wraps up

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.830 
sending into it so that that wraps up
inverters<00:03:35.910> pretty<00:03:36.090> much<00:03:36.239> inverters<00:03:36.780> and

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
inverters pretty much inverters and

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.289 
inverters pretty much inverters and
repeats<00:03:37.199> in<00:03:37.530> one<00:03:38.099> video<00:03:38.250> here<00:03:38.609> they're<00:03:39.180> pretty

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
repeats in one video here they're pretty

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.020 
repeats in one video here they're pretty
simple<00:03:39.599> stuff<00:03:39.870> really<00:03:40.079> basic<00:03:40.669> we<00:03:41.669> need<00:03:41.819> any

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
simple stuff really basic we need any

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.970 
simple stuff really basic we need any
more<00:03:42.209> explanation<00:03:42.480> just<00:03:43.230> ask<00:03:43.440> me<00:03:43.560> what<00:03:43.739> what

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
more explanation just ask me what what

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.740 
more explanation just ask me what what
the<00:03:44.069> problem<00:03:44.370> is<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:45.209> can<00:03:45.419> maybe<00:03:45.540> make

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
the problem is and I can maybe make

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.080 
the problem is and I can maybe make
another<00:03:45.780> video<00:03:46.230> on<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.410> so<00:03:47.099> for<00:03:47.639> next<00:03:47.760> until

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
another video on that so for next until

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.400 
another video on that so for next until
next<00:03:48.209> time<00:03:48.389> guys<00:03:48.569> I'm<00:03:48.780> finally<00:03:49.049> here<00:03:49.349> and

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
next time guys I'm finally here and

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.799 
next time guys I'm finally here and
thanks<00:03:49.680> for<00:03:49.739> watching
