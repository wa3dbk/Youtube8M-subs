okay put on my handy dandy play here one
thing<00:03:07.430> I<00:03:07.549> failed<00:03:07.879> to<00:03:08.000> mention<00:03:08.120> is<00:03:09.340> that<00:03:10.340> it

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
thing I failed to mention is that it

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.399 
thing I failed to mention is that it
comes<00:03:10.700> with<00:03:10.790> a<00:03:10.970> special<00:03:11.360> sauce<00:03:13.540> some<00:03:14.540> burger

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:15.409 
comes with a special sauce some burger

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:20.849 
comes with a special sauce some burger
sauce<00:03:15.739> I<00:03:17.049> don't<00:03:18.049> know<00:03:18.110> how<00:03:18.230> feel<00:03:18.560> about<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:18.980> yet

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
sauce I don't know how feel about it yet

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:24.569 
sauce I don't know how feel about it yet
in<00:03:21.859> terms<00:03:22.579> does<00:03:23.060> it<00:03:23.180> taste<00:03:23.420> like<00:03:23.569> a<00:03:23.720> burger

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
in terms does it taste like a burger

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:43.050 
in terms does it taste like a burger
kind<00:03:25.579> of<00:03:26.290> it's<00:03:27.290> hard<00:03:27.500> to<00:03:27.680> really<00:03:27.950> describe<00:03:28.489> me

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.149 

so<00:03:44.060> it's<00:03:44.209> almost<00:03:44.480> as<00:03:44.659> if<00:03:44.689> the<00:03:45.079> sauce<00:03:45.560> is<00:03:45.860> trying

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 
so it's almost as if the sauce is trying

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:51.399 
so it's almost as if the sauce is trying
to<00:03:46.250> emulate<00:03:47.829> what<00:03:48.829> a<00:03:48.890> mashed<00:03:49.280> up<00:03:50.409> cheeseburger

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:51.409 
to emulate what a mashed up cheeseburger

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:53.649 
to emulate what a mashed up cheeseburger
in<00:03:51.530> your<00:03:51.680> mouth<00:03:51.829> would<00:03:52.129> taste<00:03:52.340> like<00:03:52.659> not

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:53.659 
in your mouth would taste like not

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:56.110 
in your mouth would taste like not
necessarily<00:03:54.049> individual<00:03:54.769> flavors<00:03:55.040> like<00:03:55.909> they

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
necessarily individual flavors like they

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.860 
necessarily individual flavors like they
have<00:03:56.299> maybe<00:03:56.510> for<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:56.810> toppings<00:03:57.319> but<00:03:58.310> the

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
have maybe for the toppings but the

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.390 
have maybe for the toppings but the
individual<00:03:59.870> like<00:04:00.530> I<00:04:00.680> but<00:04:00.829> not<00:04:00.950> that<00:04:01.069> I<00:04:01.129> mean

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
individual like I but not that I mean

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.780 
individual like I but not that I mean
the<00:04:02.000> conglomerate<00:04:02.870> if<00:04:03.170> you<00:04:03.290> will<00:04:03.760> flavors<00:04:04.760> of

the<00:04:05.480> cheeseburger<00:04:06.019> matched<00:04:06.409> up<00:04:06.650> together

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
the cheeseburger matched up together

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.839 
the cheeseburger matched up together
pureed<00:04:07.670> in<00:04:07.970> a<00:04:08.120> sauce<00:04:08.920> that's<00:04:09.920> their<00:04:10.400> special

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
pureed in a sauce that's their special

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
burger sauce I don't know what comes in

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.160 
burger sauce I don't know what comes in
it<00:04:12.950> I<00:04:13.670> kind<00:04:14.239> of<00:04:14.269> want<00:04:14.450> to<00:04:14.510> try<00:04:14.629> another<00:04:14.689> slice

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
it I kind of want to try another slice

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.900 
it I kind of want to try another slice
because<00:04:15.560> there's<00:04:15.709> a<00:04:15.769> big<00:04:15.920> old<00:04:16.070> glob<00:04:16.430> in<00:04:16.699> one<00:04:16.880> of

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
because there's a big old glob in one of

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.539 
because there's a big old glob in one of
these<00:04:17.060> so<00:04:17.389> I<00:04:17.419> kind<00:04:17.750> of<00:04:17.780> want<00:04:17.930> to<00:04:18.039> see<00:04:19.039> you<00:04:19.430> know

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.930 

that's<00:07:09.530> why<00:07:09.680> i<00:07:09.710> mean<00:07:09.979> it<00:07:10.190> that's<00:07:10.430> not<00:07:10.520> a<00:07:10.610> bad

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940 
that's why i mean it that's not a bad

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.790 
that's why i mean it that's not a bad
rating<00:07:11.240> but<00:07:11.509> it's<00:07:11.659> not<00:07:11.780> big<00:07:11.960> spectacular<00:07:12.470> i

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 
rating but it's not big spectacular i

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.240 
rating but it's not big spectacular i
mean<00:07:12.979> it's<00:07:13.130> better<00:07:13.460> than<00:07:13.759> average<00:07:14.120> and<00:07:14.599> my

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.250 
mean it's better than average and my

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:20.230 
mean it's better than average and my
scale<00:07:16.250> if<00:07:16.909> you<00:07:17.090> will<00:07:17.800> but<00:07:18.800> I<00:07:18.860> mean<00:07:19.280> a<00:07:19.490> very<00:07:20.060> high

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 
scale if you will but I mean a very high

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.719 
scale if you will but I mean a very high
standard<00:07:20.300> so<00:07:20.990> rarely<00:07:21.530> anything<00:07:21.949> gets<00:07:22.340> a<00:07:22.460> nine

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:22.729 
standard so rarely anything gets a nine

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:28.899 
standard so rarely anything gets a nine
and<00:07:25.599> most<00:07:26.599> things<00:07:26.870> get<00:07:27.200> a<00:07:27.469> five<00:07:28.159> or<00:07:28.190> around

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:28.909 
and most things get a five or around

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:29.900 
and most things get a five or around
that

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:29.910 
that

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.350 
that
and<00:07:31.400> you<00:07:32.400> know<00:07:32.490> if<00:07:32.550> you<00:07:32.640> get<00:07:32.730> above<00:07:32.940> a<00:07:33.060> six

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360 
and you know if you get above a six

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.670 
and you know if you get above a six
you're<00:07:34.350> doing<00:07:34.560> okay<00:07:34.920> so<00:07:35.910> that's<00:07:36.060> what<00:07:36.210> it<00:07:36.240> gets

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:36.680
