I don't think that we thought that we

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.850 
I don't think that we thought that we
wonder<00:00:44.219> all<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:45.000> match<00:00:45.270> but<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:46.559> was<00:00:46.710> in

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
throne yeah of course but I think that a

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.020 
throne yeah of course but I think that a
lot<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.180> Ukrainian<00:01:12.950> like<00:01:13.950> fanatic<00:01:14.670> because

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
lot of Ukrainian like fanatic because

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.510 
lot of Ukrainian like fanatic because
they're<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.570> local<00:01:16.259> team<00:01:17.540> so<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.570> think<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:19.520> think

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
they're a local team so I think I think

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.219 
they're a local team so I think I think
the<00:01:20.610> crowd<00:01:20.820> will<00:01:21.030> will<00:01:21.360> cheer<00:01:21.659> from<00:01:21.780> fanatic

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
the crowd will will cheer from fanatic

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.670 
the crowd will will cheer from fanatic
and<00:01:22.610> maybe<00:01:23.610> because<00:01:23.970> they<00:01:24.210> probably<00:01:25.080> feel<00:01:25.290> sub

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
and maybe because they probably feel sub

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.620 
and maybe because they probably feel sub
feel<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> bit<00:01:26.130> sorry<00:01:26.310> for<00:01:26.580> them<00:01:26.729> for<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.330> oldest
