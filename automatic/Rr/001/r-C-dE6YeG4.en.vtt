deserve<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.399> video<00:00:35.760> let's<00:00:36.360> get<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.660> out<00:00:36.780> let's

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
deserve a video let's get it out let's

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.540 
deserve a video let's get it out let's
use<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:37.620> in<00:00:37.739> my<00:00:37.860> right<00:00:38.070> hand<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.370> have<00:00:38.460> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
use it so in my right hand we have the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.880 
use it so in my right hand we have the
tungsten<00:00:38.760> carbide<00:00:39.149> striker<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:40.110> my<00:00:40.500> left<00:00:40.710> hand

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
tungsten carbide striker in my left hand

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.380 
tungsten carbide striker in my left hand
we<00:00:41.070> have<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> fire<00:00:41.550> still<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.059> believe<00:00:42.270> this

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
we have a fire still and I believe this

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.479 
we have a fire still and I believe this
is<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.629> army<00:00:43.019> version<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.769> is<00:00:43.949> very<00:00:44.309> very

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
is the army version this is very very

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.729 
is the army version this is very very
good<00:00:44.609> size<00:00:44.940> indeed<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:46.109> why<00:00:46.320> don't<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:46.530> put

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
good size indeed so why don't we put

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.020 
good size indeed so why don't we put
these<00:00:46.859> two<00:00:47.070> together<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.489> see<00:00:47.820> what<00:00:47.969> happens

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
these two together and see what happens

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.709 
these two together and see what happens
so<00:00:48.600> we<00:00:48.989> have<00:00:49.109> the<00:00:49.469> striker<00:00:49.769> we<00:00:50.519> have<00:00:50.670> our<00:00:50.879> fire

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
so we have the striker we have our fire

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.529 
so we have the striker we have our fire
still<00:00:52.879> 45<00:00:53.879> degrees

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
still 45 degrees

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.410 
still 45 degrees
look<00:00:55.409> at<00:00:55.620> those<00:00:55.829> sparks<00:00:56.339> guys<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:57.210> put<00:00:57.359> a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
look at those sparks guys you put a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.250 
look at those sparks guys you put a
little<00:00:57.600> bit<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.809> pressure<00:00:58.050> on<00:00:58.170> it<00:01:00.109> there's<00:01:01.109> are

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
little bit of pressure on it there's are

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.590 
little bit of pressure on it there's are
some<00:01:01.289> big<00:01:01.800> chunks<00:01:02.429> right<00:01:02.729> there<00:01:02.999> so<00:01:03.329> let's<00:01:03.359> go

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
some big chunks right there so let's go

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.219 
some big chunks right there so let's go
ahead<00:01:03.659> and<00:01:03.749> do<00:01:03.870> this

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
ahead and do this

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.980 
ahead and do this
remember<00:01:04.650> 45-degree<00:01:05.640> angle<00:01:06.150> put<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.690> little

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
remember 45-degree angle put a little

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.300 
remember 45-degree angle put a little
bit<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.229> pressure<00:01:07.440> on<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.070> it'll<00:01:08.159> throw

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
bit of pressure on it in and it'll throw

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.649 
bit of pressure on it in and it'll throw
those<00:01:08.490> big<00:01:08.760> slivers<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.930> let's<00:01:10.290> do<00:01:10.440> this<00:01:14.659> as

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
those big slivers so let's do this as

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.130 
those big slivers so let's do this as
you<00:01:15.719> can<00:01:15.780> see<00:01:15.869> that's<00:01:16.110> burning<00:01:16.530> away<00:01:18.020> let's<00:01:19.020> go

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
you can see that's burning away let's go

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.270 
you can see that's burning away let's go
ahead<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.350> do<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.500> one<00:01:19.619> more<00:01:19.799> time<00:01:19.829> that's

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
ahead and do that one more time that's

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.149 
ahead and do that one more time that's
first<00:01:20.640> strike<00:01:20.700> let's<00:01:21.119> do<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.360> again

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:36.790 

again<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.759> burning<00:01:29.719> let's<00:01:30.719> do<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.960> again

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:45.470 

let's<00:01:37.800> do<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.100> one<00:01:38.340> more<00:01:38.490> time<00:01:38.550> so<00:01:44.390> there<00:01:45.390> you

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 
let's do that one more time so there you

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.800 
let's do that one more time so there you
go

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
go

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.620 
go
as<00:01:46.190> you<00:01:47.190> can<00:01:47.280> see<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.640> works<00:01:47.820> incredibly

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
as you can see that works incredibly

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.800 
as you can see that works incredibly
well<00:01:49.280> now<00:01:50.280> as<00:01:50.460> we<00:01:50.670> saw<00:01:50.850> there<00:01:51.120> the<00:01:51.330> tungsten

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
well now as we saw there the tungsten

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.020 
well now as we saw there the tungsten
carbide<00:01:52.140> striker<00:01:52.560> did<00:01:52.800> a<00:01:52.830> fantastic<00:01:53.130> job<00:01:53.970> with

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
carbide striker did a fantastic job with

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.840 
carbide striker did a fantastic job with
that<00:01:54.300> fire<00:01:54.720> still<00:01:55.080> this<00:01:56.010> is<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> very<00:01:56.580> nice

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
that fire still this is a very nice

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
key to the whole thing certainly once I

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.480 
key to the whole thing certainly once I
get<00:02:03.390> done<00:02:03.510> with<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.840> rod<00:02:04.050> I<00:02:04.350> may<00:02:05.160> take<00:02:05.370> this

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490

get done with this rod I may take this
striker<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.090> put<00:02:06.330> it<00:02:06.420> with<00:02:06.540> another<00:02:06.870> heck<00:02:07.590> I

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
striker and put it with another heck I

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.950 
striker and put it with another heck I
might<00:02:07.830> do<00:02:07.980> that<00:02:08.040> even<00:02:08.310> before<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:09.450> runs<00:02:09.780> out

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
might do that even before this runs out
