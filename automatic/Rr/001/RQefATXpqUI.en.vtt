00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.859 
up with a really simple test in
Australia<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.549> average<00:01:38.909> car<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.390> owned<00:01:39.600> for

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
Australia the average car is owned for

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.380 
Australia the average car is owned for
about<00:01:40.079> nine<00:01:40.380> point<00:01:40.770> three<00:01:40.950> years<00:01:41.520> yeah<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.180> we

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
about nine point three years yeah so we

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.630 
about nine point three years yeah so we
decided<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.990> put<00:01:43.259> nine<00:01:43.799> point<00:01:44.130> three<00:01:44.250> years

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
decided to put nine point three years

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.750 
decided to put nine point three years
worth<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:45.030> wear<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.299> tear<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.020> test

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
worth of wear and tear to the test

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.560 
worth of wear and tear to the test
