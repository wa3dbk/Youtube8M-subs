but to be honest it trust me just take

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.590 
but to be honest it trust me just take
it<00:02:30.740> from<00:02:30.830> my<00:02:31.040> point<00:02:31.280> of<00:02:31.490> view<00:02:31.550> it's<00:02:32.180> beyond<00:02:32.480> see

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
it from my point of view it's beyond see

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.510 
it from my point of view it's beyond see
it<00:02:32.690> make<00:02:32.900> more<00:02:33.080> sense<00:02:33.140> if<00:02:33.500> Rockstar<00:02:33.980> Gables<00:02:34.370> 1

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520

million dollars to spend on ourselves

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.690 
million dollars to spend on ourselves
but<00:02:36.170> obviously<00:02:36.440> that's<00:02:36.650> not<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:36.980> case<00:02:37.160> but

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
but obviously that's not the case but
