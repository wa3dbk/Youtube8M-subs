here she is the dirty diesel smears
I<00:00:12.570> got<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.559> battery<00:00:13.830> charger<00:00:14.190> on<00:00:14.309> her<00:00:14.400> right<00:00:14.549> now

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
I got a battery charger on her right now

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.980 
I got a battery charger on her right now
just<00:00:15.000> trying<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.240> top<00:00:15.420> up<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.690> battery

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
just trying to top up the battery

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.510 
just trying to top up the battery

 things I hate these things
they<00:00:39.660> don't<00:00:39.870> thread<00:00:40.170> properly<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:41.129> is

they don't thread properly this is

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.030 
they don't thread properly this is
literally<00:00:41.610> like<00:00:41.790> five<00:00:42.780> layers<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.500> plastic

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
literally like five layers of plastic

the<00:00:47.670> cap<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.629> only<00:00:48.840> thing<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.170> actually

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
the cap is the only thing that actually

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.900 
the cap is the only thing that actually
keeps<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.770> fuel<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.340> caps<00:00:50.550> from<00:00:50.640> just

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
keeps the fuel and the caps from just

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.459 
keeps the fuel and the caps from just
flying<00:00:51.149> off<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.660> putting<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.020> little<00:00:52.199> bit<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.379> a

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
flying off is putting a little bit of a

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.130 
flying off is putting a little bit of a
shim<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.829> there<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.579> long<00:00:54.449> term<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.840> think<00:00:54.870> I'm

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
shim in there so long term I think I'm

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.470 
shim in there so long term I think I'm
getting<00:00:55.350> rid<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.680> fuel<00:00:55.890> tank<00:00:56.129> and

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
getting rid of this fuel tank and

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.729 
getting rid of this fuel tank and
mounting<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.570> somewhere<00:00:57.870> else<00:00:57.930> with<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.469> better

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
mounting it somewhere else with a better

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.920 
mounting it somewhere else with a better
fuel<00:00:58.980> tank<00:00:59.190> with<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.340> better<00:00:59.520> cap<00:00:59.930> that's

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
fuel tank with a better cap that's

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:15.520 
fuel tank with a better cap that's
project<00:01:01.379> for<00:01:01.500> another<00:01:01.590> day

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.390 

see<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:16.800> remember<00:01:16.950> how<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.190> do<00:01:17.370> this

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
see if I can remember how to do this

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.670 
see if I can remember how to do this
there's<00:01:18.360> an<00:01:18.480> actual<00:01:18.720> process<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.350> starting

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
there's an actual process to starting

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.090 
there's an actual process to starting
these<00:01:19.770> Diesel's<00:01:21.050> you<00:01:22.050> got<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.320> pull<00:01:22.770> them<00:01:22.860> over

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
these Diesel's you got to pull them over

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.560 
these Diesel's you got to pull them over
to<00:01:23.160> the<00:01:23.220> compression<00:01:23.700> stroke<00:01:26.570> which

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
to the compression stroke which

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.510 
to the compression stroke which
basically<00:01:27.900> means<00:01:28.200> pull<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.070> cord<00:01:29.310> till<00:01:29.460> you

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
basically means pull the cord till you

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.490 
basically means pull the cord till you
can't<00:01:29.730> pull<00:01:29.910> it<00:01:29.940> no<00:01:30.060> more<00:01:30.380> hit<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
can't pull it no more hit the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.890 
can't pull it no more hit the
compression<00:01:31.950> release<00:01:32.360> make<00:01:33.360> sure<00:01:33.510> the<00:01:33.600> fuels

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
compression release make sure the fuels

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
compression release make sure the fuels
on<00:01:34.370> and<00:01:35.370> then<00:01:35.760> I<00:01:36.320> should<00:01:37.320> probably<00:01:37.350> find<00:01:37.800> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
on and then I should probably find the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:47.780 
on and then I should probably find the
keys<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.490> then<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.510> can<00:01:39.660> use<00:01:39.690> a<00:01:39.780> glow<00:01:39.990> plug<00:01:46.790> well

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
keys and then I can use a glow plug well

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.980 
keys and then I can use a glow plug well
it's<00:01:47.910> been<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> while<00:01:48.240> since<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.510> sat<00:01:48.720> on<00:01:48.900> this

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
it's been a while since I sat on this

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.250 
it's been a while since I sat on this
thing<00:01:51.170> so<00:01:52.170> if<00:01:52.230> we<00:01:52.290> got<00:01:52.470> power<00:01:53.900> how<00:01:54.900> much<00:01:55.080> I<00:01:55.200> do

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
thing so if we got power how much I do

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.610 
thing so if we got power how much I do
not<00:01:55.470> know<00:01:59.510> 10<00:02:00.510> seconds<00:02:00.900> on<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.080> glow<00:02:01.260> plug<00:02:01.470> I

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
not know 10 seconds on the glow plug I

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:18.260 
not know 10 seconds on the glow plug I
think<00:02:01.830> we'll<00:02:01.950> do<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.510> it<00:02:03.510> goes<00:02:15.770> nope<00:02:17.270> battery's

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
think we'll do it it goes nope battery's

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.680 
think we'll do it it goes nope battery's
not<00:02:18.300> going<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.660> let<00:02:18.780> me<00:02:20.239> thought<00:02:21.239> I<00:02:21.270> was<00:02:21.480> doing

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
not going to let me thought I was doing

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.510 
not going to let me thought I was doing
myself<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:22.140> favor<00:02:22.170> by<00:02:22.650> buying<00:02:23.160> one<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.400> these

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
myself a favor by buying one of these

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.120 
myself a favor by buying one of these
