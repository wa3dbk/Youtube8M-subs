it and I'm just going to hold it in the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.340 
it and I'm just going to hold it in the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
yeah I think it's really important it

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.569 
yeah I think it's really important it
helps<00:02:03.000> make<00:02:03.869> sure<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.290> your<00:02:04.469> ribbons<00:02:05.310> are

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
helps make sure that your ribbons are

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.789 
helps make sure that your ribbons are
the<00:02:05.880> right<00:02:06.060> length<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.960> then<00:02:07.469> I'm<00:02:07.560> just<00:02:07.619> going

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
the right length so then I'm just going

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.760 
the right length so then I'm just going
to<00:02:07.829> fold<00:02:08.069> put<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.700> over<00:02:09.030> top<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:10.440> base

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
to fold put that over top of the base

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.589 
to fold put that over top of the base
and<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.280> it's<00:02:11.400> got<00:02:11.550> kind<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.180> they<00:02:12.270> look<00:02:12.420> like<00:02:12.540> a

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
and so it's got kind of they look like a

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.770 
and so it's got kind of they look like a
bow

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.250 
so I'm just going to make it a little
pretty<00:04:11.769> try<00:04:12.130> to<00:04:12.359> even<00:04:13.359> it<00:04:13.480> out<00:04:13.630> a<00:04:13.690> little<00:04:13.989> more

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
pretty try to even it out a little more

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.449 
pretty try to even it out a little more
stretch<00:04:14.560> it<00:04:14.680> out<00:04:14.739> make<00:04:14.950> sure<00:04:14.980> it's<00:04:15.220> nice<00:04:15.430> and

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
stretch it out make sure it's nice and

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.330 
stretch it out make sure it's nice and
then<00:04:16.269> I'm<00:04:16.479> just<00:04:16.720> going<00:04:16.900> to<00:04:16.989> I<00:04:17.380> just<00:04:17.919> eyeball<00:04:18.310> it

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
then I'm just going to I just eyeball it

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.430 
then I'm just going to I just eyeball it
I'm<00:04:18.789> just<00:04:19.209> going<00:04:19.390> to<00:04:19.979> roughly<00:04:20.979> cut<00:04:22.050> well<00:04:23.050> trim

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
I'm just going to roughly cut well trim

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.879 
I'm just going to roughly cut well trim
I<00:04:23.620> guess<00:04:25.140> my<00:04:26.140> bow

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
I guess my bow

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.339 
I guess my bow
so<00:04:27.039> it<00:04:27.460> is<00:04:27.759> the<00:04:28.120> exact<00:04:28.449> same<00:04:28.689> length<00:04:28.750> as<00:04:29.080> the

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:29.349 
so it is the exact same length as the

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:32.129 
so it is the exact same length as the
other<00:04:29.379> end<00:04:29.830> now<00:04:30.099> that<00:04:30.729> they're<00:04:31.120> basically<00:04:31.930> the

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
other end now that they're basically the

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.800 
other end now that they're basically the
exact<00:04:32.500> same<00:04:32.740> length<00:04:33.189> and<00:04:33.580> sure<00:04:34.509> I<00:04:34.539> don't<00:04:34.689> need

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
exact same length and sure I don't need

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.129 
exact same length and sure I don't need
to<00:04:34.900> make<00:04:34.960> any<00:04:35.169> other<00:04:35.289> alterations<00:04:35.919> I'm<00:04:36.189> just

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
to make any other alterations I'm just

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:43.200 
to make any other alterations I'm just
going<00:04:38.139> to<00:04:40.590> cut<00:04:41.590> my<00:04:41.770> zip<00:04:42.009> tie<00:04:42.250> because<00:04:42.639> it<00:04:42.939> still

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
going to cut my zip tie because it still

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.570 
going to cut my zip tie because it still
has<00:04:43.389> that<00:04:43.419> little<00:04:43.930> hang<00:04:44.139> as<00:04:44.469> close<00:04:45.009> to<00:04:45.400> them

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
has that little hang as close to them

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.339 
has that little hang as close to them
not<00:04:45.729> as<00:04:46.569> I<00:04:46.780> can

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:47.349 
not as I can

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:49.770 
not as I can
so<00:04:47.949> that's<00:04:48.159> leftover<00:04:48.639> I<00:04:48.789> have<00:04:48.969> and<00:04:49.210> now<00:04:49.719> you

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
so that's leftover I have and now you

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.300 
so that's leftover I have and now you
can't<00:04:50.199> really<00:04:50.319> sum<00:04:50.500> it<00:04:50.560> up<00:04:50.740> tie<00:04:51.180> so<00:04:53.099> next<00:04:54.099> and

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
can't really sum it up tie so next and

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.490 
can't really sum it up tie so next and
last<00:04:54.669> thing<00:04:54.969> I'm<00:04:55.120> going<00:04:55.300> to<00:04:55.389> do<00:04:56.009> is<00:04:58.379> make<00:04:59.379> the

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
last thing I'm going to do is make the

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.170 
last thing I'm going to do is make the
ends<00:04:59.710> into<00:04:59.830> fish<00:05:00.039> tails<00:05:00.340> now<00:05:00.819> you<00:05:00.879> may<00:05:01.150> be

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
ends into fish tails now you may be

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.700 
ends into fish tails now you may be
thinking<00:05:01.270> wait<00:05:01.779> you<00:05:02.020> didn't<00:05:02.259> cover<00:05:02.349> the<00:05:02.529> zip

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
thinking wait you didn't cover the zip

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.830 
thinking wait you didn't cover the zip
tie<00:05:02.889> and<00:05:03.250> that<00:05:03.669> is<00:05:03.849> because<00:05:04.210> this<00:05:04.360> is<00:05:04.539> a<00:05:04.569> clear

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
tie and that is because this is a clear

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.140 
tie and that is because this is a clear
zip<00:05:05.050> tie<00:05:05.229> it's<00:05:05.529> not<00:05:05.710> really<00:05:05.919> obvious<00:05:06.069> as<00:05:06.550> you

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
zip tie it's not really obvious as you

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.129 
zip tie it's not really obvious as you
can<00:05:07.300> see<00:05:07.569> in<00:05:07.870> the<00:05:08.560> bow<00:05:08.770> I'm<00:05:09.099> wearing<00:05:09.870> you<00:05:10.870> can't

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
can see in the bow I'm wearing you can't

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.709 
can see in the bow I'm wearing you can't
really<00:05:11.349> see<00:05:11.590> the<00:05:11.710> zip<00:05:11.889> title<00:05:12.310> hold<00:05:12.550> and<00:05:12.789> but

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:13.719 
really see the zip title hold and but

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:15.839 
really see the zip title hold and but
and<00:05:13.960> this<00:05:14.469> is<00:05:14.529> supposed<00:05:14.979> to<00:05:15.039> be<00:05:15.129> no<00:05:15.310> glue<00:05:15.550> and

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
and this is supposed to be no glue and

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.230 
and this is supposed to be no glue and
you<00:05:15.969> can't<00:05:16.240> add<00:05:16.419> a<00:05:16.449> center<00:05:16.840> with<00:05:17.020> no<00:05:17.199> glue<00:05:18.240> so

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
you can't add a center with no glue so

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.360 
you can't add a center with no glue so
that<00:05:19.689> is<00:05:19.930> why<00:05:20.139> I'm<00:05:20.349> kind<00:05:20.710> of<00:05:20.770> stopping<00:05:21.189> there

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
that is why I'm kind of stopping there

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.309 
that is why I'm kind of stopping there
but<00:05:21.580> if<00:05:21.729> you<00:05:21.909> want<00:05:24.779> to<00:05:25.779> put<00:05:25.960> a<00:05:25.990> Center<00:05:26.289> in

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:26.319 
but if you want to put a Center in

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:29.309 
but if you want to put a Center in
you're<00:05:26.620> going<00:05:26.800> to<00:05:26.919> glue<00:05:27.300> so<00:05:28.300> the<00:05:28.930> next<00:05:29.139> thing

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
you're going to glue so the next thing

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.099 
inch up cut my fish tail now people say

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:47.339 
inch up cut my fish tail now people say
don't<00:05:45.490> cut<00:05:45.819> from<00:05:46.089> the<00:05:46.240> inside<00:05:46.629> out<00:05:46.839> but<00:05:47.169> I

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:47.349 
don't cut from the inside out but I

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:48.719 
don't cut from the inside out but I
think<00:05:47.620> it<00:05:47.710> really<00:05:47.860> doesn't<00:05:48.129> matter<00:05:48.219> because<00:05:48.550> I

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
think it really doesn't matter because I

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:50.640 
think it really doesn't matter because I
do<00:05:48.879> it<00:05:49.060> all<00:05:49.150> the<00:05:49.180> time<00:05:49.270> and<00:05:49.719> nothing<00:05:50.169> happens

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
do it all the time and nothing happens

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.059 
do it all the time and nothing happens
but<00:05:51.270> and<00:05:52.270> it's<00:05:53.020> just<00:05:53.229> easier<00:05:53.529> for<00:05:53.560> me<00:05:53.770> but<00:05:53.919> what

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:54.069 
but and it's just easier for me but what

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:56.399 
but and it's just easier for me but what
I<00:05:54.099> do<00:05:54.219> is<00:05:54.669> I<00:05:54.940> to<00:05:55.599> make<00:05:55.750> sure<00:05:55.870> that<00:05:55.990> the<00:05:56.110> ends

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:56.409 
I do is I to make sure that the ends

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:59.429 
I do is I to make sure that the ends
have<00:05:56.560> the<00:05:56.650> exact<00:05:57.009> same<00:05:57.129> DEF<00:05:58.089> cut<00:05:58.629> in<00:05:58.779> indent<00:05:59.319> a

00:05:59.429 --> 00:05:59.439 
have the exact same DEF cut in indent a

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:02.129 
have the exact same DEF cut in indent a
fish<00:05:59.650> tail<00:05:59.860> I<00:05:59.889> guess<00:06:00.189> I<00:06:00.400> just<00:06:01.060> line<00:06:01.449> up<00:06:01.479> the<00:06:01.930> old

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:02.139 
fish tail I guess I just line up the old

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:05.369 
fish tail I guess I just line up the old
piece<00:06:02.379> of<00:06:02.529> fabric<00:06:02.740> with<00:06:03.099> it<00:06:03.279> and<00:06:03.930> do<00:06:04.930> a<00:06:04.960> little

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:05.379 
piece of fabric with it and do a little

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:07.709 
piece of fabric with it and do a little
snip<00:06:05.740> just<00:06:06.550> so<00:06:06.639> that<00:06:06.759> I<00:06:06.789> know<00:06:06.879> exactly<00:06:07.000> where

00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:07.719 
snip just so that I know exactly where

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:11.939 
snip just so that I know exactly where
to<00:06:08.020> start<00:06:08.800> cutting<00:06:09.370> and<00:06:10.020> line<00:06:11.020> it<00:06:11.050> up<00:06:11.289> and<00:06:11.589> I

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:11.949 
to start cutting and line it up and I

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:19.350 
to start cutting and line it up and I
cut<00:06:12.159> a<00:06:12.189> fish<00:06:12.400> tail<00:06:17.490> perfect<00:06:18.490> now<00:06:18.879> that<00:06:19.089> I<00:06:19.120> have

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
cut a fish tail perfect now that I have

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.329 
cut a fish tail perfect now that I have
my<00:06:19.509> fish<00:06:19.719> tail<00:06:19.990> and<00:06:20.199> that<00:06:20.439> is<00:06:20.680> the<00:06:20.860> front<00:06:21.099> of<00:06:21.310> my

00:06:21.329 --> 00:06:21.339 
my fish tail and that is the front of my

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:26.459 
my fish tail and that is the front of my
bow<00:06:23.069> this<00:06:24.069> is<00:06:24.250> where<00:06:24.430> the<00:06:24.610> liner<00:06:24.909> comes<00:06:25.389> in<00:06:25.689> it

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:26.469 
bow this is where the liner comes in it

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:27.959 
bow this is where the liner comes in it
would<00:06:26.650> suck<00:06:26.979> if<00:06:27.009> you<00:06:27.219> have<00:06:27.430> this<00:06:27.520> perfectly

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:27.969 
would suck if you have this perfectly

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:31.439 
would suck if you have this perfectly
adorable<00:06:28.419> bow<00:06:28.839> and<00:06:29.289> then<00:06:29.759> it<00:06:30.759> started<00:06:31.089> fraying

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:31.449 
adorable bow and then it started fraying

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:33.209 
adorable bow and then it started fraying
and<00:06:31.900> you<00:06:32.199> have<00:06:32.469> to<00:06:32.589> replace<00:06:32.800> the<00:06:32.949> ribbon

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:33.219 
and you have to replace the ribbon

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:35.040 
and you have to replace the ribbon
therefore<00:06:33.669> you<00:06:33.849> need<00:06:34.029> a<00:06:34.089> new<00:06:34.270> elastic<00:06:34.539> and<00:06:34.990> you

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.050 
therefore you need a new elastic and you

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.439 
therefore you need a new elastic and you
meet<00:06:35.199> the<00:06:35.259> zip<00:06:35.620> tie<00:06:35.800> and<00:06:35.830> everything<00:06:36.089> so<00:06:37.089> just

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:37.449 
meet the zip tie and everything so just

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:39.420 
meet the zip tie and everything so just
to<00:06:38.020> save<00:06:38.259> the<00:06:38.409> ends<00:06:38.680> from<00:06:38.800> getting<00:06:39.069> all<00:06:39.190> weird

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
to save the ends from getting all weird

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.230 
to save the ends from getting all weird
you're<00:06:39.759> just<00:06:39.880> going<00:06:40.000> to

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
you're just going to

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.930 
you're just going to
you're<00:06:40.419> lighter<00:06:40.599> and<00:06:43.229> softly<00:06:44.370> run<00:06:45.370> over<00:06:45.849> the

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:45.940 
you're lighter and softly run over the

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.879 
you're lighter and softly run over the
edges<00:06:46.360> you<00:06:46.509> don't<00:06:46.660> want<00:06:46.780> to<00:06:46.840> run<00:06:46.930> over<00:06:47.050> it<00:06:47.259> too

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:47.889 
edges you don't want to run over it too

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:50.879 
edges you don't want to run over it too
long<00:06:48.160> otherwise<00:06:49.050> you<00:06:50.050> will<00:06:50.199> find<00:06:50.530> that<00:06:50.740> you're

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:50.889 
long otherwise you will find that you're

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:55.010 
long otherwise you will find that you're
burning<00:06:51.370> your<00:06:51.400> beau<00:06:51.729> and<00:06:53.400> it'll<00:06:54.400> turn<00:06:54.580> black

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020 
burning your beau and it'll turn black

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.029 
burning your beau and it'll turn black
so<00:06:56.020> as<00:06:56.169> you<00:06:56.319> can<00:06:56.440> see<00:06:56.500> it's<00:06:56.770> starting<00:06:57.009> to

00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:57.039 
so as you can see it's starting to

00:06:57.039 --> 00:06:58.770 
so as you can see it's starting to
darken<00:06:57.370> a<00:06:57.610> little<00:06:57.819> bit<00:06:57.940> there<00:06:58.180> because<00:06:58.509> I<00:06:58.539> went

00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:58.780 
darken a little bit there because I went

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.839 
darken a little bit there because I went
a<00:06:58.840> little<00:06:58.870> too<00:06:59.169> long<00:06:59.349> but<00:06:59.650> I<00:07:00.310> mean<00:07:00.550> that

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:00.849 
a little too long but I mean that

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:03.120 
a little too long but I mean that
obviously<00:07:01.270> happens<00:07:01.780> but<00:07:02.139> you<00:07:02.440> just<00:07:02.979> don't

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.130 
obviously happens but you just don't

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.080 
obviously happens but you just don't
want<00:07:03.250> to<00:07:03.280> hold<00:07:03.400> it<00:07:03.520> there<00:07:03.580> too<00:07:03.819> long<00:07:03.940> otherwise

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:04.090 
want to hold it there too long otherwise

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.740 
want to hold it there too long otherwise
it'll<00:07:04.449> end<00:07:04.599> bla<00:07:04.810> end<00:07:05.020> up<00:07:05.139> black<00:07:05.349> so<00:07:05.650> I<00:07:06.750> don't

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:07.750 
it'll end bla end up black so I don't

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.689 
it'll end bla end up black so I don't
think<00:07:07.930> I<00:07:07.990> went<00:07:08.139> over<00:07:08.349> long<00:07:08.830> enough<00:07:09.069> personally

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:09.699 
think I went over long enough personally

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:12.089 
think I went over long enough personally
so<00:07:10.479> and<00:07:10.780> I<00:07:10.930> really<00:07:10.960> just<00:07:11.289> don't<00:07:11.740> want<00:07:11.949> this<00:07:12.039> to

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:12.099

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 
it really lightly and a little bit more

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.390 
it really lightly and a little bit more
until<00:07:16.300> the<00:07:16.690> edges<00:07:16.900> are<00:07:17.289> clearly<00:07:17.590> sealed<00:07:18.099> and

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 
until the edges are clearly sealed and

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.740 
until the edges are clearly sealed and
they<00:07:18.490> feel<00:07:18.669> a<00:07:18.699> little<00:07:18.909> crusty<00:07:19.330> on<00:07:19.419> the<00:07:19.509> edges

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:19.750
