00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.719
 samsung has a note series 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.700
 practically the tablet category web 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.379
 invented and that is now the fifth 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.970
 nation the samsung galaxy note 5 the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.859
 does not come first 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.840
 Germany 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:24.060
 but I think maybe a few 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.740
 weeks or months could be late 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.300
 Well imagine that this is a car 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.519
 behaves at some point Lich 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.679
 so far you look so close to it 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:37.230
 Similar to the mission on the 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:40.500
 note 4 and the s 6 here you have it 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.239
 not such a strongly rounded screen 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.969
 So here's practically it 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.200
 conventional metal case but the 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.670
 Of course, gimmick is here and there 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.530
 you do not have to be fingernail-sized anymore 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.320
 but press it once and then 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.219
 the pen comes out that's natural 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.879
 the highlight of the note 5 when I am 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.219
 press this button while I am here 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.760
 I 'm on screen then I can 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:09.890
 call notes or even different 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:12.950
 screen modes 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:17.060
 I can reconnect 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.060
 so now let's take a look 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.290
 design is similar to the sex so 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.430
 all-metal rear glass and if you like 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.110
 Interestingly times the comparison with 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.260
 the biggest competitor 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.950
 it takes then already on the 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.550
 Although iphone 6 plus has a smaller one 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.240
 screen 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.820
 but it's even higher overall 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.369
 also a very small tick wider who 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.250
 now it can not decide 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.440
 six plus should I take this or should 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.539
 i wait until the galaxy note 5 den 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.259
 you have to say yes apart from the 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.580
 rounded surface and the pen 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.710
 There are no big differences 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.700
 technically, the two devices are one 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.700
 completely identical
