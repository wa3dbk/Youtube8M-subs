00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
don't know if it still works now if it

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.750

then I'll think about getting it I
probably<00:03:27.550> will<00:03:27.970> if<00:03:28.600> it<00:03:28.690> does<00:03:28.900> work<00:03:29.080> with<00:03:29.290> the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
probably will if it does work with the

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.250 
probably will if it does work with the
update<00:03:29.770> just<00:03:30.070> because<00:03:30.460> that<00:03:31.390> will<00:03:31.630> make<00:03:32.080> it<00:03:32.230> so

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
or anything to go download it because I

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.890 
or anything to go download it because I
technically<00:05:45.590> don't<00:05:46.070> own<00:05:46.669> the<00:05:47.270> textures

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
technically don't own the textures

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.810 
technically don't own the textures
because<00:05:48.200> I<00:05:48.320> didn't<00:05:48.680> make<00:05:48.860> them<00:05:49.130> a<00:05:49.340> few<00:05:49.520> of<00:05:49.669> them

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
because I didn't make them a few of them

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.180 
because I didn't make them a few of them
I<00:05:49.940> edited<00:05:50.389> yes<00:05:50.690> but<00:05:50.990> like<00:05:51.169> the<00:05:51.830> overall

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
I edited yes but like the overall

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.100 
I edited yes but like the overall
texture<00:05:52.639> I<00:05:52.820> don't<00:05:53.210> really<00:05:53.450> like<00:05:53.750> I<00:05:53.840> didn't

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
texture I don't really like I didn't

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.960 
texture I don't really like I didn't
make<00:05:54.260> it<00:05:54.470> so<00:05:55.040> I<00:05:55.070> can't<00:05:55.520> really<00:05:55.669> reach

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
make it so I can't really reach

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.260 
make it so I can't really reach
distribute<00:05:56.450> it<00:05:56.600> so<00:05:57.370> stop<00:05:58.370> asking<00:05:58.910> for<00:05:59.120> it

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
distribute it so stop asking for it

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.900 
distribute it so stop asking for it
because<00:05:59.600> I<00:05:59.660> don't<00:05:59.840> have<00:06:00.380> it<00:06:00.650> remix<00:06:01.370> your<00:06:01.729> own

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910 
because I don't have it remix your own
