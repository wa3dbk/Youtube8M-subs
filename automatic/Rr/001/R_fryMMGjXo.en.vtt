they did not have access to water

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.109 
they did not have access to water
anymore<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:04.649> nonprofits<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.759> government

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
anymore so nonprofits and the government

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.760 
anymore so nonprofits and the government
set<00:02:06.240> up<00:02:06.270> emergency<00:02:06.570> systems<00:02:07.259> they<00:02:07.710> were

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
getting non potable water it means they

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.630

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
interesting things is that at the

emergency water allotment near this

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.810 
emergency water allotment near this
firehouse

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
firehouse

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.730 
firehouse
there<00:02:24.120> was<00:02:24.270> this<00:02:24.420> warning<00:02:24.840> flier<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.200> said

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
there was this warning flier that said

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.550 
there was this warning flier that said
if<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.670> want<00:02:26.940> clean<00:02:27.300> drinking<00:02:27.780> water<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:28.410> can

go buy it from your nearest retailer so

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.120 
go buy it from your nearest retailer so
I<00:02:30.540> guess<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:31.200> me<00:02:31.350> that's<00:02:31.500> kind<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.740> alarming

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
I guess to me that's kind of alarming

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.270 
I guess to me that's kind of alarming
because<00:02:32.310> it's<00:02:33.030> sort<00:02:33.300> of<00:02:33.680> this<00:02:34.680> image<00:02:35.040> of<00:02:35.160> what

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
because it's sort of this image of what

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.700 
because it's sort of this image of what
we<00:02:35.310> can<00:02:35.520> expect<00:02:35.960> for<00:02:36.960> the<00:02:36.990> poorest

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
we can expect for the poorest

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.140 
we can expect for the poorest
communities<00:02:38.130> in<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.430> future<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.850> guess<00:02:38.910> it's

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
communities in the future I guess it's

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.270 
communities in the future I guess it's
just<00:02:39.180> kind<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.480> scary<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:39.810> as<00:02:40.280> the

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
just kind of scary that as the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.420 
just kind of scary that as the
population<00:02:41.790> grows<00:02:42.000> as<00:02:42.980> more<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.130> more<00:02:44.280> people

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
population grows as more and more people

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.120 
population grows as more and more people
start<00:02:44.670> living<00:02:44.880> in<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.030> metropolitan<00:02:45.540> areas

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
start living in the metropolitan areas

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.320 
start living in the metropolitan areas
the<00:02:47.130> amount<00:02:47.340> of<00:02:47.460> water<00:02:47.700> there<00:02:48.000> isn't

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
the amount of water there isn't

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.030 
the amount of water there isn't
increasing<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:49.020> that<00:02:49.230> means<00:02:49.440> water<00:02:49.740> is<00:02:49.920> gonna

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
increasing and that means water is gonna

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.620 
increasing and that means water is gonna
be<00:02:50.190> harder<00:02:50.490> and<00:02:50.520> harder<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.850> come<00:02:50.970> by<00:02:51.150> in<00:02:51.450> the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
be harder and harder to come by in the

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.680 
be harder and harder to come by in the
future<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.140> if<00:02:53.070> we<00:02:53.340> decide<00:02:53.760> that<00:02:54.150> rich<00:02:54.660> people

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
future and if we decide that rich people

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.660 
future and if we decide that rich people
who<00:02:55.140> can<00:02:55.290> pay<00:02:55.440> for<00:02:55.650> water<00:02:55.770> are<00:02:56.010> simply<00:02:56.370> allowed

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
who can pay for water are simply allowed

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.190 
who can pay for water are simply allowed
to<00:02:56.970> just<00:02:57.209> take<00:02:57.360> as<00:02:57.480> much<00:02:57.630> as<00:02:57.750> they<00:02:57.870> want<00:02:58.080> and

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
to just take as much as they want and

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.170 
to just take as much as they want and
maybe<00:02:58.350> pay<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.560> fine<00:02:58.860> what<00:02:59.580> happens<00:02:59.940> to<00:03:00.090> the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
maybe pay a fine what happens to the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.670 
maybe pay a fine what happens to the
poor<00:03:00.360> people<00:03:00.720> who<00:03:00.959> don't<00:03:01.230> have<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.590> ability

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
poor people who don't have the ability

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.800 
poor people who don't have the ability
to<00:03:01.950> just<00:03:02.160> buy<00:03:02.310> water<00:03:02.580> are<00:03:03.240> we<00:03:03.450> gonna<00:03:03.570> go<00:03:03.750> to

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
to just buy water are we gonna go to

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:04.880 
to just buy water are we gonna go to
them<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:03.990> say<00:03:04.170> hey<00:03:04.290> we<00:03:04.440> can<00:03:04.530> go<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.740> store

them and say hey we can go to the store
and<00:03:04.920> buy<00:03:05.100> some<00:03:05.810> but<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:06.840> guess<00:03:06.990> this<00:03:07.110> brings<00:03:07.290> up

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.140 
and buy some but I guess this brings up
another<00:03:07.530> interesting<00:03:07.860> point<00:03:08.190> which<00:03:09.000> I

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
another interesting point which I

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.850 
another interesting point which I
mentioned<00:03:09.450> earlier<00:03:09.630> who<00:03:09.780> does<00:03:10.080> have<00:03:10.530> rights

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
mentioned earlier who does have rights

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.490 
mentioned earlier who does have rights
to<00:03:11.459> water<00:03:11.640> I<00:03:12.000> think<00:03:12.630> a<00:03:12.840> lot<00:03:13.020> of<00:03:13.170> people<00:03:13.440> are

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
to water I think a lot of people are

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.170 
to water I think a lot of people are
gonna<00:03:13.590> fly<00:03:13.830> it<00:03:13.890> out<00:03:14.010> say<00:03:14.190> water<00:03:14.670> is<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:14.880> human

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
gonna fly it out say water is a human

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.940 
gonna fly it out say water is a human
right<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:15.600> we<00:03:15.660> need<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:15.870> figure<00:03:16.050> out<00:03:16.230> how<00:03:16.890> we

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
right and we need to figure out how we

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.000 
right and we need to figure out how we
distribute<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.640> equally<00:03:18.330> but<00:03:19.140> I<00:03:19.170> definitely

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
distribute it equally but I definitely

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
distribute it equally but I definitely
feel<00:03:20.130> there's<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.310> lot<00:03:20.430> of<00:03:20.519> people<00:03:20.790> who<00:03:20.940> are

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
feel there's a lot of people who are

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.670 
feel there's a lot of people who are
gonna<00:03:21.180> go<00:03:21.330> ahead<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:21.600> say<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:22.110> they<00:03:22.500> should

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
gonna go ahead and say that they should

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.780 
gonna go ahead and say that they should
have<00:03:22.769> a<00:03:22.830> right<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.130> buy<00:03:23.250> as<00:03:23.370> much<00:03:23.459> water<00:03:23.700> as
