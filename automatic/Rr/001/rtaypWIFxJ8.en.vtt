recently<00:00:06.810> benchmarked<00:00:07.620> star<00:00:07.950> citizen

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460

subversion<00:00:09.030> 09<00:00:09.780> 22<00:00:10.260> alpha<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.580> it<00:00:12.389> was<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.509> GPU

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
subversion 09 22 alpha and it was a GPU

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.570 
subversion 09 22 alpha and it was a GPU
benchmark<00:00:13.380> so<00:00:13.559> it's<00:00:13.740> really<00:00:13.830> just<00:00:13.920> an<00:00:14.190> effort

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
benchmark so it's really just an effort

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.090 
benchmark so it's really just an effort
of<00:00:15.030> looking<00:00:15.570> at<00:00:15.690> how<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.870> game<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.379> performing

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
of looking at how the game is performing

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.599 
of looking at how the game is performing
in<00:00:17.220> its<00:00:17.369> current<00:00:17.840> development<00:00:18.840> state<00:00:19.109> and

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
in its current development state and

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.920 
in its current development state and
it's<00:00:20.609> it's<00:00:20.970> looking<00:00:21.240> pretty<00:00:21.390> good<00:00:21.539> so<00:00:21.600> far

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
it's it's looking pretty good so far

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.529 
it's it's looking pretty good so far
especially<00:00:22.140> considering<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.340> original

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
especially considering the original

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.599 
especially considering the original
launch<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.960> star<00:00:25.170> citizen<00:00:25.410> looked<00:00:25.830> really

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
launch of star citizen looked really

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.169 
launch of star citizen looked really
much<00:00:27.380> much<00:00:28.380> more<00:00:28.590> alpha<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.580> speak<00:00:29.820> in<00:00:30.060> that

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
much much more alpha so to speak in that

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.639 
much much more alpha so to speak in that
it<00:00:30.599> had<00:00:31.040> far<00:00:32.040> less<00:00:32.070> developed<00:00:32.669> graphics<00:00:33.390> and

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
it had far less developed graphics and

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.620 
it had far less developed graphics and
it<00:00:34.649> was<00:00:34.860> crashing<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.610> really<00:00:35.850> had<00:00:36.000> pretty

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
it was crashing and really had pretty

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.410 
it was crashing and really had pretty
poor<00:00:36.960> optimization<00:00:37.829> with<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.090> current

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
poor optimization with the current

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.540 
poor optimization with the current
version<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.200> alpha<00:00:40.590> i<00:00:40.800> want<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.340> emphasize

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
version of the alpha i want to emphasize

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.779 
version of the alpha i want to emphasize
very<00:00:42.180> heavily<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.920> graphics<00:00:44.489> are<00:00:44.610> not

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
very heavily that the graphics are not

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.660 
very heavily that the graphics are not
final<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.600> they<00:00:45.809> will<00:00:46.070> generally<00:00:47.070> look<00:00:47.250> better

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
final so they will generally look better

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.279 
final so they will generally look better
than<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.600> final<00:00:48.899> version<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.230> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
than this in the final version of the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.160 
than this in the final version of the
game<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.800> still<00:00:50.370> very<00:00:50.520> early<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.170> in

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
game it is still very early and in

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.959 
game it is still very early and in
addition<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.010> optimization<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.789> not

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
addition to this the optimization is not

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.700 
addition to this the optimization is not
final<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.570> we've<00:00:54.690> got<00:00:54.840> two<00:00:55.140> elements<00:00:55.649> that

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
final so we've got two elements that

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.069 
final so we've got two elements that
will<00:00:55.920> critically<00:00:56.340> impact<00:00:56.969> GPU<00:00:57.840> performance

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
will critically impact GPU performance

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.200 
will critically impact GPU performance
when<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.980> game<00:00:59.160> launches<00:00:59.399> which<00:00:59.820> means<00:01:00.059> that

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
when the game launches which means that

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.720 
when the game launches which means that
my<00:01:00.359> benchmark<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.989> not<00:01:01.170> as<00:01:01.550> definitive<00:01:02.550> as

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
my benchmark is not as definitive as

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.310 
my benchmark is not as definitive as

very early alpha game that said I ran
the<00:01:24.720> test<00:01:24.990> anyway<00:01:25.410> because<00:01:25.590> one<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.250> thought<00:01:26.460> it

the test anyway because one I thought it

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.190 
the test anyway because one I thought it

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
would be fun and star citizen looks

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.230 
would be fun and star citizen looks
pretty<00:01:28.440> good<00:01:28.590> right<00:01:28.650> now<00:01:28.950> even<00:01:29.790> though<00:01:30.060> it's

pretty good right now even though it's

pretty good right now even though it's

buy<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> new<00:01:48.570> GPU<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.650> this<00:01:50.160> was<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.520> benchmark

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
buy a new GPU so this was the benchmark

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.600 
buy a new GPU so this was the benchmark
course<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.630> looks<00:01:51.810> pretty<00:01:51.900> good<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.170> far<00:01:52.610> PBR

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
course it looks pretty good so far PBR

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.280 
course it looks pretty good so far PBR
and<00:01:53.640> things<00:01:54.090> like<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.420> don't<00:01:54.690> think<00:01:55.170> are

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
and things like that I don't think are

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.710 
and things like that I don't think are
completely<00:01:56.040> integrated<00:01:56.610> right<00:01:57.090> now<00:01:57.300> but<00:01:57.600> it

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
completely integrated right now but it

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.420 
completely integrated right now but it
is<00:01:57.840> certainly<00:01:58.200> heading<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.680> direction<00:01:58.740> and

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
is certainly heading that direction and

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.520 
is certainly heading that direction and
I<00:01:59.670> will<00:01:59.820> have<00:02:00.090> more<00:02:00.900> videos<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.410> articles

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
I will have more videos and articles

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.440 
I will have more videos and articles
about<00:02:01.920> those<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.340> future<00:02:02.610> hit<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.240> link

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
about those in the future hit the link
