stupid<00:04:01.850> things<00:04:02.060> donkey<00:04:02.450> kick<00:04:02.720> started<00:04:03.110> like

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
stupid things donkey kick started like

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.440 
stupid things donkey kick started like
this<00:04:03.320> dice<00:04:03.950> plus<00:04:04.490> now<00:04:04.820> I<00:04:04.850> don't<00:04:05.030> think<00:04:05.300> dice

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
this dice plus now I don't think dice

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.240 
this dice plus now I don't think dice
plus<00:04:05.870> was<00:04:06.050> actually<00:04:06.320> kick-started<00:04:07.160> on

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
plus was actually kick-started on

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.980 
plus was actually kick-started on
Kickstarter<00:04:07.850> but<00:04:08.150> it<00:04:08.240> could<00:04:08.420> have<00:04:08.510> been<00:04:08.540> okay

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
Kickstarter but it could have been okay

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.240 
Kickstarter but it could have been okay
so<00:04:09.050> what<00:04:09.200> are<00:04:09.230> these<00:04:09.380> it's<00:04:09.650> a<00:04:09.830> physical

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
so what are these it's a physical

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.460 
so what are these it's a physical
peripheral<00:04:10.790> to<00:04:11.150> use<00:04:11.360> in<00:04:11.930> conjunction<00:04:12.320> with

games<00:04:14.180> with<00:04:14.630> the<00:04:14.930> dice<00:04:15.140> and<00:04:15.380> you<00:04:15.410> can<00:04:15.560> actually

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
games with the dice and you can actually

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.260 
games with the dice and you can actually
roll<00:04:16.010> the<00:04:16.190> dice<00:04:16.370> because<00:04:16.549> fuck<00:04:16.940> that<00:04:17.120> makes

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
roll the dice because fuck that makes

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.370 
roll the dice because fuck that makes
all<00:04:17.359> the<00:04:17.450> difference<00:04:17.480> doesn't<00:04:17.960> it<00:04:18.080> sweet

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
all the difference doesn't it sweet

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.349 
all the difference doesn't it sweet
Jesus<00:04:19.010> there's<00:04:19.190> a<00:04:19.250> lot<00:04:19.370> of<00:04:19.489> tech<00:04:19.760> in<00:04:19.940> this<00:04:20.060> die

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
Jesus there's a lot of tech in this die

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:21.820 
Jesus there's a lot of tech in this die
you<00:04:20.780> know<00:04:20.900> how<00:04:21.080> sophisticated<00:04:21.290> the

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
you know how sophisticated the

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.590 
you know how sophisticated the
technology<00:04:22.340> is<00:04:22.400> by<00:04:22.700> how<00:04:22.850> small<00:04:23.210> they<00:04:23.450> make

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
technology is by how small they make

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.030 
technology is by how small they make
that<00:04:23.720> writing<00:04:24.080> so<00:04:24.230> it<00:04:24.350> has<00:04:24.440> a<00:04:24.470> plethora<00:04:24.830> of

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
that writing so it has a plethora of

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.950 
that writing so it has a plethora of
technology<00:04:25.700> Bluetooth<00:04:26.270> to<00:04:26.480> talk<00:04:26.690> to<00:04:26.870> the

technology Bluetooth to talk to the

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.570 
technology Bluetooth to talk to the
device<00:04:27.260> a<00:04:27.500> micro<00:04:27.950> controller<00:04:28.370> with<00:04:28.550> a

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
device a micro controller with a

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.640 
device a micro controller with a
temperature<00:04:29.030> gauge<00:04:29.330> a<00:04:29.600> mag<00:04:29.840> field<00:04:30.080> sensor<00:04:30.500> so

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
temperature gauge a mag field sensor so

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.290 
temperature gauge a mag field sensor so
knows<00:04:30.830> where<00:04:31.010> it<00:04:31.070> is<00:04:31.130> in<00:04:31.250> 3d<00:04:31.490> space<00:04:31.850> a

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
knows where it is in 3d space a

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.080 
knows where it is in 3d space a
proximity<00:04:32.840> sensor<00:04:33.200> and<00:04:33.590> an<00:04:34.040> accelerometer

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
proximity sensor and an accelerometer

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.060 
proximity sensor and an accelerometer
now<00:04:35.270> I<00:04:35.480> think<00:04:35.570> we're<00:04:35.990> over<00:04:36.170> engineering<00:04:36.890> the

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
now I think we're over engineering the

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.410 
now I think we're over engineering the
problem<00:04:37.400> here<00:04:37.580> I<00:04:37.700> mean<00:04:37.850> if<00:04:37.970> you<00:04:38.030> really<00:04:38.180> wanted

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
problem here I mean if you really wanted

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.180 
problem here I mean if you really wanted
to<00:04:38.480> make<00:04:38.600> a<00:04:38.660> super<00:04:39.020> technology<00:04:39.290> device<00:04:39.740> just

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
to make a super technology device just

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.890 
to make a super technology device just
use<00:04:40.430> one<00:04:40.640> of<00:04:40.669> these<00:04:40.790> technologies<00:04:41.390> how<00:04:41.660> about

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
use one of these technologies how about

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.770 
use one of these technologies how about
the<00:04:42.290> magnetic<00:04:42.860> field<00:04:43.160> sensor<00:04:43.400> so<00:04:43.940> we<00:04:44.030> can<00:04:44.180> tell

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
the magnetic field sensor so we can tell

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.780 
the magnetic field sensor so we can tell
roll<00:04:45.110> it<00:04:45.320> what<00:04:45.710> side<00:04:45.950> is<00:04:46.130> pointing<00:04:46.310> up<00:04:46.520> since

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
roll it what side is pointing up since

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.210 
roll it what side is pointing up since
it<00:04:46.910> knows<00:04:47.090> it's<00:04:47.360> space<00:04:47.630> in<00:04:47.870> 3d<00:04:48.290> place<00:04:48.710> or<00:04:48.980> just

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
it knows it's space in 3d place or just

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.770 
it knows it's space in 3d place or just
the<00:04:49.310> proximity<00:04:49.580> sensor<00:04:49.850> so<00:04:50.300> it<00:04:50.390> knows<00:04:50.540> render

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
the proximity sensor so it knows render

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.970 
the proximity sensor so it knows render
has<00:04:50.870> lots<00:04:51.140> of<00:04:51.200> proximity<00:04:51.500> around<00:04:51.860> it

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
has lots of proximity around it

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.470 
has lots of proximity around it
someone's<00:04:52.310> holding<00:04:52.550> the<00:04:52.820> thing<00:04:52.970> and<00:04:53.330> when

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
someone's holding the thing and when

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
they roll it and it lands on the table

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.800 
they roll it and it lands on the table
only<00:04:55.400> one<00:04:55.790> sides<00:04:56.060> touching<00:04:56.540> the<00:04:56.600> table

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
proximity to that so the opposite size

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.010 
proximity to that so the opposite size
the<00:04:59.000> one<00:04:59.120> that's<00:04:59.270> showing<00:04:59.510> or<00:04:59.780> an
