 so recently i have removed the plug novation garden 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.130
 due to the fact that he paints the server server 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.710
 dad just cut out and all that and so 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.200

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.489
 exmo on another enemy will not be able to climb 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.190

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.129
 You three all your door, no one 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.490

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.299
 and the second news is that we opened the rpg 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.750
 server what's different about server rpg 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.979
 from our dad or classical ask 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:23.580
 you let me tell you on rbg 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:28.080
 there are skills pumped it on 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:33.750
 let's say pickax we want fast lama we 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:39.829
 want to dig fast let's get to for example yes 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:44.790
 to me for example here we take off ourselves cue mod 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:50.610
 for example, we have a pickaxe and so what 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:54.240
 The meaning of pumping skills can be such 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.119
 click on the right button and is called 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.380
 critical hit he for a while 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.390
 for nothing we see the present of the heart 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.810
 raise one level only 2 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.670
 the more you will have a figure from everything 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.380
 two the more to fight the more you 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.810
 can make a critical hit longer 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.500
 map which critical hit click on 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.790
 right button 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.370
 write cook your 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.629
 pick and left hold the right hold 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.370
 Elihu and his what we see is a super destroyer 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:23.069
 we are activated so we broke and 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.689
 a finger blocks now we are tired 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.849
 i need to imitate four minutes i don't 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:29.099
 for how much more than we will 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.950
 breaks the blocks the more we will be ourselves 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.900
 after all, pump three further 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.180
 the result is in the hands of a tree, we also 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:41.579
 We can quickly chop the tree can continue 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.159
 do a critical hit on mobs 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:47.459
 or by players well and also from 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:49.829
 blades really looking no but also 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.780
 there already you can quickly also have bersek 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:56.849
 but he seems not pumped if i 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:59.159
 I know Bersek, too, there is just like that 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.980

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:07.040
 on bersek we activate bersek all pier 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:10.379
 where activated because we are tired here 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.120
