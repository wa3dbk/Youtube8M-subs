00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.819
 hello and welcome to this video a 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:08.840
 boxing review of this star fox game 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:10.850
 64 3d for nintendo 3ds is not a game 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.010
 precisely new but because it is 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.800
 good price I decided to make a video 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.720
 let's see what we have behind the 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.310
 typical text that says wonders of 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.070
 game in case you do not know anything about him 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.890
 accompanied as always by images of 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.210
 game apart also appears here the 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.039
 new control by movement that has 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.740
 this game is not bad but 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.509
 I honestly do not finish convincing 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.070
 the game has download mode with what 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.220
 you can play with up to four players 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.410
 simply as a game and as a novelty 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.750
 final is the first starfox that reaches us 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.960
 entirely Spanish, both the text and the 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.550
 the voices are going to open this box 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.530
 to see what it brings inside and by the way 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.649
 remember that after this boxing 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.890
 you can see the analysis of this game not 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.990
 I think we need the help of the 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.560
 just messing around 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:02.330
 and using the nintendo prayer 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.330
 it comes out very easily 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:19.050
 we open the box and we hope that the young man 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:21.690
 acquitted that they are all papers 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.340
 amazing an instruction book not 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.890
 I think I thought they had 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.810
 extinguished as many of you will already know 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.090
 my last one boxing is soil complain 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.860
 because more and more often the games 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.560
 they no longer bring instructions 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.450
 just a very shabby paper and it's something 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.010
 that should not be lost and all 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.110
 games should bring a good book of 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.750
 instructions that by the way if you have 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.240
 curiosity comes very well Spanish other 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.770
 medium in Portuguese 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.810
 then have the hazard sheet and 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.260
 precautions that I'm going to bother in 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.480
 look 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.010
 the nintendo club points that like 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.760
 you know you have to scratch to get 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:00.390
 250 stars and here you can see the 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.010
 faces of the characters of the star fox 64 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.830
 to see if I can remove it so that 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.140
 you see better as detail is not bad 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.990
 but honestly it does not call much the 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.510
 last attention I simply have left 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.270
 remove the game from the box that 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.880
 true I tell you the boxes of the 3ds not 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:23.220
 I like nothing and I do not know if this happens to you 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.560
 you but many times they are so so 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.890
 the 2 that gives me the impression that I'm going to 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.800
 break eye removing it but it can be 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.290
 that is just already a little clumsy 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.590
 or the analysis of this game I hope that 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.590
 I like you 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.709
 possibly starfox 64 or the age words 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.019
 as it was finally known in europe 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.580
 is one of the games that you know best 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.280
 for the time I told him that when 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.720
 I had the nintendo 64 towards the end of the 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.940
 90's 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.430
 for the mere fact of playing once after 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.260
 another in its different phases thanks to its 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.750
 great replayability I doubt there's a 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.670
 game that I know best about this one 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.980
 reason I wanted to try this remake 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.260
 for nintendo 3ds to see what 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.260
 point had respected the original game 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.750
 the original starfox 64 was part of the 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.840
 group of faithful who came out next to the 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.239
 nintendo 64 console commercialized 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.770
 with the rumble pack accessory which was 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.780
 a novelty for the time 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.640
 At first this game was going to be 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.790
 part of the second installment for super 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.470
 nintendo of starfox but the company's 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.960
 Nintendo opted to develop the game 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.050
 for your nintendo 64 console that would be 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.540
 launched in less than a year 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.720
 know starfox you just need to know a 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.600
 couple of details 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.780
 this is a game on short rails 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.790
 duration but very but very rejugable 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.940
 in fact the replayability of the title is 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.430
 its biggest central pillar we will control 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.080
 fox mccloud that with the help of his 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.940
 squadron we will have to avoid the 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.370
 invasion of the scientist banished to the 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.900
 planet venus called andros for 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.150
 liberate the entire system at the age 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.040
 starting with the most important stress 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.290
 that nintendo has not bothered her and 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.599
 keeps all the gameplay of the game intact 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.030
 original title everything is in place 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.560
 all the phases all the enemies and 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.340
 even the secrets are exactly 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.440
 In the same place 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.770
 although the essence is the same as the 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:31.160
 of the original title of 1997 everything has been 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.530
 updated one way or another but if 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.510
 it's exactly the same game it deserves 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:40.100
 sorry with just this face wash 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.230
 absolutely yes my graphic jump is 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.810
 tremendous in comparison the title 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.970
 original that by the way is available 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.650
 in the wii virtual console where each 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.660
 one of the levels has been remodeled 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.820
 from scratch displaying some of 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.370
 the best graphics seen up to this 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.500
 moment in a portable console this 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.930
 forms the effects of water and lighting 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.700
 they are by far the most impressive that 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.220
 can be found in the catalog of a 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.620
 portable console likewise the music 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.940
 it has also suffered an improvement of the otazo 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.650
 really good in dubbing 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.890
 we will enjoy a new dubbing 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.780
 totally adapted to Spanish many 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.060
 will be the known benders 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.430
 done if we have played other games since 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.620
 previously bent by nintendo as 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.420
 can be the light on will not sound the 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.670
 most voices such as others 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.620
 titles of nintendo 3ds we can do 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.930
 use of gyros to power 9 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.760
 our tree and it works 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.590
 surprisingly good though 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.680
 honestly it is difficult to maintain this 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.450
 forms the 3d effect with the swings and - 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.450
 that we will give to the console using 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:44.660
 this type of control will be almost impossible 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:47.120
 maintain the characteristic effect of 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.120
 three dimensions correctly to the 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.130
 height of our eyes apart this 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.770
 control is far less accurate than 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:57.230
 use classic control and for a game 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.419
 where accuracy is essential we will leave 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.850
 this kind of special control just for 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:04.040
 few times the game is very 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.810
 auckland style where to get to the 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.190
 final goal we will have to explore the 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.220
 different levels and in the order that 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:12.050
 we want but to really squeeze it 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.450
 it will be necessary to determine enough 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.950
 times winning for it skill and 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.639
 biting us to get better 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.780
 scores 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:23.999
 because the game itself is very short short 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:27.090
 you can literally finish it 

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:29.789
 in a couple of hours but its replayability 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:32.849
 is tremendous and will make us have a game 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:34.710
 for months the multiplayer mode for 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:36.419
 play up against four people a 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.210
 only cartridge has been totally 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:40.430
 remodeled although unfortunately it is not 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.170
 on-line 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.390
 although there are three types of game 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:48.080
 multiplayer are essentially the same 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:49.910
 destroy all the other ships if not 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.610
 we have four people on hand 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.650
 we can replace these people with 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.780
 bots but of course the game 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.120
 multiplayer really loses quite 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.730
 grace this new version of the star fox 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.050
 it is something difficult to recommend especially 

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.000
 when the original is easily 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:08.420
 downloadable from the virtual console 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.700
 wii for just one thousand fifths the eastern part 

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:13.930
 original is still as fun as 

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.930
 it was when it went on sale
