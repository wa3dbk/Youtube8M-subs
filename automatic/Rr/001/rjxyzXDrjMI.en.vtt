00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.529
 in this video I will teach you how to 

00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:06.390
 use your iphone or any device 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.530
 have this application and music 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.900
 to listen to music between xbox or in your 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.780
 accuracy 3 good what we have to 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.130
 to do first is to go to aston one year 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.050
 I'm here app store and we look for music 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.029
 the only bad thing this application is that 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.429
 it costs two dollars with 99 but it's 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.720
 I recommend it is very good it is the best 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.119
 application that exists to transmit 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.900
 music as could be said by means of 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.170
 nl 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.650
 the average wifi from the others there 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.530
 free does not work very well and good as 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.149
 come have downloaded let's open it 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.410
 the first step that you will get the 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.460
 first time when you use it will come out 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.800
 this because it is generating your library 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.600
 musical here says with music you can 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.329
 issue your library directly 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.219
 music streaming via wifi to 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.079
 a pressure 3 an xbox or also 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.820
 it works like a good computer 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.079
 then to lend to use the 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.329
 first I recommend doing is saying 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.149
 the first ignition could be said a 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.610
 configuration and we put transmission of 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.530
 high quality and take care of it and here it stops 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.970
 that the music keeps playing if it's 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.440
 reproductions do not have to close the 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.759
 application and you do not have to be the one of 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.929
 she is to say it is not necessary to leave it thus 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.900
 because it's going to be ported, you have to be in 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:21.870
 stay in the application 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.450
 and not leaving also leave it in second 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.630
 flat as you see then we can attenuate 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.360
 the continuation of activity 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.159
 that is, if not, the screen is also 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.479
 to lower the brightness as well as what 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.060
 come right now that you got off if there's no 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.259
 activity and the phone will not be left as 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.259
 fast then let's ok 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.770
 Now to activate the music alone will 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.990
 we throw here it is possible to recharge it to emphasize 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.030
 that the iphone or your phone has to 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.460
 be connected to the same Wi-Fi network as 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:56.530
 your xbox then now let's go in the xbox 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.530
 we press the guide button 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:10.020
 now let's do the right we go down 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.390
 let's select music 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.000
 as you can see here the music iphone of 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.040
 Miguel leaves two because 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.390
 previously had used and of the 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.890
 back again to show them how 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.520
 was then let's try which one 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.950
 enters missions of Miguel and entered 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.060
 so here you go he says he's going to repeat 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.060
 our music by albums 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.950
 by interpreters 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.830
 per playlist per songs 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.860
 and by genre you can start there 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.410
 but I 'm always going to reproduce everything 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.670
 music will always be transmitted 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.470
 iphone as they are 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.100
 and this has lowered the brightness so that 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.960
 sound like this 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.230
 and here is the song but it has a 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.319
 low volume let's go song 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.850
 if I'm here it's for random is in 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.830
 Random no longer has thorium 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.670
 who continues with the 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:09.010
 if we remove it, it will change randomly 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.670
 is x for the volume of the music 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.739
 it's out here backing out of music for 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.490
 force the music and remove it 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.190
 totally 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.030
 and good that and especially thanks for the 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.030
 video and see you later
