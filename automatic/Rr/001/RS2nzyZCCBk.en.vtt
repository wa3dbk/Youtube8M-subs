step by step and how we go about doing
that<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.640> first<00:00:29.910> thing<00:00:30.090> what<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.300> do<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.900> put

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
that the first thing what I do is I put

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.920 
that the first thing what I do is I put
a<00:00:31.140> little<00:00:31.500> tiny<00:00:31.800> pencil<00:00:32.189> mark<00:00:32.610> that's<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:33.780> like

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
a little tiny pencil mark that's so like

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.950 
a little tiny pencil mark that's so like
in<00:00:34.170> light<00:00:34.410> when<00:00:34.739> we<00:00:34.770> take<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.340> pipe<00:00:35.640> off<00:00:35.960> we

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
in light when we take this pipe off we

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.750 
in light when we take this pipe off we
can<00:00:37.140> line<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.590> pipes<00:00:37.829> up<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.370> holes<00:00:38.579> to

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
can line the pipes up in the holes to

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.610 
can line the pipes up in the holes to
line<00:00:38.940> up<00:00:39.000> perfectly<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.829> pipe<00:00:42.620> it'll

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
line up perfectly so the pipe it'll

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:52.580 
line up perfectly so the pipe it'll
slide<00:00:43.920> up<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:47.000> put<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> bucket<00:00:51.289> underneath<00:00:52.289> it

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
slide up I put a bucket underneath it

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.700 
slide up I put a bucket underneath it
now<00:00:53.340> we<00:00:53.399> go<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.670> top<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.360> roof<00:00:54.570> we<00:00:55.230> take<00:00:55.469> off

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
now we go on top of the roof we take off

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.580 
now we go on top of the roof we take off
the<00:00:55.739> cap<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.820> then<00:00:56.910> we<00:00:57.000> run<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> brush<00:00:58.079> down<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
the cap and then we run a brush down the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.110 
the cap and then we run a brush down the
middle<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:58.980> scrub<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.370> inside<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.910> pipe

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
middle and scrub the inside of the pipe

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.110 
middle and scrub the inside of the pipe
you<00:01:01.010> need<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.129> get<00:01:02.280> these<00:01:02.460> things<00:01:02.520> tight

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
you need to get these things tight

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.520 
you need to get these things tight
because<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.600> don't<00:01:03.780> want<00:01:03.930> them<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.229> come

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
because you don't want them to come

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.140 
because you don't want them to come
loose<00:01:04.799> while<00:01:05.070> you're<00:01:05.280> scrubbing<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.820> inside

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
loose while you're scrubbing the inside

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.370 
loose while you're scrubbing the inside
of<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> pipe<00:01:11.479> look<00:01:12.479> at<00:01:12.600> all<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.810> creosote

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
of the pipe look at all that creosote

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.590 
of the pipe look at all that creosote
that's<00:01:13.590> up<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.890> there<00:01:14.180> that's<00:01:15.180> what<00:01:15.330> causes

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
that's up in there that's what causes

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:46.310 
that's up in there that's what causes
chimney<00:01:16.140> fires

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.380 

go<00:01:46.860> check<00:01:47.160> out<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.430> inside<00:01:47.730> of<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.940> pipe<00:01:48.150> it

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
go check out the inside of the pipe it

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:57.170 
go check out the inside of the pipe it
looks<00:01:48.600> pretty<00:01:48.840> clean<00:01:55.280> our<00:01:56.280> cap<00:01:56.520> back<00:01:56.790> on<00:01:57.030> the

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.580 

okay<00:02:07.670> so<00:02:07.729> we<00:02:08.000> brushed<00:02:08.209> out<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.720> chimney<00:02:09.289> pipe

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
okay so we brushed out the chimney pipe

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.770 
okay so we brushed out the chimney pipe
we<00:02:09.860> knocked<00:02:10.100> all<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.340> creosote<00:02:11.030> down<00:02:11.510> at<00:02:11.690> the

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
we knocked all the creosote down at the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.340 
we knocked all the creosote down at the
end<00:02:11.900> of<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.080> pipe<00:02:12.459> into<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.700> bucket<00:02:14.350> there

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
end of the pipe into the bucket there

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.280 
end of the pipe into the bucket there
with<00:02:15.500> them<00:02:19.060> now<00:02:20.060> inside<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.630> stove<00:02:20.900> here<00:02:21.140> we

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
with them now inside the stove here we

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.830 
with them now inside the stove here we
have<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.470> baffle<00:02:22.239> you<00:02:23.239> can<00:02:23.420> see<00:02:23.600> how<00:02:23.780> the

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
have a baffle you can see how the

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.080 
have a baffle you can see how the
creosote<00:02:24.800> is<00:02:24.830> collected<00:02:25.520> there<00:02:25.670> in<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.880> top

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
creosote is collected there in the top

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.430 
creosote is collected there in the top
of<00:02:26.270> that<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:27.319> we<00:02:27.410> want<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:27.680> get<00:02:27.830> rid<00:02:28.010> of<00:02:28.040> that

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
of that so we want to get rid of that

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:45.370 
of that so we want to get rid of that
creosote<00:02:30.440> in<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.709> ash

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.410 

now<00:02:46.380> there's<00:02:46.590> probably<00:02:46.710> some<00:02:47.220> creosote<00:02:48.060> still

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
now there's probably some creosote still

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.080 
now there's probably some creosote still
left<00:02:48.720> in<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.140> stove<00:02:49.410> but<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.400> stove<00:02:50.640> gets<00:02:50.910> so

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
left in the stove but the stove gets so

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.870 
left in the stove but the stove gets so
hot<00:02:51.360> they<00:02:51.600> don't<00:02:51.810> burn<00:02:52.020> that<00:02:52.050> creosote<00:02:52.770> down

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.360 

and<00:02:56.880> then<00:02:57.630> we<00:02:57.750> just<00:02:57.780> have<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:58.260> put<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.620> screws

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
and then we just have to put the screws

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:18.980 
and then we just have to put the screws
back<00:02:59.550> in<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.790> holes

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.080 

okay<00:03:19.650> now<00:03:19.830> here's<00:03:20.070> our<00:03:20.190> other<00:03:20.340> Stoke<00:03:20.700> we<00:03:20.910> have

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
okay now here's our other Stoke we have

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.150 
okay now here's our other Stoke we have
on<00:03:21.240> the<00:03:21.330> homestead<00:03:21.780> this<00:03:22.260> one's<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.710> little<00:03:22.860> bit

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
on the homestead this one's a little bit

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.770 
on the homestead this one's a little bit
different<00:03:23.670> because<00:03:23.850> you<00:03:24.180> notice<00:03:24.360> we<00:03:24.660> have<00:03:24.750> a
