00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.210
 hello friends of your maracasi and 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.920
 today I would like to show you 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.689
 entertaining bout middle japanese 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.050
 tanks 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:32.460
 stb-1 battle took place on the windstorm map 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.130
 nick of player stinger 15 he is sent 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.340
 finish off avenue with his 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:43.710
 platoon on t-62 well and also to them 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.810
 joined the player on the t-54 and in general 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.539
 This direction is certainly not the most 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.530
 common but nice points here 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.280
 you can act pretty well 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.890
 meets our heroes t-54 and succeeds 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.719
 the enemy very quickly disassemble well and 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.700
 But also on batchat managed to get there 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:08.190
 54-ka substitutes the tower apparently she 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.580
 thinks that against ten she can 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.800
 to tank but naturally the tower at 54 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.130
 not so strong 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:20.700
 as before and against tens she doesn't 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.670
 saves her stb of course and and destroys 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.850
 next is another adversary on 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.460
 t49 but just because you can not destroy 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.310
 because if you climb it right away 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.080
 do you get some frivolts and 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.540
 other tanks that are for sure 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.740
 somewhere in the bushes sat down there 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:44.270
 and t49 is trying to specifically someone 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:48.210
 so warm and managed to sell that 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.360
 t-62 from the second time of course the position is not 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.040
 the best is because there art can 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:57.600
 shoot through the player nonetheless 2 times 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:01.950
 60 deuce selling comes alive and the third time 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.410
 He gets it in Huslia well and then apparently 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:10.289
 all the same with the platoon they are solved 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:13.940
 go and take apart t49 60 deuce on 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:19.200
 took the brunt of itself and further 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.310
 managed to destroy t49 right now player 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.709
 take him of course 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.830
 many hurried here with their comment 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:29.700
 and another enemy tank in the distance 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:33.540
 glows this tortoise managed again 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.319
 damage t-62a he is very strong here 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.630
 substituted and of course our hero of his 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.510
 destroyed but then further stb begins 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:46.560
 punch tortoys prices still allies 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:51.150
 here help the British Fri-shka quickly 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:54.600
 blown away of course dpm stb hell therefore 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.720
 it is worth only a little to implement it as 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.060
 already damage stuffed with huge 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.970
 speed well and here is ptshku managed 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.750
 destroy with allies still 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:11.220
 in the distance, the light of the art is not the same 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.620
 near as is Fri-shka t30 stinger 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:18.120
 her selling comes alive trying to put on 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:21.239
 I am harping but he does not get a t30 car 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:25.380
 slowly and on food rolls back and yet 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:28.829
 the third time she cuts off but then she doesn't 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:32.720
 even looks at our hero above the water 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:34.880
 STB class with new sales and 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.890
 sovzvodny her got 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.319
 stinger decides to return to his base 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.560
 because opponents push through the city and 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:47.190
 of course soon they will be there and will begin 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:51.120
 the sovzvvodny mash on t-62 decided 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:54.049
 seize the base but it's never really 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:58.350
 nothing good ends him 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:01.500
 destroy stb-1 flashes here by 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.769
 road Eagdpancer e100 but get from him 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.870
 it couldnâ€™t have been done normally just behind 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:10.730
 it's still lit up 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:14.280
 e100 and also glows in the distance 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:17.340
 waffentrager pz 4 generally opponents 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.789
 come on all fronts and 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:24.240
 STB focused on cardboard but very 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:26.600
 dangerous savannah here smears and once again 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.320
 you can sell it 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.090
 well, of course, high-explosive shells are even better 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.520
 for this fr sa but constantly 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.390
 reloading back and forth is not the best 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.850
 idea 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.720
 nevertheless, the little bird succeeded 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.410
 to destroy 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:45.350
 and Egdpantser e100 missed because so on. 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:49.670
 he has a very long time. 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:52.850
 then disassemble what I like stb-1 order 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:56.030
 that he has a great good warrior 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.820
 speed and at the same time pretty 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.810
 sturdy tower but of course not always 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:05.450
 keep the blow nevertheless sometimes she can 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:09.530
 something nice you tank I arrived 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:11.780
 avast and he destroyed an ally on St-1 well 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:15.170
 and as long as the enemy recharges 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.300
 need to use it and distribute come to life 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.700
 his cumulative projectile calm 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.880
 punches e100 besides he even towers 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:26.060
 do not turn away and it remains completely 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:29.300
 little hp he missed and need to get him 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.240
 but if he did not pierce his top of the tower to 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.060
 the same came m x 50 b which 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:39.850
 covers his ally nonetheless 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:43.670
 stb took a chance and destroyed e100 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:47.870
 somehow pick a mxf and you can 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:51.500
 but dangerous though stb fig tank tower 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:54.350
 as I said the towers of this tank though 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.320
 not super armored but nonetheless 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:01.850
 often she can save at the right moment 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:04.640
 I left the city from 7 and our Japanese and his 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:07.310
 got well and it remains to somehow disassemble 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.590
 Frenchman x 50 b but problem 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.830
 is that he is not so little 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:15.080
 hp and he has a drum for 4 shells 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.330
 of course you just can't go out on him 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.690
 because he is taking you ban calmly 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:24.910
 disassemble and then the Frenchman still manages 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:27.860
 destroy the union art well and our hero 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.940
 at least now knows where he is and 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.720
 what he has now 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:35.780
 recharge deals stinger position 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:38.419
 here and on the mountain here as a whole is very much 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.710
 good backache and you can again here 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:43.670
 nice awning 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:46.630
 give tower mx not yet leave 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.200
 wants it for sure recharges and 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:52.270
 this stb 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:55.520
 decides to wait for him though of course 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:57.370
 the french tank is fast and he can drive around 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.020
 on the other hand so it's a little 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:02.330
 risky though from this position is quite 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.550
 probably it was possible and the left flank 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:07.820
 highlight but it does not matter mx 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:09.400
 leaves he misses our japanese 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.980
 and twice 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:17.000
 manages to sell you aimax and 

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:20.600
 now he's naturally not enough shot 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.200
 him shells to pick up our now 

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.880
 stb 

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:27.350
 and then the player is just in arrogant bridget and 

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.910
 destroys m x 50 b 

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.100
 well, he did everything very well 

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:36.590
 medals in this fight redley medal 

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:39.980
 Walters main caliber and warrior 10240 6 

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:41.950
 damage dealt and the player he has destroyed nine 

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:46.640
 tanks 

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:51.020
 1573 experience he would get without prema 

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:55.070
 he played with prema and got 2359 

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:59.150

00:07:55.070 --> 00:08:02.450
 prema you tank 790 damage well and in 

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:06.680

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:10.250
