00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.369
 the year 2013 is getting tired and wants 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.139
 sleep no wonder it was also 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:16.000
 a spectacular technique yes with the 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.970
 approaches faster faster persevering 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.439
 and not to mention sharper phones 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.119
 ever bigger tablets were getting 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.650
 Small and ultrabooks do that now 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.059

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.399
 Entire lord of the rings trilogy 

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:28.629

 at the lowest brightness levels 

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:32.349
 For me it was the year of one 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.090
 review simply because this channel 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.070
 only for a little over four months 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.420
 exists better said I have then 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.510
 the first video uploaded 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.070
 now the 3333 subscribers are cracked 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.760
 and therefore it will be a special time 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.500
 upload 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.910

 around the clock and commented on that 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.840
 keeps convicting 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.420
 I simply wanted to 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.190
 We would like to thank you for the year 2013 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.380
 honorably let it end 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.780

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.610
 year the categories are natural 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.469
 technology oriented and therefore is the 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.969
 first point smartphones here he writes 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:12.039
 Just make a comment with rhombus or 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:14.200

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:16.719

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.429
 found a maximum of three smartphones are there 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:20.560
 possible there was here in all sorts of ways 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:21.609
 Operating system categories which I 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.529
 then will all the comments 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:25.869
 gather and thus the audience 

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:27.429
 top 5 and my personal top 5 form 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.009
 the second point is the tablets 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:32.049
 dedicated and also the ultrabooks case 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.909
 her desktop calculator fansite writes 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.130

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.899

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.729
 more than just a category comes here 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.649
 your favorite gadget or feature 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.299
 what is this year so that can exist 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.939
 touch design but also the breakthrough 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.009
 the 10 80 p phones or even 4k tv 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.649
 maybe it is also the ps4 the 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.759
 xbox that alone decides your point 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.649
 a lot also depends on the 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.749
 Consoles together as we then those 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.689
 have seen a lot of games dared 

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:59.649
 Number 4 is the favorite game of 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.419
 2013 and here, of course, the 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.579

 Comedy action or musical has been around 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.420
 honestly this is really something totally 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.280
 subjective as well as in the games 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.020

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.030

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.160
