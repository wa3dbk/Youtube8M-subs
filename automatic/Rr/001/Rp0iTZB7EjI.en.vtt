 this channel to a gaming channel 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.349
 would do 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:33.000
 Well, just to be so faithful to this 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:36.660
 it's about how to psp on the laptop 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.710
 Can play without a mirror without buying 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.219
 to buy a psp so that easy 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.739
 made 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.570
 and that just has to be in the video 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.110
 look at description 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.840
 this link I now in that 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:58.829
 description of the left will be easy 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:02.489
 then click Copy on the browser 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.430
 Now just insert and enter unity 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.350
 comes a page where is mine 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.760
 file stop the uploaded on the page 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.369
 has and yes definitely it is also 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.900
 it is not a virus as far as I am concerned 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.439
 I do not have any here while 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.090
 program 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.210
 but if you want you can do that 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.939
 scan if it is virus then please 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.860

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.860

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.880

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.590
 time this psp emulator down and that 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.579
 system gold suffered 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.189
 So that version, so to speak, right now 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.000
 if her scrum died, that had to happen 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.880
 just a pack of course 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.460
 nobody knows about the other tutorials 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.560

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:58.530

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.399
