00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
dangerous Tara I know what the problem

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.470 
dangerous Tara I know what the problem
with<00:00:16.890> them<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.160> they're<00:00:17.820> not<00:00:17.970> names<00:00:18.240> they're

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
with them is they're not names they're

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.200 
with them is they're not names they're
not<00:00:18.750> dangerous<00:00:19.260> Tara<00:00:20.010> today<00:00:20.910> we're<00:00:21.119> gonna

not dangerous Tara today we're gonna

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.359 
not dangerous Tara today we're gonna
take<00:00:21.420> something<00:00:21.750> completely<00:00:22.680> harmless<00:00:23.039> and

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
take something completely harmless and

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.300 
take something completely harmless and
make<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.000> incredibly<00:00:24.510> destructive<00:00:25.039> in<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
make it incredibly destructive in the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.099 
make it incredibly destructive in the
name<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.490> science<00:00:27.090> I'm<00:00:27.480> not<00:00:27.689> even<00:00:27.810> gonna<00:00:27.900> hide

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
name of science I'm not even gonna hide

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.080 
name of science I'm not even gonna hide
behind<00:00:28.140> science<00:00:28.890> anymore<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.519> just<00:00:29.910> want<00:00:30.060> a

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
behind science anymore I just want a

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.120 
behind science anymore I just want a
mess<00:00:30.750> up<00:00:30.900> today<00:00:31.199> today<00:00:31.769> we're<00:00:31.890> gonna<00:00:32.009> be

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
mess up today today we're gonna be

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.069 
mess up today today we're gonna be
building<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.610> ping<00:00:32.910> pong<00:00:32.940> ball<00:00:33.210> cannon<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
building a ping pong ball cannon and the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.720 
building a ping pong ball cannon and the
reason<00:00:34.440> we're<00:00:34.590> using<00:00:34.620> ping<00:00:35.070> pong<00:00:35.280> balls<00:00:35.520> for

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
reason we're using ping pong balls for

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.010 
reason we're using ping pong balls for
this<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.969> because<00:00:36.090> they<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.450> very<00:00:36.719> high

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
this is because they have a very high

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.660 
this is because they have a very high
amount<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.469> air<00:00:37.680> resistance<00:00:37.980> for<00:00:38.520> their

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
amount of air resistance for their

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.479 
amount of air resistance for their
weight<00:00:38.879> v12<00:00:39.510> ping<00:00:39.809> pong<00:00:39.989> balls<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:41.129> can<00:00:41.309> have

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
weight v12 ping pong balls you can have

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.310 
weight v12 ping pong balls you can have
too<00:00:41.730> Anthony<00:00:41.969> I'm<00:00:42.390> not<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.930> mood<00:00:43.110> to

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
too Anthony I'm not in the mood to

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.900 
too Anthony I'm not in the mood to
negotiate<00:00:43.980> they<00:00:44.219> can<00:00:44.370> see<00:00:44.489> why<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.670> air

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
negotiate they can see why the air

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.100 
negotiate they can see why the air
resistance<00:00:45.120> thing<00:00:45.450> would<00:00:45.570> be<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> problem<00:00:45.989> if

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
resistance thing would be a problem if

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.630 
resistance thing would be a problem if
you've<00:00:46.230> ever<00:00:46.350> tried<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.739> throw<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.340> ping<00:00:47.610> pong

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
you've ever tried to throw a ping pong

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.729 
you've ever tried to throw a ping pong
ball<00:00:47.850> not<00:00:48.539> terribly<00:00:48.960> impressive<00:00:49.289> but<00:00:49.559> if<00:00:49.620> we

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
ball not terribly impressive but if we

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.979 
ball not terribly impressive but if we
could<00:00:49.890> remove<00:00:50.160> air<00:00:50.489> resistance<00:00:50.730> entirely<00:00:51.300> we

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
could remove air resistance entirely we

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:52.970 
could remove air resistance entirely we
would<00:00:52.140> solve<00:00:52.350> our<00:00:52.500> problem

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
would solve our problem

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.139 
would solve our problem
do<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.129> just<00:00:53.280> always<00:00:53.699> carry<00:00:54.030> around

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
do you just always carry around

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.150 
do you just always carry around
ping-pong<00:00:54.780> balls<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.289> your<00:00:55.379> pocket<00:00:55.739> now<00:00:55.980> if<00:00:56.039> we

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
ping-pong balls in your pocket now if we

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.040 
ping-pong balls in your pocket now if we
manage<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.460> evacuate<00:00:57.090> all<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.570> air<00:00:57.719> out<00:00:58.020> of

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
manage to evacuate all of the air out of

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.660 
manage to evacuate all of the air out of
that<00:00:58.170> pipe<00:00:58.500> while<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.980> ping<00:00:59.190> pong<00:00:59.309> balls<00:00:59.550> are

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
that pipe while the ping pong balls are

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.369 
that pipe while the ping pong balls are
inside<00:00:59.969> then<00:01:00.390> theoretically<00:01:00.809> we<00:01:01.260> can

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
inside then theoretically we can

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.439 
inside then theoretically we can
eliminate<00:01:01.559> all<00:01:01.949> air<00:01:02.219> resistance<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:03.180> when<00:01:03.300> we

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
eliminate all air resistance so when we

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.600 
eliminate all air resistance so when we
finally<00:01:03.660> do<00:01:03.989> reintroduce<00:01:04.680> some<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.369> ping

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
finally do reintroduce some the ping

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.510 
finally do reintroduce some the ping
pong<00:01:05.640> ball<00:01:05.850> will<00:01:06.180> exit<00:01:06.950> not<00:01:07.950> looking<00:01:08.340> not

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
pong ball will exit not looking not

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.969 
pong ball will exit not looking not
looking<00:01:12.110> okay<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.170> what<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.409> did<00:01:13.560> was<00:01:13.680> we<00:01:13.710> just

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
looking okay so what we did was we just

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.440 
looking okay so what we did was we just
drilled<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.460> hole<00:01:14.490> into<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.000> pipe<00:01:15.180> we're<00:01:15.330> gonna

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
drilled a hole into the pipe we're gonna

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.420 
drilled a hole into the pipe we're gonna
put<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.810> valve<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.860> valve<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.220> what

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
put this valve in and the valve is what

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.500 
put this valve in and the valve is what
the<00:01:17.610> vacuum<00:01:18.000> pump<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.210> gonna<00:01:18.420> be<00:01:18.540> connected<00:01:18.930> to

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
the vacuum pump is gonna be connected to

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.360 
the vacuum pump is gonna be connected to
that's<00:01:21.170> a<00:01:21.260> great<00:01:21.440> first<00:01:21.620> effort<00:01:21.860> you're

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
that's a great first effort you're

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.300 
that's a great first effort you're
halfway<00:01:22.550> there<00:01:23.800> we're<00:01:24.800> also<00:01:24.920> gonna<00:01:25.100> put<00:01:25.190> some

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
halfway there we're also gonna put some

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.310 
halfway there we're also gonna put some
sealant<00:01:25.880> around<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.300> valve<00:01:26.510> so<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:26.870> tubs

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
sealant around the valve so the tubs

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.960 
sealant around the valve so the tubs
airtight<00:01:27.800> my<00:01:28.040> hands<00:01:28.340> have<00:01:28.430> been<00:01:28.580> training<00:01:28.790> my

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
airtight my hands have been training my

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.610 
airtight my hands have been training my
whole<00:01:29.000> life<00:01:29.180> for<00:01:29.390> this<00:01:29.660> moment<00:01:29.720> oh<00:01:30.200> yeah

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
whole life for this moment oh yeah

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.810 
whole life for this moment oh yeah
would<00:01:30.770> you<00:01:30.860> like<00:01:30.980> to<00:01:31.070> tell<00:01:31.220> us<00:01:31.250> out<00:01:31.460> I<00:01:31.670> just

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
would you like to tell us out I just

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.190 
would you like to tell us out I just
want<00:01:31.940> to<00:01:32.000> go<00:01:32.060> all<00:01:32.180> around<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.450> edge<00:01:32.570> there<00:01:32.840> now

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
want to go all around the edge there now

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.710 
want to go all around the edge there now
we<00:01:33.680> see<00:01:34.100> all<00:01:34.130> fins<00:01:34.490> this<00:01:34.880> might<00:01:35.060> seem<00:01:35.330> like<00:01:35.390> an

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
we see all fins this might seem like an

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.600 
we see all fins this might seem like an
incredibly<00:01:35.840> difficult<00:01:36.410> experiment<00:01:37.010> but<00:01:37.400> it's

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
incredibly difficult experiment but it's

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.100 
incredibly difficult experiment but it's
actually<00:01:38.030> one<00:01:38.150> of<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.300> simplest<00:01:38.690> ones<00:01:38.870> we've

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
actually one of the simplest ones we've

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.390 
actually one of the simplest ones we've
done<00:01:39.320> because<00:01:39.590> all<00:01:39.740> you<00:01:39.890> need<00:01:39.920> is<00:01:40.130> a<00:01:40.160> few

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
done because all you need is a few

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.630 
done because all you need is a few
simple<00:01:40.610> household<00:01:41.060> materials<00:01:41.690> a<00:01:41.870> vacuum<00:01:42.350> pump

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
simple household materials a vacuum pump

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.610 
simple household materials a vacuum pump
PVC<00:01:43.640> pipe<00:01:43.910> couple<00:01:44.630> sheets<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.900> mylar<00:01:45.320> to<00:01:45.440> seal

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
PVC pipe couple sheets of mylar to seal

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.620 
PVC pipe couple sheets of mylar to seal
the<00:01:45.740> ends<00:01:46.040> couple<00:01:46.370> valves<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:47.060> of<00:01:47.330> course

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
the ends couple valves and of course

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.600 
the ends couple valves and of course
ping-pong<00:01:48.230> balls<00:01:48.470> okay<00:01:48.980> so<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.220> epoxy

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
ping-pong balls okay so the epoxy

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.800 
ping-pong balls okay so the epoxy
actually<00:01:49.910> takes<00:01:50.090> a<00:01:50.180> little<00:01:50.300> bit<00:01:50.450> of<00:01:50.540> time<00:01:50.660> to

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
actually takes a little bit of time to

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.990 
actually takes a little bit of time to
set<00:01:51.050> so<00:01:51.320> we<00:01:51.470> have<00:01:51.740> a<00:01:51.980> cannon<00:01:52.370> that<00:01:52.400> has<00:01:52.760> already

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
set so we have a cannon that has already

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.340 
set so we have a cannon that has already
been<00:01:53.210> assembled<00:01:55.210> next<00:01:56.210> step<00:01:56.390> is<00:01:56.630> our<00:01:56.870> mylar

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
been assembled next step is our mylar

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.990 
been assembled next step is our mylar
this<00:01:57.920> is<00:01:58.010> what's<00:01:58.160> going<00:01:58.280> to<00:01:58.370> seal<00:01:58.550> off<00:01:58.730> the<00:01:58.880> end

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
this is what's going to seal off the end

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
this is what's going to seal off the end
of<00:01:59.120> it<00:01:59.210> we<00:01:59.390> want<00:01:59.480> to<00:01:59.630> make<00:01:59.720> sure<00:01:59.750> that<00:01:59.900> it's

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
of it we want to make sure that it's

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.330 
of it we want to make sure that it's
very<00:02:00.200> taut<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:00.680> that<00:02:00.770> there<00:02:00.890> are<00:02:00.920> no<00:02:01.040> creases

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
very taut and that there are no creases

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.980 
very taut and that there are no creases
over<00:02:01.730> this<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.090> we<00:02:02.120> can<00:02:02.300> put<00:02:02.450> this<00:02:02.540> valve<00:02:02.750> on

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
over this and we can put this valve on

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.380 
over this and we can put this valve on
to<00:02:03.140> sort<00:02:03.350> of<00:02:03.410> seal<00:02:03.980> it<00:02:04.130> so<00:02:04.460> our<00:02:04.730> ping-pong<00:02:04.970> ball

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
to sort of seal it so our ping-pong ball

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.970 
to sort of seal it so our ping-pong ball
sits<00:02:05.720> in<00:02:05.870> the<00:02:05.990> back<00:02:06.200> of<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.410> tube<00:02:06.620> there's<00:02:06.830> no

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
sits in the back of the tube there's no

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.050 
sits in the back of the tube there's no
air<00:02:07.160> in<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.340> tube<00:02:07.490> so<00:02:07.640> there's<00:02:07.790> no<00:02:07.880> air

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
air in the tube so there's no air

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.910 
air in the tube so there's no air
resistance<00:02:08.090> anymore<00:02:08.810> we<00:02:09.170> pop<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.649> seal<00:02:09.830> at

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
resistance anymore we pop the seal at

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.560 
resistance anymore we pop the seal at
the<00:02:09.950> back<00:02:10.130> of<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.340> tube<00:02:10.520> air<00:02:10.700> rushes<00:02:11.240> in<00:02:11.390> at

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
the back of the tube air rushes in at

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.090 
the back of the tube air rushes in at
the<00:02:11.810> speed<00:02:12.050> of<00:02:12.140> sound<00:02:12.320> and<00:02:12.500> if<00:02:12.590> our<00:02:12.710> tube<00:02:12.920> is

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
the speed of sound and if our tube is

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.770 
the speed of sound and if our tube is
long<00:02:13.250> enough<00:02:13.520> hopefully<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.180> ping-pong<00:02:14.570> ball

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
long enough hopefully the ping-pong ball

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.020 
long enough hopefully the ping-pong ball
exits<00:02:15.320> at<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.890> speed<00:02:16.100> of<00:02:16.220> sound<00:02:16.250> as<00:02:16.580> well<00:02:16.730> all

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
exits at the speed of sound as well all

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.730 
exits at the speed of sound as well all
right<00:02:17.090> now<00:02:17.510> all<00:02:17.540> that's<00:02:17.900> left<00:02:18.170> is<00:02:18.320> to<00:02:18.380> shoot

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
right now all that's left is to shoot

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.160 
right now all that's left is to shoot

that's<00:03:29.660> not<00:03:29.840> kosher

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.050 

now<00:03:39.499> I<00:03:39.530> can't<00:03:39.859> think<00:03:40.069> of<00:03:40.129> a<00:03:40.189> single<00:03:40.400> practical

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
now I can't think of a single practical

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.539 
now I can't think of a single practical
application<00:03:41.629> for<00:03:41.780> this<00:03:42.189> but<00:03:43.189> that<00:03:43.310> doesn't

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
application for this but that doesn't
