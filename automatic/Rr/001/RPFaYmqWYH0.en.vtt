00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.640
 after watching the tesla car like it 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:14.190
 start with the brake pedal 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:14.190
 so decided to make myself also 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:24.700
 turn on the ignition so all no 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:27.340
 Emotion machine starts up now after 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.670
 when starting all starter is no longer 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.730
 will turn on until the engine is 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:37.180
 stalled no i mean i didn't turn off 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.170
 Ignition doesnâ€™t stall again 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.060
 the battery light turns on 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.530
 Here he can work in a few 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:49.510
 modes, respectively, is click and 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.050
 pressed that is no matter how it is there 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.149
 click so on and so forth then 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:00.250
 there is for example here I keep up the ignition 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:01.300
 off including the car immediately 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.319
 everything starts up 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:09.340
 brake pedal adequately means in my 

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:15.159
 case there is still all tied to the sensor 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:16.840
 speeds like for example if a light bulb 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.479
 the battery lights up somewhere on the road 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.340
 this machine will start all movements 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.069
 equals them will not turn on until 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.979
 the car's not entirely stop it 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:29.889
 of course a huge plus here for the rest 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.020
 very handy thing that I myself 

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:34.479
 while getting used to 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.319
 Here, but in general, while I say the impression 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.529
 the good 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:41.439
 that means one more such thing 

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:43.749
 for example, when you are standing somewhere on a knoll 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.719
 and you need to move without a pullback give 

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:48.310
 for example, if the car stalls when 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.679
 naturally immediately automatically 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.829
 click there clutch brake yes and 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:55.499
 the machine accordingly instantly 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.270
 can get started can now 

00:01:55.499 --> 00:02:01.770
 demonstrate that is now she have 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:07.600
 us at speed 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:11.739
 Here I keep my foot on the brake and let go 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:15.700
 clutch i.e. car immediately 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:19.230
 wound up accordingly very comfortable 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.230
 here's the thing
