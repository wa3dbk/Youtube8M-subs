 films 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.740
 m in this case is 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.750
 Sylvester Stallone who starred in 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.680
 this movie 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.540

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.129
 20 I understand the work with the program 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:44.979

 also interesting to see 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.639
 information later than June 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.549
 laying on curious moments 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.099
 related to the movie directly 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.609
 movie rating

 the most respectable 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:03.009
 rating which is displayed on all 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:04.519
 movie sites

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:07.239
 even in hollywood 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.439
 respect this opinion this is an encyclopedia 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.819
 this site because 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:12.889
 percent 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.290
 This assessment become the viewers themselves vote if 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:18.079
 return on the main school building 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.560
 there is a list of all sections 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.290
 which became such data 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.469
 are given 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:27.469
 at the same time there is 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:29.679
 look more popular 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:32.659
 just watch 250 films 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.540
 start already a long period of time escape 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.489
 shawshank comes first 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.129
 and then the word n ​​who knows because the first 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.459
 the second third of a lot kopeikin m 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.619
 movie start 

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:50.609
 a unique option that moved on 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.379
 such a high position 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:53.999
 as a rule there is a very 

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:56.629
 old movies but here's a toy story 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.479
 or the last movie about this they also took 

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:02.769
 got pretty good reviews there 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.639
 also anti-rating itself is possible 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.539
 say bacman table and above are films 

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:09.009
 which 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:11.759
 do not in any case look the most 

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:14.469
 the very sump film is some sort of 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:16.519
 stupor action movies 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.539
 never watch this movie like this 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.180
 actors who shame it 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.800
 movie 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.830
 there is 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.259
 so that new ideas for example 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:29.539
 or watching 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.309
 You can see that he is from the first yesterday 

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:34.050
 August 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.229
 such films here we have adjusted people 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.229
 serials and so on 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.010
 also interesting to see the protocol 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:44.809
 people 

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:47.909
 he who was born from the actors today 

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:52.709
 also it became possible to go to the page 

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:54.669
 this which then carries 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.490
 habitual navigation 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.490
 or 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.229
 too to choose 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.169
 date is valid 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.979
 who was born tomorrow 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.849
 maybe i hope the second of september 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:12.729
 stated what is needed now 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.069
 This is how the program looks like. 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:18.050
 the poet is very comfortable we have become and most often 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.470
 use it a year 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.080
 m moment of watching a movie when you can with 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.580
 This position we looked at what 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.759
 actors star in this movie 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.020
 most often when 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.129
 some kind of gunpowder with my friends he 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:32.160
 this or that actor participated in it 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.919
 the movie 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.110
 it is this program that becomes 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.729
 the final word 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:40.589
 It was a review of the program for the money 

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:42.479
 for the edge of the project specifically for those 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:42.860
 to whom
