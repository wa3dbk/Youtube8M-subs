keep<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.739> same<00:03:56.010> draft<00:03:56.670> now<00:03:57.569> that's<00:03:57.780> a<00:03:57.900> good

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
keep the same draft now that's a good

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.479 
keep the same draft now that's a good
question<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.500> I<00:03:58.560> think<00:03:58.769> that<00:03:58.920> may<00:03:59.189> come<00:03:59.459> down

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
question and I think that may come down

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.520 
question and I think that may come down
to<00:03:59.909> player<00:04:00.359> preference<00:04:00.840> again<00:04:01.079> if<00:04:01.199> they<00:04:01.349> both

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
to player preference again if they both

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.319 
to player preference again if they both
agree<00:04:01.889> one<00:04:02.220> way<00:04:02.370> or<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.579> other<00:04:02.639> then<00:04:03.060> it'll<00:04:03.269> be

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
agree one way or the other then it'll be

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.089 
agree one way or the other then it'll be
fine<00:04:03.569> if<00:04:03.780> they<00:04:03.900> disagree<00:04:04.379> that's<00:04:04.889> what<00:04:05.040> the

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
fine if they disagree that's what the

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.439 
fine if they disagree that's what the
admins<00:04:05.340> have<00:04:05.459> to<00:04:05.609> step<00:04:05.819> in<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.150> indecision

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:08.930 
admins have to step in and indecision
like<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.959> situation<00:04:07.260> like<00:04:07.739> this<00:04:07.889> it<00:04:08.760> seems

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
like the situation like this it seems

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.849 
like the situation like this it seems
like<00:04:09.000> teams<00:04:09.359> are<00:04:09.599> more<00:04:09.840> often<00:04:10.109> than<00:04:10.260> not<00:04:10.319> very
