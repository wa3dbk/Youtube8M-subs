00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.210

 musicstar tv you see on my 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.210
 iphone this is ready today 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.189
 it's about an accessory for 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.830
 smartphones or tablets and that and 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.020
 a small microphone a so-called 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.640
 lavallee microphones are these 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.320
 microphones like me here now too 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.230
 always wear with the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.210
 I record my voice and stuff 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.840
 is also available from the company rohde 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.440
 australia suitable for iphones or 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.870
 other smartphones and tablets since that 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.969
 product is just that big and you have it now 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.469
 so can not see I'm going now 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.570
 in the close-up on change 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.420
 and then we'll take a close look 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.219
 on yes I dare to say that the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.470
 here is really the smallest microphone 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.780
 that I ever at musicstore tv 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.030
 So I really introduced you very much 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.720
 small and unobtrusive on the clothes too 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.270
 I hide with this clip 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.250
 already attached to it 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.080
 man's shirt or blouse 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.140
 attach and with included 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.270
 Also included here is this little one 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.270
 fortunately windbreak 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.360
 underneath at the bottom one 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.189
 That's why Rubber Ring keeps it special 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.990
 good on the microphone that is a very 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.020
 nice little feature and stuff like that 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.670
 The whole thing looks completely assembled then 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.700
 I would say I connect that now 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.310
 Let's do it with my iphone and we will 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.829
 my test record so that yes I have 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.030
 Now here is my iphone 5 as you can see in 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.770
 a slightly thicker rubber protective cover 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.170
 then the problem that the plug then 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.140
 because not fit because the hole then 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.820
 too small is not, however, in this case the 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.799
 plug of rothe who have it 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.189
 thought or that is a very slim one 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.649
 stecker design easily with it 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.950
 Protective cover can make good contact 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.870
 with the iphone 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.330
 The microphone manufacturer Rohde offers 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.550
 an own app with which one the marta 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.349
 can operate river and audio 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.090
 record for example here with 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.000
 can do his iphone 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.530
 the m versions of it are free and 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.769
 slightly restricted by the 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.790
 variety of functions the full functions 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.780
 you only get in the paid 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.790
 variant 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.519
 fair enough you have to say that 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.030
 of course with any app even 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:40.879
 with the factory integrated in the aos 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.319
 system to make the audio recording 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.840
 So the microphone is full 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.670
 Compatible with any software and such 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.160
 Everyone can think for themselves whether he 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.470
 the special or app needed or 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.670
 Not 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.970
 I will now for the recording times 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.450
 start using red app in the version 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.950
 the x 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.319
 then I can get down here on the 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.709
 go receptive symbol and then he shows 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.150
 me the available sampling rates 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.640
 mono is clear I have only in mono 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.739
 Microphone connected and reminds me 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.810
 below still with the big button that 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.310
 I'm going to spend some money, please 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.079
 and buy the pro version as I said 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.239
 you can do that then you have everyone 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:20.769
 possibilities or you take each one 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.609
 Any other recording will secure that 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:26.959
 and if I have a recording now 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:29.720
 Just want to add to plus and 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:33.920

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:37.010

 plus as I said everything in real time can 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.760
 Here you can see the waveform 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:48.019

 turn on the normal microphone with 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.150
 I usually record my sound 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.799
 Now if you should ask yourself how 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.420
 I come to the audio recording 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.280
 actually ran on my data 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.010
 that too is very easy 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.989
 as follows in the rue of the app 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.000

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.539

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.370
 Recording window and there I have here 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.949
