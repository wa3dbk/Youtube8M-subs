00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
expected let's take a look at the first

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.280 
expected let's take a look at the first
one

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
one

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.200 
one
you<00:00:10.679> can<00:00:10.830> see<00:00:10.980> here<00:00:11.160> that<00:00:11.340> total<00:00:11.730> war<00:00:11.820> Attila

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
you can see here that total war Attila

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.600 
you can see here that total war Attila
is<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.750> victory<00:00:13.170> by<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.530> decent<00:00:13.860> margin<00:00:14.099> it's

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
is the victory by a decent margin it's

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.689 
is the victory by a decent margin it's
got<00:00:14.790> more<00:00:15.059> than<00:00:15.560> it<00:00:16.560> looks<00:00:16.800> like<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.220> second

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
got more than it looks like the second

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.599 
got more than it looks like the second
and<00:00:18.000> third<00:00:18.449> options<00:00:18.869> combined<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:20.039> it's<00:00:20.430> a

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
and third options combined so it's a

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.010 
and third options combined so it's a
pretty<00:00:20.850> clear<00:00:21.180> winner<00:00:21.420> then<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.630> guess<00:00:21.900> that's

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
pretty clear winner then I guess that's

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.330 
pretty clear winner then I guess that's
what<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.230> expected<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.890> think<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.130> might<00:00:23.250> have

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
what I expected I think I might have

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.890 
what I expected I think I might have
mentioned<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:23.760> in<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.939> video<00:00:24.330> when<00:00:24.869> I

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
mentioned that in the video when I

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.080 
mentioned that in the video when I
release<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.439> vote<00:00:25.680> anyway<00:00:26.070> it's<00:00:26.970> also

release this vote anyway it's also

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.640 
release this vote anyway it's also
interesting<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.510> see<00:00:27.720> what<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.990> other<00:00:28.289> sort

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
interesting to see what the other sort

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.380 
interesting to see what the other sort
of<00:00:28.710> top<00:00:28.980> ranking<00:00:29.429> things<00:00:29.640> are<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:29.970> can<00:00:30.119> see<00:00:30.269> on

of top ranking things are you can see on

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.659 
of top ranking things are you can see on
this<00:00:30.510> pie<00:00:30.750> chart<00:00:30.890> it's<00:00:31.890> mostly<00:00:32.189> all<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.399> total

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
this pie chart it's mostly all the total

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.030 
this pie chart it's mostly all the total
war<00:00:32.940> games<00:00:33.210> are<00:00:33.480> there<00:00:33.930> forming<00:00:34.469> more<00:00:34.890> than

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
war games are there forming more than

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.889 
war games are there forming more than
three-quarters<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.940> but<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.540> with<00:00:36.690> there

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
three-quarters of it but in with there

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.530 
three-quarters of it but in with there
is<00:00:37.110> Mountain<00:00:37.620> blade<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.760> geeky<00:00:38.910> Cujo<00:00:39.300> mod

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
is Mountain blade the geeky Cujo mod

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.869 
is Mountain blade the geeky Cujo mod
specifically<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.290> Crusader<00:00:40.739> Kings<00:00:41.129> has

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
specifically and Crusader Kings has

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.549 
specifically and Crusader Kings has
pretty<00:00:42.090> much<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.390> line<00:00:42.420> with<00:00:42.629> what<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.350> thought

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
pretty much in line with what I thought

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.080 
pretty much in line with what I thought
would<00:00:43.710> happen<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.250> think<00:00:44.610> that's<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
would happen I think that's the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.090 
would happen I think that's the
crossover<00:00:45.570> between<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.110> total<00:00:46.770> war

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
crossover between the total war

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.830 
crossover between the total war
community<00:00:47.610> as<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.059> bit<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.390> crossover<00:00:48.660> with

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
community as a bit of crossover with

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.900 
community as a bit of crossover with
mountain<00:00:49.170> blade<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.530> Crusader<00:00:49.890> Kings<00:00:50.219> but

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
mountain blade and Crusader Kings but

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.189 
mountain blade and Crusader Kings but
anyway<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.210> that's<00:00:51.360> interesting<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.050> know<00:00:52.170> a

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
anyway so that's interesting to know a

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.139 
anyway so that's interesting to know a
tiller<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.770> going<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.100> be<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.340> next<00:00:53.579> series

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
tiller is going to be the next series

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.119 
tiller is going to be the next series
and<00:00:54.570> actually<00:00:55.050> lots<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.350> things<00:00:55.620> like<00:00:55.829> further

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
and actually lots of things like further

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.950 
and actually lots of things like further
down<00:00:56.399> still<00:00:56.730> got<00:00:57.000> votes<00:00:57.300> which<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.660> wasn't

those<00:01:34.200> ones<00:01:34.470> were<00:01:34.740> just<00:01:35.640> below<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:35.970> avoid<00:01:36.329> in

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
those ones were just below to avoid in

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.999 
those ones were just below to avoid in
the<00:01:36.509> interest<00:01:36.990> probably<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.409> total<00:01:37.650> war

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
the interest probably a total war

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.950 
the interest probably a total war
dominating<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.000> interest<00:01:39.299> polls<00:01:39.540> or<00:01:39.720> not

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
dominating the interest polls or not

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.390 
dominating the interest polls or not
quite<00:01:40.259> as<00:01:40.500> much<00:01:40.650> as<00:01:40.829> dominating<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
quite as much as dominating the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.300 
quite as much as dominating the
auricular<00:01:41.549> poll<00:01:41.909> but<00:01:42.479> anyway<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.259> end<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:44.189> all

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
auricular poll but anyway the end of all

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.490 
auricular poll but anyway the end of all
this<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.850> total<00:01:45.479> Attila<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.079> going<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.409> be

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
this is that total Attila is going to be

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.630 
this is that total Attila is going to be
the<00:01:46.619> next

is actually realize that one of the

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.400 
is actually realize that one of the
things<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.090> had<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.359> do<00:03:24.480> was<00:03:24.660> start<00:03:24.900> making<00:03:25.290> it

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.110 
things I had to do was start making it
before<00:03:25.799> I<00:03:25.829> actually<00:03:25.980> announced<00:03:26.609> the<00:03:26.700> results

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
before I actually announced the results

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.670 
before I actually announced the results
actually<00:03:27.239> started<00:03:27.660> making<00:03:27.959> this<00:03:28.079> video<00:03:28.410> so

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
actually started making this video so

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.589 
actually started making this video so
we're<00:03:29.400> making<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.790> Atilla<00:03:30.150> video<00:03:30.389> like<00:03:30.569> five

we're making the Atilla video like five

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.180 
we're making the Atilla video like five
days<00:03:31.019> ago<00:03:31.169> because<00:03:31.739> there<00:03:31.829> wasn't<00:03:31.950> going<00:03:32.130> to

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
days ago because there wasn't going to

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.379 
days ago because there wasn't going to
be<00:03:32.250> time<00:03:32.459> to<00:03:32.609> make<00:03:32.760> it<00:03:32.940> during<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.269> week

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
be time to make it during the week

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.059 
be time to make it during the week
especially<00:03:34.260> because<00:03:34.620> I'm<00:03:34.769> also<00:03:34.889> making

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
especially because I'm also making

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:36.620 
especially because I'm also making
mastani<00:03:35.430> tales<00:03:35.760> at<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:35.970> same<00:03:36.180> time<00:03:36.450> I<00:03:36.480> think

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
mastani tales at the same time I think

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.229 
mastani tales at the same time I think
the<00:03:36.840> ideal<00:03:37.290> thing<00:03:37.590> for<00:03:37.620> me<00:03:38.130> would<00:03:38.730> be<00:03:38.880> to<00:03:39.030> kind

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
the ideal thing for me would be to kind

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.460 
the ideal thing for me would be to kind
of<00:03:39.269> have<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:39.540> an

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
of have a an

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.980 
of have a an
of<00:03:40.770> season<00:03:41.280> one<00:03:41.550> to<00:03:41.760> masala<00:03:42.120> tel<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.780> reach

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
of season one to masala tel so to reach

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.830 
of season one to masala tel so to reach
some<00:03:43.200> sort<00:03:43.230> of<00:03:43.440> stable<00:03:43.970> situation<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.150> then

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
some sort of stable situation and then

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.690 
some sort of stable situation and then
stop<00:03:46.230> making<00:03:46.530> that<00:03:46.650> for<00:03:46.920> a<00:03:46.950> bit<00:03:47.190> so<00:03:47.370> I<00:03:47.430> can

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
stop making that for a bit so I can

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.120 
stop making that for a bit so I can
focus<00:03:48.210> on<00:03:48.540> making<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:48.930> start<00:03:49.230> of<00:03:49.410> this<00:03:49.590> series

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
focus on making the start of this series

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.100 
focus on making the start of this series
and<00:03:50.310> then<00:03:50.760> perhaps<00:03:51.030> build<00:03:51.360> up<00:03:51.510> slowly<00:03:51.780> build

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
and then perhaps build up slowly build

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.960 
and then perhaps build up slowly build
up<00:03:52.170> a<00:03:52.260> backlog<00:03:52.710> of<00:03:52.770> my<00:03:52.950> solid<00:03:53.130> Tales<00:03:53.460> episodes

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
up a backlog of my solid Tales episodes

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.910 
up a backlog of my solid Tales episodes
and<00:03:54.240> there<00:03:54.480> so<00:03:54.630> I've<00:03:54.720> got<00:03:54.930> some<00:03:55.170> in<00:03:55.320> advance<00:03:55.650> so

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
and there so I've got some in advance so

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.130 
and there so I've got some in advance so
I<00:03:55.950> can<00:03:56.010> then<00:03:56.160> release<00:03:56.550> a<00:03:56.820> season<00:03:57.570> to<00:03:57.750> a<00:03:57.780> bit

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
I can then release a season to a bit

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.200 
I can then release a season to a bit
later<00:03:58.470> with<00:03:59.310> some<00:03:59.550> of<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.670> episodes<00:03:59.970> already

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
later with some of the episodes already

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.790 
later with some of the episodes already
made<00:04:00.420> so<00:04:00.660> I'm<00:04:00.750> not<00:04:00.900> sort<00:04:01.110> of<00:04:01.140> rushing<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.710> make

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
made so I'm not sort of rushing to make

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.440 
made so I'm not sort of rushing to make
both<00:04:02.010> suitors<00:04:02.340> at<00:04:02.460> the<00:04:02.520> same<00:04:02.700> time<00:04:02.940> for<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.240> bit

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
both suitors at the same time for a bit

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.360 
both suitors at the same time for a bit
difficult<00:04:03.630> I<00:04:04.020> drown<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.100> we'll<00:04:05.190> get

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
difficult I drown and we'll get

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.520 
difficult I drown and we'll get
something<00:04:05.520> there<00:04:05.820> and<00:04:06.060> I'm<00:04:06.570> not<00:04:06.750> too<00:04:06.930> sure<00:04:07.170> the

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
something there and I'm not too sure the

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.990 
something there and I'm not too sure the
idea<00:04:07.740> would<00:04:07.800> be<00:04:07.860> that<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.100> second<00:04:08.460> series<00:04:08.640> is

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
idea would be that the second series is

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.480 
idea would be that the second series is
sort<00:04:09.210> of<00:04:09.320> 50<00:04:10.320> years<00:04:10.560> later<00:04:10.620> maybe<00:04:11.190> like<00:04:11.460> a

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
sort of 50 years later maybe like a

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:12.950 
sort of 50 years later maybe like a
hundred<00:04:11.880> years<00:04:12.030> later<00:04:12.270> I<00:04:12.390> don't<00:04:12.570> know<00:04:12.660> to<00:04:12.720> some

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:12.960 
hundred years later I don't know to some

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.260 
hundred years later I don't know to some
jump<00:04:13.320> in<00:04:13.500> time<00:04:13.800> so<00:04:14.160> go<00:04:14.520> forward<00:04:15.030> through<00:04:15.180> a

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
jump in time so go forward through a

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.570 
jump in time so go forward through a
vaguely<00:04:15.480> stable<00:04:16.140> period<00:04:16.440> of<00:04:16.590> history<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:17.459> go

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
vaguely stable period of history to go

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.949 
vaguely stable period of history to go
back<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:17.940> all<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.120> world<00:04:18.330> looks<00:04:18.570> like<00:04:18.660> in<00:04:18.870> the

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
back to all the world looks like in the

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.099 
back to all the world looks like in the
future<00:04:19.370> and<00:04:20.370> see<00:04:20.730> what<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.630> most<00:04:21.810> Harlan

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
future and see what the most Harlan

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.870 
future and see what the most Harlan
Republic<00:04:22.500> is<00:04:22.620> up<00:04:22.740> to<00:04:22.920> it<00:04:23.220> is<00:04:23.400> even<00:04:23.670> still<00:04:23.760> a

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
Republic is up to it is even still a

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.000 
Republic is up to it is even still a
republic<00:04:24.300> at<00:04:24.420> all<00:04:24.540> but<00:04:25.380> anyway<00:04:25.650> so<00:04:25.710> that's<00:04:25.890> the

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
republic at all but anyway so that's the

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.940 
republic at all but anyway so that's the
idea<00:04:26.130> there<00:04:26.690> so<00:04:27.690> now<00:04:27.870> you<00:04:28.200> just<00:04:28.380> need<00:04:28.500> to<00:04:28.740> look

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
idea there so now you just need to look

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.860 
idea there so now you just need to look
out<00:04:29.160> for<00:04:29.520> hopefully<00:04:29.820> one<00:04:30.090> week's<00:04:30.270> time<00:04:30.360> the
