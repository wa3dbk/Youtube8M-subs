00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
one of the reasons I will use them

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.130 
one of the reasons I will use them
around<00:00:22.970> bridges<00:00:23.970> because<00:00:24.810> you're<00:00:24.960> going<00:00:25.080> to

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
around bridges because you're going to

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.019 
around bridges because you're going to
lose<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.289> lot<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.590> lures<00:00:25.830> doing<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.550> the

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
lose a lot of lures doing this and the

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.790 
lose a lot of lures doing this and the
bottom<00:00:27.300> one<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.720> just<00:00:28.199> really<00:00:28.590> love<00:00:28.740> that

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
bottom one I just really love that

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.500 
bottom one I just really love that
aggressive<00:00:29.400> action<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.849> cadence<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.300> it's

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
aggressive action the cadence that it's

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.200 
aggressive action the cadence that it's
got<00:00:30.720> fantastic<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.890> suspends<00:00:32.520> really

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
got fantastic and it suspends really

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.180 
got fantastic and it suspends really
really<00:00:33.510> well<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.469> jacks<00:00:34.739> love<00:00:34.950> both<00:00:35.160> of

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
really well so the jacks love both of

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.100 
really well so the jacks love both of
these<00:00:35.489> let<00:00:36.030> me<00:00:36.149> show<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.390> how<00:00:36.570> I'll<00:00:36.719> use<00:00:36.930> them

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
these let me show you how I'll use them

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.500 
these let me show you how I'll use them
so<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.129> way<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.579> approach<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:39.090> bridge<00:00:39.329> I

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
so the way that you approach a bridge I

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.350 
so the way that you approach a bridge I
think<00:00:39.719> it's<00:00:39.809> fairly<00:00:40.020> important<00:00:40.879> at<00:00:41.879> least<00:00:41.940> in

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
think it's fairly important at least in

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.119 
think it's fairly important at least in
increasing<00:00:43.050> your<00:00:43.079> chances<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.739> be<00:00:43.829> able<00:00:44.040> to

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
increasing your chances to be able to

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.799 
increasing your chances to be able to
get<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.399> first<00:00:44.610> strike<00:00:45.000> being<00:00:45.239> able<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.629> get

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
get that first strike being able to get

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.299 
get that first strike being able to get
a<00:00:45.840> jack<00:00:46.140> out<00:00:46.320> sometimes<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.070> out<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.219> your

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
a jack out sometimes it's out of your

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.830 
a jack out sometimes it's out of your
control<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:48.180> because<00:00:48.329> they're<00:00:48.450> so<00:00:48.600> powerful

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
control just because they're so powerful

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.799 
control just because they're so powerful
obviously<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:50.219> my<00:00:50.789> approach<00:00:51.090> I'm<00:00:51.570> fairly

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
obviously but my approach I'm fairly

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.229 
obviously but my approach I'm fairly
stealthy<00:00:52.350> usually<00:00:52.770> I'm<00:00:52.980> with<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.579> tide<00:00:53.850> here

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
stealthy usually I'm with the tide here

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.630 
stealthy usually I'm with the tide here
so<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.420> was<00:00:54.539> running<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.050> way<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.219> my<00:00:56.399> lure

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
so I was running this way and so my lure

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.160 
so I was running this way and so my lure
retrieve<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.180> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.660> with<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.960> tide

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
retrieve is going to be with the tide

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.930 
retrieve is going to be with the tide
like<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> natural<00:00:59.129> bait<00:00:59.340> movement<00:00:59.820> would<00:00:59.879> be

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
like a natural bait movement would be

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.460 
like a natural bait movement would be
and<00:01:00.329> I'll<00:01:00.930> sit<00:01:01.289> off<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.829> pylons<00:01:02.699> and

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
and I'll sit off the pylons and

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.350 
and I'll sit off the pylons and
generally<00:01:04.470> my<00:01:04.619> first<00:01:04.920> casts<00:01:07.850> right<00:01:08.850> up<00:01:09.060> past

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
generally my first casts right up past

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.480 
generally my first casts right up past
the<00:01:09.600> n1<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.470> bring<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.860> back<00:01:10.890> along<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
the n1 and just bring it back along the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.550 
the n1 and just bring it back along the
side<00:01:11.729> usually<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.720> fairly<00:01:13.200> consistent

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
side usually a fairly consistent

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.880 
side usually a fairly consistent
retrieve<00:01:14.159> like<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:15.409> just<00:01:16.409> looking<00:01:16.680> for<00:01:16.860> a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
retrieve like this just looking for a

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.510 
retrieve like this just looking for a
reaction<00:01:17.070> strike<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:18.000> then<00:01:19.070> if<00:01:20.070> nothing

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
reaction strike and then if nothing

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.060 
reaction strike and then if nothing
happens<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.000> first<00:01:21.240> one<00:01:21.479> or<00:01:21.509> two<00:01:22.040> I've<00:01:23.040> got

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
happens in the first one or two I've got

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.039 
happens in the first one or two I've got
this<00:01:23.400> Samari<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:24.000> I'll<00:01:24.210> be<00:01:24.450> really<00:01:24.689> twitchy

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
this Samari on I'll be really twitchy

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.490 
this Samari on I'll be really twitchy
with<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:26.000> stall<00:01:27.000> heaps

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.650 

and<00:01:30.950> then<00:01:31.160> go<00:01:31.340> to<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:31.610> other<00:01:31.760> side<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:32.420> then

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
and then go to the other side and then

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.540 
and then go to the other side and then
try<00:01:32.900> the<00:01:32.960> other<00:01:33.200> side<00:01:33.290> of<00:01:33.650> the<00:01:33.710> bridge<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.400> the

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
try the other side of the bridge so the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.790 
try the other side of the bridge so the
other<00:01:34.700> pylons<00:01:35.210> another<00:01:35.780> good<00:01:35.990> cast<00:01:36.260> is<00:01:36.530> right

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
other pylons another good cast is right

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.400 
other pylons another good cast is right
up<00:01:37.010> into<00:01:37.910> the<00:01:38.090> shallows<00:01:38.510> if<00:01:38.750> you<00:01:38.840> can<00:01:38.960> see<00:01:39.200> that

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
up into the shallows if you can see that

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.010 
up into the shallows if you can see that
and<00:01:39.680> just<00:01:40.550> bring<00:01:40.790> it<00:01:40.820> down<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.300> batter<00:01:41.510> of<00:01:41.810> the

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
and just bring it down the batter of the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.910 
and just bring it down the batter of the
of<00:01:42.260> the<00:01:42.410> rocks<00:01:46.870> again<00:01:47.870> lots<00:01:48.230> of<00:01:48.380> twitches<00:01:48.800> and

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
of the rocks again lots of twitches and

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.970 
of the rocks again lots of twitches and
stalls<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:50.110> that<00:01:51.110> movement<00:01:51.440> of<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.800> lure

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
stalls and that movement of the lure

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.950 
stalls and that movement of the lure
will<00:01:52.460> just<00:01:52.700> throw<00:01:52.880> out<00:01:53.120> a<00:01:53.150> heap<00:01:53.390> a<00:01:53.540> light<00:01:53.750> or

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
will just throw out a heap a light or

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.560 
will just throw out a heap a light or
refract<00:01:54.410> like<00:01:54.680> these<00:01:54.920> gold<00:01:55.190> laws<00:01:55.460> I<00:01:55.730> love<00:01:56.450> the

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
refract like these gold laws I love the

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.420 
refract like these gold laws I love the
way<00:01:56.690> they<00:01:56.840> do<00:01:56.900> that<00:01:57.520> so<00:01:58.520> once<00:01:58.880> I've<00:01:59.060> done<00:01:59.090> that

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
way they do that so once I've done that

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.760 
way they do that so once I've done that
I'll<00:02:01.430> head<00:02:01.910> up<00:02:02.060> fairly<00:02:02.360> quietly<00:02:02.840> into<00:02:03.650> the

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
I'll head up fairly quietly into the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.850 
I'll head up fairly quietly into the
middle<00:02:04.040> of<00:02:04.160> the<00:02:04.220> bridge<00:02:06.940> and<00:02:08.350> just<00:02:09.350> park<00:02:09.619> up

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
middle of the bridge and just park up

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.680 
middle of the bridge and just park up
and<00:02:10.070> start<00:02:10.310> casting<00:02:10.550> little<00:02:11.090> flick<00:02:11.330> casts

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
and start casting little flick casts

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.840 
and start casting little flick casts
in-between<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:12.380> stalling<00:02:13.370> when<00:02:13.490> you<00:02:13.580> get<00:02:13.730> in

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
in-between and stalling when you get in

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.460 
in-between and stalling when you get in
between<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.300> pylons<00:02:15.310> lots<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.459> stalls<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.470> if

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
between the pylons lots of stalls and if

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.199 
between the pylons lots of stalls and if
there's<00:02:18.740> a<00:02:18.800> shadow<00:02:19.040> line<00:02:19.370> that's<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.790> really

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
there's a shadow line that's a really

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.940 
there's a shadow line that's a really
good<00:02:20.390> point<00:02:20.630> where<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.170> where<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.560> shadows

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
good point where the where the shadows

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.150 
good point where the where the shadows
cast<00:02:22.250> under<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.760> bridge<00:02:23.000> you<00:02:23.980> know<00:02:24.980> about

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
cast under the bridge you know about

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.860 
cast under the bridge you know about
Jackson<00:02:25.640> really<00:02:25.850> light-sensitive<00:02:26.420> so<00:02:26.750> they

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
Jackson really light-sensitive so they

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.750 
Jackson really light-sensitive so they
love<00:02:27.080> both<00:02:27.290> shadows<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.040> shadow<00:02:28.280> lines<00:02:28.610> a

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
love both shadows and the shadow lines a

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.540 
love both shadows and the shadow lines a
lot<00:02:28.880> of<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.030> time<00:02:29.209> they'll<00:02:29.390> sit<00:02:29.630> on<00:02:29.720> them<00:02:29.870> and

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
lot of the time they'll sit on them and

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.460 
lot of the time they'll sit on them and
so<00:02:31.550> I'll<00:02:31.700> just<00:02:31.910> cast<00:02:32.180> repeatedly<00:02:32.959> in<00:02:33.080> between

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
so I'll just cast repeatedly in between

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.380 
so I'll just cast repeatedly in between
these<00:02:33.680> pylons<00:02:33.980> then<00:02:34.400> try<00:02:34.640> this<00:02:34.700> side<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:37.400> my

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
these pylons then try this side and my

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.750 
these pylons then try this side and my
favorite<00:02:38.900> spots<00:02:39.230> in<00:02:39.410> bridges<00:02:39.860> are<00:02:40.070> around<00:02:40.610> the

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
favorite spots in bridges are around the

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.120 
favorite spots in bridges are around the
ends<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:41.360> usually<00:02:42.290> if<00:02:42.380> you've<00:02:42.500> ever<00:02:42.650> seen<00:02:42.950> the

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
ends and usually if you've ever seen the

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.340 
ends and usually if you've ever seen the
sand<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.239> way<00:02:44.390> that<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:44.690> tide<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.290> the

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
sand and the way that the tide and the

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.170 
sand and the way that the tide and the
turbulence<00:02:45.860> around<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.340> end<00:02:46.489> pylons<00:02:46.940> works

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
turbulence around the end pylons works

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.000 
turbulence around the end pylons works
there's<00:02:47.600> usually<00:02:47.750> big<00:02:48.110> holes<00:02:48.440> at<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.860> end

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
there's usually big holes at the end

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.009 
there's usually big holes at the end
points<00:02:49.459> and<00:02:49.640> a<00:02:50.180> lot<00:02:50.209> of<00:02:50.360> time<00:02:50.600> that's<00:02:50.750> where

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
points and a lot of time that's where

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.290 
points and a lot of time that's where
the<00:02:51.080> jacks<00:02:51.320> will<00:02:51.470> sit<00:02:51.709> so<00:02:53.800> sometimes<00:02:55.120> you<00:02:56.120> can

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
the jacks will sit so sometimes you can

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.479 
the jacks will sit so sometimes you can
go<00:02:56.480> for<00:02:56.750> like<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.930> diagonal<00:02:57.380> cast<00:02:57.830> around<00:02:58.130> the

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
go for like a diagonal cast around the

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.910 
go for like a diagonal cast around the
first<00:02:58.760> pylon<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.510> bring<00:03:00.290> it<00:03:00.380> down<00:03:00.590> really

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
first pylon and bring it down really

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.770 
first pylon and bring it down really
close

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.630 

and<00:03:04.780> then<00:03:04.960> if<00:03:05.080> you<00:03:05.170> hook<00:03:05.320> something<00:03:05.650> this<00:03:06.520> is

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
and then if you hook something this is

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.640 
and then if you hook something this is
personal<00:03:07.120> preference<00:03:07.510> but<00:03:07.540> for<00:03:07.750> me<00:03:07.900> if<00:03:08.350> I<00:03:08.410> hook

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
personal preference but for me if I hook

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.340 
personal preference but for me if I hook
something<00:03:08.920> if<00:03:09.580> I<00:03:09.820> feel<00:03:10.120> any<00:03:10.420> resistance<00:03:10.870> like

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
something if I feel any resistance like

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.660 
something if I feel any resistance like
it's<00:03:11.500> got<00:03:11.620> me<00:03:11.740> back<00:03:11.890> around<00:03:12.100> the<00:03:12.220> pile<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:12.550> off

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
it's got me back around the pile and off

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.640 
it's got me back around the pile and off
free<00:03:12.910> spool<00:03:13.210> and<00:03:13.450> then<00:03:13.810> just<00:03:14.020> go<00:03:14.140> in<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.440> chase

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
free spool and then just go in and chase

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.280 
free spool and then just go in and chase
it<00:03:14.860> some<00:03:15.580> people<00:03:15.760> try<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:16.120> haul<00:03:16.390> it<00:03:16.570> out<00:03:16.690> and<00:03:16.990> I

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
it some people try and haul it out and I

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.660 
it some people try and haul it out and I
mean<00:03:17.620> I've<00:03:17.770> lost<00:03:17.950> fished<00:03:18.280> on<00:03:18.490> both<00:03:18.840> but<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:20.670> tend

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
mean I've lost fished on both but I tend

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.880 
mean I've lost fished on both but I tend
to<00:03:21.760> just<00:03:21.940> free<00:03:22.150> spool<00:03:22.450> and<00:03:22.720> usually<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.710> fish

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
to just free spool and usually the fish

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.470 
to just free spool and usually the fish
is<00:03:24.010> still<00:03:24.220> hooked<00:03:24.460> by<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.760> time<00:03:25.060> you<00:03:25.180> go<00:03:25.330> in

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
is still hooked by the time you go in

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.630 
is still hooked by the time you go in
and<00:03:25.630> try<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:25.840> unhook<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.380> these<00:03:27.010> sections<00:03:27.520> of

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
and try and unhook it these sections of

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.880 
and try and unhook it these sections of
river<00:03:28.600> where<00:03:28.840> you've<00:03:28.990> got<00:03:29.170> oysters<00:03:29.410> around

all the pylons it's just deadly so

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.750 
all the pylons it's just deadly so
you've<00:03:32.440> only<00:03:32.530> got<00:03:32.800> a<00:03:32.830> split<00:03:33.130> second<00:03:33.520> to<00:03:33.610> make

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
you've only got a split second to make

you've only got a split second to make
your<00:03:33.940> decision<00:03:34.360> and<00:03:34.510> it<00:03:35.050> is<00:03:35.260> hard<00:03:35.560> to<00:03:35.920> clip
