00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:11.249
 motorcycle enthusiasts February 23 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.409
 not the first year is associated far 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:15.360
 not only with the day of defender of the fatherland 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:17.369
 holiday is also a date 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.500
 the traditional star race behind the wheel 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.960
 which again took place on the central 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.609
 Moscow hippodrome and of course again 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.490
 Not without the invitation of the stars 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.589
 formula 1 in the role of which were kimi 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.330
 raikkonen and charles rush precisely with 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:32.400
 press conferences Finns and French 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.590
 essentially started another race 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.780
 kimi and talking to reporters again 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.650
 confirmed that his first car 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.210
 was fret 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.440
 and also shared his impressions 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.300
 from winter tests of formula 1 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.610
 the tests went quite well with us 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.320
 there were certain problems not so much in 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.360
 mechanically how much system 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.640
 The development of the machine took time to 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.680
 fix them we went not so much laps 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.830
 how much we wanted to achieve 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.420
 improvements but in general everything goes well in 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.120
 Overall kimi fit their 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.400
 although sometimes he gave 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.950
 highly detailed answers and joked in 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.690
 Finn for sure in his signature style 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.850
 drew attention to what he had in 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.380
 Russia has a lot of fans of the fan club 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.330
 raikkonen met every appearance 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.940
 Emotion Storm Racer 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.370
 I’m picking up my colleague’s popularity for now 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.220
 far away but he was addressed a number 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.080
 ask questions and charles and do not mind 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.340
 whether to the Frenchman that his partner did not 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.350
 experienced Vitaly Petrov 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.710
 which could have been a lot 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.810
 learn i think that this question is not to 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.060
 I do not decide on 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.470
 co-pilot my task 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.010
 focus on your work 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.930
 do your best for the team 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.810
 making a decision on another racer i'm not 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.010
 involved 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.320
 politically correct answer to what else can 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.690
 it was to wait in its own way politically correct 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.850
 formule 1 representatives were on the track 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.770
 during the super final races in the race 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.320
 stars and peak and raikkonen 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.940
 gave way to the master tracks from Kirill Ladygin 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.640
 who became the winner 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.950
 for the fourth time we note that if 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.470
 charles lost ydygin with virtually no 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.719
 struggle so at some point caught up 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.870
 Russian but could not hold a successful 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:14.600
 attack I must say that the Ladygin win 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.790
 mostly competitions then 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.500
 hung in the balance at the end of six 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.530
 final race winner crystal 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.100
 tires scored less points than dmitry 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.170
 Bragin 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.570
 however, one of the last results 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.940
 was canceled because during the race 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.580
 no lights were burning which is prohibited by the rules and 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.800
 Here thanks to this judicial decision 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.410
 lodygin won for the fourth time 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.240
 general race stars turned out very 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.460
 spectacular literally in each of 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.440
 preliminary races happened accident 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.690
 immediately several pilots completed their 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.220
 performances after their cars 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.220
 left to lie on the roof 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.210
 Well, once the weather did not let you down then 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.840
 everyone can be happy stellar saturday 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.840
 succeeded
