00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:07.379
 how to play the piano the story song 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.210
 kiko rivera Fairy because it is that 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.500
 have had to make this video I've 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.980
 seen forced because I have entered 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.859
 youtube I have not seen any 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.210
 karaoke of this song that I love and 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.810
 I've put myself on the piano and I've had to 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.400
 get something out because this can not be 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:29.449
 then for people who do not know about 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.449
 good piano the chords are the the vale 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.340
 the life 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.860
 the rest 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.400
 and you start to but the introduction 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.400
 I would do it that way 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.520
 ah 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.870
 and here you could start singing 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.440
 because they are the same chords 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.059
 and teach me to stop the time so I 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.059
 I feel when I'm worse 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:09.040
 to feel that everything is perfect like this 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:13.210
 they are the same chords and then 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:16.330
 change stanza to see what he learned 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:20.560
 forget your lips in which I love you 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:24.520
 feeling better are the same chords 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.960
 but you can make them sauteed you can 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.960
 make them together or do 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.070
 Today is comfortable and when is the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.960
 chorus I give you a story of 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.540
 fairies so that everything is not the same 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.440
 here in the same tonality as low I 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:48.090
 and I give you a fairy tale live the 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:52.140
 moment the intel tomorrow I want to know if 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.880
 you feel the same do not let me fall 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.340
 abyss 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.940
 or if I know what you want to do here 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.890
 the same me and I give you a story of 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:07.300
 fairies live the moment 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:12.710
 of tomorrow I do not want to know if you feel what 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:15.360
 same you let me fall to it 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.610
 good is all the time like this 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.620
 and good if you want the good melody 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.470
 melody in theory to see me this I am 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.620
 doing karaoke the melody is 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.660
 your voice but it would be good to see the ones 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.660
 I have great with the mobile I can not 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.680
 plus 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.840
 look and what was found would be only 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.610
 good is that it does not come out 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.010
 automatically not because of the sun and therefore 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:02.090
 you take it out by ear and you're doing 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.090
 and today I give you a fairy tale 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.430
 and then put it together with the accompaniment 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.040
 that as I am recording I can not do it 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.240
 with both hands and that's it and this is 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.240
 everything for today I hope you liked it
