00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
you'll see it'll say 21 not quite sure

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.220 
you'll see it'll say 21 not quite sure
why<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.309> triggers<00:00:44.700> them<00:00:45.390> both<00:00:45.600> maybe<00:00:45.989> because

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
why it triggers them both maybe because

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.229 
why it triggers them both maybe because
this<00:00:46.469> kind<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.010> sets<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.460> off<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.000> then<00:00:48.120> this

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
this kind of sets this off and then this

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.209 
this kind of sets this off and then this
sets<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.600> up<00:00:48.780> I'm<00:00:48.989> not<00:00:49.140> quite<00:00:49.320> sure<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:50.039> tell

but if you see what I just did is I took

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:41.869 
but if you see what I just did is I took
some<00:03:36.389> cobblestone<00:03:37.049> and<00:03:38.269> vines<00:03:39.269> and<00:03:40.639> I<00:03:41.639> put

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
some cobblestone and vines and I put

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.080 
some cobblestone and vines and I put
them<00:03:41.909> in<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.209> crafting<00:03:42.690> table<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.849> it<00:03:44.849> looked

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
them in the crafting table and it looked

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.460 
them in the crafting table and it looked
like<00:03:45.209> because<00:03:45.449> there's<00:03:45.659> no<00:03:45.810> number<00:03:46.169> it<00:03:46.319> looked

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
like because there's no number it looked

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.780 
like because there's no number it looked
like<00:03:46.560> there<00:03:46.709> was<00:03:46.829> only<00:03:46.949> one<00:03:47.280> here<00:03:47.489> but<00:03:47.639> there's

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
like there was only one here but there's

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.430 
like there was only one here but there's
actually<00:03:47.909> 64<00:03:48.629> that's<00:03:49.199> very<00:03:49.409> interesting<00:03:51.139> so<00:03:52.139> I

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
actually 64 that's very interesting so I

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.899 
actually 64 that's very interesting so I
personally<00:03:52.769> don't<00:03:53.099> like<00:03:53.190> this<00:03:53.459> I<00:03:53.609> think<00:03:53.819> it

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
personally don't like this I think it

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.210 
personally don't like this I think it
should<00:03:54.030> stay<00:03:54.060> rare<00:03:54.479> as<00:03:54.720> it<00:03:54.750> is<00:03:55.019> but<00:03:55.949> you<00:03:56.010> know

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
should stay rare as it is but you know

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.149 
should stay rare as it is but you know
whatever<00:03:56.729> as<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.510> developers<00:03:58.500> see<00:03:58.709> it<00:03:58.829> that

00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 
whatever as the developers see it that

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:00.439 
whatever as the developers see it that
should<00:03:59.310> that's<00:03:59.579> the<00:03:59.760> way<00:03:59.849> it<00:03:59.940> really<00:04:00.180> should

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449 
should that's the way it really should

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.990 
should that's the way it really should
be<00:04:00.479> you<00:04:00.959> know<00:04:01.049> as<00:04:01.409> their<00:04:02.010> vision<00:04:02.280> so<00:04:02.729> there's<00:04:02.940> a

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
be you know as their vision so there's a

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.640 
be you know as their vision so there's a
new<00:04:03.120> command<00:04:03.419> called<00:04:03.659> flushed<00:04:03.959> particle<00:04:04.470> and

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
new command called flushed particle and

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.559 
new command called flushed particle and
when<00:04:05.190> I<00:04:05.220> destroy<00:04:05.760> its<00:04:05.879> lush<00:04:06.000> particle<00:04:06.389> copy

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
when I destroy its lush particle copy

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.420 
when I destroy its lush particle copy

from text edit here for me because I

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.949

haven't text editor on another monitor
that<00:04:10.169> I'm<00:04:10.260> just<00:04:10.409> copying<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.919> command<00:04:11.250> into

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
that I'm just copying a command into

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.000 
that I'm just copying a command into
here<00:04:12.150> so<00:04:12.299> that<00:04:12.419> you<00:04:12.510> guys<00:04:12.629> can<00:04:12.840> see<00:04:13.139> what<00:04:13.919> this

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
here so that you guys can see what this

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.129 
here so that you guys can see what this
does<00:04:14.220> so<00:04:14.489> basically<00:04:14.819> /<00:04:15.120> particle<00:04:15.629> if<00:04:15.720> i<00:04:15.810> do<00:04:15.870> /

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
does so basically / particle if i do /

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.500 
does so basically / particle if i do /

pretty<00:04:33.650> much<00:04:33.800> if<00:04:33.860> we<00:04:34.190> look<00:04:34.340> at<00:04:34.430> this<00:04:34.550> carefully

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
pretty much if we look at this carefully

pretty much if we look at this carefully
select<00:04:35.600> particle<00:04:35.960> name<00:04:36.200> you<00:04:36.470> give<00:04:36.620> the<00:04:36.710> name

select particle name you give the name
of<00:04:36.920> the<00:04:36.980> particles<00:04:37.310> let's<00:04:37.490> do<00:04:37.610> /<00:04:37.850> particle<00:04:38.420> and

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
of the particles let's do / particle and

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.140 
of the particles let's do / particle and
then<00:04:39.560> you<00:04:40.250> guys<00:04:40.370> can<00:04:40.490> reduce<00:04:40.700> press<00:04:40.880> tab<00:04:41.120> to

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
then you guys can reduce press tab to

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.300 
then you guys can reduce press tab to
get<00:04:41.420> all<00:04:41.510> the<00:04:41.630> name<00:04:41.780> all<00:04:42.620> the<00:04:42.860> names<00:04:43.040> of<00:04:43.160> them

the radius that you want it to be so I'm

and because i am the player that I using
this<00:05:04.610> command<00:05:04.790> i'm<00:05:05.120> pretty<00:05:05.630> sure<00:05:05.780> i<00:05:05.810> don't

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
this command i'm pretty sure i don't

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.080 
this command i'm pretty sure i don't
even<00:05:06.140> use<00:05:06.350> a<00:05:06.380> player<00:05:06.620> entity<00:05:07.100> and<00:05:07.280> i<00:05:07.820> just<00:05:08.000> hit

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
even use a player entity and i just hit

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.050 
even use a player entity and i just hit
enter<00:05:08.240> and<00:05:08.540> here<00:05:09.230> we<00:05:09.350> have<00:05:09.500> an<00:05:09.710> explosion<00:05:10.060> 100

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
enter and here we have an explosion 100

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.680 
enter and here we have an explosion 100
explosions<00:05:11.540> around<00:05:11.930> me<00:05:12.290> I'll<00:05:12.950> do<00:05:13.480> so<00:05:14.480> that's<00:05:14.630> a

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
explosions around me I'll do so that's a

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.920 
explosions around me I'll do so that's a
lot<00:05:14.810> of<00:05:14.840> explosions<00:05:15.160> I'm<00:05:16.180> not<00:05:17.180> sure<00:05:17.240> if<00:05:17.720> in<00:05:17.870> the

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
lot of explosions I'm not sure if in the

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.360 
lot of explosions I'm not sure if in the
future<00:05:17.960> it'll<00:05:18.320> play<00:05:18.530> sound<00:05:18.830> if<00:05:18.980> that's<00:05:19.130> a<00:05:19.220> bug

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
future it'll play sound if that's a bug

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.880 
future it'll play sound if that's a bug
or<00:05:19.460> not<00:05:19.640> but<00:05:20.240> if<00:05:20.330> it<00:05:20.480> does<00:05:20.690> I'm<00:05:20.990> sure<00:05:21.020> map<00:05:21.620> maker

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
or not but if it does I'm sure map maker
