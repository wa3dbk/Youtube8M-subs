thing and this is range what I was

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.500 
thing and this is range what I was
talking<00:03:01.610> about<00:03:01.670> so<00:03:01.940> with<00:03:02.060> a<00:03:02.090> full<00:03:02.330> battery

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
talking about so with a full battery

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.660 
talking about so with a full battery
they<00:03:03.200> estimate<00:03:03.620> that<00:03:03.680> in<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:03.920> lowest<00:03:04.340> level

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
they estimate that in the lowest level

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.790 
they estimate that in the lowest level
of<00:03:04.700> assist<00:03:05.090> it's<00:03:05.540> around<00:03:05.780> 50<00:03:06.140> miles<00:03:06.380> per

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
of assist it's around 50 miles per

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.070 
of assist it's around 50 miles per
charge<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:07.610> again<00:03:08.120> that's<00:03:08.330> a<00:03:08.660> little<00:03:08.750> bit

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
charge and again that's a little bit

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.040 
charge and again that's a little bit
less<00:03:09.260> than<00:03:09.500> maybe<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:09.800> mx2<00:03:10.340> urban<00:03:11.330> because

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
less than maybe the mx2 urban because

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.699 
less than maybe the mx2 urban because
these<00:03:12.230> tires

these tires

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.130 
these tires
you<00:03:13.640> know<00:03:13.730> they've<00:03:14.150> no<00:03:14.330> knobby<00:03:14.780> there's

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
you know they've no knobby there's

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.720 
you know they've no knobby there's
they're<00:03:15.680> just<00:03:15.830> not<00:03:16.100> gonna<00:03:16.280> roll<00:03:16.519> as

bike something that's that's pretty

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.870 
bike something that's that's pretty
beautiful<00:03:20.600> to<00:03:21.410> ride<00:03:21.530> around<00:03:21.650> on<00:03:21.890> so<00:03:22.130> from<00:03:22.580> eco

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
beautiful to ride around on so from eco

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.630 
beautiful to ride around on so from eco
you<00:03:23.030> can<00:03:23.150> go<00:03:23.239> to<00:03:23.299> tour<00:03:23.540> sport<00:03:24.170> turbo<00:03:24.799> it's<00:03:25.040> just

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
you can go to tour sport turbo it's just

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.850 
you can go to tour sport turbo it's just
an<00:03:26.090> awesome<00:03:26.360> setup<00:03:26.930> and<00:03:27.200> this<00:03:27.320> one's<00:03:27.500> again

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
an awesome setup and this one's again

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.500 
an awesome setup and this one's again
it's<00:03:28.100> actually<00:03:28.370> a<00:03:28.400> little<00:03:28.549> bit<00:03:28.640> lighter<00:03:28.970> than

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
it's actually a little bit lighter than

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.890 
it's actually a little bit lighter than
the<00:03:29.660> mx2<00:03:29.989> urban<00:03:30.560> at<00:03:30.950> about<00:03:31.190> 48<00:03:31.820> pounds<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:32.600> I

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
the mx2 urban at about 48 pounds and I

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.000 
the mx2 urban at about 48 pounds and I
think<00:03:33.080> that's<00:03:33.200> partially<00:03:33.440> because<00:03:33.620> of<00:03:33.769> the

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
think that's partially because of the

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.479 
think that's partially because of the
air<00:03:34.549> fork<00:03:34.940> go<00:03:35.600> in<00:03:35.720> there<00:03:35.900> so<00:03:36.140> again<00:03:36.799> we<00:03:37.070> got<00:03:37.220> ten

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
air fork go in there so again we got ten

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.660 
air fork go in there so again we got ten
speed<00:03:37.760> cassette<00:03:37.940> in<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.239> rear<00:03:38.360> SRAM<00:03:38.720> MX<00:03:39.290> or

mx9<00:03:40.840> high<00:03:41.840> quality<00:03:42.230> components<00:03:42.380> and<00:03:42.799> that's

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
mx9 high quality components and that's

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.140 
mx9 high quality components and that's
important<00:03:43.340> something<00:03:43.489> that's<00:03:43.700> pretty<00:03:43.820> stiff

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
important something that's pretty stiff

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.880 
important something that's pretty stiff
and<00:03:44.330> durable<00:03:44.630> because<00:03:44.780> you're<00:03:45.470> getting<00:03:45.620> the

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
and durable because you're getting the

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.370 
and durable because you're getting the
added<00:03:46.519> forces<00:03:46.910> of<00:03:47.090> that<00:03:47.120> mid-drive<00:03:47.810> motor<00:03:47.840> in

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
added forces of that mid-drive motor in

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.199 
added forces of that mid-drive motor in
addition<00:03:48.709> to<00:03:48.830> your<00:03:48.980> leg<00:03:49.340> power<00:03:49.519> just<00:03:49.880> pushing

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
addition to your leg power just pushing

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.030 
addition to your leg power just pushing
on<00:03:50.299> those<00:03:50.450> pedals<00:03:50.900> that's<00:03:51.620> what<00:03:51.830> gives<00:03:51.950> you

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
on those pedals that's what gives you

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.590 
on those pedals that's what gives you
efficiency<00:03:52.519> for<00:03:52.670> climbing<00:03:53.120> that's<00:03:53.480> what

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
efficiency for climbing that's what

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.420 
efficiency for climbing that's what
gives<00:03:53.750> you<00:03:53.840> balance<00:03:53.989> but<00:03:54.769> you<00:03:55.070> know<00:03:55.160> there's

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
gives you balance but you know there's

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.710 
gives you balance but you know there's
concern<00:03:55.820> that<00:03:56.000> oh<00:03:56.030> is<00:03:56.269> that<00:03:56.390> gonna<00:03:56.480> match

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
concern that oh is that gonna match

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.960 
concern that oh is that gonna match
gears<00:03:57.110> and<00:03:57.260> stuff<00:03:57.560> well<00:03:57.950> Bosch<00:03:58.160> systems<00:03:58.700> are

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
gears and stuff well Bosch systems are

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.250 
gears and stuff well Bosch systems are
smart<00:03:59.330> enough<00:03:59.420> to<00:03:59.570> detect<00:03:59.810> when<00:04:00.140> you're

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
smart enough to detect when you're

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.320 
smart enough to detect when you're
shifting<00:04:00.650> and<00:04:00.860> they<00:04:01.370> actually<00:04:01.519> they<00:04:02.030> sort<00:04:02.269> of

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
shifting and they actually they sort of

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.270 
shifting and they actually they sort of
like<00:04:02.450> let<00:04:02.720> up<00:04:02.900> so<00:04:03.380> that<00:04:03.530> you<00:04:03.740> don't<00:04:03.920> have<00:04:04.069> that

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
like let up so that you don't have that

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.370 
like let up so that you don't have that
issue<00:04:04.490> and<00:04:05.209> I<00:04:05.330> really<00:04:05.540> appreciate<00:04:05.930> that

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
issue and I really appreciate that

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.800 
issue and I really appreciate that
a<00:04:06.440> 350<00:04:07.250> watt<00:04:07.280> mid-drive<00:04:07.790> motor<00:04:07.820> and<00:04:08.330> then

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
a 350 watt mid-drive motor and then

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.540 
a 350 watt mid-drive motor and then
they're<00:04:08.960> using<00:04:09.080> the<00:04:09.290> bosch<00:04:09.470> power<00:04:09.500> pack<00:04:10.070> which

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
they're using the bosch power pack which

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.250 
they're using the bosch power pack which
is<00:04:10.700> traditional<00:04:11.300> for<00:04:11.480> for<00:04:11.900> most<00:04:12.050> bosch

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
is traditional for for most bosch

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.140 
is traditional for for most bosch
systems<00:04:12.710> it<00:04:12.890> is<00:04:13.100> removable<00:04:13.610> it's<00:04:13.880> got<00:04:13.970> a<00:04:14.000> nice

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
systems it is removable it's got a nice

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.910 
systems it is removable it's got a nice
little<00:04:14.270> handle<00:04:14.540> does<00:04:15.110> lock<00:04:15.320> to<00:04:15.470> the<00:04:15.560> frame<00:04:15.770> and

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
little handle does lock to the frame and

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.380 
little handle does lock to the frame and
it<00:04:15.980> actually<00:04:16.100> uses<00:04:16.370> a<00:04:16.610> bus<00:04:16.940> locking

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
it actually uses a bus locking

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.910 
it actually uses a bus locking
technology<00:04:17.900> so<00:04:18.050> it's<00:04:18.170> really<00:04:18.530> secure<00:04:18.709> you

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
technology so it's really secure you

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.110 
technology so it's really secure you
don't<00:04:19.070> have<00:04:19.160> to<00:04:19.220> worry<00:04:19.370> about<00:04:19.459> battery<00:04:19.820> theft

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
don't have to worry about battery theft

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.830 
don't have to worry about battery theft
as<00:04:20.270> much<00:04:20.530> and<00:04:21.530> this<00:04:21.650> thing<00:04:21.860> is<00:04:22.010> 36<00:04:22.760> volt<00:04:23.120> 11<00:04:23.630> amp

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
as much and this thing is 36 volt 11 amp

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.690 
as much and this thing is 36 volt 11 amp
hour<00:04:24.020> it's<00:04:24.200> using<00:04:24.440> lithium-ion<00:04:25.010> cells<00:04:25.460> that

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
hour it's using lithium-ion cells that

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.820 
hour it's using lithium-ion cells that
are<00:04:25.850> known<00:04:26.540> for<00:04:26.720> being<00:04:26.780> really<00:04:27.170> durable<00:04:27.530> and

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
are known for being really durable and

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.890 
are known for being really durable and
lightweight<00:04:28.340> and<00:04:28.850> again<00:04:29.330> that's<00:04:29.510> the<00:04:29.690> case<00:04:29.870> so

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
lightweight and again that's the case so

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.930 
lightweight and again that's the case so
48<00:04:30.380> frame<00:04:30.680> you<00:04:30.860> take<00:04:31.040> off<00:04:31.190> the<00:04:31.310> battery<00:04:31.460> and

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
48 frame you take off the battery and

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.970 
48 frame you take off the battery and
just<00:04:32.300> bikes<00:04:32.450> even<00:04:32.690> lighter<00:04:33.020> for<00:04:33.350> transporting

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
just bikes even lighter for transporting

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.350 
just bikes even lighter for transporting
maybe<00:04:34.130> on<00:04:34.280> a<00:04:34.310> rack<00:04:34.610> or<00:04:34.850> something<00:04:35.210> like<00:04:35.300> that

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
maybe on a rack or something like that

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.200 
maybe on a rack or something like that
which<00:04:36.260> I<00:04:36.380> love<00:04:36.590> also<00:04:36.980> the<00:04:37.340> Bosch<00:04:37.490> system<00:04:38.000> it

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
which I love also the Bosch system it

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.380 
which I love also the Bosch system it
detects<00:04:39.050> your<00:04:39.370> pedal<00:04:40.370> cadence<00:04:40.730> as<00:04:40.940> well<00:04:41.210> as

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
detects your pedal cadence as well as

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.730 
detects your pedal cadence as well as
the<00:04:41.630> strain<00:04:41.990> that<00:04:42.200> you're<00:04:42.320> applying<00:04:42.530> the

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
the strain that you're applying the

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.940 
the strain that you're applying the
torque<00:04:43.010> and<00:04:43.420> the<00:04:44.420> speed<00:04:44.450> of<00:04:44.720> the<00:04:44.960> bike<00:04:45.140> and<00:04:45.380> by

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
torque and the speed of the bike and by

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.620 
torque and the speed of the bike and by
using<00:04:46.250> all<00:04:46.400> three<00:04:46.610> of<00:04:46.760> those<00:04:46.880> inputs<00:04:47.150> it's

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
using all three of those inputs it's

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
using all three of those inputs it's
able<00:04:47.840> to<00:04:48.100> dynamically<00:04:49.100> adjust<00:04:50.050> how<00:04:51.050> how<00:04:51.440> much

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
able to dynamically adjust how how much

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.980 
able to dynamically adjust how how much

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
energy it's applying to match your force

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.690 
energy it's applying to match your force
but<00:04:54.560> also<00:04:54.590> to<00:04:54.920> activate<00:04:55.460> and<00:04:55.580> deactivate

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.010 
what it looks like to to pedal around
what<00:05:12.620> it<00:05:12.710> sounds<00:05:13.070> like<00:05:13.130> while<00:05:13.760> you're<00:05:13.940> riding

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.990

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
so I'm currently in turbo so you can

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.310 
so I'm currently in turbo so you can
hear<00:05:19.240> it<00:05:19.270> and<00:05:19.510> I'm<00:05:19.600> gonna<00:05:19.690> pedal<00:05:20.050> and<00:05:20.200> then

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
hear it and I'm gonna pedal and then

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:30.410 
hear it and I'm gonna pedal and then
stop<00:05:20.650> so<00:05:20.890> you<00:05:20.950> can<00:05:21.100> see<00:05:21.280> how<00:05:21.400> responsive<00:05:21.970> it<00:05:22.060> is

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.660 

you<00:05:30.990> do<00:05:31.140> hear<00:05:31.380> it<00:05:31.530> whining<00:05:31.980> a<00:05:32.070> little<00:05:32.310> bit<00:05:32.430> and

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:32.670 
you do hear it whining a little bit and

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.070 
you do hear it whining a little bit and
that's<00:05:32.820> partially<00:05:33.360> because<00:05:33.570> this<00:05:33.870> is<00:05:34.050> a

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
that's partially because this is a

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.650 
that's partially because this is a
geared<00:05:34.380> Center<00:05:34.680> Drive<00:05:34.860> it's<00:05:35.070> 350<00:05:35.850> watt<00:05:36.000> versus

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
geared Center Drive it's 350 watt versus

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.710

the<00:05:37.290> Bosch<00:05:37.800> generation<00:05:38.430> 1<00:05:38.640> which<00:05:38.850> is<00:05:39.000> 250<00:05:39.570> so

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
the Bosch generation 1 which is 250 so

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.970 
the Bosch generation 1 which is 250 so
you're<00:05:39.840> getting<00:05:40.050> up<00:05:40.140> really<00:05:40.440> a<00:05:40.470> lot<00:05:40.680> of<00:05:40.830> power
