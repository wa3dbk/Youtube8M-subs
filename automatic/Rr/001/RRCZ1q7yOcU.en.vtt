situations<00:01:34.229> let's<00:01:35.159> say<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:36.450> want<00:01:36.829> to<00:01:39.110> go

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
situations let's say you want to go

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.410 
situations let's say you want to go
outside<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.770> bright<00:01:40.890> daylight<00:01:41.420> you're

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
outside in the bright daylight you're

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.749 
outside in the bright daylight you're
using<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.899> wireless<00:01:43.110> flash<00:01:43.500> set<00:01:43.950> up<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.549> means

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
using a wireless flash set up that means

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.330 
using a wireless flash set up that means
you're<00:01:44.970> limited<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.390> your<00:01:45.810> sync<00:01:46.380> speed<00:01:46.530> unless

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
you're limited to your sync speed unless

you're limited to your sync speed unless
you're<00:01:47.640> using<00:01:47.759> some<00:01:48.180> type<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.420> TTL<00:01:49.140> but<00:01:49.799> let's

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
you're using some type of TTL but let's

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.660 
you're using some type of TTL but let's
just<00:01:50.189> say<00:01:50.520> you're<00:01:50.670> using<00:01:50.700> general<00:01:52.670> wireless

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
just say you're using general wireless

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.429 
just say you're using general wireless
flash<00:01:54.290> with<00:01:55.290> radiofrequency<00:01:56.000> triggers

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
flash with radiofrequency triggers

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.600 
flash with radiofrequency triggers
you're<00:01:58.439> going<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.740> use<00:01:58.890> something<00:01:59.189> like<00:01:59.219> this

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
you're going to use something like this

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.580 
you're going to use something like this
to<00:02:00.110> limit<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:02.210> natural<00:02:03.210> exposure<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:04.259> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
to limit the natural exposure of the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.570 
to limit the natural exposure of the
scene<00:02:05.149> so<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.240> can<00:02:06.420> get<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.930> mixture<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.890> flash

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
scene so you can get a mixture of flash

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.580 
scene so you can get a mixture of flash
and<00:02:09.080> ambient<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.910> proper<00:02:11.910> mixture<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.330> flash

freezing it you want that flowing look

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.640 
freezing it you want that flowing look
to<00:03:00.370> it<00:03:00.520> we'll<00:03:01.150> just<00:03:01.330> do<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.480> long<00:03:01.750> exposure<00:03:02.140> with

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
to it we'll just do a long exposure with

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.390 
to it we'll just do a long exposure with
the<00:03:03.210> variable<00:03:04.210> nd<00:03:04.620> it's<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.710> little<00:03:05.920> bit<00:03:06.010> easier

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
the variable nd it's a little bit easier

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.880 
the variable nd it's a little bit easier
because<00:03:07.180> you're<00:03:07.660> not<00:03:07.780> fixed<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.350> a<00:03:08.380> certain

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
because you're not fixed to a certain

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.310 
because you're not fixed to a certain
amount<00:03:09.520> of<00:03:10.770> you<00:03:11.770> know<00:03:11.920> limit<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.970> light<00:03:13.930> that

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
amount of you know limit the light that

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:22.170 
amount of you know limit the light that
these<00:03:14.890> limit<00:03:17.310> so<00:03:18.310> i<00:03:18.340> have<00:03:19.320> x<00:03:20.320> k<00:03:20.530> 5<00:03:20.800> here<00:03:21.070> with<00:03:21.370> 24

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
these limit so i have x k 5 here with 24

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:30.860 
these limit so i have x k 5 here with 24
millimeter<00:03:22.680> f2<00:03:23.680> lens<00:03:25.260> very<00:03:26.260> simple<00:03:28.920> connected

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
millimeter f2 lens very simple connected

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.100 
millimeter f2 lens very simple connected
like<00:03:31.870> I<00:03:31.959> said<00:03:32.230> it<00:03:32.410> slightly<00:03:33.220> larger<00:03:33.850> than<00:03:34.110> the

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
like I said it slightly larger than the

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.970 
like I said it slightly larger than the
67<00:03:35.830> millimeter<00:03:36.420> filter<00:03:37.420> thread<00:03:37.740> and<00:03:38.740> you<00:03:38.830> just

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
67 millimeter filter thread and you just

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.720 
67 millimeter filter thread and you just
rotate<00:03:39.400> it<00:03:40.530> on<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.680> camera<00:03:41.890> you<00:03:42.190> can<00:03:42.340> see<00:03:42.580> it's

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
rotate it on the camera you can see it's

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.410 
rotate it on the camera you can see it's
getting<00:03:43.030> lighter<00:03:43.270> and<00:03:43.480> darker<00:03:43.660> as<00:03:44.110> I<00:03:44.500> do<00:03:44.560> that

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
getting lighter and darker as I do that

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:53.880 
getting lighter and darker as I do that
very<00:03:46.420> simple<00:03:47.730> so<00:03:48.730> these<00:03:48.940> photo<00:03:49.660> gallons<00:03:52.890> so

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
very simple so these photo gallons so

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.020 
very simple so these photo gallons so
far<00:03:54.190> with<00:03:54.730> my<00:03:55.060> testing<00:03:55.660> they<00:03:55.900> do<00:03:55.959> not<00:03:56.230> produce

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
far with my testing they do not produce

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.370 
far with my testing they do not produce
the<00:03:58.050> X<00:03:59.050> in<00:03:59.620> the<00:04:00.280> photo<00:04:00.520> which<00:04:01.300> is<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.840> property

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
the X in the photo which is a property

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.229 
the X in the photo which is a property
of<00:04:02.500> using<00:04:03.190> two<00:04:03.880> polarizers<00:04:04.239> I<00:04:04.870> believe<00:04:06.239> but

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
of using two polarizers I believe but

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.930 
of using two polarizers I believe but
for<00:04:07.930> some<00:04:08.140> reason<00:04:08.500> these<00:04:08.950> don't<00:04:09.310> seem<00:04:09.700> to

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
for some reason these don't seem to

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.150 
for some reason these don't seem to
produce<00:04:10.150> that<00:04:10.510> and<00:04:10.840> it's<00:04:11.470> definitely<00:04:11.830> a<00:04:11.980> good

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
produce that and it's definitely a good

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.670 
produce that and it's definitely a good
thing<00:04:12.190> when<00:04:12.610> you<00:04:12.760> take<00:04:13.630> a<00:04:13.660> photo<00:04:13.930> with<00:04:14.080> the

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
thing when you take a photo with the

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.780 
thing when you take a photo with the
really<00:04:15.459> poor<00:04:15.700> quality<00:04:16.120> ones<00:04:16.390> you'll<00:04:17.200> get<00:04:17.440> a

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
really poor quality ones you'll get a

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.090 
really poor quality ones you'll get a
black<00:04:18.790> x<00:04:19.330> in<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:19.840> photo<00:04:20.080> depending<00:04:20.650> on<00:04:20.799> how

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
black x in the photo depending on how

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.630 
black x in the photo depending on how
how<00:04:21.970> you<00:04:22.030> have<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.660> filter<00:04:23.440> rotated<00:04:24.010> and

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
how you have the filter rotated and

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.330 
how you have the filter rotated and
that's<00:04:25.000> pretty<00:04:25.330> much

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
that's pretty much

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.140 
that's pretty much
makes<00:04:26.430> it<00:04:26.550> useless<00:04:27.500> but<00:04:28.500> these<00:04:29.280> don't<00:04:29.520> seem<00:04:29.880> to

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
makes it useless but these don't seem to

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.600 
makes it useless but these don't seem to
have<00:04:30.330> that<00:04:30.360> problem<00:04:30.780> and<00:04:31.199> sharpness<00:04:31.800> wise<00:04:32.160> I

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
have that problem and sharpness wise I

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.439 
have that problem and sharpness wise I
don't<00:04:33.240> think<00:04:33.300> it's<00:04:33.600> too<00:04:33.990> bad<00:04:34.470> really<00:04:35.090> so<00:04:36.090> for

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
don't think it's too bad really so for

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.110 
don't think it's too bad really so for
maybe<00:04:36.600> ten<00:04:36.990> or<00:04:37.020> fifteen<00:04:37.410> dollars<00:04:37.850> of<00:04:38.850> course

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
maybe ten or fifteen dollars of course

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.060 
maybe ten or fifteen dollars of course
it's<00:04:39.300> not<00:04:39.510> you<00:04:40.380> know<00:04:40.410> up<00:04:40.560> to<00:04:40.710> a<00:04:40.740> quality

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
it's not you know up to a quality

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.210 
it's not you know up to a quality
quality<00:04:41.580> level<00:04:42.449> of<00:04:42.660> one<00:04:43.590> of<00:04:43.680> those<00:04:43.770> hundred

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
quality level of one of those hundred

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.570 
quality level of one of those hundred
two<00:04:44.639> hundred<00:04:44.669> dollar<00:04:45.060> ones<00:04:45.590> but<00:04:46.590> i<00:04:47.100> think<00:04:47.460> it's

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
two hundred dollar ones but i think it's

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.020 
two hundred dollar ones but i think it's
worth<00:04:47.729> at<00:04:47.790> least<00:04:48.270> trying<00:04:48.660> out<00:04:49.220> another<00:04:50.220> good

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
worth at least trying out another good

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.570 
worth at least trying out another good
thing<00:04:51.060> about<00:04:51.270> these<00:04:51.570> variable<00:04:52.110> ND<00:04:52.410> filters<00:04:52.800> is

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
thing about these variable ND filters is

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.120 
thing about these variable ND filters is
in<00:04:53.760> video<00:04:54.060> mode<00:04:54.350> because<00:04:55.350> you<00:04:55.590> have<00:04:55.860> some

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
in video mode because you have some

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.850 
in video mode because you have some
pretty<00:04:56.520> big<00:04:56.729> limits<00:04:57.150> in<00:04:58.020> video<00:04:58.350> mode<00:04:58.410> you

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
pretty big limits in video mode you

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.730 
pretty big limits in video mode you
can't<00:04:59.130> do<00:04:59.700> trim<00:05:00.120> lehigh<00:05:00.510> sure<00:05:01.229> speeds<00:05:01.560> and

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
can't do trim lehigh sure speeds and

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.500 
can't do trim lehigh sure speeds and
things<00:05:01.919> like<00:05:02.040> that<00:05:02.100> we<00:05:02.610> don't<00:05:02.910> want<00:05:03.210> to<00:05:03.330> do

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
things like that we don't want to do

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.350 
things like that we don't want to do
very<00:05:04.320> high<00:05:04.440> shutter<00:05:04.740> speeds<00:05:05.040> we<00:05:05.850> use<00:05:06.090> the

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
very high shutter speeds we use the

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.250 
very high shutter speeds we use the
variable<00:05:06.720> filter<00:05:07.200> to<00:05:07.919> change<00:05:08.840> your<00:05:09.840> exposure

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
variable filter to change your exposure

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.580 
variable filter to change your exposure
you<00:05:11.190> know<00:05:11.310> very<00:05:11.639> instantly<00:05:12.450> and<00:05:13.320> it<00:05:13.410> works

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
you know very instantly and it works

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.520 
you know very instantly and it works
really<00:05:13.770> well<00:05:13.919> with<00:05:14.310> video<00:05:14.870> so<00:05:15.870> that's<00:05:16.020> another

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
really well with video so that's another
