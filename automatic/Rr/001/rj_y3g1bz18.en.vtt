00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 binational nurses is the program 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.930
 that drives the secretary of the migrant to 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.349
 so that these professionals go to 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.530
 work to usa or canada because we 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.809
 wanting to take advantage of the deficit that 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.720
 has in the USA for this kind of 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.449
 professionals 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.609
 in which in the USA it is a demand 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:27.230
 growing and that right now 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:29.960
 exceeds 700 thousand nurses and that nothing 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.880
 more in the USA also in Canada and in others 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.449
 industrialized countries or first 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.670
 world have this problem what happens 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:41.540
 is that your students do not want 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.570
 do this race and we have 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.269
 here also another one comes out if our 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.070
 nurses with bachelor's degree but 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.920
 unfortunately for the situation 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.280
 economic do not find many of them 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.780
 where to work the specific support that 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.670
 will do this immediately 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.070
 government agency through a 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.689
 Trust consists of training 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.059
 graduates in nursing and can 

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:09.799
 develop the exam as soon as possible 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.970
 the exam that they are going to present 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.610
 in a beginning 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.950
 we are going to identify what is the 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.079
 level of English you have but right now 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.560
 in this first stage of the program 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:24.320
 what we want is to identify 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.890
 within the state geography people 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.490
 who already speak the language and who have a 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.560
 nursing degree for what reason 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.190
 because these are the first people 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.540
 that we 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.030
 we would support them to go to 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.040
 study the state government is going 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.840
 to create a trust and this I say 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.520
 because it is already a program that we have 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.320
 approved and they have seen with very good 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.200
 eyes 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.780
 and the trust is for the 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.760
 people who do not have do not have 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.060
 three enough economic resources 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.590
 to pay for the procedures that are 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.950
 around the 1600 dollars 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:07.310
 then the state government is going to 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.319
 finance with the promise of 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.330
 participants to reintegrate 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.950
 trust once they are already winning 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.569
 In U.S.A 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.190
 This program also obeys the 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.099
 Governor's instruction to create 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.410
 self-financing programs and the 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.500
 governor has instructed that we 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.170
 we used ingenuity to 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.940
 us or so that we can move forward and 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.390
 in this program because the truth is 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:36.340
 that if we do it it's that alone 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.840
 walking because it's re-fundable or 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.299
 self-financing as that is what 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.239
 we need and here we are helping them 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.910
 to the task of structuring structure 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.849
 quickly between these dependencies 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.260
 I just mentioned those of 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.599
 have a degree in nursing 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.340
 and know how to speak English can go to 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.560
 the facilities of the secretariat of the 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.160
 migrant informs our news 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.610
