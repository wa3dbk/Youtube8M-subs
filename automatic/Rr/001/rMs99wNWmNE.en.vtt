00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.760 
going to play seven rounds each round 10
minutes<00:00:36.480> long<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:36.750> it's<00:00:37.079> been<00:00:37.200> like<00:00:37.410> seven

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
minutes long so it's been like seven

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.530

one<00:00:41.309> side<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:41.879> think<00:00:42.120> just<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.329> make<00:00:42.450> it

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
one side so I think just to make it

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.180 
one side so I think just to make it
better<00:00:43.800> than<00:00:44.070> just<00:00:44.219> just<00:00:44.399> following<00:00:44.789> stuff<00:00:45.120> i

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
better than just just following stuff i

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.080 
better than just just following stuff i
think<00:00:47.190> i<00:00:47.250> saw<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.460> rules<00:00:47.700> are<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.910> way<00:00:48.030> so

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
think i saw the rules are the way so

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.650 
think i saw the rules are the way so
