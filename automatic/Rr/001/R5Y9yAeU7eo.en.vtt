hi<00:00:00.599> guys<00:00:00.750> this<00:00:00.989> is<00:00:01.050> my<00:00:01.230> first<00:00:01.410> experience<00:00:01.589> with

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
hi guys this is my first experience with

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.409 
hi guys this is my first experience with
the<00:00:02.070> new<00:00:02.190> patch<00:00:02.399> which<00:00:02.939> was<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.179> third<00:00:03.330> is

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
the new patch which was the third is

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.300 
the new patch which was the third is
video<00:00:03.689> up<00:00:03.780> showing<00:00:04.049> how<00:00:04.350> fast<00:00:04.650> I<00:00:04.920> killed

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
video up showing how fast I killed

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.160 
video up showing how fast I killed
Belial<00:00:05.759> compared<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.359> how<00:00:06.480> fast<00:00:06.779> I<00:00:06.930> get<00:00:07.080> it

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
Belial compared to how fast I get it

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.259 
Belial compared to how fast I get it
before<00:00:07.340> this<00:00:08.340> kid<00:00:08.550> is<00:00:08.580> seeing<00:00:08.849> now<00:00:09.030> is

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
before this kid is seeing now is

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.030 
before this kid is seeing now is
obviously<00:00:09.570> before<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.260> patch<00:00:10.440> at<00:00:10.740> another

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
obviously before the patch at another

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.980 
obviously before the patch at another
tentacle<00:00:11.280> she's<00:00:11.580> still<00:00:11.790> really<00:00:12.000> good<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.900> I

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
tentacle she's still really good and I

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.629 
tentacle she's still really good and I
think<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.200> code<00:00:13.410> it<00:00:13.500> in<00:00:13.590> about<00:00:13.740> 60<00:00:14.160> seconds<00:00:14.519> flat

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
think I code it in about 60 seconds flat

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.250 
think I code it in about 60 seconds flat
which<00:00:14.940> obviously<00:00:15.179> isn't<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.599> fastest<00:00:16.020> and

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
which obviously isn't the fastest and

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.140 
which obviously isn't the fastest and
they<00:00:16.320> could<00:00:16.560> have<00:00:16.650> done<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.800> better<00:00:17.150> but

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
they could have done it better but

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.849 
they could have done it better but
that's<00:00:18.600> beside<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.900> point<00:00:19.050> because<00:00:19.320> 60

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
that's beside the point because 60

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.470 
that's beside the point because 60
seconds<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.369> still<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.550> lot<00:00:20.820> faster<00:00:21.029> than<00:00:21.390> they

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
seconds is still a lot faster than they

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.439 
seconds is still a lot faster than they
can<00:00:21.539> do<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.900> now<00:00:25.820> the<00:00:26.820> thing<00:00:27.029> with<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.269> is

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
can do it now the thing with this is

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.390 
can do it now the thing with this is
another<00:00:27.750> tentacle<00:00:28.080> still<00:00:28.470> hit<00:00:28.710> below<00:00:29.010> twice

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
another tentacle still hit below twice

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.550 
another tentacle still hit below twice
or<00:00:29.670> three<00:00:29.910> times<00:00:29.939> which<00:00:30.900> makes<00:00:31.109> killing<00:00:31.410> them

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
or three times which makes killing them

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.830 
or three times which makes killing them
especially<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:32.130> phase<00:00:32.279> two<00:00:32.520> really<00:00:33.270> really

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
especially in phase two really really

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.190 
especially in phase two really really
quickly<00:00:34.110> as<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.920> can<00:00:35.040> see<00:00:35.219> here<00:00:35.399> it's<00:00:35.610> like

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
quickly as you can see here it's like

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.330 
quickly as you can see here it's like
dies<00:00:37.200> for<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.590> can<00:00:37.710> mail<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.010> him<00:00:38.160> twice

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
dies for you can mail it to him twice

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.750 
dies for you can mail it to him twice
which<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.850> just<00:00:38.969> insane<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:40.520> just<00:00:41.520> completely

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
which is just insane and just completely

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.069 
which is just insane and just completely
ruins<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.390> face<00:00:42.570> because<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.960> don't

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
ruins the face because you don't

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.229 
ruins the face because you don't
actually<00:00:43.140> have<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.469> dodge<00:00:43.739> anything<00:00:47.239> let's

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
actually have to dodge anything let's

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.270 
actually have to dodge anything let's
lay<00:00:48.360> even<00:00:48.539> talk<00:00:48.719> about<00:00:48.750> phase<00:00:49.230> three<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.739> mean

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
lay even talk about phase three I mean

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.040 
lay even talk about phase three I mean
he<00:00:50.850> doesn't<00:00:51.090> even<00:00:51.210> get<00:00:51.390> chance<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.719> put<00:00:51.930> down

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
he doesn't even get chance to put down

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.569 
he doesn't even get chance to put down
our<00:00:52.230> minds<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.680> have<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.920> dodge<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.340> just

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
our minds that you have to dodge it just

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.790 
our minds that you have to dodge it just
dies<00:00:53.879> because<00:00:54.210> nella<00:00:54.510> tentacles<00:00:54.989> look<00:00:55.620> at

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
dies because nella tentacles look at

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.410 
dies because nella tentacles look at
that<00:00:55.949> damage<00:00:56.280> coming<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:56.670> on<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.850> screen<00:00:57.059> it's

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
that damage coming up on the screen it's

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.560 
that damage coming up on the screen it's
absolutely<00:00:57.719> retarded<00:00:59.120> so<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.239> was<00:01:00.329> about<00:01:00.510> a

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
absolutely retarded so that was about a

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.200 
absolutely retarded so that was about a
minute<00:01:00.989> for<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.230> kill<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:02.100> yes<00:01:02.520> I'm<00:01:02.730> aware<00:01:02.879> that

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
minute for a kill and yes I'm aware that

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.620 
minute for a kill and yes I'm aware that
death<00:01:03.539> pretty<00:01:04.229> bad<00:01:05.000> okay<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.060> here<00:01:06.270> we<00:01:06.330> go<00:01:06.360> with

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
death pretty bad okay so here we go with

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.399 
death pretty bad okay so here we go with
the<00:01:06.750> post<00:01:07.049> patch<00:01:07.320> kill<00:01:08.810> church<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.960> rapid<00:01:10.260> fire

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the post patch kill church is rapid fire

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.230 
the post patch kill church is rapid fire
with<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.830> poison<00:01:11.280> thing<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.850> makes<00:01:12.030> it

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
with the poison thing that makes it

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.090 
with the poison thing that makes it
passed<00:01:12.689> through<00:01:12.840> targets<00:01:13.590> because<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:14.040> think

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
passed through targets because I think

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.609 
passed through targets because I think
that<00:01:14.520> has<00:01:15.330> some<00:01:15.600> potential<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.259> actually<00:01:16.290> be

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
that has some potential to actually be

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.050 
that has some potential to actually be
go<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:16.860> as<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.220> see<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> damage<00:01:17.700> out<00:01:17.880> was

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
go so as you can see the damage out was

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.240 
go so as you can see the damage out was
actually<00:01:18.509> pretty<00:01:18.659> good<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.710> seems<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.040> they

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
actually pretty good it seems that they

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.530 
actually pretty good it seems that they
know<00:01:20.460> for<00:01:20.790> lightning<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.270> what<00:01:21.420> I've<00:01:21.509> been

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
know for lightning is what I've been

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.120 
know for lightning is what I've been
identical<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.500> doesn't<00:01:22.740> actually<00:01:22.860> hit

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
identical so it doesn't actually hit

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.390 
identical so it doesn't actually hit
targets<00:01:23.520> two<00:01:23.670> or<00:01:23.790> three<00:01:23.939> times<00:01:24.119> as<00:01:24.509> well<00:01:24.689> so

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
targets two or three times as well so

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.520 
targets two or three times as well so
ala<00:01:26.400> matt<00:01:26.610> lauer<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.060> kind<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.810> bad<00:01:28.020> now<00:01:28.259> I'm

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
ala matt lauer is kind of bad now I'm

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.140 
ala matt lauer is kind of bad now I'm
not<00:01:28.740> really<00:01:28.890> sure<00:01:29.009> how<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.460> think<00:01:29.790> about<00:01:30.030> it

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
not really sure how to think about it

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.789 
not really sure how to think about it
I'm<00:01:30.810> going<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:30.990> do<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.110> lot<00:01:31.259> more<00:01:31.320> tests

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
I'm going to do a lot more tests

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.140 
I'm going to do a lot more tests
obviously<00:01:32.189> but<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.549> just<00:01:32.790> kind<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
obviously but it's just kind of the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.870 
obviously but it's just kind of the
first<00:01:33.360> preview<00:01:33.840> my<00:01:34.829> face<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.250> timing<00:01:35.490> was<00:01:35.850> a

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
first preview my face to timing was a

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.580 
first preview my face to timing was a
little<00:01:36.000> bit<00:01:36.299> slower<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.020> was<00:01:37.140> only<00:01:37.439> a

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
little bit slower but it was only a

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.330 
little bit slower but it was only a
couple<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.890> seconds<00:01:38.280> max<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:39.110> I<00:01:40.110> mean<00:01:40.340> just

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
couple of seconds max and I mean just

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.179 
couple of seconds max and I mean just
look<00:01:41.549> at<00:01:41.670> how<00:01:41.880> much<00:01:42.060> slower<00:01:42.299> phase<00:01:42.630> 2<00:01:42.899> goes

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
look at how much slower phase 2 goes

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.789 
look at how much slower phase 2 goes
like<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.939> have<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.479> get<00:01:45.600> Dodgers<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.619> Mellie

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
like I to have to get Dodgers to Mellie

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.399 
like I to have to get Dodgers to Mellie
swings<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.790> kite<00:01:48.030> backwards<00:01:48.509> not<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.899> use<00:01:49.200> my

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
swings and kite backwards not to use my

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.460 
swings and kite backwards not to use my
mouse<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.100> phase<00:01:50.869> like<00:01:51.869> it's<00:01:52.229> still

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
mouse in this phase like it's still

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:02.580 
mouse in this phase like it's still
pretty<00:01:52.680> quick<00:01:53.210> but<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.450> comparison<00:01:54.740> yeah

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.899 

so<00:02:03.590> if<00:02:03.680> this<00:02:03.799> is<00:02:03.920> before<00:02:04.219> the<00:02:04.340> patch<00:02:04.549> he<00:02:04.820> would

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
so if this is before the patch he would

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.399 
so if this is before the patch he would
have<00:02:05.000> been<00:02:05.090> dead<00:02:05.299> by<00:02:05.329> now<00:02:05.659> whereas<00:02:06.079> I'm<00:02:06.170> just

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
have been dead by now whereas I'm just

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.190 
have been dead by now whereas I'm just
starting<00:02:06.649> phase<00:02:07.039> 3d<00:02:07.399> now<00:02:07.810> quite<00:02:08.810> a<00:02:08.840> big

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
starting phase 3d now quite a big

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.580 
starting phase 3d now quite a big
difference<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:11.810> is<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:11.959> complete<00:02:12.349> theory

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
difference this is a complete theory

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.680 
difference this is a complete theory
test<00:02:12.920> by<00:02:13.069> the<00:02:13.160> way<00:02:13.280> as<00:02:13.459> I'm<00:02:13.700> pretty<00:02:14.180> sure<00:02:14.480> the

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
test by the way as I'm pretty sure the

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.360 
test by the way as I'm pretty sure the
rapid<00:02:14.989> fire<00:02:15.170> poison<00:02:15.530> things<00:02:15.950> that<00:02:16.160> go<00:02:16.340> through

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
rapid fire poison things that go through

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.180 
rapid fire poison things that go through
targets<00:02:17.060> still<00:02:17.300> go<00:02:17.480> through<00:02:17.510> palau<00:02:18.040> so<00:02:19.040> it

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
targets still go through palau so it

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.160 
targets still go through palau so it
could<00:02:19.640> be<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.940> best<00:02:20.060> damage<00:02:20.450> per<00:02:20.569> second<00:02:20.930> I'm

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
could be the best damage per second I'm

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.199 
could be the best damage per second I'm
not<00:02:21.440> understand<00:02:22.130> shortlist<00:02:22.640> don't<00:02:22.819> quote<00:02:23.030> me

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.940 
not understand shortlist don't quote me
on<00:02:23.239> that<00:02:23.330> it's<00:02:24.140> just<00:02:24.319> something<00:02:24.590> I've<00:02:24.709> tried

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
on that it's just something I've tried

on that it's just something I've tried
and<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:25.430> seems<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.790> work<00:02:25.900> pretty<00:02:26.900> okay<00:02:28.480> if<00:02:29.480> in

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
and it seems to work pretty okay if in

and it seems to work pretty okay if in
or<00:02:29.660> has<00:02:29.870> any<00:02:30.019> ideas<00:02:30.349> that<00:02:30.650> might<00:02:31.069> be<00:02:31.190> better

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
or has any ideas that might be better

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.740

than<00:02:31.489> this<00:02:31.640> please<00:02:31.970> let<00:02:32.150> me<00:02:32.180> know<00:02:32.269> and<00:02:32.599> I'll

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
than this please let me know and I'll

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.850 
than this please let me know and I'll
try<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:32.989> out<00:02:35.140> so<00:02:36.140> I<00:02:36.170> had<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.349> actually<00:02:36.560> dodge

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
try it out so I had to actually dodge

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.289 
try it out so I had to actually dodge
the<00:02:37.040> green<00:02:37.220> things<00:02:37.519> because<00:02:37.940> even<00:02:38.209> though

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
the green things because even though

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:39.820 
the green things because even though
they<00:02:38.420> nerfed<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.810> damage<00:02:39.110> like<00:02:39.260> four<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.620> four

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
they nerfed the damage like four to four

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.150 
they nerfed the damage like four to four
percent<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:41.420> still<00:02:42.260> get<00:02:42.349> one<00:02:42.560> shot<00:02:42.769> because<00:02:43.010> I

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
percent I still get one shot because I

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.550 
percent I still get one shot because I
have<00:02:43.280> no<00:02:43.430> resistance<00:02:43.610> is<00:02:44.060> low<00:02:44.750> armor<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.349> only

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
have no resistance is low armor and only

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.110 
have no resistance is low armor and only
like<00:02:45.680> 25<00:02:46.130> HP<00:02:46.610> so<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:47.540> mean<00:02:47.750> I<00:02:48.519> don't<00:02:49.519> know<00:02:49.730> you

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
like 25 HP so I mean I don't know you

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.309 
like 25 HP so I mean I don't know you

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
have two bouncy get out pretty well

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.870 
have two bouncy get out pretty well
after<00:02:51.620> this<00:02:51.709> patch<00:02:51.950> if<00:02:52.250> you're<00:02:52.430> planning<00:02:52.849> to

after this patch if you're planning to

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.140 
after this patch if you're planning to
be<00:02:53.209> sort<00:02:53.959> of<00:02:53.989> tanki<00:02:54.470> but<00:02:54.620> still<00:02:54.890> I've<00:02:55.790> do<00:02:55.970> some

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
be sort of tanki but still I've do some

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.569 
be sort of tanki but still I've do some
damage<00:02:56.299> because<00:02:56.810> I'm<00:02:57.049> one<00:02:57.829> minute<00:02:58.069> 50<00:02:58.400> into

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
damage because I'm one minute 50 into

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.490 
damage because I'm one minute 50 into
this<00:02:58.640> video<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.810> enrage<00:03:00.049> timers<00:03:00.410> at

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
this video and the enrage timers at

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.789 
this video and the enrage timers at
three<00:03:00.950> minutes<00:03:01.280> I<00:03:01.430> think<00:03:01.459> and<00:03:02.380> if<00:03:03.380> you<00:03:03.530> get<00:03:03.680> to

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
three minutes I think and if you get to

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.530 
three minutes I think and if you get to
that<00:03:03.890> demon<00:03:04.220> hunter<00:03:04.579> you're<00:03:04.910> pretty<00:03:05.480> much

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
that demon hunter you're pretty much

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.289 
that demon hunter you're pretty much
dead<00:03:05.920> so<00:03:06.920> yeah<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.250> takes<00:03:07.430> me<00:03:07.609> literally<00:03:07.940> twice

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
dead so yeah it takes me literally twice

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.690 
dead so yeah it takes me literally twice
as<00:03:08.630> long<00:03:08.900> after<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.440> patch<00:03:09.620> to<00:03:09.799> cover<00:03:09.950> that's

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
as long after the patch to cover that's

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.390 
as long after the patch to cover that's
quite<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.060> big<00:03:11.359> change<00:03:14.590> my<00:03:15.590> dps<00:03:16.040> would<00:03:16.190> shout

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
quite a big change my dps would shout

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.610 
quite a big change my dps would shout
you<00:03:16.579> to<00:03:16.730> only<00:03:16.910> dropped<00:03:17.239> by<00:03:17.450> like<00:03:17.600> 40k<00:03:18.019> and<00:03:18.440> my

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
you to only dropped by like 40k and my

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.990 
you to only dropped by like 40k and my
gear<00:03:18.799> is<00:03:18.920> that<00:03:19.069> exactly<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.549> same<00:03:19.730> in<00:03:19.880> both

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
gear is that exactly the same in both

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.629 
gear is that exactly the same in both
videos<00:03:20.530> so<00:03:21.530> this<00:03:21.799> is<00:03:21.829> obviously<00:03:22.040> after<00:03:22.400> the

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
videos so this is obviously after the

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:27.009 
videos so this is obviously after the
patch<00:03:22.790> with<00:03:23.030> 143<00:03:23.750> hated<00:03:24.200> yes<00:03:24.410> and<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:26.750> attack
