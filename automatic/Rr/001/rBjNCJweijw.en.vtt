I'm patti Moreno the garden girl people

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.079 
I'm patti Moreno the garden girl people
ask<00:00:43.870> me<00:00:44.019> all<00:00:44.260> the<00:00:44.350> time<00:00:44.680> how<00:00:45.280> do<00:00:45.339> I<00:00:45.489> grow<00:00:45.789> herbs

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.089 
ask me all the time how do I grow herbs

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:48.599 
ask me all the time how do I grow herbs
and<00:00:46.510> vegetables<00:00:46.690> in<00:00:47.230> a<00:00:47.379> container<00:00:47.800> in<00:00:48.039> small

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.609 
and vegetables in a container in small

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:50.969 
and vegetables in a container in small
spaces<00:00:48.879> well<00:00:49.839> I've<00:00:50.019> been<00:00:50.289> experimenting<00:00:50.620> with

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:50.979 
spaces well I've been experimenting with

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:53.279 
spaces well I've been experimenting with
container<00:00:51.460> gardening<00:00:51.909> for<00:00:52.180> years<00:00:52.510> and<00:00:52.750> I

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 
container gardening for years and I

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:55.020 
container gardening for years and I
found<00:00:53.530> out<00:00:53.739> the<00:00:53.859> containers<00:00:54.399> tend<00:00:54.670> to<00:00:54.760> dry<00:00:55.000> out

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
found out the containers tend to dry out

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.990 
found out the containers tend to dry out
quickly<00:00:55.449> and<00:00:55.780> they<00:00:56.469> also<00:00:56.649> need<00:00:57.129> fertilizers

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
quickly and they also need fertilizers

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.509 
quickly and they also need fertilizers
this<00:00:58.809> year<00:00:59.170> I'm<00:00:59.350> installing<00:00:59.890> a<00:01:00.190> drip

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519

with a fertilizer injector that way my

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.460 
with a fertilizer injector that way my
plants<00:01:06.549> will<00:01:06.640> be<00:01:06.759> in<00:01:06.850> optimum<00:01:07.390> condition

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470

container garden you have to fertilize

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:00.540 
container garden you have to fertilize
it<00:01:58.479> pretty<00:01:59.050> often<00:01:59.319> before<00:01:59.890> I<00:02:00.129> connect<00:02:00.459> the

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
it pretty often before I connect the

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.270 
it pretty often before I connect the
manifold<00:02:01.060> to<00:02:01.420> my<00:02:01.750> spigot<00:02:02.170> I<00:02:02.470> am<00:02:02.769> going<00:02:03.099> to

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
manifold to my spigot I am going to

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.109 
manifold to my spigot I am going to
connect<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:04.239> hoses<00:02:04.720> for<00:02:05.110> my<00:02:05.289> fertilizer<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
connect the hoses for my fertilizer the

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.529 
connect the hoses for my fertilizer the
black<00:02:07.360> one<00:02:07.629> is<00:02:07.840> on<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:08.739> top<00:02:09.280> side<00:02:09.610> and<00:02:09.970> that<00:02:10.300> is

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
black one is on the top side and that is

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.509 
black one is on the top side and that is
going<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:10.840> connect<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.500> my<00:02:11.769> easy<00:02:12.129> flow

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
going to connect to my easy flow

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.150 
going to connect to my easy flow
fertilizer<00:02:13.030> injector<00:02:13.690> then<00:02:14.200> I've<00:02:14.470> got<00:02:14.860> my

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
fertilizer injector then I've got my

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.100 
fertilizer injector then I've got my
clear<00:02:16.030> tubing<00:02:16.930> here<00:02:17.290> and

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
clear tubing here and

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.380 
clear tubing here and
I'm<00:02:18.170> using<00:02:18.440> clear<00:02:18.890> tubing<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:19.580> that<00:02:19.730> I<00:02:19.850> can<00:02:19.970> see

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
I'm using clear tubing so that I can see

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.070 
I'm using clear tubing so that I can see
my<00:02:20.540> fertilizer<00:02:21.110> as<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.800> goes<00:02:22.180> into<00:02:23.180> my<00:02:23.510> system

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
my fertilizer as it goes into my system

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.680 
my fertilizer as it goes into my system
so<00:02:24.770> I've<00:02:24.950> left<00:02:25.220> enough<00:02:25.520> slack<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:25.850> just<00:02:26.300> move

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
so I've left enough slack to just move

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.690 
so I've left enough slack to just move
it<00:02:26.840> around<00:02:26.930> wherever<00:02:27.320> I<00:02:27.560> want<00:02:28.990> now<00:02:29.990> I<00:02:30.500> have<00:02:31.190> to

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
it around wherever I want now I have to

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.080 
it around wherever I want now I have to
get<00:02:32.000> my<00:02:32.410> half-inch<00:02:33.410> main<00:02:33.770> line<00:02:34.070> and<00:02:34.340> connect

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
get my half-inch main line and connect

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.010 
get my half-inch main line and connect
it<00:02:35.270> to<00:02:35.540> my<00:02:35.570> ez<00:02:36.110> lock<00:02:36.410> fitting<00:02:36.740> here<00:02:37.130> and<00:02:37.750> then<00:02:38.750> I

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
it to my ez lock fitting here and then I

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.050 
it to my ez lock fitting here and then I
think<00:02:39.620> I'm<00:02:39.770> just<00:02:39.800> going<00:02:40.070> to<00:02:40.130> take<00:02:40.370> it<00:02:40.430> up<00:02:40.640> right

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
think I'm just going to take it up right
