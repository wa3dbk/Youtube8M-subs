00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 And then go for another day and do not touch. 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.640
 engines 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.910
 I'm bringing this party there to 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.610
 you it 's a point be until a dog 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.670
 It's funny, the owner called me. 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.500
 that this car was not working 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.930
 in the morning it has to work not 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.609
 got it and face it soon he deduced that 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.100
 was the fuel pump 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:28.289
 He's been stirring here and he's 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:30.150
 funny and passed the connectu there he 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.770
 put it all here I just saw 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:40.340
 Now, right away , I realized that for 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.960
 Cause when I opened the key did not dial 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.020
 a cava is now marking because I 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:54.870
 I already called but at the time it did not 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:56.910
 happened on a curve right there. 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.710
 simply the pump 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.469
 that whip that makes 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.070
 that it works and it moved and stopped 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:09.350
 being turned on will give the car key no 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.350
 will work the car will not continue 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.880
 or not but already dying is only this is a 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.100
 the remnant of the fuel still 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:27.630
 it was in the system again 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:29.460
 speaking this is a defect he was 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.570
 sad because this car and taxi did not 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:41.329
 can stop 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:41.329
 What I did here simply connect it 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:51.780
 if it becomes a service so 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:55.700
 simple people and car owner is a 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.450
 complicated thing saw that the guys want 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.210
 to move 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.009
 sometimes it's simple the defect the defect 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.500
 in this car was only the body was 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.930
 buried around the body had not 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:13.910
 The need for a face soon deduced that 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:17.270
 was the bomb himself of 2006 then 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:31.130
 the case of deductions 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:31.130
 hasty that there're the bank in place 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:43.890

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.170
