00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.389
 hello to all on fast cooking 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.000
 Today we will make a wrap to 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.259
 chicken in go go it goes for the 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 recipe it will take us two nets 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.060
 of chicken that I cut in aiguillettes 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.760
 200 g bread crumbs pancake salt 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.220
 sunflower oil pepper for the 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.460
 frying a handful of spinach or a 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.429
 handful of salad a minced red onion 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.720
 located at flour soup 2 nd and 2 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.180
 tomatoes cut finely 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.360
 so to start the recipe I put 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.399
 my oil to heat up to about 180 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.550
 degrees so now here i'm going 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.600
 coming room is so slightly my 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:51.930
 pieces of chicken then I'm going 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:59.059
 pepper and with my fingers so well 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:03.680
 own game mix then I take that 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.680
 the fork and I beat the others 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.189
 alas it remains only to go so 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:19.500
 the chicken pieces so directly 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:21.150
 in flour 1 then we help 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.979
 well to remove the excess of farinas 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:31.500
 and put them directly into the waters 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:34.590
 there we also remove the surplus of nine and 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.329
 they are plunged into pancake breadcrumbs 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.600
 so pancake pancake what is that 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.850
 it is 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.009
 so it's a Japanese hair has 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.680
 so the package looks like these 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.350
 and that does not really mean a result 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.189
 perfect it is crispy and 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.950
 discolored beautiful texture 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:57.680
 so I put down chicken pieces 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.680
 breaded so directly on the plate 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:07.159
 and I continue so his nil yemo is at 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:11.630
 temperature so here I prepared a 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:14.420
 plate with paper towel and I 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:19.459
 will start to dispose my nets of 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:22.069
 chicken in the oil here you have to be 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:28.730
 vigilant we do not put much in the 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:31.970
 time and we're watching we'll be able to 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.580
 returns and then some at the level 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.110
 temperatures tried to drop from 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.160
 really go up if need be if you 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.019
 see that it's too hot down a 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.910
 little bit and we do not hesitate to 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.900
 return often to have a color 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.900
 well uniform 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.019
 we will be able to remove them 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.709
 really a very very beautiful color 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.120
 then this breadcrumbs you will be able 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.120
 find it in Asian stores 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:07.250
 so those who are too thick are 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.450
 leave a little longer then 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:15.709
 that she is this one she is over 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:19.690
 fine we sulk them properly and 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.690
 directly on the absorbent paper 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.750
 so I continue cooking and get 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.750
 find right away 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.640
 we will immediately go to dressage 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.140
 so here I have organic ketchup so I 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.970
 I will not show it later but 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.700
 planned to put a mustard sauce 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.000
 mayonnaise or ketchup 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.099
 so I put a little bit on the 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.799
 galette then I have talent with the 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:53.510
 spoon I say he disposes and so my 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.510
 spinach leaves or salad 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.299
 some red onions 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.569
 some tomatoes now I drop 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.040
 so that my breaded chicken fillets 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:13.390
 so we'll put maybe three because 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:19.630
 that I'm pretty greedy and we're going 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:22.230
 close the cake and we pass 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.550
 immediately at the tasting 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.919
 so we have a chicken that is good 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.580
 fluffy a breadcrumb pankow well 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.230
 crunchy 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.020
 this recipe i think it's going 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:36.910
 absolutely have to try it go I 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:38.919
 rebuke a bite so it is this 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.210
 gourmet recipe is finished so 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.710
 I hope you will do it again at 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.780
 I hope you will 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.160
 leave a little blue thumb and we 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.660
 is therefore very quickly assured 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.860
 cooking arvida for recipes a 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.860
 certainly easy to
