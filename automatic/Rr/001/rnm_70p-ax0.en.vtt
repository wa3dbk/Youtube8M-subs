that<00:02:25.770> will<00:02:25.890> also<00:02:26.340> then<00:02:27.050> go<00:02:28.050> ahead<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.700> produce

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
that will also then go ahead and produce

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.210 
that will also then go ahead and produce
a<00:02:29.970> chemical<00:02:30.959> substance<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:31.800> can<00:02:31.950> see<00:02:32.190> that

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
a chemical substance you can see that

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.309 
a chemical substance you can see that
you<00:02:32.550> can<00:02:32.670> smell<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.600> they'll<00:02:33.989> be<00:02:34.050> able<00:02:34.170> to

smell between each other too because

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.570 
smell between each other too because
that's<00:02:51.330> enough<00:02:51.780> one<00:02:52.380> of<00:02:52.500> their<00:02:52.650> alert<00:02:53.100> systems

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
that's enough one of their alert systems

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.900 
that's enough one of their alert systems
as<00:02:53.760> well<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.950> they're<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:55.980> wonderful<00:02:56.640> addition
