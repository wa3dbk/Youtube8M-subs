plates are are energized with a charge

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.520 
plates are are energized with a charge
which<00:00:44.879> sets<00:00:45.180> up<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.450> chemical<00:00:45.930> reaction<00:00:46.050> like

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
which sets up a chemical reaction like

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.619 
which sets up a chemical reaction like
Anna<00:00:46.770> let<00:00:46.980> acid<00:00:47.399> battery<00:00:47.760> well<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.180> sulfate

Anna let acid battery well the sulfate

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.479 
Anna let acid battery well the sulfate
goes<00:00:48.899> one<00:00:49.289> way<00:00:49.440> or<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.649> other<00:00:49.770> way<00:00:50.129> between

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
goes one way or the other way between

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.459 
goes one way or the other way between
those<00:00:50.820> two<00:00:51.000> plates<00:00:51.329> depending<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:51.960> charge<00:00:52.260> and

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
those two plates depending on charge and

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.400 
those two plates depending on charge and
discharge<00:00:52.820> and<00:00:53.820> after<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.629> gets<00:00:54.899> warmed<00:00:55.320> up

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
discharge and after this gets warmed up

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.619 
discharge and after this gets warmed up
it<00:00:55.649> becomes<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:56.190> rechargeable<00:00:56.850> battery<00:00:56.879> and

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
it becomes a rechargeable battery and

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.990 
it becomes a rechargeable battery and
this<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.770> homemade<00:00:59.219> one<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.699> made

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
this is the homemade one that I made

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.729 
this is the homemade one that I made
here<00:01:00.449> now<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.219> Linotype<00:01:02.879> lead<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.080> you

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
here now this is a Linotype lead and you

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.950 
here now this is a Linotype lead and you
could<00:01:04.920> use<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.159> number<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.729> kinds<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.270> leads<00:01:06.600> of

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
could use a number of kinds of leads of

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.780 
could use a number of kinds of leads of
different<00:01:07.350> alloys<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.979> pure<00:01:08.340> let<00:01:08.520> if<00:01:08.670> you

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
different alloys and pure let if you

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.810 
different alloys and pure let if you
want<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.390> has<00:01:09.600> 10<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.340> antimony<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.610> it

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
want to this has 10 and antimony in it

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.840 
want to this has 10 and antimony in it
but<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.689> can<00:01:12.810> see<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.020> I've<00:01:13.260> got<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.850> blue

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
but you can see that I've got this blue

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.240 
but you can see that I've got this blue
separator<00:01:15.540> material<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.350> there<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:17.159> has

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
water have to use distilled water you

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.859 
water have to use distilled water you
can't<00:01:22.530> use<00:01:22.710> tap<00:01:23.040> water<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:24.299> alum<00:01:24.689> is

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
can't use tap water and the alum is

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.580 
can't use tap water and the alum is
aluminum<00:01:25.500> sulfate<00:01:26.780> preferably<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.960> ammonium

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
aluminum sulfate preferably the ammonium

aluminum sulfate preferably the ammonium
aluminum<00:01:29.130> sulfate<00:01:29.759> no<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.240> tried<00:01:30.570> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
aluminum sulfate no I have you tried the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.719 
aluminum sulfate no I have you tried the
other<00:01:30.750> ones<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.380> potassium<00:01:31.770> seems<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.549> work

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
other ones the potassium seems to work

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.050 
other ones the potassium seems to work
also<00:01:33.350> but<00:01:34.350> anyway<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.040> has<00:01:35.220> been<00:01:35.400> formed<00:01:35.880> up

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
also but anyway this has been formed up

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.850 
also but anyway this has been formed up
by<00:01:36.299> charge<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.840> discharge<00:01:36.990> charge<00:01:37.680> and

by charge and discharge charge and

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.550 
by charge and discharge charge and
discharge<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:40.229> rechargeable

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
discharge so that it is a rechargeable

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.480 
discharge so that it is a rechargeable
cell<00:01:41.400> now<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.259> it's<00:01:43.259> very<00:01:43.530> very<00:01:43.619> hard<00:01:44.130> once

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
cell now and it's very very hard once

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.249 
cell now and it's very very hard once
these<00:01:44.670> form<00:01:45.060> up<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.420> get<00:01:45.600> them<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.899> go<00:01:46.049> down<00:01:46.229> to

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
these form up to get them to go down to

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.560 
these form up to get them to go down to
zero<00:01:46.829> even<00:01:47.430> if<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.700> short<00:01:48.000> them<00:01:48.210> out<00:01:48.360> they

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
zero even if you short them out they

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.780 
zero even if you short them out they
seem<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.869> want<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.079> bounce<00:01:49.290> back<00:01:49.680> very<00:01:50.399> similar

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
seem to want to bounce back very similar

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.300 
seem to want to bounce back very similar
to<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.149> galvanic<00:01:51.659> cell<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.409> have<00:01:52.829> not<00:01:53.040> figured

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
to a galvanic cell I have not figured

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.700 
to a galvanic cell I have not figured
that<00:01:53.640> part<00:01:53.670> out<00:01:54.180> yet<00:01:54.240> why<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.439> would<00:01:55.560> be

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
that part out yet why that would be

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.740 
that part out yet why that would be
doing<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.219> with<00:01:56.790> two<00:01:57.229> same<00:01:58.969> metals<00:01:59.969> that

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
doing that with two same metals that

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.319 
doing that with two same metals that
that's<00:02:01.110> what<00:02:01.350> I'm<00:02:01.439> finding<00:02:01.770> out<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:03.030> let<00:02:03.299> me

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
that's what I'm finding out so let me

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.730 
that's what I'm finding out so let me
show<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.689> what<00:02:03.869> I've<00:02:03.960> got<00:02:03.990> here<00:02:04.170> I've<00:02:04.530> got<00:02:04.560> a

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
show you what I've got here I've got a

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.869 
show you what I've got here I've got a
little<00:02:04.950> motor<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.540> built<00:02:06.869> back<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.350> June

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:07.879 
little motor that I built back in June

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:11.540 
little motor that I built back in June
this<00:02:08.879> is<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.090> little<00:02:09.330> pulse<00:02:09.539> motor<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.430> like<00:02:11.430> I

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
this is a little pulse motor that like I

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.580 
this is a little pulse motor that like I
said<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.790> built<00:02:12.060> this<00:02:12.209> back<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.750> June<00:02:13.080> to

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
said I built this back in June to

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.030 
said I built this back in June to
try<00:02:13.709> out<00:02:13.890> these<00:02:14.730> small<00:02:15.239> cells<00:02:15.840> with<00:02:16.290> it's<00:02:16.800> just

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
try out these small cells with it's just

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.580 
try out these small cells with it's just
a<00:02:17.099> little<00:02:17.220> pulse<00:02:17.550> motor<00:02:17.849> has<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.150> coil<00:02:18.569> has<00:02:19.530> a

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
battery here i'm going to show running

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.039 
battery here i'm going to show running
the<00:02:45.989> motor<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.730> i'll<00:02:47.730> put<00:02:48.180> this<00:02:48.360> up<00:02:48.599> here<00:02:48.630> on

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
the motor and i'll put this up here on

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:57.400 
the motor and i'll put this up here on
the<00:02:49.230> on<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.500> little<00:02:50.280> device<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:51.150> plug<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.540> in

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.630 

nothing<00:02:58.410> going<00:02:58.590> on<00:03:00.950> you<00:03:01.950> show<00:03:02.190> you<00:03:02.250> what<00:03:02.489> the

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
nothing going on you show you what the

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:10.509 
nothing going on you show you what the
voltage<00:03:03.090> is<00:03:03.299> here<00:03:03.750> with<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:05.510> cell<00:03:06.510> hooked<00:03:06.900> up

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.559 

fluctuates<00:03:11.519> around<00:03:11.849> a<00:03:11.910> little<00:03:12.030> bit<00:03:12.269> but

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
fluctuates around a little bit but

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.770 
fluctuates around a little bit but
basically<00:03:13.230> it's<00:03:13.680> when<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.430> switch<00:03:14.730> is<00:03:14.780> closed

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
basically it's when the switch is closed

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.289 
basically it's when the switch is closed
of<00:03:16.470> course<00:03:16.739> it's<00:03:16.920> not<00:03:17.010> showing<00:03:17.430> anything<00:03:17.819> if<00:03:18.180> i

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
of course it's not showing anything if i

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.650 
of course it's not showing anything if i
rotate<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.959> wheel<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.470> little<00:03:19.590> bit<00:03:20.600> you<00:03:21.600> can

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
rotate the wheel a little bit you can

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.170 
rotate the wheel a little bit you can
see<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:22.019> voltage<00:03:22.170> fluctuates<00:03:23.040> um<00:03:23.400> let<00:03:24.090> me

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
see the voltage fluctuates um let me

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:31.750 
see the voltage fluctuates um let me
disconnect<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.959> cell<00:03:25.940> watch<00:03:26.940> this<00:03:27.269> rebound

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.949 

it's<00:03:32.760> going<00:03:32.940> to<00:03:33.000> rebound<00:03:33.389> all<00:03:33.599> the<00:03:33.750> way<00:03:33.810> up<00:03:33.930> to

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
it's going to rebound all the way up to

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.420 
it's going to rebound all the way up to
about<00:03:34.609> eight-tenths<00:03:35.609> of<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.940> volt<00:03:37.340> but<00:03:38.340> it

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
about eight-tenths of a volt but it

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.180 
about eight-tenths of a volt but it
still<00:03:38.730> is<00:03:38.849> not<00:03:38.910> enough<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:39.660> run<00:03:39.870> this<00:03:40.019> wheel

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.580 

plug<00:03:44.190> that<00:03:44.220> back<00:03:44.430> in<00:03:44.880> there<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.380> it's<00:03:46.380> just

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
plug that back in there and it's just

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.220 
plug that back in there and it's just
not<00:03:46.739> enough<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.250> make<00:03:47.400> anything<00:03:47.669> happen<00:03:48.230> but

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
not enough to make anything happen but

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.319 
not enough to make anything happen but
watch<00:03:49.470> this<00:03:49.889> this<00:03:50.250> is<00:03:50.430> what<00:03:50.609> I<00:03:50.819> found<00:03:51.150> very

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
watch this this is what I found very

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.530 
watch this this is what I found very
very<00:03:51.780> fascinating<00:03:52.590> this<00:03:52.980> acts<00:03:53.280> like<00:03:53.579> a<00:03:53.880> super

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
very fascinating this acts like a super

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.819 
very fascinating this acts like a super
capacitor<00:03:56.870> that's<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.019> closest<00:03:58.470> thing<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:58.769> can

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
capacitor that's the closest thing I can

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.190 
capacitor that's the closest thing I can
I<00:03:59.160> can<00:03:59.370> say<00:03:59.579> to<00:03:59.609> the<00:03:59.880> what<00:04:00.450> I'm<00:04:00.569> seeing<00:04:00.930> here<00:04:01.019> is

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
I can say to the what I'm seeing here is

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.229 
I can say to the what I'm seeing here is
something<00:04:01.650> like<00:04:01.769> a<00:04:01.829> supercapacitor<00:04:02.459> but<00:04:03.120> it's

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
something like a supercapacitor but it's

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.460 
something like a supercapacitor but it's
really<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.569> battery<00:04:04.079> it's<00:04:04.290> not<00:04:04.440> a

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
really a battery it's not a

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.440 
really a battery it's not a
supercapacitor<00:04:05.040> but<00:04:05.639> what<00:04:06.000> I'm<00:04:06.120> going<00:04:06.239> to<00:04:06.269> do

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
supercapacitor but what I'm going to do

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.509 
supercapacitor but what I'm going to do
is<00:04:06.569> I'm<00:04:06.720> just<00:04:06.750> going<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:07.049> tap<00:04:07.380> this<00:04:07.739> with<00:04:08.340> this

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
is I'm just going to tap this with this

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:18.970 
is I'm just going to tap this with this
3<00:04:08.819> volts<00:04:09.180> here<00:04:09.419> and<00:04:09.680> watch<00:04:10.680> what<00:04:11.010> happens

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:29.540 

now<00:04:19.670> it<00:04:19.730> goes

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.720 

the<00:04:30.540> LED<00:04:31.080> on<00:04:31.290> the<00:04:33.470> wheels<00:04:34.470> going<00:04:34.740> around<00:04:35.010> let

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
the LED on the wheels going around let

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.460 
the LED on the wheels going around let
me<00:04:35.760> show<00:04:35.970> you<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:36.180> voltage<00:04:36.630> on<00:04:36.810> the<00:04:36.840> cell<00:04:37.230> now

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
me show you the voltage on the cell now

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.320 
me show you the voltage on the cell now
from<00:04:37.740> that<00:04:37.770> slight<00:04:38.250> charge<00:04:38.580> that<00:04:38.820> I<00:04:38.910> just<00:04:39.120> put

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
from that slight charge that I just put

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.210 
from that slight charge that I just put
on<00:04:39.450> it<00:04:41.840> there's<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:43.050> loaded<00:04:43.440> voltage<00:04:43.860> on<00:04:44.040> the

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
on it there's the loaded voltage on the

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:52.240 
on it there's the loaded voltage on the
cell<00:04:45.170> drop<00:04:46.170> it<00:04:46.320> off<00:04:47.480> like<00:04:48.480> a<00:04:48.510> super<00:04:49.020> capacitor

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.320 

okay<00:04:53.250> now<00:04:53.400> what<00:04:53.580> I'm<00:04:53.670> going<00:04:53.790> to<00:04:53.880> do<00:04:54.060> is<00:04:54.180> I'm

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
okay now what I'm going to do is I'm

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.000 
okay now what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:04:54.420> to<00:04:54.480> short<00:04:54.870> this<00:04:55.050> guy<00:04:55.320> out<00:04:55.560> I'm<00:04:55.800> going<00:04:55.890> to

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
going to short this guy out I'm going to

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.820 
going to short this guy out I'm going to
punish<00:04:56.280> it<00:04:56.580> take<00:04:57.480> the<00:04:57.660> negative<00:04:57.870> put<00:04:58.620> it<00:04:58.710> over

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
punish it take the negative put it over

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.230 
punish it take the negative put it over
here<00:04:59.070> to<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.280> positive<00:05:01.520> so<00:05:02.520> that<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.940> cell<00:05:03.210> is

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
here to the positive so that the cell is

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:10.280 
here to the positive so that the cell is
discharging<00:05:04.080> now<00:05:07.970> got<00:05:08.970> no<00:05:09.180> voltage<00:05:09.660> on<00:05:09.900> it<00:05:10.080> let

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
discharging now got no voltage on it let

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.250 
discharging now got no voltage on it let
me<00:05:10.350> pull<00:05:10.680> this<00:05:10.830> off<00:05:11.150> watch<00:05:12.150> this<00:05:12.420> rebound<00:05:12.990> now

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
me pull this off watch this rebound now

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.960 
me pull this off watch this rebound now
like<00:05:13.530> a<00:05:13.560> capacitor<00:05:14.340> or<00:05:14.550> a<00:05:14.580> battery<00:05:15.120> will<00:05:15.330> do

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
like a capacitor or a battery will do

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:25.520 
like a capacitor or a battery will do
there<00:05:17.970> it's<00:05:18.150> rebounding<00:05:18.840> again<00:05:24.380> plug<00:05:25.380> this

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
there it's rebounding again plug this

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:32.260 
there it's rebounding again plug this
back<00:05:25.590> in<00:05:27.860> this<00:05:28.860> may<00:05:29.130> go<00:05:29.310> around<00:05:29.640> real<00:05:29.880> slow<00:05:30.210> now

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.020 

but<00:05:33.270> not<00:05:33.450> very<00:05:33.660> fast<00:05:34.550> maybe<00:05:35.550> you'll<00:05:35.760> see<00:05:36.000> a

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
but not very fast maybe you'll see a

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.850 
but not very fast maybe you'll see a
blink<00:05:36.420> not<00:05:37.140> really<00:05:39.080> I'll<00:05:40.080> spin<00:05:40.410> this<00:05:40.530> up<00:05:40.740> a

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
blink not really I'll spin this up a

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.010 
blink not really I'll spin this up a
little<00:05:41.010> bit<00:05:41.310> so<00:05:41.700> that<00:05:41.730> the<00:05:42.240> loaded<00:05:42.600> voltage

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
little bit so that the loaded voltage

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.300 
little bit so that the loaded voltage
again<00:05:43.410> not<00:05:44.160> much<00:05:44.190> there<00:05:45.980> now<00:05:46.980> I'm<00:05:47.070> going<00:05:47.250> to

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
again not much there now I'm going to

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.310 
again not much there now I'm going to
take<00:05:47.460> this<00:05:47.670> battery<00:05:48.180> again<00:05:48.510> here<00:05:48.750> and<00:05:48.900> tap<00:05:49.140> it

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
take this battery again here and tap it

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:57.660 
take this battery again here and tap it
on<00:05:49.410> a<00:05:49.470> wick<00:05:49.770> on<00:05:49.950> the<00:05:50.130> contacts

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:57.670 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:11.210 

and<00:05:58.270> goes<00:05:58.450> the<00:05:58.600> motor<00:05:58.810> again

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.460 

this<00:06:11.820> is<00:06:11.970> going<00:06:12.150> so<00:06:12.330> fast<00:06:12.540> the<00:06:12.870> camera<00:06:13.260> really

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
this is going so fast the camera really

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.950 
this is going so fast the camera really
can't<00:06:13.710> even<00:06:13.950> hardly<00:06:14.070> pick<00:06:14.430> this<00:06:14.640> up<00:06:14.880> you<00:06:15.750> show

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
can't even hardly pick this up you show

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.120 
can't even hardly pick this up you show
you<00:06:16.050> the<00:06:16.140> voltage<00:06:16.530> again<00:06:16.860> on<00:06:17.040> the<00:06:17.160> cell<00:06:19.130> this

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
you the voltage again on the cell this

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:28.140 
you the voltage again on the cell this
will<00:06:20.310> be<00:06:20.400> dropping<00:06:20.700> off

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.900 

there's<00:06:28.870> the<00:06:29.050> motor<00:06:29.290> runnin<00:06:32.430> you<00:06:33.430> know<00:06:33.490> i<00:06:33.580> just

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:33.910 
there's the motor runnin you know i just

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.510 
there's the motor runnin you know i just
thought<00:06:34.090> i<00:06:34.120> would<00:06:34.330> share<00:06:34.600> this<00:06:34.900> with<00:06:35.110> the

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
thought i would share this with the

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.860 
thought i would share this with the
people<00:06:36.520> that<00:06:36.550> are<00:06:36.700> following<00:06:37.150> along<00:06:37.330> and

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.870 
people that are following along and

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.150 
people that are following along and
those<00:06:38.050> that<00:06:38.200> are<00:06:38.350> actually<00:06:38.650> building<00:06:38.890> these

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.160 
those that are actually building these

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.880 
those that are actually building these
things<00:06:39.430> is<00:06:39.730> this<00:06:40.440> charge-discharge<00:06:41.440> has<00:06:41.710> to

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:41.890 
things is this charge-discharge has to

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.850 
things is this charge-discharge has to
do<00:06:42.010> with<00:06:42.130> impedance<00:06:42.700> on<00:06:42.970> that<00:06:43.180> cell<00:06:43.800> it<00:06:44.800> can

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
do with impedance on that cell it can

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.940 
do with impedance on that cell it can
accept<00:06:45.580> a<00:06:45.670> charge<00:06:45.970> very<00:06:46.060> rapidly<00:06:46.930> and<00:06:47.200> it<00:06:47.800> can

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:47.950 
accept a charge very rapidly and it can

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.060 
accept a charge very rapidly and it can
meter<00:06:48.250> it<00:06:48.460> out<00:06:48.610> very<00:06:48.910> slowly<00:06:49.180> and<00:06:49.750> this<00:06:50.740> charge

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.070 
meter it out very slowly and this charge

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.510 
meter it out very slowly and this charge
discharge<00:06:51.460> curve<00:06:52.300> that<00:06:52.750> we're<00:06:52.960> studying<00:06:53.520> I'm

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 
discharge curve that we're studying I'm

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.010 
discharge curve that we're studying I'm
going<00:06:54.670> to<00:06:54.730> be<00:06:54.850> looking<00:06:55.420> at<00:06:55.570> it<00:06:55.690> on<00:06:55.750> a<00:06:55.780> computer

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.020 
going to be looking at it on a computer

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.600 
going to be looking at it on a computer
pretty<00:06:56.620> soon<00:06:56.950> is<00:06:57.940> very<00:06:58.300> fascinating<00:06:59.460> see<00:07:00.460> this

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:00.610 
pretty soon is very fascinating see this

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:06.390 
pretty soon is very fascinating see this
is<00:07:00.790> starting<00:07:01.030> to<00:07:01.120> slow<00:07:01.390> down<00:07:01.420> now<00:07:05.130> so<00:07:06.130> you'll

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 
is starting to slow down now so you'll

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:12.510 
is starting to slow down now so you'll
see<00:07:06.700> this<00:07:06.850> blink<00:07:10.560> and<00:07:11.560> was<00:07:11.740> not<00:07:11.920> picking<00:07:12.310> it<00:07:12.400> up

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.520 
see this blink and was not picking it up

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.270 
see this blink and was not picking it up
we<00:07:13.150> do<00:07:13.360> this<00:07:13.450> one<00:07:13.720> more<00:07:13.900> time<00:07:14.170> watch<00:07:14.530> the<00:07:14.770> LED

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280 
we do this one more time watch the LED

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.430 
we do this one more time watch the LED
here<00:07:15.550> when<00:07:15.700> I<00:07:15.760> do<00:07:15.820> this<00:07:18.660> goes<00:07:19.660> the<00:07:19.840> LED<00:07:20.260> on

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:20.440 
here when I do this goes the LED on

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.830 
here when I do this goes the LED on
bright<00:07:22.470> there's<00:07:23.470> the<00:07:23.650> wheel<00:07:23.860> spinning<00:07:24.340> up

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 
bright there's the wheel spinning up

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:32.390 
bright there's the wheel spinning up
show<00:07:25.840> you<00:07:25.870> the<00:07:26.020> voltage<00:07:26.440> again

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.450 

this<00:07:33.000> will<00:07:33.210> go<00:07:33.389> up<00:07:33.570> to<00:07:33.750> about<00:07:34.050> a<00:07:34.380> volt<00:07:35.220> and<00:07:35.400> a

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:35.460 
this will go up to about a volt and a

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:42.860 
this will go up to about a volt and a
half<00:07:35.699> to<00:07:35.940> one<00:07:36.150> point<00:07:36.419> eight<00:07:36.690> bolts<00:07:41.870> anyway
