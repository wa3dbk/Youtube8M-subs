left<00:01:50.790> out<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.240> figure<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.810> could

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
left out of the figure and you could

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.170 
left out of the figure and you could
just<00:01:52.380> pose<00:01:52.649> him<00:01:52.920> because<00:01:53.280> there's<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.850> lot<00:01:54.149> of

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
just pose him because there's a lot of

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.700

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
stuff in here that creates a lot of

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.530 
stuff in here that creates a lot of
weight<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.070> makes<00:01:56.430> him<00:01:56.610> top-heavy<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.299> tau

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
weight that makes him top-heavy and tau

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.920 
weight that makes him top-heavy and tau
as<00:01:57.810> well<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:59.159> be<00:01:59.280> honest<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.850> don't<00:02:00.600> think

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
as well and to be honest I don't think

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.859 
as well and to be honest I don't think
the<00:02:01.110> gimmick<00:02:01.409> works<00:02:01.890> all<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.520> well<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:03.210> it

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
the gimmick works all that well it it

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.180 
the gimmick works all that well it it
just<00:02:04.110> kind<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:06.049> moving<00:02:07.049> his<00:02:07.259> arms<00:02:07.740> the

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
just kind of is moving his arms the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.279 
just kind of is moving his arms the
engineering<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.849> fantastic<00:02:09.539> though<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.869> will

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
engineering is fantastic though I will

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.559 
engineering is fantastic though I will
give<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.709> Lego<00:02:10.890> designers<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.700> great

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
give the Lego designers that great

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
piece and then you have another short

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.160 
piece and then you have another short
piece<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.940> pegs<00:02:39.209> into<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.600> bottom<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:40.020> his

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170
