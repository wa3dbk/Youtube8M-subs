now they about a vintage machine in a
very<00:00:07.500> nice<00:00:07.710> example<00:00:07.890> we<00:00:08.400> have<00:00:08.550> this<00:00:08.700> in<00:00:08.880> for<00:00:09.090> a

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
very nice example we have this in for a

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.070 
very nice example we have this in for a
rebuild<00:00:10.759> it's<00:00:11.759> quite<00:00:12.269> beautiful<00:00:12.809> with<00:00:12.929> the

really good for to have a real powerful
steam<00:01:33.509> flaw<00:01:41.000> okay<00:01:43.130> that<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.939> short

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
steam flaw okay that just a short

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.999 
steam flaw okay that just a short
demonstration<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:48.560> have<00:01:49.560> seen<00:01:49.829> you

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
demonstration that you have seen you

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.060 
demonstration that you have seen you
have<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.430> get<00:01:50.610> really<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.509> lot<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.899> power<00:01:52.110> going

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
have to get really a lot of power going

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.050 
have to get really a lot of power going
the<00:01:53.310> Machine<00:01:53.640> up<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.990> with<00:01:55.650> full<00:01:56.490> steam<00:01:56.880> to

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
the Machine up and with full steam to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.240 
the Machine up and with full steam to
get<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.360> ball<00:01:57.680> it's<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.950> spring<00:01:59.580> piston<00:02:00.240> and

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
get the ball it's a spring piston and

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.830 
get the ball it's a spring piston and
interestingly<00:02:02.250> enough<00:02:02.580> it<00:02:03.390> has<00:02:03.690> an

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
interestingly enough it has an

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.300 
interestingly enough it has an
adjustable<00:02:04.580> format<00:02:06.200> that<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.470> can<00:02:07.500> I'm<00:02:08.130> back

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
adjustable format that you can I'm back

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.240 
adjustable format that you can I'm back
to<00:02:08.460> low<00:02:08.580> power<00:02:08.790> that<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:10.020> can<00:02:10.290> adjust<00:02:10.770> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
to low power that you can adjust the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.850 
to low power that you can adjust the
size<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.670> shot<00:02:11.970> by<00:02:12.780> adjusting<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.680> length

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
size of the shot by adjusting the length

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.670 
size of the shot by adjusting the length
of<00:02:14.100> this<00:02:14.250> first<00:02:14.610> nut<00:02:15.090> right<00:02:16.050> now<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.290> have<00:02:16.650> it

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
of this first nut right now I have it

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.830 
of this first nut right now I have it
set<00:02:17.070> so<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.490> bottom<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:17.910> piston<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.540> right

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
set so the bottom of the piston is right

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.930 
set so the bottom of the piston is right
at<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.170> bottom<00:02:19.320> of<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.680> cylinder<00:02:19.860> has<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.400> as

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
at the bottom of the cylinder has it as

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.140 
at the bottom of the cylinder has it as
a<00:02:21.000> cylinder<00:02:21.840> sleeve<00:02:22.410> which<00:02:22.680> inserts<00:02:23.090> in<00:02:24.090> the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
a cylinder sleeve which inserts in the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.860 
a cylinder sleeve which inserts in the
bottom<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:25.080> has<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.380> old-style

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
bottom and has the old-style

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.600 
bottom and has the old-style
dispersion<00:02:27.870> screen<00:02:28.200> which<00:02:28.920> attaches<00:02:29.280> the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
dispersion screen which attaches the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.440 
dispersion screen which attaches the
small<00:02:29.880> nuts<00:02:30.210> and<00:02:30.590> so<00:02:31.590> there's<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.370> can't<00:02:33.240> up

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
small nuts and so there's you can't up

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.500 
small nuts and so there's you can't up
dose<00:02:33.920> on<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:34.980> machine<00:02:35.190> very<00:02:35.580> much<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.970> VuPoint

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
strong on these machines and once you

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.970 
strong on these machines and once you
you<00:03:51.019> adequately<00:03:51.910> handle<00:03:52.910> your<00:03:53.980> temperature

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
you adequately handle your temperature

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.830 
you adequately handle your temperature
profiling<00:03:55.610> on<00:03:55.760> then<00:03:55.970> they<00:03:56.090> make<00:03:56.269> an<00:03:56.420> excellent
