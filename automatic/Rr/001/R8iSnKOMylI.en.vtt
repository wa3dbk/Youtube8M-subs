00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.810
 that three types of serves are in tennis 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.820
 before talking about the three types of 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.070
 sake how do you ask me the question 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.590
 many students ask me how many types of 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.250
 salt there is but before entering it 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:42.760
 I would like to make it clear that the service 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:46.030
 tennis is basically a pitch and 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.900
 as such it must be worked ie it must 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:53.260
 be a fluid economic movement and very 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.900
 natural with a lot of pace at a level 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.420
 physical one works as if from a 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.060
 launching is this case for example to 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.610
 times 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:07.050
 greetings already of competition to improve 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.700
 its capacity in terms of power 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.770
 you work with a medicine ball of a 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.100
 kilo kilo and half two kilos and they are made 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.680
 throws with that ball too 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.200
 then as an application you are looking 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.610
 Martinian like the faces of the 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.740
 sand stones 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.040
 it's usually an old ball that's 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.460
 broken or an opening is made and 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.640
 filled with sand beach or river 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:40.020
 in this way they weigh a lot of 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.020
 releases well we are 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.950
 a little more 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.140
 it comes in handy too 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.100
 the old ones that are not worth broken and 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.100
 a launch is also made 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.640
 in this way so that it descends 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.200
 well from behind 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.200
 and it moves towards the sky upwards 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.160
 this would be from work exercises 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.070
 physical but the most important thing of the serve 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.860
 of course it would be the ring 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:28.380
 the rhythm is the most important the rhythm 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.890
 of the service is 1 2 3 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.890
 consists 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.219
 two 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.219
 fluency with the base 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.450
 12 is the cause 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.080
 from the other I see 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.080
 this would be a good king 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.080
 12 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.200
 12 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.120
 if we achieved this 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.710
 the sake is the same as a pitch 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.690
 our launch then surely 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.690
 everything else will be easy
