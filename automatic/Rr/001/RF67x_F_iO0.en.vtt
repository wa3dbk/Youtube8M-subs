00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.590 

so<00:00:01.520> first<00:00:02.520> we<00:00:02.669> just<00:00:02.700> have<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:02.939> quick<00:00:03.179> look<00:00:03.360> I

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
so first we just have a quick look I

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.260 
so first we just have a quick look I
mean<00:00:03.689> that<00:00:03.899> is<00:00:04.110> an<00:00:04.230> error

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:05.270 
mean that is an error

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.870 
mean that is an error
11:06<00:00:06.270> which<00:00:07.280> technically<00:00:08.280> in<00:00:08.340> my<00:00:08.490> book<00:00:08.730> is

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
11:06 which technically in my book is

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.700 
11:06 which technically in my book is
not<00:00:09.090> really<00:00:09.389> an<00:00:09.480> error<00:00:09.690> it<00:00:09.990> just<00:00:10.170> can't<00:00:10.410> find

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
not really an error it just can't find

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.650 
not really an error it just can't find
the<00:00:10.860> native<00:00:11.190> driver<00:00:11.490> so<00:00:11.849> it's<00:00:12.000> going<00:00:12.599> to

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
the native driver so it's going to

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.760 
the native driver so it's going to
default<00:00:13.110> back<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:14.120> UPD<00:00:15.379> let's<00:00:16.379> just<00:00:16.650> have

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
default back to the UPD let's just have

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.670 
default back to the UPD let's just have
a<00:00:16.800> look<00:00:17.010> if<00:00:17.130> I've<00:00:17.369> got<00:00:17.580> any<00:00:18.470> just<00:00:19.470> kind<00:00:19.619> of

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
a look if I've got any just kind of

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:31.429 
a look if I've got any just kind of
filter<00:00:20.539> on<00:00:22.460> event<00:00:23.460> ID<00:00:25.519> 1116<00:00:30.050> so<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.109> do<00:00:31.170> have<00:00:31.410> a

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
filter on event ID 1116 so I do have a

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.950 
filter on event ID 1116 so I do have a
few<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:33.920> you<00:00:34.920> can<00:00:35.130> see<00:00:35.340> from<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.930> text<00:00:36.930> that

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
few and you can see from the text that

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.470 
few and you can see from the text that
it's<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.440> Add<00:00:37.590> Printer<00:00:38.040> call<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.850> this

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
it's the Add Printer call in this

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.209 
it's the Add Printer call in this
particular<00:00:39.809> instance<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.680> you're<00:00:41.100> actually

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
particular instance and you're actually

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.709 
particular instance and you're actually
given<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.640> little<00:00:41.850> bit<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.059> information<00:00:42.600> you'll

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
given a little bit of information you'll

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.920 
given a little bit of information you'll
give<00:00:42.899> them<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.170> status<00:00:44.660> obviously<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> hex

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
give them that status obviously a hex

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.170 
give them that status obviously a hex
code<00:00:46.230> 3<00:00:47.219> eb<00:00:47.969> there's<00:00:48.390> about<00:00:48.600> 4<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.079> think<00:00:49.559> and

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
code 3 eb there's about 4 I think and

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.170 
code 3 eb there's about 4 I think and
you<00:00:51.180> can<00:00:51.360> search<00:00:51.629> for<00:00:51.899> this<00:00:52.050> on<00:00:52.550> Citrix<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.820> I

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
you can search for this on Citrix and I

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.189 
you can search for this on Citrix and I
think<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.480> varies<00:00:54.989> from<00:00:56.690> what<00:00:57.690> if<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.870> had<00:00:58.079> in

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
think it varies from what if I had in

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.049 
think it varies from what if I had in
the<00:00:58.289> past<00:00:58.500> yeah<00:00:59.250> if<00:00:59.370> you've<00:00:59.520> notched<00:00:59.760> the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
the past yeah if you've notched the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.520 
the past yeah if you've notched the
Citrix<00:01:01.910> print<00:01:02.910> manager<00:01:03.420> user<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:04.080> runs<00:01:04.350> that

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
Citrix print manager user that runs that

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.530 
Citrix print manager user that runs that
service<00:01:05.189> let's<00:01:05.580> just<00:01:05.760> have<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> quick<00:01:06.180> look<00:01:06.240> at

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
service let's just have a quick look at

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.750 
service let's just have a quick look at
him<00:01:06.750> while<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.200> while<00:01:08.130> we're<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.460> there<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
him while we while we're in there and

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.899 
him while we while we're in there and
looking<00:01:09.030> at<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.689> we're<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:09.930> one<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.909> some

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
looking at it so we're on one and some

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.810 
looking at it so we're on one and some
look<00:01:12.060> at<00:01:12.090> services<00:01:14.689> first<00:01:15.689> thing<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.820> point

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
look at services first thing to point

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.670 
look at services first thing to point
out<00:01:18.180> let's<00:01:18.450> let's<00:01:18.840> stay<00:01:19.020> with<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.259> Citrix

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
out let's let's stay with the Citrix

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.080 
out let's let's stay with the Citrix
first<00:01:22.680> thing<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.979> point<00:01:23.130> out<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:25.369> this<00:01:26.369> depends

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
first thing to point out is this depends

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.910 
first thing to point out is this depends
well.ok<00:01:27.780> depends<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.500> remote<00:01:28.770> procedure

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
well.ok depends on the remote procedure

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.810 
well.ok depends on the remote procedure
call<00:01:29.430> but<00:01:29.810> if<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.020> spool<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.290> not<00:01:31.619> up<00:01:31.770> then<00:01:32.189> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
call but if the spool is not up then the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.399 
call but if the spool is not up then the
print<00:01:33.060> manager<00:01:33.479> said<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> citrix<00:01:34.170> print

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
print manager said the citrix print

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.870 
print manager said the citrix print
manager<00:01:34.799> service<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.280> not<00:01:35.400> going<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.729> up

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
manager service is not going to be up

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.469 
manager service is not going to be up
either<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:38.930> sometimes<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.049> particular<00:01:40.439> user

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
either so sometimes this particular user

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.230 
either so sometimes this particular user
which<00:01:42.479> has<00:01:42.750> kind<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.860> power<00:01:44.399> user<00:01:44.790> rights

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
which has kind of a power user rights

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.940 
which has kind of a power user rights
but<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.750> has<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.960> absolute<00:01:46.320> minimum<00:01:46.560> rights

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
but it has the absolute minimum rights

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.660 
but it has the absolute minimum rights
to<00:01:47.280> be<00:01:47.399> able<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.670> print<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.680> basically<00:01:49.680> load<00:01:50.640> I

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
to be able to print and basically load I

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.410 
to be able to print and basically load I
think<00:01:51.149> device<00:01:51.689> driver<00:01:53.090> basically<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.180> do<00:01:54.270> that

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
think device driver basically to do that

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.530 
think device driver basically to do that
Auto<00:01:54.570> creation<00:01:55.229> method<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:56.640> sometimes<00:01:57.390> that

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
Auto creation method so sometimes that

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.760 
Auto creation method so sometimes that
doesn't<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:59.180> enough<00:02:00.180> access<00:02:00.560> so<00:02:01.560> I've

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
doesn't have enough access so I've

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.999 
doesn't have enough access so I've
cloned<00:02:02.399> Citrix<00:02:02.969> servers<00:02:03.299> in<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.540> past

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
cloned Citrix servers in the past

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.109 
cloned Citrix servers in the past
admittedly<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.100> don't<00:02:05.369> do<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.640> anymore

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
admittedly I don't do that anymore

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.650 
admittedly I don't do that anymore
and<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:07.530> cloning<00:02:07.890> process<00:02:08.099> somehow

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
and the cloning process somehow

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.900 
and the cloning process somehow
interrupted<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:10.310> permissions

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
interrupted the permissions

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
interrupted the permissions
or<00:02:13.490> user<00:02:14.490> rights<00:02:14.820> for<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.240> particular<00:02:15.690> user

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
or user rights for that particular user

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.380 
or user rights for that particular user
so<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:17.250> can<00:02:17.370> actually<00:02:17.580> recreate<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.180> in<00:02:18.270> a

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
so you can actually recreate it in a

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.970 
so you can actually recreate it in a
special<00:02:18.780> way<00:02:18.900> but<00:02:18.960> there's<00:02:19.320> little<00:02:19.440> utility

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
special way but there's little utility

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.940 
special way but there's little utility
that<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.310> can<00:02:20.460> use<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.850> recreate<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.950> print

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
that you can use to recreate the print

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.350 
that you can use to recreate the print
manager<00:02:23.990> that's<00:02:24.990> probably<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.410> simplest

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
manager that's probably the simplest

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.300 
manager that's probably the simplest
occasionally<00:02:27.360> if<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.570> want<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.960> promote<00:02:28.310> the

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
occasionally if you want to promote the

there<00:02:45.850> it<00:02:45.970> is<00:02:46.740> so<00:02:47.740> occasionally<00:02:48.040> just<00:02:48.940> for

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
there it is so occasionally just for

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.730 
there it is so occasionally just for
troubleshooting<00:02:49.600> purposes<00:02:49.840> I<00:02:50.350> this<00:02:50.410> is<00:02:50.709> a

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
troubleshooting purposes I this is a

00:02:50.740 --> 00:03:02.300 
troubleshooting purposes I this is a
power<00:02:51.010> user<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:52.780> might<00:02:53.170> just<00:02:53.500> make<00:02:53.890> that<00:02:54.130> a

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.290 

interesting<00:03:03.310> my<00:03:03.550> eyes<00:03:03.700> are<00:03:03.819> not<00:03:03.850> coming<00:03:04.209> up

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
interesting my eyes are not coming up

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:13.690 
interesting my eyes are not coming up
with<00:03:04.330> a<00:03:04.450> local<00:03:04.810> admin<00:03:05.140> perhaps<00:03:05.590> after<00:03:05.890> book

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.500 

good<00:03:14.240> work<00:03:15.069> anyway<00:03:16.069> I<00:03:16.280> would<00:03:18.340> name<00:03:19.510> didn't

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
good work anyway I would name didn't

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.600 
good work anyway I would name didn't
come<00:03:20.540> up<00:03:20.660> with<00:03:20.870> anything<00:03:21.020> I<00:03:21.410> need<00:03:22.310> to<00:03:22.370> do<00:03:22.459> that

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
come up with anything I need to do that

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.220 
come up with anything I need to do that
properly<00:03:22.790> next<00:03:23.060> time<00:03:23.330> so<00:03:23.840> I<00:03:23.870> would<00:03:23.959> make<00:03:24.200> that

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
properly next time so I would make that

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.770 
properly next time so I would make that
a<00:03:24.770> member<00:03:25.459> of<00:03:25.580> the<00:03:25.700> local<00:03:26.060> administrators

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
a member of the local administrators

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.390 
a member of the local administrators
obviously<00:03:27.200> exactly<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.680> way<00:03:27.740> around<00:03:28.130> when<00:03:28.340> I

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
obviously exactly the way around when I

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.320 
obviously exactly the way around when I
think<00:03:28.640> about<00:03:28.730> it<00:03:30.550> simpler<00:03:31.550> to<00:03:31.700> go<00:03:31.820> into<00:03:32.120> there

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
think about it simpler to go into there

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.690 
think about it simpler to go into there
and<00:03:32.570> then<00:03:32.930> add<00:03:33.050> it<00:03:33.200> from<00:03:33.320> here<00:03:33.620> so<00:03:34.220> basically<00:03:34.610> I

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
and then add it from here so basically I

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.610 
and then add it from here so basically I
promoted<00:03:35.120> from<00:03:35.209> power<00:03:35.450> user<00:03:35.720> to<00:03:35.959> local<00:03:36.290> admin

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
promoted from power user to local admin

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.470 
promoted from power user to local admin
and<00:03:37.160> if<00:03:37.280> for<00:03:37.370> some<00:03:37.430> reason<00:03:37.970> that<00:03:39.010> error

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
and if for some reason that error

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.540 
and if for some reason that error
11:16<00:03:41.480> went<00:03:41.660> away<00:03:41.810> I<00:03:42.290> know<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:42.980> permissions

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
11:16 went away I know the permissions

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.160 
11:16 went away I know the permissions
were<00:03:43.730> incorrect<00:03:44.239> I<00:03:44.330> know<00:03:44.450> that's<00:03:44.660> the<00:03:44.810> reason

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
were incorrect I know that's the reason

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.229 
were incorrect I know that's the reason
so<00:03:45.200> I<00:03:45.620> probably<00:03:45.950> recreate<00:03:46.520> it<00:03:46.700> rather<00:03:47.060> than

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
so I probably recreate it rather than

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.560 
so I probably recreate it rather than
mess<00:03:47.750> about<00:03:47.900> with<00:03:48.050> the<00:03:48.290> permissions<00:03:49.450> let's<00:03:50.450> go

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
mess about with the permissions let's go

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:56.550 
mess about with the permissions let's go
back<00:03:50.780> to<00:03:50.989> the<00:03:53.290> very<00:03:54.290> on<00:03:54.470> the<00:03:54.560> application<00:03:55.190> log

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
back to the very on the application log

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.110 
back to the very on the application log
can't<00:03:57.560> remember<00:03:57.739> which<00:03:57.890> one<00:03:57.950> we're<00:03:58.430> on<00:03:58.459> maybe

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
can't remember which one we're on maybe

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.870 
can't remember which one we're on maybe
we're<00:03:59.330> on<00:03:59.420> the<00:03:59.510> first<00:03:59.750> one<00:04:00.080> okay<00:04:00.700> so<00:04:01.700> you<00:04:01.790> can

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
we're on the first one okay so you can

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.350 
we're on the first one okay so you can
tell<00:04:02.030> a<00:04:02.060> little<00:04:02.209> bit<00:04:02.330> from<00:04:02.660> that<00:04:04.090> little<00:04:05.090> hex

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
tell a little bit from that little hex

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.150 
tell a little bit from that little hex
code<00:04:05.690> and<00:04:05.989> obviously<00:04:06.800> you<00:04:06.890> do<00:04:07.010> the

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
code and obviously you do the

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.000 
code and obviously you do the
appropriate<00:04:07.400> fix
