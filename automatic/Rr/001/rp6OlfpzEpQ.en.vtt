have something to do with that gun and

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:46.800 
have something to do with that gun and
we<00:01:37.729> can<00:01:37.880> sling<00:01:38.180> zombies<00:01:38.690> using<00:01:38.930> it<00:01:39.550> with<00:01:40.550> that

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.340 

well<00:01:47.810> at<00:01:47.990> least<00:01:49.810> figuring<00:01:50.810> in<00:01:50.899> this<00:01:51.050> out<00:01:51.200> on

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
well at least figuring in this out on

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.040 
well at least figuring in this out on
like<00:01:51.530> round<00:01:51.770> 32<00:01:52.190> that's<00:01:53.090> free<00:01:53.360> stellar<00:01:53.720> not

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
like round 32 that's free stellar not

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.780 
like round 32 that's free stellar not
gonna<00:01:54.229> lie

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
gonna lie

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.830 
gonna lie
hopefully<00:01:55.790> zombies<00:01:56.180> don't<00:01:56.360> break<00:01:56.540> it<00:01:56.690> I've<00:01:56.810> a

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
hopefully zombies don't break it I've a

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.210 
hopefully zombies don't break it I've a
feeling<00:01:56.990> they<00:01:57.229> can't<00:01:57.500> break<00:01:57.649> it<00:01:57.800> off<00:01:57.920> we<00:01:58.070> can

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
feeling they can't break it off we can

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:09.700 
feeling they can't break it off we can
get<00:01:58.369> a<00:01:58.399> new<00:01:58.580> one

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.230 

to<00:02:10.710> make<00:02:10.920> like<00:02:11.100> a<00:02:11.130> wall<00:02:11.460> of<00:02:11.490> them<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:11.970> see<00:02:12.120> what

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
to make like a wall of them and see what

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:19.540 
to make like a wall of them and see what
they<00:02:12.360> do

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
killing it sounds like the last one that

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.870 
killing it sounds like the last one that
we<00:02:24.810> have<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.200> nav<00:02:25.410> card<00:02:25.740> bill<00:02:25.950> we<00:02:26.400> have<00:02:26.670> the

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
yeah see it's like trampoline that's

00:03:52.700 --> 00:04:05.010 
yeah see it's like trampoline that's
gotta<00:03:53.060> be<00:03:53.150> like<00:03:53.510> it's<00:03:54.470> like<00:03:54.590> a<00:03:54.709> mousetrap<00:04:01.989> whoa
