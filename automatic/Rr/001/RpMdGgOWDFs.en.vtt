00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.710 

let's<00:00:10.770> start<00:00:11.040> this<00:00:11.190> part<00:00:11.520> of<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.640> analysis<00:00:12.150> by

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:12.720 
let's start this part of the analysis by

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.330 
let's start this part of the analysis by
considering<00:00:13.200> what<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.410> said<00:00:13.680> at<00:00:13.800> the<00:00:13.830> end<00:00:13.950> of

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
considering what I said at the end of

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.660 
considering what I said at the end of
the<00:00:14.430> last<00:00:14.580> video<00:00:14.850> a<00:00:15.800> bank's<00:00:16.800> I'll<00:00:16.950> use<00:00:17.310> our

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
the last video a bank's I'll use our

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.050 
the last video a bank's I'll use our
money<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.150> your<00:00:18.990> iou's<00:00:19.560> are<00:00:19.860> not<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.490> the

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
money and your iou's are not and the

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.850 
money and your iou's are not and the
chief<00:00:21.450> reason<00:00:21.930> for<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.320> difference<00:00:22.500> between

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
chief reason for the difference between

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.910 
chief reason for the difference between
the<00:00:23.160> two<00:00:23.340> is<00:00:23.520> that<00:00:23.939> people<00:00:24.480> will<00:00:24.630> take<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.439> banks

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
the two is that people will take a banks

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.400 
the two is that people will take a banks
I'll<00:00:26.130> use<00:00:26.550> as<00:00:27.120> payment<00:00:27.660> for<00:00:27.720> most<00:00:28.020> goods<00:00:28.230> and

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
I'll use as payment for most goods and

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.590 
I'll use as payment for most goods and
services<00:00:28.800> they'll<00:00:29.460> reliably<00:00:29.940> do<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.420> we

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 
services they'll reliably do so we

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.940 
services they'll reliably do so we
haven't<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:30.930> all<00:00:31.080> know<00:00:31.350> that<00:00:31.380> people<00:00:31.800> will

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
haven't we all know that people will

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.030 
haven't we all know that people will
take<00:00:32.220> bank<00:00:32.610> credit<00:00:33.030> us<00:00:33.180> payment<00:00:33.440> and<00:00:34.440> we<00:00:34.890> all
