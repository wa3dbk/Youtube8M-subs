about<00:02:15.970> this<00:02:16.330> figure<00:02:16.570> I<00:02:17.130> hate<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.280> fact<00:02:18.490> that<00:02:18.700> a

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
about this figure I hate the fact that a

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.400 
about this figure I hate the fact that a
lot<00:02:19.270> of<00:02:19.300> these<00:02:19.450> force<00:02:19.750> figures<00:02:20.050> have<00:02:20.230> this

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
lot of these force figures have this

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.030 
lot of these force figures have this
where<00:02:20.710> you<00:02:21.550> need<00:02:21.940> these<00:02:22.480> parts<00:02:22.960> if<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:23.740> lose

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
where you need these parts if you lose

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.110 
where you need these parts if you lose
them<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.730> figure<00:02:25.060> is<00:02:25.710> useless<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:28.060> to

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
them the figure is useless so to

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.810 
them the figure is useless so to
transform<00:02:28.660> will<00:02:29.290> just<00:02:29.470> lift<00:02:29.800> that<00:02:29.860> up<00:02:29.980> lift

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
transform will just lift that up lift

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:37.980 
transform will just lift that up lift
that<00:02:30.940> up<00:02:31.890> pull<00:02:32.890> those<00:02:33.100> forward<00:02:36.780> swing<00:02:37.780> that

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
that up pull those forward swing that

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.830 
that up pull those forward swing that
down<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.620> slide<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:39.040> down<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.640> twist<00:02:40.450> it<00:02:40.630> so

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
down and slide it down and twist it so

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:48.600 
down and slide it down and twist it so
that<00:02:41.010> we<00:02:42.010> can<00:02:42.220> just<00:02:42.490> form<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.030> legs<00:02:43.210> up<00:02:47.610> we're

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
that we can just form the legs up we're

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.000 
that we can just form the legs up we're
going<00:02:48.760> to<00:02:48.880> take<00:02:49.390> this<00:02:49.630> and<00:02:49.960> rotate<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:50.590> down<00:02:50.620> to

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
going to take this and rotate it down to

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.500 
going to take this and rotate it down to
form<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.340> shoulder<00:02:53.310> turn<00:02:54.310> that<00:02:54.510> completely

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
form the shoulder turn that completely

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.930 
form the shoulder turn that completely
around<00:02:55.750> like<00:02:56.020> that<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:57.280> rotate<00:02:57.610> up<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.850> head

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
around like that and rotate up the head

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.180 
around like that and rotate up the head
and<00:02:58.870> here<00:02:59.410> we<00:02:59.500> have<00:02:59.650> Tara<00:03:00.340> Gator<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:01.920> I<00:03:02.920> have

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
and here we have Tara Gator and I have

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.360 
and here we have Tara Gator and I have
to<00:03:03.340> say<00:03:03.520> in<00:03:03.880> robot<00:03:04.330> mode<00:03:04.410> he<00:03:05.410> is<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:05.560> lot<00:03:06.010> less

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
to say in robot mode he is a lot less

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.350 
to say in robot mode he is a lot less
impressive<00:03:07.230> sadly<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.520> really<00:03:09.520> loved<00:03:09.760> him<00:03:09.910> in

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
impressive sadly I really loved him in

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.470 
impressive sadly I really loved him in
beast<00:03:10.990> mode<00:03:11.140> but<00:03:11.770> the<00:03:12.550> robot<00:03:12.820> mode<00:03:13.000> is<00:03:13.060> not

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
beast mode but the robot mode is not

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.570 
beast mode but the robot mode is not
that<00:03:13.780> impressive<00:03:14.080> at<00:03:14.530> all<00:03:14.590> I<00:03:15.630> totally<00:03:16.630> did<00:03:16.870> the

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
that impressive at all I totally did the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.100 
that impressive at all I totally did the
part<00:03:18.580> of<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.760> Shelby<00:03:19.300> coming<00:03:19.600> apart<00:03:19.870> his

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
part of the Shelby coming apart his

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.460 
part of the Shelby coming apart his
hands<00:03:20.709> but<00:03:21.989> he's<00:03:22.989> not<00:03:23.260> very<00:03:23.790> cool<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:25.000> look<00:03:25.150> at

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
hands but he's not very cool to look at

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.860 
hands but he's not very cool to look at
head<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.950> hit<00:03:27.160> or<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.459> face<00:03:27.790> is<00:03:28.630> actually

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
head the hit or the face is actually

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.930 
head the hit or the face is actually
nicely<00:03:29.320> detailed<00:03:29.770> and<00:03:30.100> carries<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.670> shell

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
nicely detailed and carries the shell

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.360 
nicely detailed and carries the shell
motif<00:03:31.440> along<00:03:32.440> with<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.770> rest<00:03:32.950> of<00:03:33.130> the<00:03:33.190> figure

motif along with the rest of the figure

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.140 
motif along with the rest of the figure
kind<00:03:34.209> of<00:03:34.330> that<00:03:34.450> growling<00:03:35.200> look<00:03:35.760> it's<00:03:36.760> not<00:03:36.970> as

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
kind of that growling look it's not as

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.820 
kind of that growling look it's not as
detailed<00:03:37.570> as<00:03:37.750> some<00:03:37.900> of<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.050> other<00:03:38.200> faces<00:03:38.680> I've

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
detailed as some of the other faces I've

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.150 
detailed as some of the other faces I've
seen<00:03:39.100> but<00:03:39.760> it's<00:03:39.910> not<00:03:40.060> bad<00:03:40.330> um<00:03:41.160> detailing

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
seen but it's not bad um detailing

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.890 
seen but it's not bad um detailing
across<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.670> rest<00:03:42.850> of<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.060> figure<00:03:43.239> isn't<00:03:43.540> that

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
across the rest of the figure isn't that

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.040 
across the rest of the figure isn't that
bad<00:03:44.110> but<00:03:44.350> it's<00:03:44.470> just<00:03:44.650> kind<00:03:44.830> of<00:03:44.890> boring

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
bad but it's just kind of boring

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.170 
bad but it's just kind of boring
it's<00:03:47.050> okay<00:03:47.590> yes<00:03:47.950> we've<00:03:48.250> seen<00:03:48.489> molded<00:03:48.940> lines

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
it's okay yes we've seen molded lines

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.370 
it's okay yes we've seen molded lines
before<00:03:49.540> what<00:03:50.230> they<00:03:50.470> do<00:03:50.650> a<00:03:51.690> giant<00:03:52.690> crocodile

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
before what they do a giant crocodile

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.280 
before what they do a giant crocodile
head<00:03:53.590> sticking<00:03:53.950> off<00:03:54.160> his<00:03:54.340> right<00:03:54.519> shoulder<00:03:54.730> is

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
head sticking off his right shoulder is

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.900 
head sticking off his right shoulder is
pretty<00:03:56.290> darn<00:03:56.530> cool

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
pretty darn cool

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
pretty darn cool
so<00:03:57.910> he<00:03:58.360> cans<00:03:58.600> he<00:03:58.930> could<00:03:59.080> still<00:03:59.380> do<00:03:59.620> the

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
so he cans he could still do the

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.870 
so he cans he could still do the
crocodile<00:04:01.930> thing<00:04:02.650> which<00:04:02.920> is<00:04:03.130> kind<00:04:03.400> of<00:04:03.519> dumb

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
crocodile thing which is kind of dumb

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.540 
crocodile thing which is kind of dumb
gimmick<00:04:04.180> but<00:04:04.570> still<00:04:04.900> so<00:04:05.800> let's<00:04:06.160> go<00:04:06.280> ahead<00:04:06.370> and

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
gimmick but still so let's go ahead and

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.040 
gimmick but still so let's go ahead and
get<00:04:06.670> him<00:04:06.820> armed<00:04:07.150> up<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:08.700> shell<00:04:09.700> will<00:04:10.420> only<00:04:10.660> fit

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
get him armed up the shell will only fit

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.830 
get him armed up the shell will only fit
on<00:04:11.260> this<00:04:11.500> arm<00:04:11.800> and<00:04:13.080> pegs<00:04:14.080> there<00:04:14.410> holes<00:04:14.950> there

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
on this arm and pegs there holes there

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:24.029 
on this arm and pegs there holes there
you<00:04:16.840> can<00:04:17.019> do<00:04:17.230> it<00:04:17.280> either<00:04:19.440> this<00:04:20.440> way<00:04:21.479> or<00:04:22.890> turn<00:04:23.890> it

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
you can do it either this way or turn it

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:25.480 
you can do it either this way or turn it
around<00:04:24.130> like<00:04:24.700> he<00:04:24.880> hasn't<00:04:25.090> be

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
around like he hasn't be

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.129 
around like he hasn't be
mode<00:04:25.759> and<00:04:26.270> cover<00:04:27.259> up<00:04:27.530> his<00:04:27.800> entire<00:04:28.190> arm<00:04:29.139> the

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
mode and cover up his entire arm the

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.589 
mode and cover up his entire arm the
process<00:04:30.590> thus<00:04:30.830> pretty<00:04:31.759> much<00:04:31.940> eliminating<00:04:32.509> an

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:32.599 
process thus pretty much eliminating an

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:35.309 
process thus pretty much eliminating an
arm<00:04:32.780> and<00:04:33.139> any<00:04:33.740> possibility<00:04:34.400> that<00:04:34.580> side<00:04:34.819> hat

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:35.319 
arm and any possibility that side hat

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:39.219 
arm and any possibility that side hat
for<00:04:36.319> that<00:04:36.830> arm<00:04:37.389> come<00:04:38.389> under<00:04:38.599> the<00:04:38.690> tail<00:04:38.900> and

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
for that arm come under the tail and

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.140 
for that arm come under the tail and
flip<00:04:39.530> out<00:04:39.650> the<00:04:39.800> twin<00:04:39.979> blaster<00:04:40.460> and<00:04:40.669> I<00:04:40.789> like<00:04:41.000> to

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
flip out the twin blaster and I like to

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.070 
flip out the twin blaster and I like to
fold<00:04:41.360> the<00:04:41.599> crocodile<00:04:42.050> legs<00:04:42.289> up<00:04:42.610> just<00:04:43.610> because

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
fold the crocodile legs up just because

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.330 
fold the crocodile legs up just because
or<00:04:45.080> you<00:04:45.110> can<00:04:45.440> just<00:04:45.590> kind<00:04:45.770> of<00:04:45.800> turn<00:04:46.130> them<00:04:46.250> around

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
or you can just kind of turn them around

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
unfortunately this thing is so heavy

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.580

as you saw just even a little bit of

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:10.300 
as you saw just even a little bit of
movement<00:05:09.020> will<00:05:09.139> cause<00:05:09.319> the<00:05:09.530> shell<00:05:09.770> to<00:05:09.919> pop<00:05:10.099> off
