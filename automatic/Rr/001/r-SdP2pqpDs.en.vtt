00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.990
 hello guys gt 2015 we are in san 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.660
 francisco and I'm here with fabio di rim 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.220
 light that I sat at the end of 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.290
 don't look like the dwarf bagonghi because 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.300
 first of all my first technical question e 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.460
 as much as 6 all 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.380
 196 here is therefore rightly so 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.390
 seated because it would have been a lot 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.700
 embarrassing in any case we just have 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.789
 seen shooting which is a new title that is 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.460
 developed in italy and we are here you have of 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.410
 haiti xbox at the microsoft event 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.120
 organized for jurists where they come 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.890
 unveiled the independent games that 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.960
 will arrive on xbox one 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.760
 shortly then tell us a moment about 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.820
 virus what is this game like the 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.760
 concept 0 and a new 3d beat'em up 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.640
 scroll and is inspired by the classics like 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.649
 golden ax street rage greened 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.989
 fished out with new mechanics 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.809
 however the idea is to bring in 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.390
 a kind that has fallen into 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.309
 so many of the components of the 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.110
 team come to that generation of 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.519
 those classics of past years and 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.140
 so the right cough from the ok one 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.790
 let's play a game that brings us back a little 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.830
 in the past and that ours is connected 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.380
 childhood what we liked from there 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.090
 the idea of ​​the beat'em up we have put 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.400
 five of us are together 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.799
 We have been working the game for almost one 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.770
 year is what we have shown 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.409
 today the first playable demo of the game a 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.310
 an official event when the game will be 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.689
 available 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.979
 we expect to complete the development 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:32.990
 for summer then July August 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.400
 obviously we have so many ideas 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.740
 we want to insert in the game then 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.080
 this date could be mentioned depending on 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.060
 how much you allow us to enter and how much 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.820
 we can improve it implement you 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.700
 you are a team that has its home in 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.950
 Sicily right catania series 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.990
 but you told me that you are a team in 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.150
 international reality but we are two 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.210
 Catania boys a boy always 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.720
 Sicilian but of a ragusa a swedish is a 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.299
 Canadian 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.060
 and how the story of your team was born 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.649
 with foreigners because we know each other 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.240
 we have been giving together for several years 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.610
 I worked abroad for several years 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.610
 so they returned to Italy I decided 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.770
 to begin this adventure 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.560
 now here in Sicily first in others 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.599
 parts of italy with other realities we are 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.400
 returned we found ourselves ok 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.349
 we want to do this these project 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.200
 friends we want to collaborate great 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.790
 Great graphic artists have also come 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.860
 them in Sicily from the sun from 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.750
 good weather and now we are all there 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.790
 together with working on this project 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.590
 Angel food is good to say in 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.150
 climate is excellent from this point of view 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.769
 there are no problems 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.930
 why did you choose junichi between? 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.850
 develop and heroes unity because a 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.250
 framework and allows us to easily 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.459
 develop our own platform 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.049
 programmer was already quite knowledgeable 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.360
 community so the choice fell back 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.709
 mainly the instrument on him 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.060
 more suitable for him since we have a 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.180
 only programmer who takes care of 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.620
 all the code of the game and then yes 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.150
 lends itself very well to passing the 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.480
 side platform and wanting to make a 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.530
 multiplatform launch that seemed 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.980
 the most sensible choice 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.000
 last question how many levels e 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.220
 indicatively how long will it be along the 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.519
 the game we plan to provide the 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.070
 end a gameplay of about three hours 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.140
 of study on two different environments e 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.420
 approximately 45 levels per 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.070
 the setting is the first one 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.049
 will see that it is in the trailer that you see 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.549
 which we show you here at the gdc which is a 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.190
 futuristic setting with one 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.230
 weird city full of robots the second 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.060
 instead it will be more a setting with one 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.380
 forest a natural environment 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.269
 I'm always on technology because 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.400
 the whole shooting world is based on 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.560
 technology, however, the bra is a tool 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.269
 completely different to lucca for 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.880
 also vary the situations of 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.510
 perfect game then thanks a lot fabio 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.500
 I said it right from fabio di rim light 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.299
 perfect then guys from san francisco 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.329
 for the moment it is all see you at 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.329
 next
