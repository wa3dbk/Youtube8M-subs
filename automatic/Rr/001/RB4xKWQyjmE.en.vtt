00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 Hello everyone, beauty ksu I like 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.429
 always check all the beauty recipes in 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.440
 home conditions on myself and keep 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.340
 will refuse so our order table 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:19.080
 I fulfill the request of many girls and do 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.660
 a mask to narrow pores on the face of such 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.029
 problems usually suffer holders 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.010
 oily and combination skin and when 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.279
 pores open they are very strong 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.210
 polluted and almost every week 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.630
 you have to do face cleaning and therefore 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.300
 there are masks that narrow pores for 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.579
 that they are not polluted for this 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.040
 masks we need some oatmeal 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.930
 1 tablespoon to be needed 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.210
 grind in a coffee grinder and kefir 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.390
 I do not know how much to 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.500
 It turned out such a creamy paste 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.930
 let's say both oatmeal and kefir are very 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.880
 take good care of oily and 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.090
 combined 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:09.380
 skin and oatmeal in general is excellent 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:11.390
 means great product which is very 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.400
 often used in folk recipes 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.470
 beauty 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:19.040
 Just such a mask she narrows pores 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:24.650
 this mask needs to be done every day though 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:28.040
 there would be about 5 procedures in a day 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:32.170
 so that the pores really narrow the mask 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.000
 apply as always on cleansed face 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.050
 so I don't remember whether kefir said or not 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.810
 need to warm up 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.979
 so that masochka was lukewarm to 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:46.700
 it was comfortable to put on her face 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:52.009
 so here it looks like we put it 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:57.290
 thick for 15 minutes all waiting for 15 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:02:00.140
 minutes so I washed off the girl's mask what 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.450
 can say i adore oatmeal masks like 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.390
 and yeast because they have an effect 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:10.670
 very good and it is visible even from the first 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:12.890
 times since i have freckle skin then 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.540
 it is noticeable that the skin bleached because 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.690
 oatmeal is actually very good 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.569
 whitens and rejuvenates the skin and on 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.710
 about the narrowing of the time the mask needs to be done 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:27.590
 every day at least 5 procedures therefore 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.319

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.709
