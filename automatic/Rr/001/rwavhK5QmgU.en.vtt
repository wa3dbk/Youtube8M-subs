00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.230
 today 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.570
 hello friends nothing better than to start the 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.180
 Android section that watching one of the 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.010
 best games for the platform it 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.530
 called amazement and it is a game of 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:41.410
 platforms in which there is a component 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.410
 of puzzles very well implemented 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.579
 on his shoulder we control a zombie that 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.309
 will have to reach the end of the 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.790
 level collecting all the drums of 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.010
 gasoline that they walk on the stage the 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.920
 problem is that there are certain 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.850
 obstacles to dodge and certain parts 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.399
 that can not be passed as such the good 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.090
 is that our zombie can be dismembered 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:14.450
 in three parts that is torso legs and 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.340
 brain we can move the entire zombie or 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.729
 any of its parts separately 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.860
 to complete the legs levels 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.380
 they have greater mobility than the rest 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.390
 of the parties so we can jump and 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.250
 reach areas that we can not reach 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.250
 with any other part of the body 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.720
 the goal on the shoulder is to complete the 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.330
 level and collect how many more drums 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.090
 best the best of this game for 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.280
 Android is that they are short levels and that 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.250
 it does not make you tired or 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.100
 repetitive without a doubt a very 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:02:01.290
 original that we encourage you to download now 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:03.450
 that you install on your android mobile other 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.290
 the games that we have chosen this week 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.149
 for the section is mons time incredible 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.130
 in every sense 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.260
 this platform game for android 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.020
 puts us in the skin of a chameleon that 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.340
 will have to manage to eat his 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.340
 Worm ration 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.900
 for this you will have to look for the form of 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.390
 reach him at each level we can 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.610
 make him move by hooking us with 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.099
 his long tongue in colorful flowers 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.730
 of the stage and swinging us to 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.730
 take momentum 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.910
 however, although everything seems simple 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.430
 before you can use a flower 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.980
 we must adopt the same color as 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.230
 To do this we will have to swallow 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.450
 fireflies the color of flowers that 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.390
 we want to use to balance us 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.000
 besides the worm to complete the 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.560
 levels with the highest score 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:07.630
 we will have to eat all the 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:10.180
 stars of the monster level is a game 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.210
 very well done his visual section and his 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.100
 gameplay are really good and this 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.530
 the typical games that immerse you 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.230
 for hours losing the notion of 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.580
 time definitely a good game so that 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.580
 burst this week 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.959
 and smartphones are like computers 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.510
 conventional but in small format 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.430
 therefore keep optimized our 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.560
 mobile managing energy well 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.810
 eliminating caches and files 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.580
 unusable or watching that a 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.160
 application do not play with our data 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:50.270
 Private are tasks that you should not give 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:53.180
 sideways for optimal use cosmos ago 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.840
 precisely these three things and in a way 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.270
 simple 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.570
 this maintenance tool for 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.489
 Android is divided into three sections by 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.860
 one side we have the administrator of 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.959
 battery that allows us to choose three 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.300
 different configuration profiles 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.590
 functions depending on the level of 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.590
 battery that we have 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.500
 another option offered by 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:20.019
 cosmos is to clean the android cache 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.600
 temporary files and other data 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:26.290
 that make memory work and that the 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.449
 mobile work so much slower 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.220
 finally cosmos also allows us 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.889
 know what applications they use 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.260
 special permits that may affect 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:38.020
 our privacy and catalogs them by 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.270
 types if we see that an application has 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.820
 an important permit that should not 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:46.419
 cosmos gives us the option to eliminate it 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.520
 directly undoubtedly cosmos bread android 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:52.830
 is another application that 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.830
 we should have everyone on the mobile 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:05:01.110
 and we finish with the election more 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.599
 complicated this week let's see why 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.360
 there are dozens of games that I had to 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:08.849
 leave for your difficulty but the game 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.520
 impossible is the most complicated that I have 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:13.830
 found so far despite their 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.080
 Simple graphics this game for android 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.300
 that is captivating thousands of gamers 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.770
 from all over the world who love challenges 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:24.930
 as the one who offers this title to us 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.479
 goal of the impossible game is 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.330
 get as far as possible in 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:32.789
 the scenario here there are no levels nor 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.099
 control points just by touching the 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.319
 screen we will make the orange square 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:41.539
 jump and ski the skewers that you 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:41.539
 approach us at full speed 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:47.039
 It will also be important to rely on the 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.870
 black squares to jump stretches of 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.260
 soil that would kill us if those who 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.650
 we make 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:56.860
 also if we click we start again and 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:59.230
 it will not matter how much we have advanced that 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.660
 is perhaps the most frustrating thing in the game 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:03.760
 impossible that it does not matter if a game 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.390
 he does it is great because at the moment 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:09.310
 that you die you will have to start over 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:11.950
 from my point of view it is a game for 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.900
 compete with other people but let's 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.520
 if you want to get on your nerves and 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.350
 catch an anxiety attack 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.330
 you yourself need 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.550
 How about friends we liked the 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.340
 applications then we return on Tuesday 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:28.070
 which comes with more games and more apps for 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:31.270
 your android phones said this 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.270
 what happens is a good day
