everyone's<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.330> Texas<00:00:06.690> young<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.140> be

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
everyone's to Texas young to be

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.250 
everyone's to Texas young to be
continuing<00:00:08.250> their<00:00:08.400> fear<00:00:08.700> series<00:00:09.330> but<00:00:10.200> I

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
continuing their fear series but I

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.990 
continuing their fear series but I
talking<00:00:10.650> about<00:00:10.800> adding<00:00:11.130> physics<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.880> an

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
talking about adding physics to an

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.530 
talking about adding physics to an
object<00:00:12.450> in<00:00:12.690> unity3d<00:00:13.910> it<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.150> pretty<00:00:15.360> much<00:00:15.509> a

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
object in unity3d it is it pretty much a

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.439 
object in unity3d it is it pretty much a
basic<00:00:16.400> explanation<00:00:17.400> about<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.029> rigidbody

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
basic explanation about the rigidbody

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.330 
basic explanation about the rigidbody
component<00:00:18.690> which<00:00:19.380> adds<00:00:19.619> physics<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.250> an

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
component which adds physics to an

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.910 
component which adds physics to an
object<00:00:20.460> now<00:00:20.820> basically<00:00:21.380> but<00:00:22.380> first<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.800> all

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
object now basically but first of all

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.339 
object now basically but first of all
add<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.400> cube<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.480> our<00:00:24.630> scene<00:00:25.699> cube<00:00:27.349> let's

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
add a cube to our scene cube let's

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.109 
add a cube to our scene cube let's
position<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.949> song<00:00:29.279> we<00:00:29.400> need<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.609> plan<00:00:29.880> to

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
position this song we need a plan to

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.209 
position this song we need a plan to
explain<00:00:30.539> problem<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.140> put<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.920> little<00:00:32.040> bit

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
explain problem and put it a little bit

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:40.369 
explain problem and put it a little bit
in<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.759> air<00:00:33.020> as<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.290> plate<00:00:37.670> if<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.850> can<00:00:39.000> see<00:00:39.379> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
in the air as I plate if you can see the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.049 
in the air as I plate if you can see the
box<00:00:40.649> does<00:00:41.070> not<00:00:41.399> fall<00:00:41.850> down<00:00:42.379> okay<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:44.000> wait<00:00:45.000> a

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
box does not fall down okay so wait a

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.510 
box does not fall down okay so wait a
minute<00:00:45.469> every<00:00:46.469> time<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.920> move<00:00:47.129> forward

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
minute every time and I move forward

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.790 
minute every time and I move forward
this<00:00:47.700> game<00:00:48.149> freakin<00:00:48.899> cause<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.530> don't<00:00:49.739> even

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
this game freakin cause I don't even

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.209 
this game freakin cause I don't even
know<00:00:49.980> how<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.129> fix<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:51.710> actually<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.770> do<00:00:52.890> know

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
know how to fix that actually I do know

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.850 
know how to fix that actually I do know
but<00:00:53.460> I'm<00:00:53.579> just<00:00:53.610> too<00:00:54.090> lazy<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.570> do<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.719> okay<00:00:55.320> so

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
but I'm just too lazy to do it okay so

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.130 
but I'm just too lazy to do it okay so
anyways<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.219> box<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.640> just<00:00:56.850> midair<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.870> even

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
anyways the box is just midair and even

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.860 
anyways the box is just midair and even
though<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.289> shoot<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.820> nothing<00:00:59.820> happens<00:00:59.850> if<00:01:00.750> i

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
though I shoot it nothing happens if i

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.209 
though I shoot it nothing happens if i
take<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.079> missile<00:01:01.469> launch<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.920> shoot<00:01:02.100> it

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
take a missile launch and shoot it

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.560 
take a missile launch and shoot it
nothing<00:01:03.210> happens<00:01:03.239> now<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.619> not<00:01:04.830> cool<00:01:05.570> so

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
nothing happens now that is not cool so

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.630 
nothing happens now that is not cool so
we<00:01:06.750> need<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.990> add<00:01:07.110> physics<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:07.979> object<00:01:08.220> so

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
we need to add physics to this object so

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.460 
we need to add physics to this object so
that<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.939> object<00:01:09.330> has<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.540> certain<00:01:09.869> idea<00:01:10.140> how

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
that the object has a certain idea how

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.920 
that the object has a certain idea how
the<00:01:10.530> gravity<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> area<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.450> how<00:01:12.869> to

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
the gravity in the area is and how to

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.490 
the gravity in the area is and how to
behave<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.680> kind<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.159> gravity<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:15.500> go

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
behave in that kind of gravity so go

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.670 
behave in that kind of gravity so go
girls<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.280> like<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.580> cube<00:01:17.869> component<00:01:18.869> physics

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
girls to like the cube component physics

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.010 
girls to like the cube component physics
rigid<00:01:20.310> body<00:01:20.490> okay<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.780> get<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
rigid body okay and you get the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.320 
rigid body okay and you get the
rigidbody<00:01:22.380> component<00:01:22.590> right<00:01:23.100> over<00:01:23.340> there<00:01:23.490> now

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
rigidbody component right over there now

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.749 
rigidbody component right over there now
let's<00:01:24.900> explain<00:01:25.619> probably<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.580> most

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
let's explain probably the most

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.999 
let's explain probably the most
important<00:01:27.330> settings<00:01:27.689> mass<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.229> how<00:01:28.439> heavy<00:01:28.799> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
important settings mass is how heavy the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.770 
important settings mass is how heavy the
object<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.490> currently<00:01:30.000> set<00:01:30.210> one<00:01:30.540> which<00:01:30.750> is

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
object is currently set one which is

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.770 
object is currently set one which is
normal<00:01:31.280> now<00:01:32.280> drag<00:01:32.640> when<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.090> drag<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.509> zero

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
normal now drag when the drag is zero

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.770 
normal now drag when the drag is zero
now<00:01:34.470> let<00:01:34.619> me<00:01:34.650> show<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.920> how<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.659> once<00:01:36.659> we

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
now let me show you how it is once we

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.179 
now let me show you how it is once we
have<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.990> major<00:01:37.140> body<00:01:37.380> component<00:01:37.860> there<00:01:38.040> the

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
have the major body component there the

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.910 
have the major body component there the
box<00:01:38.400> falls<00:01:38.700> down<00:01:39.079> which<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.110> move<00:01:40.409> forward<00:01:40.439> and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
box falls down which is move forward and

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.969 
box falls down which is move forward and
disable<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.549> day<00:01:43.549> ok<00:01:44.780> so<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.290> box<00:01:46.530> fell<00:01:46.740> down

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
disable this day ok so the box fell down

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.620 
disable this day ok so the box fell down
and<00:01:47.310> if<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.610> shoot<00:01:47.820> at<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:50.340> Box<00:01:50.579> moves<00:01:50.909> if

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
and if you shoot at it the Box moves if

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.910 
and if you shoot at it the Box moves if
you<00:01:51.689> can<00:01:51.840> see<00:01:52.009> if<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.100> take<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> bazooka<00:01:54.829> see<00:01:55.829> the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
you can see if I take a bazooka see the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.190 
you can see if I take a bazooka see the
box<00:01:56.159> collides<00:01:57.060> with<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.299> masala<00:01:57.719> mantra<00:01:57.869> and

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
box collides with the masala mantra and

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.190 
box collides with the masala mantra and
actually<00:01:58.700> moves<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.479> make<00:02:00.659> sure<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.930> one<00:02:01.079> more

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
actually moves so make sure you one more

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.530 
actually moves so make sure you one more
time<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:02.719> didn't<00:02:03.719> position<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.350> right<00:02:05.540> there

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
time I didn't position this right there

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.870 
time I didn't position this right there
we<00:02:06.630> go<00:02:07.039> ok

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
we go ok

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.790 
we go ok
now<00:02:09.360> if<00:02:09.600> i<00:02:09.720> increase<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.170> drive<00:02:10.560> one

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
now if i increase the drive one

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.760 
now if i increase the drive one
basically<00:02:11.220> does<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.760> slows<00:02:12.210> down<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:13.530> speed

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
basically does it slows down the speed

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.720 
basically does it slows down the speed
of<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:13.980> object<00:02:14.130> just<00:02:14.670> look<00:02:14.820> closely<00:02:15.120> now<00:02:16.730> okay

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
of the object just look closely now okay

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.390 
of the object just look closely now okay
look<00:02:17.880> at<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.090> editor<00:02:18.450> view<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:19.260> fell<00:02:20.130> down<00:02:20.160> a

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
look at the editor view it fell down a

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.960 
look at the editor view it fell down a
little<00:02:20.670> bit<00:02:20.850> more<00:02:21.030> slow<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:22.670> also<00:02:23.670> what<00:02:23.820> it

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
little bit more slow and also what it

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.030 
little bit more slow and also what it
does<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.540> actually<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:28.290> can<00:02:28.470> see<00:02:28.680> now<00:02:28.860> no

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
does it actually you can see now no

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.100 
does it actually you can see now no
matter<00:02:29.160> how<00:02:29.370> much<00:02:29.550> I'm<00:02:29.700> shooting<00:02:30.180> at<00:02:30.270> it<00:02:30.420> it

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
matter how much I'm shooting at it it

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.400 
matter how much I'm shooting at it it
doesn't<00:02:31.470> really<00:02:31.560> move<00:02:31.920> much<00:02:32.370> further<00:02:32.760> as

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
doesn't really move much further as

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.500 
doesn't really move much further as
before<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.590> drag<00:02:34.800> with<00:02:35.010> zero<00:02:35.400> if<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.120> choose

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
before the drag with zero if I choose

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.380 
before the drag with zero if I choose
the<00:02:36.690> missile<00:02:36.990> launcher<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.470> shoot<00:02:37.710> at<00:02:37.860> it<00:02:38.390> see

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
the missile launcher and shoot at it see

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.380 
the missile launcher and shoot at it see
moves<00:02:39.660> less<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.650> moves<00:02:40.860> slower<00:02:41.180> so<00:02:42.180> make

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
moves less and it moves slower so make

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.450 
moves less and it moves slower so make
sure<00:02:42.420> your<00:02:42.690> drag<00:02:42.960> is<00:02:43.140> at<00:02:43.290> zero<00:02:43.620> unless<00:02:43.890> you're

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
sure your drag is at zero unless you're

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.600 
sure your drag is at zero unless you're
creating<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.480> space<00:02:45.780> game<00:02:46.140> you<00:02:47.100> want<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.430> set

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
creating a space game you want to set

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.290 
creating a space game you want to set
the<00:02:47.730> mat<00:02:47.970> amassed<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.690> little<00:02:48.990> bit<00:02:49.140> lower<00:02:49.380> and

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
the mat amassed a little bit lower and

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.030 
the mat amassed a little bit lower and
use<00:02:51.300> gravity<00:02:51.440> which<00:02:52.440> is<00:02:52.590> also<00:02:52.770> another

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
use gravity which is also another

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.920 
use gravity which is also another
important<00:02:54.860> setting<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.760> same<00:02:56.970> now<00:02:57.480> if<00:02:57.720> we

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
important setting to the same now if we

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.710 
important setting to the same now if we
disable<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.590> use<00:02:58.770> gravity<00:02:59.160> future<00:02:59.550> the<00:03:00.480> box

disable the use gravity future the box

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.830 
disable the use gravity future the box
will<00:03:00.990> behave<00:03:01.710> like<00:03:02.010> as<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.970> does<00:03:03.150> no<00:03:03.330> gravity

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
will behave like as it does no gravity

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.680 
will behave like as it does no gravity
at<00:03:04.020> all<00:03:04.170> at<00:03:04.470> all<00:03:05.100> in<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.550> level<00:03:05.880> which<00:03:06.450> means

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
at all at all in the level which means

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.620 
at all at all in the level which means
like<00:03:06.870> you're<00:03:07.050> in<00:03:07.140> space<00:03:08.150> now<00:03:09.150> here's<00:03:09.450> how<00:03:09.510> it

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
like you're in space now here's how it

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.520 
like you're in space now here's how it
works<00:03:09.900> if<00:03:10.500> I<00:03:10.740> shoot<00:03:11.070> at<00:03:11.280> it<00:03:12.170> it's<00:03:13.170> just<00:03:13.380> going

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
works if I shoot at it it's just going

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.350 
works if I shoot at it it's just going
to<00:03:13.590> move<00:03:13.800> in<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.190> direction<00:03:14.220> so<00:03:14.880> what<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.090> mean

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
to move in that direction so what I mean

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.810 
to move in that direction so what I mean
is<00:03:15.510> when<00:03:16.350> there's<00:03:16.560> no<00:03:16.740> gravity<00:03:17.070> at<00:03:17.370> all<00:03:17.490> if<00:03:17.700> I

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
is when there's no gravity at all if I

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.520 
is when there's no gravity at all if I
touch<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.420> object<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.020> it'll<00:03:19.230> start

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
touch the object and it'll start

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.990 
touch the object and it'll start
rotating<00:03:19.890> it's<00:03:20.160> just<00:03:20.340> going<00:03:20.520> to<00:03:20.610> keep<00:03:20.790> on

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
rotating it's just going to keep on

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.910 
rotating it's just going to keep on
rotating<00:03:21.210> and<00:03:21.720> retaining<00:03:22.110> and<00:03:22.350> rotating

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
rotating and retaining and rotating

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.730 
rotating and retaining and rotating
until<00:03:23.550> some<00:03:23.790> force<00:03:24.270> actually<00:03:24.930> stops<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.530> and

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
until some force actually stops it and

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.110 
until some force actually stops it and
if<00:03:26.070> I<00:03:26.190> shoot<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.460> missile<00:03:26.640> launcher<00:03:28.940> now<00:03:29.940> it's

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
if I shoot a missile launcher now it's

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.730 
if I shoot a missile launcher now it's
just<00:03:30.210> going<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.540> keep<00:03:30.750> on<00:03:30.930> going<00:03:31.200> at<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.500> same

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
just going to keep on going at the same

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.360 
just going to keep on going at the same
speed<00:03:32.190> as<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:33.020> got<00:03:34.020> hit<00:03:34.380> and<00:03:34.560> got<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:35.010> rotate

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
speed as it got hit and got to rotate

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.610 
speed as it got hit and got to rotate
the<00:03:35.880> same<00:03:36.120> amount<00:03:36.330> of<00:03:36.600> times<00:03:36.780> as<00:03:37.020> it<00:03:37.260> got<00:03:37.380> hit

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
the same amount of times as it got hit

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.860 
the same amount of times as it got hit
it's<00:03:37.830> never<00:03:38.070> going<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.370> slow<00:03:38.670> down<00:03:39.060> unless

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
it's never going to slow down unless

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.660 
it's never going to slow down unless
it's<00:03:40.080> going<00:03:40.350> to<00:03:40.410> go<00:03:40.530> really<00:03:40.560> really<00:03:41.100> slow<00:03:41.250> and

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
it's going to go really really slow and

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.190 
it's going to go really really slow and
then<00:03:41.760> it<00:03:41.880> can<00:03:42.060> see<00:03:42.240> it's<00:03:42.390> just<00:03:42.570> going<00:03:42.840> off<00:03:42.959> the

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
then it can see it's just going off the

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.530 
then it can see it's just going off the
level<00:03:43.670> so<00:03:44.670> unless<00:03:44.880> you're<00:03:45.030> making<00:03:45.300> a<00:03:45.330> space

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
level so unless you're making a space

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.310 
level so unless you're making a space
game<00:03:45.840> I<00:03:46.670> you<00:03:47.670> want<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:47.910> keep<00:03:48.300> these<00:03:48.900> gravity

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
game I you want to keep these gravity

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.530 
game I you want to keep these gravity
and<00:03:49.440> freeze<00:03:50.130> rotation<00:03:50.700> basically<00:03:51.150> doesn't

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
and freeze rotation basically doesn't

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.010 
and freeze rotation basically doesn't
enable<00:03:52.170> any<00:03:52.590> rotation<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.430> object

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
enable any rotation to the object

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.120 
enable any rotation to the object
whatsoever<00:03:55.020> so<00:03:55.590> if<00:03:56.180> if<00:03:57.180> I<00:03:57.560> shoot<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.620> object

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
whatsoever so if if I shoot the object

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.900 
whatsoever so if if I shoot the object
is<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.280> missile<00:03:59.700> laundry<00:04:00.170> then<00:04:01.370> see<00:04:02.370> it<00:04:02.640> doesn't

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
is a missile laundry then see it doesn't

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.930 
is a missile laundry then see it doesn't
rotate<00:04:04.070> now<00:04:05.070> i<00:04:05.100> would<00:04:05.250> suggest<00:04:05.580> adding

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
rotate now i would suggest adding

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.710 
rotate now i would suggest adding
rotation<00:04:06.270> just<00:04:07.080> to<00:04:07.170> make<00:04:07.200> it<00:04:07.350> more<00:04:07.470> realism

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
rotation just to make it more realism

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.050 
rotation just to make it more realism
now<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:09.780> best<00:04:09.990> part<00:04:10.200> is<00:04:10.350> this<00:04:10.530> component<00:04:11.160> the

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
now the best part is this component the

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.550 
now the best part is this component the
good<00:04:12.240> thing<00:04:12.390> is<00:04:12.420> it<00:04:12.660> saves<00:04:12.990> time<00:04:13.170> without

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
good thing is it saves time without

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.740 
good thing is it saves time without
doing<00:04:13.920> any<00:04:14.190> much<00:04:14.459> of<00:04:14.640> scripting<00:04:15.330> or<00:04:15.450> whatever

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
doing any much of scripting or whatever

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.580 
doing any much of scripting or whatever
as<00:04:16.590> this<00:04:16.919> component<00:04:17.489> can<00:04:17.720> help<00:04:18.720> add<00:04:18.989> physics

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
as this component can help add physics

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.250 
as this component can help add physics
for<00:04:19.979> you

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
for you

should directly go to that folder ok and
now<00:05:44.160> your<00:05:45.160> passenger<00:05:45.730> ship<00:05:46.000> object<00:05:46.420> is<00:05:46.540> this

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
now your passenger ship object is this

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.360 
now your passenger ship object is this
one<00:05:46.930> right<00:05:46.960> well<00:05:47.380> you<00:05:47.500> can<00:05:47.650> extend<00:05:48.040> it<00:05:48.220> and

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
one right well you can extend it and

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.420 
one right well you can extend it and
there<00:05:48.610> you<00:05:48.640> get<00:05:49.000> are<00:05:49.180> the<00:05:49.480> two<00:05:49.690> meshes<00:05:50.370> now<00:05:51.370> we

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
there you get are the two meshes now we

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.780 
there you get are the two meshes now we
need<00:05:51.550> to<00:05:51.700> select<00:05:51.940> Polly<00:05:52.270> surface<00:05:52.870> 14<00:05:53.470> 1<00:05:53.800> so

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
need to select Polly surface 14 1 so

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.490 
need to select Polly surface 14 1 so
this<00:05:54.910> is<00:05:55.000> what<00:05:55.120> I'm<00:05:55.210> going<00:05:55.330> to<00:05:55.360> do<00:05:55.510> passenger

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
this is what I'm going to do passenger

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.610 
this is what I'm going to do passenger
ship<00:05:56.800> the<00:05:57.490> mesh<00:05:57.760> we're<00:05:58.030> going<00:05:58.180> to<00:05:58.240> drag<00:05:58.540> this

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
ship the mesh we're going to drag this

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.590 
ship the mesh we're going to drag this
quality<00:05:59.620> surface<00:06:00.040> 14<00:06:00.580> 1<00:06:00.790> which<00:06:01.030> is<00:06:01.060> the<00:06:01.360> total

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
quality surface 14 1 which is the total

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.740 
quality surface 14 1 which is the total
body<00:06:02.080> off<00:06:02.730> the<00:06:03.730> ship<00:06:03.970> and<00:06:04.390> we're<00:06:04.570> going<00:06:04.720> to

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
body off the ship and we're going to

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.070 
body off the ship and we're going to
fill<00:06:05.260> up<00:06:05.470> the<00:06:05.650> mesh<00:06:05.830> variable<00:06:06.730> ok<00:06:07.660> so<00:06:07.720> as<00:06:07.960> you

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
fill up the mesh variable ok so as you

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.590 
fill up the mesh variable ok so as you
can<00:06:08.200> see<00:06:08.580> you<00:06:09.580> can<00:06:09.730> see<00:06:09.910> these<00:06:10.030> green<00:06:10.360> lines

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
can see you can see these green lines

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:16.280 
can see you can see these green lines
and<00:06:11.020> now<00:06:11.680> let's<00:06:11.950> test<00:06:12.190> it

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.850 

and<00:06:17.290> there<00:06:17.470> we<00:06:17.560> go<00:06:17.590> it<00:06:17.890> just<00:06:17.920> lands<00:06:18.280> normally

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
and there we go it just lands normally

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.770 
and there we go it just lands normally
and<00:06:20.860> we<00:06:21.130> have<00:06:21.280> no<00:06:21.430> problem<00:06:21.640> with<00:06:21.940> that<00:06:21.970> now<00:06:22.420> Oh

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.630 

even<00:06:25.780> if<00:06:25.870> I<00:06:25.990> shoot<00:06:26.200> it<00:06:26.350> it<00:06:26.500> moves<00:06:26.920> forward<00:06:27.250> and

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
even if I shoot it it moves forward and

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.470 
even if I shoot it it moves forward and
if<00:06:27.970> i<00:06:28.060> use<00:06:28.180> a<00:06:28.210> missile<00:06:28.570> launcher<00:06:30.210> demos<00:06:31.210> a<00:06:31.240> bit

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:31.480 
if i use a missile launcher demos a bit

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.720 
if i use a missile launcher demos a bit
forward<00:06:31.720> now<00:06:31.960> this<00:06:32.170> is<00:06:32.290> the<00:06:32.320> fun<00:06:32.650> part<00:06:32.730> you're

forward now this is the fun part you're
going<00:06:33.880> to<00:06:33.940> reduce<00:06:34.180> a<00:06:34.420> lot<00:06:34.660> of<00:06:34.870> mass<00:06:35.230> in<00:06:35.500> this

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
going to reduce a lot of mass in this

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.640 
going to reduce a lot of mass in this
let's<00:06:36.100> make<00:06:36.370> this<00:06:38.670> 0.25<00:06:39.810> ok<00:06:40.810> let's<00:06:41.560> continue
