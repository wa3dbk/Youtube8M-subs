00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.860
 the Volkswagen XIV 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.889
 initially as a student 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.389
 in the run-up to the announcement of the sports car 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.339
 for the experts speculated a small SUV would be presented 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.769
 against piracy English word for stone or rock 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.060
 But it turned out quite differently 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.060
 Freiburg are just the middle letters in the name of Shaffer 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:30.059
 the namesake is a two-door sports coupe based on the Golf 1 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.110
 It was built from 1974 to 1993 at Karmann in Osnabrück 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.910
 Incidentally, the name comes from a hot Sahara wind 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.950
 and the animal is also the new VW studied 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.830

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.250
 sirocco 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.010
 together with the pop-top convertible virus 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.010
 Hosts from the band of vw factory in Portugal are running 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.990
 so the sirocco is also based on the Lions and shares with them the 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.990
 technology 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.850
 Who should be the sleek sports car because of this name giver 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.240
 In the 1970s, the frog-green Italic appearance first appeared 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.070
 to expect prices from 25 thousand euros 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.570
 There are then four-cylinder engines from 115 hp 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.830
 the study shown here is with a 210 bhp 1 point 4-liter tsi's 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.830
 equipped variant 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.230
 thanks to the strongly shaped wide shoulder and the upwards 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.230
 rejuvenate the day the coupe is squeezed 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.770
 Kapitza with the exhaust tailpipes integrated in the rear apron 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.770
 emphasize the sporty look 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.000
 In addition, the impression on aluminum wheels with 19 inches in diameter and 235er tires 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.270
 the aggressive face impression is the vw group so far without correspondence 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.750
 the mighty is hexagonal grille with the chewing Arbor Aumann 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.060

 Flanked lower area of ​​the front bumper 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.639
 so far unique 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:19.499
 the vw-logo is not in the radiator grille but on the hood 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:25.889
 the final Shiro balls are barely different from the study 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:30.269
 The town halls will be a little narrower than the series Rieder 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.649
 smaller 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:36.469
 and inside it gets cheaper to go spectacularly right 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:39.469
 boring of her cockpit could intervene 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:41.580
 after all, the fun should be
