00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
generated as you can see here I have a

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.229 
generated as you can see here I have a
pic<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.799> an<00:03:05.129> axe<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:05.670> if<00:03:05.730> i<00:03:05.819> just<00:03:06.030> select

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
pic and an axe so if i just select

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.729 
pic and an axe so if i just select
nothing<00:03:06.810> too<00:03:06.930> it's<00:03:07.019> just<00:03:07.049> my<00:03:07.230> face<00:03:07.260> when<00:03:07.709> i

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
nothing too it's just my face when i

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:08.720 
nothing too it's just my face when i
start<00:03:08.010> hitting<00:03:08.189> away<00:03:08.280> this<00:03:08.489> you'll

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
start hitting away this you'll

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.130 
start hitting away this you'll
automatically<00:03:09.150> see<00:03:09.329> that<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.569> switches<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.900> my

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
automatically see that it switches to my

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.130 
automatically see that it switches to my
axe<00:03:10.319> and<00:03:10.620> then<00:03:10.769> back<00:03:10.950> again<00:03:11.099> to<00:03:11.340> nothing

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
axe and then back again to nothing

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.119 
axe and then back again to nothing
brilliant<00:03:13.140> that's<00:03:13.319> exactly<00:03:13.470> what<00:03:13.859> it<00:03:13.980> does

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
brilliant that's exactly what it does

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:15.830 
brilliant that's exactly what it does
although<00:03:14.549> for<00:03:14.879> some<00:03:15.060> people<00:03:15.390> when<00:03:15.510> as<00:03:15.599> soon<00:03:15.750> as

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
although for some people when as soon as

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.530 
although for some people when as soon as
you<00:03:15.959> start<00:03:16.200> off<00:03:16.909> you<00:03:17.909> will<00:03:18.090> probably<00:03:18.269> notice

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
you start off you will probably notice

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.720 
you start off you will probably notice
that<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.590> won't<00:03:19.769> actually<00:03:19.920> do<00:03:20.189> anything<00:03:20.400> and

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
that it won't actually do anything and

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.069 
that it won't actually do anything and
the<00:03:21.150> reason<00:03:21.510> for<00:03:21.540> this<00:03:21.720> is<00:03:21.780> you're<00:03:21.930> going<00:03:22.019> to

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
the reason for this is you're going to

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.069 
the reason for this is you're going to
have<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.319> hit<00:03:22.439> f10<00:03:23.099> to<00:03:23.970> enable<00:03:24.390> it<00:03:24.510> once<00:03:24.930> you've

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
have to hit f10 to enable it once you've

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.009 
have to hit f10 to enable it once you've
hit<00:03:25.230> f10<00:03:25.879> it<00:03:26.879> should<00:03:27.120> then<00:03:27.209> wipe<00:03:27.450> straight

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
hit f10 it should then wipe straight

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.710 
hit f10 it should then wipe straight
