00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
as long as the length is there it can go

00:02:24.420 --> 00:03:20.790 
as long as the length is there it can go
in<00:02:24.569> all<00:02:24.750> sorts<00:02:24.959> of<00:02:25.140> different<00:02:25.349> directions

that's<00:03:46.210> what<00:03:51.990> well<00:03:52.990> this<00:03:53.140> will<00:03:53.320> show<00:03:53.530> where

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
that's what well this will show where

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.430 
that's what well this will show where
some<00:03:54.700> of<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:54.820> linkages<00:03:55.420> or<00:03:55.630> connections<00:03:56.200> are

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
some of the linkages or connections are

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.700 
some of the linkages or connections are
being<00:03:56.650> made<00:03:56.890> here<00:03:57.750> are<00:03:58.750> some<00:03:58.900> of<00:03:59.050> the<00:03:59.140> stops<00:03:59.470> on

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710 
being made here are some of the stops on

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.220 
being made here are some of the stops on
the<00:03:59.890> organ<00:04:00.370> uh<00:04:01.020> so<00:04:02.020> what<00:04:02.380> happens<00:04:02.860> if<00:04:03.100> Matthew

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
the organ uh so what happens if Matthew

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.300 
the organ uh so what happens if Matthew
pulls<00:04:05.250> there<00:04:06.250> on<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.460> right<00:04:06.730> side<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.950> octave

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
pulls there on the right side the octave

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.670 
pulls there on the right side the octave
eight-foot<00:04:09.880> what<00:04:10.390> would<00:04:10.540> happen<00:04:10.960> he<00:04:11.380> pulls

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
eight-foot what would happen he pulls

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.330 
eight-foot what would happen he pulls
the<00:04:11.950> stop<00:04:12.250> and<00:04:12.730> then<00:04:13.570> that<00:04:14.040> hole<00:04:15.040> is

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
the stop and then that hole is

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.890 
the stop and then that hole is
transmitted<00:04:16.030> to<00:04:16.180> these<00:04:16.390> that<00:04:16.600> little

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
transmitted to these that little

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.800 
transmitted to these that little
actuators<00:04:17.620> here<00:04:18.160> and<00:04:18.340> so<00:04:19.030> only<00:04:19.209> one<00:04:19.480> of<00:04:19.690> them

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
actuators here and so only one of them

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.830 
actuators here and so only one of them
within<00:04:20.620> you<00:04:21.280> see<00:04:21.520> follow<00:04:21.760> the<00:04:22.030> linking<00:04:22.390> down

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
within you see follow the linking down

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.300 
within you see follow the linking down
on<00:04:23.170> the<00:04:23.290> floor<00:04:23.640> these<00:04:24.640> black<00:04:24.970> pipes<00:04:26.040> here<00:04:27.040> and

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
on the floor these black pipes here and

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.480 
on the floor these black pipes here and
then<00:04:27.850> they<00:04:28.030> connect<00:04:28.630> to<00:04:29.560> the<00:04:29.740> bottom<00:04:30.190> or<00:04:32.490> the

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
then they connect to the bottom or the

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.340 
then they connect to the bottom or the
side<00:04:34.000> here<00:04:34.270> of<00:04:34.450> the<00:04:34.600> wind<00:04:34.870> chest<00:04:35.200> and<00:04:35.700> that's

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
side here of the wind chest and that's

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.720 
side here of the wind chest and that's
what<00:04:38.350> would<00:04:38.560> allow<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:38.890> air<00:04:39.190> to<00:04:39.220> go<00:04:39.490> through

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
what would allow the air to go through

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:47.160 
what would allow the air to go through
that<00:04:39.790> rank<00:04:40.480> of<00:04:40.690> pipe<00:04:45.630> here's<00:04:46.630> some<00:04:46.840> more<00:04:47.050> of

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
that rank of pipe here's some more of

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.960 
that rank of pipe here's some more of
those<00:04:47.320> trackers<00:04:47.890> that<00:04:48.280> we're<00:04:48.370> talking<00:04:48.580> about

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
those trackers that we're talking about

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.200 
those trackers that we're talking about
earlier<00:04:50.460> for<00:04:51.460> key<00:04:51.730> or<00:04:52.030> a<00:04:52.060> foot<00:04:52.330> pedal<00:04:52.540> is

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
earlier for key or a foot pedal is

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.909 
earlier for key or a foot pedal is
touch<00:04:54.949> and<00:04:55.949> that<00:04:56.130> will<00:04:56.250> change<00:04:56.819> the<00:04:57.060> actual

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
touch and that will change the actual

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.170 
touch and that will change the actual
supposed<00:04:58.919> to<00:04:59.009> be<00:04:59.069> washes<00:04:59.580> all<00:04:59.729> these<00:04:59.910> things

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
supposed to be washes all these things

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.320 
supposed to be washes all these things
enough<00:05:00.919> across<00:05:01.919> those<00:05:02.160> linkages<00:05:02.639> I<00:05:03.090> don't

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
enough across those linkages I don't

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.820 
enough across those linkages I don't
know<00:05:03.389> linkages<00:05:03.900> is<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.199> right<00:05:04.380> word<00:05:04.590> but

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
know linkages is the right word but

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.020 
know linkages is the right word but
that's<00:05:04.979> the<00:05:05.099> one<00:05:05.250> word<00:05:05.400> I<00:05:05.430> know<00:05:05.550> right<00:05:05.849> now

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
that's the one word I know right now

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:12.150 
that's the one word I know right now
what

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160
