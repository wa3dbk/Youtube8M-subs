00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
surface tension actually holds the steel

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.260 
surface tension actually holds the steel
dust<00:00:45.960> now<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:47.309> can<00:00:47.460> after<00:00:47.579> thinking<00:00:48.090> that

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
dust now you can after thinking that

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.330 
dust now you can after thinking that
that's<00:00:48.510> an<00:00:48.660> issue<00:00:48.809> but<00:00:49.590> as<00:00:49.739> soon<00:00:49.920> as<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.160> go

the blade into my belts and I'll being
192<00:01:35.280> mention<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.670> difference<00:01:36.030> if<00:01:36.149> I'm

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
192 mention the difference if I'm

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.070 
192 mention the difference if I'm
getting<00:01:36.539> up<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> 3000<00:01:37.500> grit<00:01:37.560> belt<00:01:38.149> and<00:01:39.149> there

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
getting up to a 3000 grit belt and there

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.469 
getting up to a 3000 grit belt and there
are<00:01:40.380> 36<00:01:41.250> grit<00:01:41.460> particles<00:01:41.939> lying<00:01:42.179> around<00:01:42.299> that

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
are 36 grit particles lying around that

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.480 
are 36 grit particles lying around that
unfortunate<00:01:42.990> into<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.289> belt<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:44.039> actually

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
unfortunate into that belt you actually

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.539 
unfortunate into that belt you actually
writing<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.909> off<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.600> long<00:01:45.810> story<00:01:45.990> short<00:01:46.369> if<00:01:47.369> I

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
writing it off so long story short if I

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.609 
writing it off so long story short if I
dunk<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.000> there<00:01:48.179> as<00:01:48.840> I'm<00:01:49.049> pushing<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.439> blade

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
dunk in there as I'm pushing the blade

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.990 
dunk in there as I'm pushing the blade
and<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:49.920> actually<00:01:50.159> see<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.549> dispersed

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
and you can actually see it dispersed

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.940 
and you can actually see it dispersed
but<00:01:51.119> as<00:01:51.420> soon<00:01:51.630> as<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.869> pull<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.470> out<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.799> can

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
but as soon as I pull it out you can

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.469 
but as soon as I pull it out you can
actually<00:01:53.070> see<00:01:53.520> what<00:01:53.759> happens<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.390> then

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
actually see what happens it and then

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.870 
actually see what happens it and then
literally<00:01:54.959> clings<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.619> blade<00:01:55.860> okay<00:01:56.459> now

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
literally clings to the blade okay now

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.249 
literally clings to the blade okay now
it's<00:01:57.030> obviously<00:01:57.299> something<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.750> don't<00:01:58.020> what

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
it's obviously something you don't what

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.179 
it's obviously something you don't what
not<00:01:58.830> putting<00:01:59.159> a<00:02:00.140> bunch<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.229> dishwashing

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
not putting a bunch of dishwashing

liquid into your into your quench or
into<00:02:04.979> your<00:02:05.069> solution<00:02:05.750> so<00:02:06.750> as<00:02:06.810> soon<00:02:06.959> as<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.140> put
