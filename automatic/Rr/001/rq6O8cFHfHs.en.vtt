00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.430 

such<00:01:10.240> most<00:01:10.660> of<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:10.900> track<00:01:11.110> itself<00:01:11.620> is<00:01:11.830> on

textures<00:01:14.440> itself<00:01:15.010> just<00:01:15.970> aren't<00:01:16.690> very<00:01:16.870> well

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
textures itself just aren't very well

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:24.560 
textures itself just aren't very well
suited<00:01:18.070> for<00:01:18.100> a<00:01:18.690> track<00:01:19.690> like<00:01:19.900> this

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:33.230 

but<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.320> okay<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:26.000> guess<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:32.060> thought<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
but it's okay I guess I thought the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
but it's okay I guess I thought the
music<00:01:33.360> would<00:01:33.750> be<00:01:33.840> suitable<00:01:34.230> for<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:36.080> but<00:01:37.080> you

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
music would be suitable for this but you

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.940 
music would be suitable for this but you
