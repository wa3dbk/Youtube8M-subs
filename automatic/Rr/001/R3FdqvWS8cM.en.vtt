00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
the face of the alternator so we're

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.760 
the face of the alternator so we're
going<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.549> come<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.850> here<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.299> side<00:01:45.570> and

our<00:01:51.570> triple<00:01:52.320> alternator<00:01:52.740> bracket<00:01:52.979> kit<00:01:53.340> over

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
our triple alternator bracket kit over

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.149 
our triple alternator bracket kit over
on<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.000> side<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:55.229> will<00:01:55.380> hold<00:01:55.619> three<00:01:55.979> of

on this side and that will hold three of

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.440 
on this side and that will hold three of
our<00:01:56.340> six<00:01:56.850> phase<00:01:57.060> Universal<00:01:57.719> 320th<00:01:58.409> units<00:01:58.920> and

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
our six phase Universal 320th units and

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.179 
our six phase Universal 320th units and
get<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.570> better<00:02:00.719> belt<00:02:01.049> wrap<00:02:01.290> better<00:02:01.799> alignment

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
get on better belt wrap better alignment

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.899 
get on better belt wrap better alignment
and<00:02:02.689> hopefully<00:02:03.689> solve<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.350> belt<00:02:05.040> issues
