00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.460
 very good I am from galilea welcome to 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.990
 a video in which we will learn how 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.730
 photograph the spring the objectives 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.620
 ideal for this type of photographs 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.750
 are the macro goals to make 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.129
 photographs of flowers and 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.650
 objectives to make photography of 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.660
 landscape and if the objective has gone well 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.610
 it's for landscape photography I do not 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.260
 they really like the angular objectives or 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.390
 large angles to take pictures 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.340
 in spring since they distort a lot 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.080
 the image and what interests us is 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.940
 capture the shapes the most you have to the 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.860
 possible reality to be able to appreciate 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.150
 friends the colors and the textures this 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.100
 does not mean that even though you use is the 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.540
 target of the kit or have a 50 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.010
 millimeters are going to get bad 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.080
 photographs in spring everything 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.850
 opposite is more with 50 millimeters 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.829
 we get a depth of field 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.480
 minimum that remains spectacular in the 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.400
 photographs of flowers carries a tripod 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.870
 to stabilize your camera is more 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.030
 I recommend that you throw in your backpack 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.620
 a sack with a little bit of sand and I 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.570
 also put the tripod to increase 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.920
 the stability of your camera without a doubt 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.660
 of the things that I like most about the 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.670
 spring is light and that is 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.690
 spectacular so take full advantage 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.670
 natural light in your photographs 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.830
 if you have to fill in parts that are 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.869
 in shadow or dark in your image 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.119
 do it in a very very subtle way and 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.690
 using very homemade reflectors like 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.040
 Folios cardboard or pieces of cork bread 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.049
 of these that are put in the boxes of 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.180
 pack things but in a very 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.710
 subtle also in spring the days are 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.149
 much longer so you're going to be able 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.560
 take this light to the fullest 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.600
 begins with large general plans 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.430
 such as a photograph of a 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.409
 great landscape and get close to the 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.600
 things that catch your attention but 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.580
 come closer without fear of being me, take yourself out 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.950
 target flight in macro mode and get closer 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.110
 because you are going to discover some textures and 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.670
 some incredible colors to photographs in 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.920
 those that appear drops of water of this 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.509
 way when light enters the water already 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.729
 you know that it disperses and will give 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.440
 place to impressive colors by 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.270
 true you do not have to wait like 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.550
 a stubborn to rain to go out to do 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.920
 the photograph you carry in your backpack 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.840
 a spray that because I miss some 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.640
 water over the leaves and make the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.710
 photo put yourself in a photographer mode 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.630
 Hunter increases the speed of life 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.610
 to the maximum of your camera and remains very 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.450
 Attentive to insects to animals 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.670
 the birds 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.200
 very likely you get some 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.760
 spectacular photo in which some of 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.349
 these little animals become the 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.180
 protagonist of your photography and to 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.709
 finish three quick tips the 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.170
 First be respectful with nature 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.200
 leave everything as you found it or 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.209
 better the second is that you look at your feet and 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.489
 that you bend down a lot to do the 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.590
 photographs try to take pictures from the 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.900
 view of ant or view of worm that 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.670
 they call him and he's going to apply with the 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.220
 textures and with the plants that appear 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.750
 on the floor and the last advice is that 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.760
 you wrap up that you take some jacket 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.049
 by the end of the afternoon because if not 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.670
 It's going to happen to me as always 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.650
 go out and take pictures of this type 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.079
 happens to catch or colds or angina 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.910
 anything so take tomÃ¡s already 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.290
 remove the backpack to warm up when 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.090
 fall afternoon I hope to see you 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.500

 in the description box so if I 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.060
 you have some because you hear better than better 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.739
 It has been a little bit and I see that you do 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.390
