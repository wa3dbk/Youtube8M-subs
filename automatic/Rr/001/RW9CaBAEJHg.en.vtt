00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
so I am happy where my ends are today I

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.900 
so I am happy where my ends are today I
don't<00:04:23.560> have<00:04:23.650> to<00:04:23.740> do<00:04:23.860> any<00:04:24.070> more<00:04:24.130> major<00:04:24.520> cuts

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
don't have to do any more major cuts

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.969 
don't have to do any more major cuts
from<00:04:25.540> this<00:04:25.750> point<00:04:25.930> on<00:04:26.140> it<00:04:26.350> will<00:04:26.500> be<00:04:26.620> trimming

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
from this point on it will be trimming

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.120 
from this point on it will be trimming
and<00:04:27.930> I'm<00:04:28.930> in<00:04:29.140> his<00:04:29.260> natural<00:04:29.410> hair<00:04:29.680> challenge<00:04:30.039> so

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
and I'm in his natural hair challenge so

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.740 
and I'm in his natural hair challenge so
I<00:04:30.190> suppose<00:04:30.430> it<00:04:30.550> could<00:04:30.669> in<00:04:30.760> no<00:04:30.789> way<00:04:30.880> but<00:04:31.270> you

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
I suppose it could in no way but you

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.360 
I suppose it could in no way but you
know<00:04:31.870> I<00:04:31.900> got<00:04:32.169> my<00:04:32.260> own<00:04:32.289> rules<00:04:32.740> if<00:04:32.890> I<00:04:32.950> can't<00:04:33.190> stand

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
know I got my own rules if I can't stand

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.840 
know I got my own rules if I can't stand
those<00:04:33.550> in<00:04:33.760> they<00:04:33.940> got<00:04:34.090> it<00:04:34.210> they<00:04:34.330> gotta<00:04:34.600> go<00:04:35.850> okay

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
those in they got it they gotta go okay

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.850 
those in they got it they gotta go okay
so<00:04:36.910> I'm<00:04:37.570> at<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:37.930> point<00:04:38.140> where<00:04:38.289> I<00:04:38.470> can<00:04:38.650> tolerate

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
so I'm at the point where I can tolerate

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.570 
so I'm at the point where I can tolerate
the<00:04:39.220> rest<00:04:39.400> of<00:04:39.520> this<00:04:39.610> color<00:04:40.060> on<00:04:40.300> the<00:04:40.600> ends

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
the rest of this color on the ends

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.640 
the rest of this color on the ends
because<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:42.880> ugly<00:04:43.390> part<00:04:43.690> of<00:04:43.840> the<00:04:44.050> code<00:04:44.260> is<00:04:44.500> off

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
because the ugly part of the code is off

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.150 
because the ugly part of the code is off
so<00:04:45.580> no<00:04:45.729> more<00:04:45.880> major<00:04:46.120> cuts<00:04:46.450> for<00:04:46.660> your<00:04:46.750> girl<00:04:47.160> so
