cable mates are going to use it here for

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.839 
cable mates are going to use it here for
tricep<00:00:11.759> extensions<00:00:13.340> and<00:00:14.340> then<00:00:14.460> i'll<00:00:14.580> post

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
tricep extensions and then i'll post

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.650 
tricep extensions and then i'll post
other<00:00:15.089> videos<00:00:16.400> throughout<00:00:17.400> time<00:00:17.940> here<00:00:18.300> on<00:00:18.330> how

other videos throughout time here on how

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.179 
other videos throughout time here on how
to<00:00:18.720> use<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.020> with<00:00:19.109> other<00:00:19.260> exercises<00:00:19.800> i<00:00:20.039> don't

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
to use it with other exercises i don't

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.529 
to use it with other exercises i don't
like<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.340> walk<00:00:20.640> around<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.000> gym<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.330> hook<00:00:21.480> it

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
like to walk around the gym and hook it

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.939 
like to walk around the gym and hook it
up<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.750> demonstrate<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.380> lot<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.650> different

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
up to demonstrate a lot of different

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.980 
up to demonstrate a lot of different
exercises<00:00:23.400> if<00:00:24.119> i'm<00:00:24.300> going<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.510> post<00:00:24.689> how<00:00:24.930> to

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
exercises if i'm going to post how to

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.540 
exercises if i'm going to post how to
use<00:00:25.230> something<00:00:25.500> i'm<00:00:25.710> going<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:25.920> actually<00:00:26.099> use

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
use something i'm going to actually use

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.269 
use something i'm going to actually use
it<00:00:26.580> or<00:00:27.449> have<00:00:27.630> somebody<00:00:27.900> else<00:00:28.080> use<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:28.920> i've

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
it or have somebody else use it so i've

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.890 
it or have somebody else use it so i've
already<00:00:29.460> done<00:00:29.699> three<00:00:29.939> or<00:00:30.119> four<00:00:30.300> sets<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.689> this

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
already done three or four sets of this

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.850 
already done three or four sets of this
what<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.650> like<00:00:31.949> with<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.430> because<00:00:32.940> the

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
what I like with this because the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.650 
what I like with this because the
grenades<00:00:34.860> are<00:00:35.070> attached<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:36.000> each<00:00:36.149> other<00:00:36.390> is

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
grenades are attached to each other is

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.310 
grenades are attached to each other is
it's<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.590> lot<00:00:37.770> easier<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.460> do<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.719> drop<00:00:39.719> set<00:00:39.989> we<00:00:40.200> to

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
it's a lot easier to do a drop set we to

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.040 
it's a lot easier to do a drop set we to
continue<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:41.460> do<00:00:41.610> an<00:00:41.730> extended<00:00:42.300> set<00:00:42.540> because<00:00:42.809> I

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
continue to do an extended set because I

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.750 
continue to do an extended set because I
just<00:00:43.110> go<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.710> next<00:00:43.860> ball<00:00:44.129> which<00:00:44.370> shortens

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
just go to the next ball which shortens

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.970 
just go to the next ball which shortens
the<00:00:44.969> range<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.329> motion<00:00:45.510> which<00:00:46.379> allows<00:00:46.680> me<00:00:46.890> to

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
the range of motion which allows me to

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.369 
the range of motion which allows me to
take<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.309> SAT<00:00:47.520> past<00:00:47.879> failure<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.960> that's<00:00:49.140> kind

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
take the SAT past failure so that's kind

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.540 
take the SAT past failure so that's kind
of<00:00:49.410> what<00:00:49.559> I'm<00:00:49.649> going<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.860> do<00:00:50.010> here<00:00:50.039> with<00:00:50.430> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
of what I'm going to do here with the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.819 
of what I'm going to do here with the
extensions<00:00:51.149> they<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:51.870> other<00:00:52.050> applications

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
extensions they have other applications

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.680 
extensions they have other applications
as<00:00:53.010> well<00:00:53.039> obviously<00:00:53.640> but<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.300> just<00:00:54.329> one

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
as well obviously but this is just one

00:00:54.690 --> 00:02:57.710 
as well obviously but this is just one
thing<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.079> posted<00:00:55.469> up<00:00:55.620> right<00:00:55.829> now

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.090 

the<00:02:58.720> reason<00:02:58.990> I<00:02:59.050> like<00:02:59.230> to<00:02:59.350> use<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.620> chains<00:02:59.890> for

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
the reason I like to use the chains for

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.770 
the reason I like to use the chains for
this<00:03:00.220> as<00:03:00.400> well<00:03:00.550> is<00:03:00.610> because<00:03:01.000> it<00:03:01.330> lightens<00:03:01.750> the

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
this as well is because it lightens the

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.360 
this as well is because it lightens the
load<00:03:01.870> at<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.320> bottom<00:03:02.710> so<00:03:02.890> it<00:03:02.920> lowers<00:03:03.160> the

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
load at the bottom so it lowers the

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.160 
load at the bottom so it lowers the
stress<00:03:03.790> on<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.120> UH<00:03:04.180> pose<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:04.690> it<00:03:04.750> increases

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
stress on the UH pose and it increases

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.710 
stress on the UH pose and it increases
the<00:03:05.670> load<00:03:06.670> as<00:03:06.910> you<00:03:07.060> go<00:03:07.180> up<00:03:07.210> which<00:03:07.480> actually

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
the load as you go up which actually

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.950 
the load as you go up which actually
puts<00:03:08.170> more<00:03:08.620> stress<00:03:08.980> on<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.400> tricep<00:03:09.880> at<00:03:10.750> the

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
puts more stress on the tricep at the

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.500 
puts more stress on the tricep at the
top<00:03:11.200> so<00:03:11.910> throughout<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.060> whole<00:03:13.090> range<00:03:13.360> of

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
top so throughout the whole range of

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.300 
top so throughout the whole range of
motion<00:03:13.810> not<00:03:13.900> just<00:03:14.140> at<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.380> top<00:03:15.300> so
