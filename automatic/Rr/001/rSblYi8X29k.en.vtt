all right this is the fourth lesson in
our<00:00:07.630> series<00:00:07.689> on<00:00:08.610> subdividing<00:00:09.610> time<00:00:09.849> for

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.120 
our series on subdividing time for

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.000 
our series on subdividing time for
rhythm<00:00:10.360> guitar<00:00:10.809> and<00:00:11.170> what<00:00:11.650> we're<00:00:11.770> going<00:00:11.890> to<00:00:11.920> be

rhythm guitar and what we're going to be

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.560 
rhythm guitar and what we're going to be
doing<00:00:12.130> with<00:00:12.370> this<00:00:12.550> particular<00:00:12.910> lesson<00:00:13.269> is

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:13.570 
doing with this particular lesson is

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.550 
doing with this particular lesson is
that<00:00:13.600> we're<00:00:14.140> going<00:00:14.230> to<00:00:14.290> be<00:00:14.380> studying

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:14.560 
that we're going to be studying

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.339 
that we're going to be studying
sixteenth<00:00:15.160> notes<00:00:16.050> we've<00:00:17.050> been<00:00:17.170> doing

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:17.349 
sixteenth notes we've been doing

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.249 
sixteenth notes we've been doing
everything<00:00:17.590> in<00:00:17.920> 4/4<00:00:18.519> time<00:00:18.550> which<00:00:19.259> basically

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:20.259 
everything in 4/4 time which basically

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:22.200 
everything in 4/4 time which basically
means<00:00:20.560> that<00:00:20.679> we've<00:00:20.980> got<00:00:21.159> four<00:00:21.519> counts<00:00:21.999> in<00:00:22.060> each

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
means that we've got four counts in each

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.450 
means that we've got four counts in each
measure<00:00:22.509> and<00:00:23.019> the<00:00:23.619> quarter<00:00:23.949> note<00:00:24.099> is<00:00:24.249> what

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
measure and the quarter note is what

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.029 
measure and the quarter note is what
gets<00:00:24.699> one<00:00:24.939> count<00:00:25.269> a<00:00:25.619> sixteenth<00:00:26.619> note<00:00:26.739> as<00:00:27.009> a

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
gets one count a sixteenth note as a

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.029 
gets one count a sixteenth note as a
quarter<00:00:27.519> of<00:00:27.669> a<00:00:27.759> beat<00:00:27.999> and<00:00:28.509> we<00:00:29.169> call<00:00:29.529> like<00:00:29.919> when

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
quarter of a beat and we call like when

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.240 
quarter of a beat and we call like when
we<00:00:30.130> count<00:00:30.399> em<00:00:30.579> we<00:00:30.699> count<00:00:30.939> one<00:00:31.359> E<00:00:31.630> and<00:00:31.720> two<00:00:32.590> E<00:00:32.860> and

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
E and now I'm gonna set my metronome to

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.459 
E and now I'm gonna set my metronome to
60<00:00:50.949> here<00:00:52.289> by<00:00:53.289> my<00:00:53.469> metronome<00:00:53.859> and<00:00:55.320> what<00:00:56.320> we're

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
60 here by my metronome and what we're

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.709 
60 here by my metronome and what we're
gonna<00:00:56.559> do<00:00:56.679> first<00:00:56.949> off<00:00:57.280> is<00:00:57.640> we're<00:00:58.449> going<00:00:58.600> to

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
gonna do first off is we're going to

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.029 
gonna do first off is we're going to
actually<00:01:00.210> subdivide<00:01:01.210> the<00:01:01.449> time<00:01:02.039> without

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
actually subdivide the time without

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.540 
actually subdivide the time without
actually<00:01:03.339> playing<00:01:03.789> a<00:01:03.940> rhythm<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:06.250> you're

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
actually playing a rhythm so you're

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.090 
actually playing a rhythm so you're
gonna<00:01:06.670> mute<00:01:06.940> all<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.240> strings<00:01:07.920> we're<00:01:08.920> just

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
gonna mute all the strings we're just

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.950 
gonna mute all the strings we're just
gonna<00:01:09.250> practice<00:01:09.730> getting<00:01:10.000> your<00:01:10.420> right<00:01:10.600> hand

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
gonna practice getting your right hand

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
gonna practice getting your right hand
playing<00:01:11.350> down<00:01:11.740> and<00:01:12.010> up<00:01:12.130> consistently<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:17.290> we

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:17.980 
playing down and up consistently so we

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.030 
playing down and up consistently so we
count<00:01:18.160> one<00:01:18.760> E<00:01:18.790> and<00:01:19.030> a<00:01:19.510> two<00:01:19.540> E<00:01:19.810> and<00:01:20.020> three<00:01:20.620> E<00:01:20.830> and

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
count one E and a two E and three E and

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:44.460 
count one E and a two E and three E and
of<00:01:41.190> try<00:01:42.190> to<00:01:42.250> not<00:01:42.780> emphasize<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.960> down<00:01:44.140> of<00:01:44.350> the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
of try to not emphasize the down of the

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.920 
of try to not emphasize the down of the
up<00:01:44.620> strum<00:01:45.070> don't<00:01:45.670> swing<00:01:46.030> it<00:01:46.060> make<00:01:46.720> this<00:01:46.870> a

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
up strum don't swing it make this a

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.020 
up strum don't swing it make this a
robotic<00:01:47.650> as<00:01:47.800> you<00:01:47.890> can<00:01:48.040> make<00:01:48.220> it<00:01:48.400> make<00:01:48.730> it<00:01:48.760> as

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
robotic as you can make it make it as

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.510 
robotic as you can make it make it as
consistent<00:01:49.810> as<00:01:50.170> even<00:01:50.590> later<00:01:50.800> on<00:01:51.040> you<00:01:51.190> can<00:01:51.340> turn

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
consistent as even later on you can turn

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.780 
consistent as even later on you can turn
this<00:01:51.670> into<00:01:51.880> music<00:01:52.270> you<00:01:52.390> can<00:01:52.510> add<00:01:52.720> inflections

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
this into music you can add inflections

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:08.710 
this into music you can add inflections
right<00:01:54.790> now<00:01:55.000> it's<00:01:55.360> all<00:01:59.370> we<00:02:00.370> were<00:02:00.490> strumming

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.120 

you<00:02:09.720> know<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.080> even<00:02:10.410> when<00:02:10.530> I'm<00:02:10.619> not<00:02:10.649> actually

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
you know that even when I'm not actually

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.160 
you know that even when I'm not actually
hitting<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.400> string<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.910> my<00:02:12.000> right<00:02:12.239> hand<00:02:12.540> is

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
hitting the string to my right hand is

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.809 
hitting the string to my right hand is
still<00:02:13.440> moving<00:02:13.590> I'm<00:02:13.890> still<00:02:14.130> feeling<00:02:14.370> every

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
still moving I'm still feeling every

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.780 
still moving I'm still feeling every
sixteen<00:02:15.410> every<00:02:16.410> subdivision<00:02:17.010> exists<00:02:17.580> there

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
sixteen every subdivision exists there

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.830 
sixteen every subdivision exists there
and<00:02:17.910> that's<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.120> only<00:02:18.330> way<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.450> make<00:02:18.690> it

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
and that's the only way to make it

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.140 
and that's the only way to make it
everything<00:02:19.290> kind<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:19.530> set<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.769> guys<00:02:20.280> go<00:02:20.489> I

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.790 

mean<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.209> could<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:24.510> could<00:02:24.690> play<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.900> time<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:25.650> them

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
mean I could I could play a time so them

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.009 
mean I could I could play a time so them
playing<00:02:26.280> for<00:02:26.580> so<00:02:26.730> long<00:02:26.910> they<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.510> doesn't<00:02:27.840> feel

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
playing for so long they it doesn't feel

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:36.440 
playing for so long they it doesn't feel
right<00:02:28.349> versus<00:02:34.700> it's<00:02:35.700> just<00:02:35.940> it's<00:02:36.120> gonna<00:02:36.239> have

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
right versus it's just it's gonna have

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.570 
right versus it's just it's gonna have
more<00:02:36.720> natural<00:02:36.900> feel<00:02:37.350> keeping<00:02:37.769> this<00:02:37.860> going<00:02:38.370> and

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
more natural feel keeping this going and

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.830 
more natural feel keeping this going and
strumming<00:02:38.819> down<00:02:39.060> on<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.480> one<00:02:40.470> on<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:42.450> in<00:02:42.720> the

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
strumming down on the one on the in the

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.050 
strumming down on the one on the in the
uh<00:02:42.870> which<00:02:43.380> was<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.560> second<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.310> four<00:02:44.549> sixteenth

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
uh which was a second and four sixteenth

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.210 
uh which was a second and four sixteenth
notes<00:02:45.180> from<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:46.019> just<00:02:46.140> gives<00:02:46.319> more<00:02:46.530> consistent

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
notes from it just gives more consistent

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.830 
notes from it just gives more consistent
alright<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.180> that's<00:02:48.299> the<00:02:48.390> first<00:02:48.630> exercise

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
alright so that's the first exercise

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.650

hear first thing that's really causing
this<00:03:33.930> sound<00:03:34.380> is<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:35.190> idea<00:03:35.459> that<00:03:37.160> as<00:03:38.160> I'm

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
this sound is the idea that as I'm

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.740 
this sound is the idea that as I'm
actually<00:03:38.549> squeezing<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.269> chord<00:03:39.569> down

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
actually squeezing the chord down

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.330 
actually squeezing the chord down
otherwise<00:03:40.350> I<00:03:40.650> just<00:03:40.680> release<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.160> pressure

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
otherwise I just release the pressure

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.599 
otherwise I just release the pressure
enough<00:03:42.440> so<00:03:43.440> again<00:03:43.709> you'd<00:03:44.010> again<00:03:46.100> so<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.250> first

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
enough so again you'd again so the first

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:57.900 
enough so again you'd again so the first
one<00:03:47.819> is<00:03:47.850> just<00:03:48.000> on<00:03:48.389> down

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.400

the second one we're gonna do the e

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.130 
the second one we're gonna do the e
which<00:04:01.370> is<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.550> second<00:04:02.030> 16th<00:04:02.450> note<00:04:02.629> of<00:04:02.750> each<00:04:02.870> P

little more sense so you can spend a

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.129 
little more sense so you can spend a
week<00:05:36.979> practicing<00:05:37.310> this<00:05:37.849> just<00:05:38.419> working<00:05:38.990> on

right<00:06:28.860> there's<00:06:29.070> no<00:06:29.190> consistency<00:06:29.850> to<00:06:30.090> what

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
right there's no consistency to what

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.170 
right there's no consistency to what
they're<00:06:30.390> doing<00:06:31.280> so<00:06:32.280> this<00:06:32.640> goes<00:06:32.790> back<00:06:33.000> to<00:06:33.120> the

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
they're doing so this goes back to the

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.670 
they're doing so this goes back to the
whole<00:06:33.270> idea<00:06:33.360> what<00:06:33.660> we've<00:06:33.840> got<00:06:33.990> the<00:06:34.110> pulse<00:06:34.350> the

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
whole idea what we've got the pulse the

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.409 
whole idea what we've got the pulse the
quarter<00:06:35.400> note<00:06:35.550> which<00:06:35.580> oh<00:06:35.820> the<00:06:35.910> metronome<00:06:36.300> is

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 
quarter note which oh the metronome is

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:37.880 
quarter note which oh the metronome is
that<00:06:36.600> then<00:06:36.960> we're<00:06:37.110> dividing<00:06:37.320> the<00:06:37.560> beat<00:06:37.740> up

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:37.890 
that then we're dividing the beat up

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.159 
that then we're dividing the beat up
into<00:06:38.100> smaller<00:06:38.340> slices<00:06:38.730> we<00:06:39.510> always<00:06:39.870> have<00:06:40.050> to

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:40.169 
into smaller slices we always have to

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:41.810 
into smaller slices we always have to
feel<00:06:40.380> each<00:06:40.620> one<00:06:40.830> of<00:06:40.919> those<00:06:41.070> smaller<00:06:41.370> slices

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:41.820 
feel each one of those smaller slices

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.000 
feel each one of those smaller slices
consistently<00:06:42.750> even<00:06:43.380> if<00:06:43.470> we're<00:06:43.590> not<00:06:43.620> playing

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.010 
consistently even if we're not playing
