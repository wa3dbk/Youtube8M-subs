because<00:02:41.600> there<00:02:41.720> were<00:02:41.780> so<00:02:42.020> many<00:02:42.170> things<00:02:42.380> I

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
because there were so many things I

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
hardest part of writing the books was

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.800 
hardest part of writing the books was
that<00:02:46.580> after<00:02:47.680> over<00:02:48.680> 10<00:02:48.920> years<00:02:49.220> now<00:02:49.520> of<00:02:49.940> working
