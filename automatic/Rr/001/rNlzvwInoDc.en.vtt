00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.580 
right in my face that I'd had five diet
sodas<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.040> wasn't<00:02:26.190> even<00:02:26.400> 1<00:02:26.730> p.m.<00:02:27.090> yet<00:02:27.590> and

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
sodas and it wasn't even 1 p.m. yet and

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.400 
sodas and it wasn't even 1 p.m. yet and
I<00:02:28.770> thought<00:02:29.010> this<00:02:29.640> does<00:02:30.060> not<00:02:30.360> fit<00:02:30.870> with<00:02:31.170> my

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
I thought this does not fit with my

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.880 
I thought this does not fit with my
picture<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.330> healing<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:34.320> I<00:02:34.560> made<00:02:34.770> the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
picture of healing and I made the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.660 
picture of healing and I made the
decision<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:35.430> stop<00:02:35.700> right<00:02:36.120> then

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.660 

now<00:02:40.569> it's<00:02:40.780> been<00:02:40.990> five<00:02:41.260> months<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:41.890> I<00:02:42.370> haven't

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
now it's been five months and I haven't

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.340 
now it's been five months and I haven't
had<00:02:42.850> one<00:02:42.880> drop<00:02:43.360> of<00:02:43.420> diet<00:02:43.840> soda<00:02:44.310> zero<00:02:45.310> yes

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
had one drop of diet soda zero yes

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.910 
had one drop of diet soda zero yes
perhaps<00:02:47.350> my<00:02:47.740> success<00:02:48.280> will<00:02:49.000> help<00:02:49.240> inspire<00:02:49.660> you

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
perhaps my success will help inspire you

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.350 
perhaps my success will help inspire you
to<00:02:50.920> quit<00:02:51.160> doing<00:02:51.370> something<00:02:51.880> that<00:02:52.000> makes<00:02:52.180> you

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
to quit doing something that makes you

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.270 
to quit doing something that makes you
feel<00:02:52.390> bad<00:02:52.780> about<00:02:52.810> yourself<00:02:53.970> good<00:02:54.970> luck
