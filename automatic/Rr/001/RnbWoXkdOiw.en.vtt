00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.860 

because<00:00:56.699> if<00:00:56.820> we<00:00:56.940> don't<00:00:57.149> do<00:00:57.269> that<00:00:57.300> then<00:00:57.659> we're

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
because if we don't do that then we're

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.489 
because if we don't do that then we're
doomed

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:58.499 
doomed

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:08.840 
doomed
there<00:00:58.739> we<00:00:58.859> are<00:01:04.460> there<00:01:05.460> we<00:01:05.580> go<00:01:07.549> is<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.759> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
there we are there we go is that the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.870 
there we are there we go is that the
Scimitar<00:01:09.270> will<00:01:09.450> shooted<00:01:09.810> us<00:01:10.640> because<00:01:11.640> if<00:01:11.789> we

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
Scimitar will shooted us because if we

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.580 
Scimitar will shooted us because if we
let<00:01:12.149> them<00:01:12.299> cloak<00:01:12.630> without<00:01:12.960> getting<00:01:13.200> any<00:01:13.350> sort

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
let them cloak without getting any sort

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.219 
let them cloak without getting any sort
of<00:01:13.680> hits<00:01:13.950> off<00:01:14.130> our<00:01:14.310> own<00:01:14.930> then<00:01:15.930> what<00:01:16.110> will

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
of hits off our own then what will

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.960 
of hits off our own then what will
happen<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.649> is<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.009> they<00:01:17.159> will<00:01:17.310> completely

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
happen is is that they will completely

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.810 
happen is is that they will completely
obliterate<00:01:18.539> us<00:01:19.039> because<00:01:20.039> they'll<00:01:20.220> fire<00:01:20.549> while

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
obliterate us because they'll fire while

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:34.690 
obliterate us because they'll fire while
cloaked<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.270> they'll<00:01:21.420> never<00:01:21.810> ever<00:01:21.990> be

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:47.770 

there's<00:01:35.700> no<00:01:35.850> really<00:01:36.149> shielding<00:01:36.690> accidents

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.960 

yeah<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.229> sad<00:01:49.470> thing<00:01:49.679> is<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.979> Kobayashi<00:01:50.490> rule

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
yeah the sad thing is the Kobayashi rule

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.770 
yeah the sad thing is the Kobayashi rule
that<00:01:51.630> mod<00:01:51.959> is<00:01:52.170> no<00:01:52.440> longer<00:01:52.740> being<00:01:53.100> updated

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
that mod is no longer being updated

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.450 
that mod is no longer being updated
so<00:01:55.380> yeah<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.740> kind<00:01:56.010> of<00:01:56.130> sucks

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.280

younger a certain time
you<00:02:31.549> know<00:02:31.670> it<00:02:32.510> looks<00:02:32.659> like<00:02:32.810> this<00:02:32.930> bad<00:02:33.170> you<00:02:33.859> know

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
sometimes these battles take a while you

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:45.369 
sometimes these battles take a while you
know<00:02:37.900> especially<00:02:38.900> one<00:02:39.079> like<00:02:39.109> this<00:02:39.500> I<00:02:44.379> mean

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
know especially one like this I mean

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:46.929 
know especially one like this I mean
with<00:02:45.530> these<00:02:45.680> custom<00:02:46.159> ship<00:02:46.400> models<00:02:46.700> like<00:02:46.819> this

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:46.939 
with these custom ship models like this

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:54.670 
with these custom ship models like this
it's<00:02:47.120> kind<00:02:47.359> of<00:02:47.420> hard<00:02:47.629> to<00:02:47.719> go<00:02:53.319> orange<00:02:54.319> things

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
it's kind of hard to go orange things

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.110 
it's kind of hard to go orange things
they're<00:02:54.920> firing<00:02:55.129> at<00:02:55.340> us<00:02:55.400> or<00:02:55.639> not<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:55.939> show

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
they're firing at us or not the show

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.080 
they're firing at us or not the show
first<00:02:56.359> but<00:02:56.599> they<00:02:56.750> are<00:02:56.810> also<00:02:56.989> good<00:03:00.730> if<00:03:01.730> you<00:03:01.909> guys

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
first but they are also good if you guys

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.580 
first but they are also good if you guys
like<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.419> skin<00:03:02.720> I<00:03:02.750> put<00:03:03.049> on<00:03:03.260> them

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
like the skin I put on them

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.460 
like the skin I put on them
this<00:03:04.519> does<00:03:05.030> shield<00:03:05.329> skins<00:03:05.659> I<00:03:06.019> made<00:03:06.349> them

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470
