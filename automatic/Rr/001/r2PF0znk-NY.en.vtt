I<00:02:56.430> said<00:02:57.030> before<00:02:57.360> and<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.050> after<00:02:58.170> which<00:02:58.410> I

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
I said before and the after which I

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.750 
I said before and the after which I
think<00:02:58.709> was<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:58.830> bad<00:02:59.069> spin<00:02:59.310> ship<00:02:59.489> through<00:02:59.700> the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
think was a bad spin ship through the

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.460 
think was a bad spin ship through the
middle<00:03:00.030> stages<00:03:00.269> which<00:03:00.690> I<00:03:00.959> found<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.290> most

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
middle stages which I found the most

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.990 
middle stages which I found the most
impressed<00:03:01.830> with<00:03:01.920> him

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
impressed with him

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.970 
impressed with him
Marvin's<00:03:03.780> batsman<00:03:04.380> should<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.650> other<00:03:04.739> day<00:03:04.920> at

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
Marvin's batsman should the other day at

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.949 
Marvin's batsman should the other day at
Lord's<00:03:05.310> through<00:03:05.519> those<00:03:05.700> middle<00:03:06.480> phase<00:03:06.690> was

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
Lord's through those middle phase was

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.170 
Lord's through those middle phase was
great<00:03:07.230> but<00:03:08.010> today<00:03:08.280> already<00:03:08.549> went<00:03:08.940> up<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.150> notch

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
great but today already went up a notch

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.289 
great but today already went up a notch
and<00:03:09.569> same<00:03:09.959> as<00:03:10.110> Ross's<00:03:10.560> in<00:03:11.430> Cannes<00:03:11.730> as<00:03:11.940> well<00:03:12.120> and

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
and same as Ross's in Cannes as well and

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.270 
and same as Ross's in Cannes as well and
I<00:03:12.360> think<00:03:12.420> that's<00:03:12.660> a<00:03:12.870> sign<00:03:13.290> of<00:03:13.350> of<00:03:14.069> some

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
I think that's a sign of of some

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.729 
I think that's a sign of of some
confident<00:03:14.760> betters<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.350> so<00:03:16.350> I<00:03:16.380> guess<00:03:16.560> the

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
confident betters and so I guess the

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.380 
confident betters and so I guess the
batsman<00:03:17.310> was<00:03:17.430> outstanding<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:18.000> see<00:03:18.239> and

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
batsman was outstanding to see and

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.229 
batsman was outstanding to see and
then<00:03:18.480> we<00:03:18.510> when<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.319> was<00:03:19.440> striking<00:03:20.370> Billy<00:03:20.610> and

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
then we when I was striking Billy and

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.090 
then we when I was striking Billy and
when<00:03:21.420> you<00:03:21.510> couple<00:03:21.750> those<00:03:21.989> two<00:03:22.260> aspects

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
when you couple those two aspects

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.580 
when you couple those two aspects
together<00:03:23.280> now<00:03:24.239> it's<00:03:24.480> as<00:03:24.930> good<00:03:25.110> innings<00:03:25.410> that's

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
together now it's as good innings that's

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.320 
together now it's as good innings that's
what<00:03:25.830> we've<00:03:26.190> probably<00:03:26.370> seen<00:03:26.640> in<00:03:26.819> one<00:03:27.209> day

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
what we've probably seen in one day

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.080 
what we've probably seen in one day

England - throwing a grand sponsor like
I<00:03:58.160> still<00:03:58.580> think<00:03:58.790> it's<00:03:58.910> a<00:03:59.030> very<00:03:59.510> good<00:03:59.630> England

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
I still think it's a very good England

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.920 
I still think it's a very good England
bowling<00:04:00.230> on<00:04:00.380> up<00:04:00.530> and<00:04:01.150> no<00:04:02.150> weird<00:04:02.390> without

bowling on up and no weird without

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:12.000 
bowling on up and no weird without
Daniel<00:04:03.230> -<00:04:03.470> as<00:04:03.680> well

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.570 

no<00:04:12.670> I<00:04:12.700> don't<00:04:12.879> see<00:04:13.180> rotation<00:04:13.780> of<00:04:13.870> place<00:04:14.580> three

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
no I don't see rotation of place three

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.159 
no I don't see rotation of place three
no<00:04:15.730> would<00:04:16.000> be<00:04:17.040> probably<00:04:18.040> as<00:04:18.130> good<00:04:18.310> as<00:04:18.400> it<00:04:18.549> gets

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
no would be probably as good as it gets

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.129 
no would be probably as good as it gets
so<00:04:20.169> we'll<00:04:20.410> be<00:04:20.530> done<00:04:20.709> whatever<00:04:20.919> we<00:04:21.130> can<00:04:21.340> to<00:04:21.370> just

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
so we'll be done whatever we can to just

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.060 
so we'll be done whatever we can to just
continue<00:04:23.139> the<00:04:23.230> momentum<00:04:23.380> that<00:04:23.740> we've<00:04:23.919> built

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
continue the momentum that we've built

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.730

still<00:04:28.150> mindful<00:04:28.600> of<00:04:28.660> I<00:04:28.930> guess<00:04:29.229> needing<00:04:29.620> to<00:04:29.889> look

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
still mindful of I guess needing to look

after<00:04:30.850> guys<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.419> Tim<00:04:31.600> has<00:04:31.750> a<00:04:31.780> case<00:04:31.990> of<00:04:32.139> that

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
after guys and Tim has a case of that

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:33.840 
after guys and Tim has a case of that
today<00:04:32.440> as<00:04:32.590> well<00:04:32.830> we<00:04:33.010> was<00:04:33.130> not<00:04:33.280> injured<00:04:33.610> but

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
today as well we was not injured but

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.370 
today as well we was not injured but
it's<00:04:34.030> just<00:04:34.180> a<00:04:34.270> matter<00:04:34.300> of<00:04:34.540> making<00:04:34.810> sure<00:04:35.020> that

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
it's just a matter of making sure that

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.140 
it's just a matter of making sure that
he's<00:04:35.860> had<00:04:35.979> a<00:04:36.040> big<00:04:36.220> workload<00:04:36.430> and<00:04:36.850> was<00:04:36.970> being

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
he's had a big workload and was being

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.020 
he's had a big workload and was being
sensible<00:04:37.540> about<00:04:38.550> looking<00:04:39.550> after<00:04:39.820> someone

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
sensible about looking after someone

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.159 
sensible about looking after someone
when<00:04:40.240> there's<00:04:40.360> still<00:04:40.510> a<00:04:40.570> lot<00:04:40.720> of<00:04:40.750> creative

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
when there's still a lot of creative

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.140 
when there's still a lot of creative
implants<00:04:41.500> so<00:04:41.740> there<00:04:42.400> will<00:04:42.520> be<00:04:42.700> will<00:04:43.090> be

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
implants so there will be will be

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.760 
implants so there will be will be
looking<00:04:43.330> to<00:04:43.479> select<00:04:44.139> the<00:04:44.229> best<00:04:44.380> thing<00:04:44.620> that's

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
looking to select the best thing that's

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.350 
looking to select the best thing that's
possibly<00:04:45.190> available<00:04:45.370> in<00:04:45.729> trauma<00:04:45.970> net<00:04:46.210> loss

possibly available in trauma net loss
skin<00:04:49.139> yeah<00:04:50.139> I<00:04:50.410> guess<00:04:50.680> it's<00:04:51.370> continually

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
skin yeah I guess it's continually

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.760 
skin yeah I guess it's continually
assessing<00:04:52.330> him<00:04:52.570> he<00:04:53.050> still<00:04:53.290> wasn't<00:04:53.470> quite

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
assessing him he still wasn't quite

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.890 
assessing him he still wasn't quite
right<00:04:53.919> for<00:04:54.160> this<00:04:54.250> one<00:04:54.460> so<00:04:54.729> we'll<00:04:55.300> just<00:04:55.450> keep

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
right for this one so we'll just keep

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.020 
right for this one so we'll just keep
the<00:04:56.020> system<00:04:56.169> as<00:04:56.500> we<00:04:56.680> go<00:04:56.800> along<00:04:56.919> and<00:04:57.100> we<00:04:57.460> assess

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
the system as we go along and we assess

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.520 
the system as we go along and we assess
the<00:04:58.150> luxury<00:04:58.479> of<00:04:58.540> God<00:04:58.870> with<00:04:59.020> the<00:04:59.110> balance<00:04:59.410> of

the squad that we've got as well as we

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.930

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.480 

it's<00:05:12.170> increasing<00:05:12.650> confidence<00:05:13.070> is<00:05:13.370> increasing

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
it's increasing confidence is increasing

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.600 
it's increasing confidence is increasing
yet<00:05:14.350> again<00:05:15.350> don't<00:05:15.680> want<00:05:15.800> to<00:05:15.860> put<00:05:15.980> any<00:05:16.160> extra

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
yet again don't want to put any extra

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.250 
yet again don't want to put any extra
pressure<00:05:16.730> on<00:05:17.150> it<00:05:17.300> because<00:05:17.600> it's<00:05:17.870> got<00:05:18.080> to<00:05:18.170> make

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
pressure on it because it's got to make

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.670 
pressure on it because it's got to make
sure<00:05:18.440> he's<00:05:18.590> right<00:05:18.830> and<00:05:19.870> and<00:05:20.870> you<00:05:21.290> know<00:05:21.560> I<00:05:21.590> think

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
sure he's right and and you know I think

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.050 
sure he's right and and you know I think
we've<00:05:21.890> got<00:05:22.070> some<00:05:22.220> guys<00:05:22.340> who<00:05:22.490> are<00:05:22.580> stepping<00:05:22.850> up

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
we've got some guys who are stepping up

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.870 
we've got some guys who are stepping up
in<00:05:23.210> the<00:05:23.240> interim<00:05:23.780> as<00:05:23.900> well<00:05:24.080> so<00:05:24.350> you<00:05:25.250> know<00:05:25.370> it'd

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
in the interim as well so you know it'd

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.160 
in the interim as well so you know it'd
be<00:05:25.940> great<00:05:26.060> if<00:05:26.270> we<00:05:26.480> do<00:05:26.750> have<00:05:26.930> him<00:05:27.020> for<00:05:27.140> the

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.170 
be great if we do have him for the

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.320 
be great if we do have him for the
Champions<00:05:27.590> Trophy<00:05:27.740> but<00:05:28.010> if<00:05:28.160> we<00:05:28.280> don't<00:05:28.490> I<00:05:28.850> think

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
Champions Trophy but if we don't I think

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:37.970 
Champions Trophy but if we don't I think
we've<00:05:29.660> still<00:05:29.810> got<00:05:29.960> a<00:05:29.990> few<00:05:30.140> bases<00:05:30.500> come
