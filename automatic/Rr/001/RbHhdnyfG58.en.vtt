 [Music] 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.970
 the ex-rally the atman restaurant we are 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:17.410
 in pescia in the province of pistoia 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:19.419
 the recipe that I propose to you today are more 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.539
 what else a recipe is a technique of 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:25.749
 cooking are penis results with cabbage 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.429
 purple and shrimp plus there will be a 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:30.300
 mayonnaise that will complete the 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:34.120
 dish the ingredients for 4 people 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:39.160
 are a liter of broth made a good le 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:42.580
 shrimp heads 24 crayfish 150 g of 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:46.030
 purple cabbage a shallot and some flowers 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.690
 edible and 240 grams of pasta drawn in 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.380
 gold 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:53.080
 if the ingredients seem few 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:57.970
 the cooking techniques instead are 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:00.580
 high in the sense that we have to cook 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.190
 the pasta in a particular way not in 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.979
 water but we must be of 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.759
 consequently we will have to take a pan 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:12.729
 put the pasta inside and then start 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:15.429
 cooking in the sense that the broth must 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.100
 be boiling and must be added 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:22.149
 slowly to the broad this allows 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.999
 that the pasta absorbs a shrimp broth 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:27.460
 okay to cook in a water filled with 

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:29.590
 not even this limestone is already a value 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.740
 added the important thing is to succeed 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.689
 to get to the end where he doesn't have to 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.100
 be more broth so let's keep it 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.710
 slowly, that's why it's called 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.439
 at the end it will have to be creamy 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.719
 another important thing is all 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.090
 elements that will go into the pasta 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:48.830
 which will be done first then in one 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.410
 pan do it first 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.690
 cook the shallot then pan 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.760
 warm a little olive oil the shallot from 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.160
 the moment when the 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.780
 temperature lower to lower e 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.840
 add a little water because the 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.120
 range of the molecule therefore of the taste e 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.370
 between 75 and 90 degrees we have to 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.060
 keep this constantly 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.010
 temperature 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:15.560
 then there will be the time to cook the 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.510
 purple cabbage of a drizzle of oil 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.930
 when the pan is very hot we bring 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.000
 into small pieces purple cabbage 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.380
 we skip it quickly and keep it 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.350
 in a heat then it will be time for 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.420
 create the base of the dish which is the 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.150
 mayonnaise made with shrimp heads 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.080
 then the shrimp heads remove them 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.450
 eyes 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.300
 we put in a container we mix with 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.820
 informant we add the oil flush 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.630
 so let's create a kind of mayonnaise with 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.280
 albumins are the proteins of the heads 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.900
 we filter from the fine pollino will be at 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.570
 base of the dish ie we will take 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.410
 the plate will put a strip of 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.340
 mayonnaise 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:01.670
 then we're going to put the plate on the plate 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.350
 pasta that we turned out was going to go 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.970
 to garnish with prawn prawns 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.730
 they will be made only at the last moment 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.500
 then a hot frying pan with holes in it 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.420
 shrimp inside with a little oil in the 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.190
 more or less and we pan-fry 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.780
 quickly then in to put on 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.940
 dish 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.060
 we look with flowers of hard knocks 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.060
 [Music] 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.450
 finished dish are the drawn feathers in 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.610
 gold results with purple cabbage and shrimp 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:41.090
 and shrimp mayonnaise 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:41.090
