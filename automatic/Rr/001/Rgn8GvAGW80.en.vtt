00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:02.860
 with the indigenous 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.450
 yes until the time of driving 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.390
 many say that efficient driving is a utopia and 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.139
 that you can not get 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.900
 but something we will have to do when for each liter of fuel consumed 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.490
 our vehicle we produce about 2 kilograms and a half of ugly 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.380
 in this video a driver who is going to show how easy it is to apply in your 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.169
 day to day efficient driving techniques 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.469
 This new way of driving decreases pollution consumption and increases 

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:33.859
 the security in addition to suppose an economic saving that never comes badly 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:38.210
 therefore this driver can and should be each one of us 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.560
 to start our driver starts the engine without stepping on the accelerator and 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.500
 use the first one only for the start of the march 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.500
 As you can see, it changes the second approximately two seconds 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.120
 hurry the first gear increases consumption 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.820
 during the rest of the tour our protagonist uses speed as 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.600
 reference to change gear 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.010
 you change third from 30 kilometers hour 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.100
 at the door when you reach 40 iaquinta when you exceed 50 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.930
 in general it is always better to drive in the longest possible gear and at low 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.930
 revolutions 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.760
 the efficient driver knows that increasing the safety distance 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.150
 get a greater field of vision that allows you to see two or three vehicles 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.060
 in front of 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.659
 to anticipate incidences of circulation, avoid 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.659
 sudden braking and acceleration that affect consumption 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.270
 When you have to stop the car before stepping on the brake, let the 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.410
 vehicle with the gear that is in grenade at that time 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.400
 then brake smoothly 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.370
 even if the speed allows it stops the car without reducing the march 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.680
 the car idling for more than one minute consumes more than necessary for 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.930
 tear 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.710
 so at some traffic lights and when the detention is greater than one minute 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.579
 it is convenient to turn off the engine 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:13.459
 with this measure we reduce emissions and save fuel 

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:20.549
 and for a traveler long journeys 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.010
 of course all of the above is still valid but also our driver 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.340
 juan paz and culantro high speeds never open the windows because he knows 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:31.919
 that increase consumption 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:36.229
 only use air conditioning when necessary and never below the 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:39.229
 24 degrees 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:45.199
 ilabaca and the roof rack only receive the essential time there is no 

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:48.199
 circulate with them when they are not going to be used 

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:56.579
 but our protagonist also saves and takes care of the environment 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.889
 keeping your car pointed 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:02.249
 he is not lazy about checking the pressure of the wheels because he knows that if they go 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:05.919
 deflated increases consumption and makes the works last less kilometers 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:10.879
 He also knows that the car can hold on due to excessive pressure 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.659
 it is dangerous 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.749
 we must pay attention to the advice of the manual of our car 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:19.240
 do periodic oil checks 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.220
 Spark plug filters a poorly regulated engine consumes up to 9% more fuel 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:38.219
 day in short each and every one of these measures are adding savings 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:39.749
 you save on consumption 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:43.899
 even without the number of visits to the workshop and you save because it extends the life of your 

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:45.399
 vehicle 

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:49.779
 but they also add benefits for all environmental and safety 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:51.019
 vial 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.629
 of course this change is not immediate 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.669
 but the small gestures we make today are necessary to maintain our 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:01.099
 quality of life tomorrow 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.819
