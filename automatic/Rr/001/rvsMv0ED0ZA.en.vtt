00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 I'm here live and definitive with 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.299
 cláudio lins cara is a brazilian who 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.980
 is living in the capital of Finland and 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.200
 game developer and look at the face 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.599
 a game that had developed behind 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.450
 would initially be for pc now will 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.760
 out for both xbox the year and also for 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.680
 the game on the screen let's talk a little 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.660
 This game was the first to cry the most 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.760
 alone must have reference of games of 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.880
 16 bits played enough that 's fact is 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.050
 which it is the idea that this was so to me 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.949
 I'm working since the game already 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.680
 anticipation and time so I never had 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.620
 opportunity to do something some 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.020
 time to be a game in itself as games that 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.120
 I played when I was a child. 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.980
 the appearance of this final phase of 8 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.140
 bit start bits 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.399
 so so have a bit of 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.800
 influence of this time 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.110
 For sure this game you hit or do 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.920
 It's like a game, said Cornyn. 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.109
 having the school with a younger look with 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.640
 some current face elements have a 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.859
 thing can put in that game that 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.629
 was not the time when you 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.030
 can put on them 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.860
 At that time you speak at the time 16 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.490
 months 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.060
 so the game there he uses 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.970
 it's a new year 2.5 in 2002 he gave it 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.880
 everyone in the e3 of things like this 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.250
 protact sata for playstation 1 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.229
 and most think three of them also you 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:31.740
 have some medications from him from the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:36.060
 pcp now pitch for soccer asking 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.090
 his visual appearance even had the 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.100
 simple thing pamphlet was that the whole one 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.649
 takes so different so it takes them in 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.869
 not the same design 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.439
 léo the same design but also the same 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.030
 look it now all in 3d and so 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.070
 now I'm going to work with him but the most 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.740
 Legal work is the effects for those who 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:00.540
 I used to say I would also say much better 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:06.890
 what was good release will be 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:10.800
 when yes yes I hope so I'm 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.380
 pointing thus towards July of this 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.150
 year but it is not 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.820
 I do not have a date defends bath but 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.110
 second semester for sure I imagine 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.860
 that at the beginning of the second half 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.240
 time 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.100
 the guy who is cool or not with some 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.170
 thing what you are doing in Finland 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.760
 so it 's there in the queue it's not in the 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.700
 Brazil 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.680
 Well I'm here almost two years and 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.400
 I was working with games in 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.760
 Recife 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.680
 at the time the company in the playboy but this 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.040
 question is not in the queue already strategy 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.050
 also the question of playing 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.990
 so it was not initially was not 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.560
 original idea but here a very 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.960
 cool, very cool, you angry person 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.580
 birds attack that more the same way 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.290
 community of developers is very 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.660
 Why look at you, you should talk like that. 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.430
 face like that guy alone can 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:05.580
 get to develop a nice game the game 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.110
 respected and had access to the box a8 netão 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.760
 people who mirror you because you 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.530
 makes these guys more or less a 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.270
 way he can mean truth 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.040
 that staff are starting one of the 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.100
 things that always happen 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.860
 no one else in several areas and so 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.530
 you will give a lot of door in his face will have 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.850
 too much claw you go for example 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.120
 I'm working with this game now. 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.070
 but I've already released 30 games 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:35.460
 now I'm 34 years old from my 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:37.980
 old to the industry but that's just it 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.660
 so do not give up it will show up a lot 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.670
 people talking that you can not 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.940
 that does not roll that does not give 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:48.330
 so that's not the way to give the video 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.910
 simple then these folks always do 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.130
 part of the local community where 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.840
 developers you really know 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.550
 on the internet that is so 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.340
 I think this energy is very important 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.560
 to create a new project to learn 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.420
 everything and begins to make the game so 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.450
 example I think that at the time I started 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.490
 I started 99 2000 out there 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.280
 the tools were more precarious was 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.840
 more difficult to gain access to 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.090
 his injuries were very much they were 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.440
 very expensive 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.810
 but nowadays if you can get 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.609
 have access to technology such as 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.200
 river of grace 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.850
 of course not for free but 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.420
 so you can download it yourself 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.120
 You can work on it. 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.790
 as well as working in the unit has a 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.600
 a lot of cold software or a lot of 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.580
 cheap you can pick up and so on 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.110
 very small team today 8 even 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.130
 alone you can work some 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:44.860
 thing and you can also publish it 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.380
 something for example or whatever 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.750
 there you have steam already a little more 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.090
 complicated but still you with the 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.150
 effort if you put a game there has 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:58.090
 a scissors thus has one with ease 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.290
 What are you up to today to publish a game? 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.550
 digitally 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.200
 I will not say what you're going to do 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.300
 million carrick lines but you go 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.120
 able to make the market game and 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.520
 people do not have easy access so 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:14.260
 I think it's this, do break the 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.820
 face is done there is not a guy much 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.110
 Thanks for the great formations. 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.140
 nice to talk to you 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:23.260
 I'm growing up for you , than this 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.390
 game Sunday derby and we will want 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.370
 to accompany it was launched and in life 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.930
 people are going to try to make a dvd player 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.700
 show it all because we like it 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.120
 to privilege the work of staff 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:37.590
 Brazilian guy, brigadão and pleasure too 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.590
