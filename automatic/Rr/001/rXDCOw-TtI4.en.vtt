do<00:00:29.970> recommend<00:00:30.359> using<00:00:30.900> polish<00:00:31.470> for<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:31.830> and

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
do recommend using polish for this and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.010 
do recommend using polish for this and
method<00:00:32.369> paint<00:00:32.640> because<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.180> polish<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.840> can

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
method paint because the polish you can

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.530 
method paint because the polish you can
see<00:00:34.260> through<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.940> through<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.030> color<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.510> it

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
see through it through the color so it

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.180 
see through it through the color so it
really<00:00:36.750> gives<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:37.110> nice<00:00:37.260> platter<00:00:37.710> fact<00:00:38.070> with

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
really gives a nice platter fact with

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.209 
really gives a nice platter fact with
the<00:00:38.309> paint<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.730> more<00:00:39.090> opaque<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.500> doesn't

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
the paint is more opaque so it doesn't

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.580 
the paint is more opaque so it doesn't
give<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.670> effect<00:00:42.090> as<00:00:42.300> well<00:00:44.989> but<00:00:45.989> i<00:00:46.020> do<00:00:46.230> like

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
give that effect as well but i do like

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.160 
give that effect as well but i do like
using<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.039> polish<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.329> simple<00:00:48.750> colors

using the polish and the simple colors

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.850
