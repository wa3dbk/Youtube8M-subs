the<00:01:10.320> right<00:01:10.560> as<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.799> see<00:01:11.040> here<00:01:11.430> we<00:01:12.000> get<00:01:12.180> a

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
the right as you see here we get a

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.230 
the right as you see here we get a
slower<00:01:12.689> animation<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.590> by<00:01:14.220> simply<00:01:15.090> sliding

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
slower animation and by simply sliding

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.660 
slower animation and by simply sliding
all<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.810> way<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.590> left<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:17.100> course<00:01:17.460> you

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
all the way to the left of course you

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.660 
all the way to the left of course you
guessed<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.570> get<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.869> faster<00:01:19.409> animation<00:01:19.979> so

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
guessed it you get a faster animation so

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.640 
guessed it you get a faster animation so
let's<00:01:21.420> go<00:01:21.570> ahead<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.810> try<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.140> few<00:01:22.470> other

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
when you set your abs in to wiggle mode

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.900 
when you set your abs in to wiggle mode
and<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:17.620> see<00:02:17.830> here<00:02:18.099> I<00:02:18.129> have<00:02:18.250> these<00:02:18.519> cool

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
and you see here I have these cool

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.570 
and you see here I have these cool
animations<00:02:19.569> when<00:02:19.840> you<00:02:19.959> hold<00:02:20.170> down<00:02:20.379> on<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.769> app

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
animations when you hold down on the app

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.540 
animations when you hold down on the app
to<00:02:22.180> go<00:02:22.300> into<00:02:22.420> wiggle<00:02:22.840> mode<00:02:26.190> now<00:02:27.190> let's<00:02:27.400> go

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
to go into wiggle mode now let's go

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.729 
to go into wiggle mode now let's go
ahead<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:27.819> go<00:02:28.180> into<00:02:28.330> stop<00:02:28.810> edit<00:02:29.200> mode<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.620> as

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
ahead and go into stop edit mode and as

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.949 
ahead and go into stop edit mode and as
you've<00:02:29.950> probably<00:02:30.310> guessed<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:31.569> is<00:02:31.690> going<00:02:31.900> to

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
you've probably guessed it is going to

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.860 
you've probably guessed it is going to
be<00:02:31.989> when<00:02:32.500> you<00:02:32.650> actually<00:02:32.940> stop<00:02:33.940> from<00:02:34.390> wiggle

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
be when you actually stop from wiggle

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.320 
be when you actually stop from wiggle
mode<00:02:35.049> so<00:02:35.739> when<00:02:35.890> you<00:02:35.980> do<00:02:36.190> go<00:02:36.489> into<00:02:36.700> wiggle<00:02:37.150> mode

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
mode so when you do go into wiggle mode

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.270 
mode so when you do go into wiggle mode
you<00:02:38.140> actually<00:02:38.590> just<00:02:38.620> hit<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.040> home<00:02:39.250> button

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
you actually just hit the home button

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.789 
you actually just hit the home button
and<00:02:39.760> then<00:02:39.970> I'll<00:02:40.120> exit<00:02:40.510> out<00:02:40.599> of<00:02:40.660> that<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.260> that

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
and then I'll exit out of that and that

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.800 
and then I'll exit out of that and that
is<00:02:41.950> when<00:02:42.129> this<00:02:42.250> animation<00:02:42.790> comes<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.330> play<00:02:43.540> and

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
is when this animation comes to play and

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.110 
is when this animation comes to play and
then<00:02:44.319> going<00:02:44.590> down<00:02:44.860> we<00:02:45.010> have<00:02:45.160> moved<00:02:45.489> page<00:02:45.790> which

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
then going down we have moved page which

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.880 
then going down we have moved page which
allows<00:02:46.420> you<00:02:46.599> to<00:02:46.690> change<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.110> animation<00:02:47.260> when

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
allows you to change the animation when

going down to tap on empty space we have

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.380 
going down to tap on empty space we have
another<00:03:24.010> co<00:03:24.250> animation<00:03:24.730> when<00:03:24.850> tapping<00:03:25.120> of

course on an empty space on your
springboard<00:03:27.850> here<00:03:28.570> I'm<00:03:28.720> messing<00:03:29.080> with<00:03:29.200> the

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
springboard here I'm messing with the

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.560 
springboard here I'm messing with the
ripple<00:03:29.710> animation<00:03:30.220> I<00:03:30.490> really<00:03:31.000> like<00:03:31.120> this<00:03:31.330> one

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
ripple animation I really like this one

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.270 
ripple animation I really like this one
this<00:03:31.780> is<00:03:31.840> probably<00:03:32.050> the<00:03:32.200> best<00:03:32.440> one<00:03:32.650> added<00:03:33.100> all

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
this is probably the best one added all

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.240 
this is probably the best one added all
those<00:03:33.820> whenever<00:03:34.450> you're<00:03:34.660> doing<00:03:34.840> this<00:03:35.140> tap<00:03:36.070> on

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
those whenever you're doing this tap on

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.580 
those whenever you're doing this tap on
empty<00:03:36.520> space<00:03:36.820> animation<00:03:39.330> lastly<00:03:40.330> we<00:03:40.480> have

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
empty space animation lastly we have

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.320 
empty space animation lastly we have
springboard<00:03:41.590> swipe<00:03:41.950> now<00:03:42.640> this<00:03:42.820> allows<00:03:43.090> you<00:03:43.240> to

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
springboard swipe now this allows you to

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.060 
springboard swipe now this allows you to
change<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.630> animation<00:03:43.810> when<00:03:44.350> flipping<00:03:44.710> pages

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
change the animation when flipping pages

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.160 
change the animation when flipping pages
as<00:03:45.490> you<00:03:45.610> probably<00:03:45.850> saw<00:03:46.000> in<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.810> beginning<00:03:46.930> of

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
as you probably saw in the beginning of

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.910 
as you probably saw in the beginning of
the<00:03:47.260> video<00:03:47.380> i<00:03:47.590> had<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.130> page<00:03:48.400> curl<00:03:48.730> right<00:03:49.090> and

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
the video i had the page curl right and

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.890 
the video i had the page curl right and
now<00:03:50.920> let's<00:03:51.160> go<00:03:51.250> ahead<00:03:51.460> and<00:03:51.550> try<00:03:51.730> suck<00:03:52.420> middle

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
now let's go ahead and try suck middle

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.440 
now let's go ahead and try suck middle
and<00:03:53.550> that<00:03:54.550> just<00:03:54.910> sounds<00:03:55.180> weird<00:03:55.210> all<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:55.630> time

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
and that just sounds weird all the time
