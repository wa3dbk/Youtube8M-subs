patch<00:03:32.560> you<00:03:32.680> can<00:03:32.800> build<00:03:32.980> them<00:03:33.100> up<00:03:33.160> like<00:03:33.400> crazy

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
patch you can build them up like crazy

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.940 
patch you can build them up like crazy
using<00:03:34.300> a<00:03:34.360> dcd<00:03:34.840> than<00:03:35.140> a<00:03:35.170> dark<00:03:35.590> patch<00:03:35.770> or

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
using a dcd than a dark patch or

using a dcd than a dark patch or
something<00:03:36.280> or<00:03:36.460> to<00:03:36.730> dark<00:03:36.940> patches<00:03:37.300> can<00:03:37.660> also<00:03:37.810> do

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
something or to dark patches can also do

energy<00:03:41.920> so<00:03:42.100> will<00:03:42.280> be<00:03:42.520> really<00:03:42.880> helpful<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.240> test

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
energy so will be really helpful to test

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.090 
energy so will be really helpful to test
it<00:03:43.540> out<00:03:43.630> and<00:03:43.930> since<00:03:44.230> both<00:03:44.440> are<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.620> stage<00:03:44.920> two

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.640 
see there as I mentioned this can be
pretty<00:04:52.360> disruptive<00:04:52.600> just<00:04:53.230> think<00:04:53.410> about<00:04:53.500> it

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
pretty disruptive just think about it

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.530 
pretty disruptive just think about it
turn<00:04:54.010> one<00:04:54.250> using<00:04:54.520> collector<00:04:54.970> or<00:04:55.090> doable<00:04:55.480> or

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
turn one using collector or doable or

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.030 
turn one using collector or doable or
something<00:04:55.900> to<00:04:56.020> get<00:04:56.110> out<00:04:56.260> a<00:04:56.290> bunch<00:04:56.530> of<00:04:56.620> Sneezles

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
something to get out a bunch of Sneezles

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.710 
something to get out a bunch of Sneezles
and<00:04:57.490> then<00:04:57.640> we<00:04:57.730> have<00:04:57.850> a<00:04:57.880> store<00:04:58.060> work<00:04:58.330> on<00:04:58.540> your

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
and then we have a store work on your

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.360 
and then we have a store work on your
active<00:04:59.110> which<00:04:59.290> has<00:04:59.470> evolved<00:04:59.919> thanks<00:05:00.160> to<00:05:00.250> the

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
active which has evolved thanks to the

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.650 
active which has evolved thanks to the
door<00:05:00.520> wall<00:05:00.700> and<00:05:00.880> then<00:05:00.970> on<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.180> next<00:05:01.330> turn<00:05:01.570> you

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
door wall and then on the next turn you

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.360 
door wall and then on the next turn you
can<00:05:01.840> just<00:05:02.020> evolve<00:05:02.530> those<00:05:02.710> needles<00:05:03.070> and

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
can just evolve those needles and

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.090 
can just evolve those needles and
and<00:05:03.460> pick<00:05:04.389> your<00:05:04.810> opponent's<00:05:05.530> hand<00:05:05.680> just<00:05:05.889> pick

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
and pick your opponent's hand just pick

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.620 
and pick your opponent's hand just pick
some<00:05:06.250> cards<00:05:06.550> that<00:05:06.669> you<00:05:06.790> don't<00:05:07.030> want<00:05:07.270> your

one<00:05:36.160> of<00:05:36.190> the<00:05:36.310> most<00:05:36.460> powerful<00:05:36.639> basics<00:05:37.210> ever

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:37.389 
one of the most powerful basics ever

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:39.360 
one of the most powerful basics ever
during<00:05:38.139> a<00:05:38.289> bunch<00:05:38.440> of<00:05:38.530> that<00:05:38.710> with<00:05:38.949> ex<00:05:39.130> ball

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
during a bunch of that with ex ball

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.129 
during a bunch of that with ex ball
shouldn't<00:05:39.699> be<00:05:39.789> that<00:05:39.910> hard<00:05:40.120> to<00:05:40.210> knock<00:05:40.449> out<00:05:40.600> the

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
shouldn't be that hard to knock out the

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:43.170 
shouldn't be that hard to knock out the
opposing<00:05:41.710> bratton<00:05:42.100> or<00:05:42.250> terrakion<00:05:42.789> since<00:05:43.090> they

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
opposing bratton or terrakion since they

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.300 
opposing bratton or terrakion since they
do<00:05:43.240> need<00:05:43.539> a<00:05:43.600> lot<00:05:43.780> of<00:05:43.900> energy<00:05:44.020> and<00:05:44.440> then<00:05:45.039> we<00:05:45.190> have

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
do need a lot of energy and then we have

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.100 
do need a lot of energy and then we have
to<00:05:45.340> rated<00:05:45.729> X<00:05:46.000> which<00:05:46.240> has<00:05:46.389> a<00:05:46.419> resistance<00:05:46.870> to

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
to rated X which has a resistance to

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.810 
to rated X which has a resistance to
fighting<00:05:47.530> as<00:05:47.949> well<00:05:48.280> as<00:05:48.370> the<00:05:48.490> regular
