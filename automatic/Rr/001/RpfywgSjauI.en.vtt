a<00:01:19.010> big<00:01:19.250> performance<00:01:19.430> boost<00:01:19.970> so<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.690> other

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
a big performance boost so the other

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.020 
a big performance boost so the other
cool<00:01:20.990> thing<00:01:21.020> happening<00:01:21.560> in<00:01:21.650> notebooks<00:01:22.100> is<00:01:22.400> 3d

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
cool thing happening in notebooks is 3d

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.140 
cool thing happening in notebooks is 3d
so<00:01:23.390> here<00:01:23.630> we<00:01:23.660> have<00:01:23.810> a<00:01:24.200> 3d<00:01:24.680> a<00:01:25.040> sous<00:01:25.580> notebook

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
so here we have a 3d a sous notebook

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.570 
so here we have a 3d a sous notebook
with<00:01:26.300> an<00:01:26.420> embedded<00:01:26.720> emitter<00:01:27.230> playing<00:01:27.830> mafia<00:01:28.280> 2

now<00:01:28.880> you<00:01:28.940> of<00:01:29.240> course<00:01:29.420> can't<00:01:29.810> tell<00:01:30.050> the<00:01:30.260> 3d

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
now you of course can't tell the 3d

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.770 
now you of course can't tell the 3d
effect<00:01:30.560> without<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.550> help<00:01:31.730> of<00:01:31.910> glasses<00:01:32.480> but
