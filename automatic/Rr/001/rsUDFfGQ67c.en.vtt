00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.670 
fun I'll just build a castle in the seed
that<00:02:24.210> you<00:02:24.570> won't<00:02:24.780> be<00:02:24.870> able<00:02:24.960> to<00:02:25.290> rebuild

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
that you won't be able to rebuild

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.400 
that you won't be able to rebuild
because<00:02:26.520> probably<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:27.030> seas<00:02:27.240> are<00:02:27.660> going<00:02:28.350> to

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
because probably the seas are going to

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.160 
because probably the seas are going to
change<00:02:28.620> also<00:02:29.310> since<00:02:30.300> there<00:02:30.570> there's<00:02:30.930> going<00:02:31.050> to

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
change also since there there's going to

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.660 
change also since there there's going to
be<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.470> stuff<00:02:31.830> that's<00:02:32.340> going<00:02:32.490> to<00:02:32.550> be

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
be you stuff that's going to be

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.960 
be you stuff that's going to be
generated<00:02:33.000> with<00:02:34.130> when<00:02:35.130> you<00:02:35.250> actually<00:02:35.400> start

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
generated with when you actually start

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.100 
generated with when you actually start
your<00:02:36.240> world<00:02:36.620> so<00:02:38.270> it's<00:02:39.270> really<00:02:39.510> your<00:02:39.600> call<00:02:39.750> guys
