00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:10.420
 okay girls, I just took them out of the 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:14.370
 oven was a tad hot and then 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.529
 I'm going to do now is fill them I'll 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.360
 this hotel in silio that serves to 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.360
 take the heart of apples 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.350
 it's like this has a little hole 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:34.140
 what I do is that we have to do it 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.920
 when they are hot they are bari 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.850
 I put him in and see why this is a bit 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.850
 complicated 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.980
 coat 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:54.510
 in the heart on the rise 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.640
 is that with the hand camera is very 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.640
 hard 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:11.460
 It goes well then so I will fill 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.460
 with this chocolate royale 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.440
 let's see I'll see if I can 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.600
 yes 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.370
 for development you must there I am 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.370
 filling in 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.340
 chocolate 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.210
 that would be what it is to fill it up 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.120
 up more or less and if you have left 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.340
 top 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:02:01.710
 if you have left then with isolated daddy 5 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.710
 but waiting for this traffic 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.679
 I'm going to do the same example but in 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.679
 this 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.819
 we open a hole 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.840
 estimating and then we will do the same 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.680
 but filling with condensed milk 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.680
 what have we done 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:37.049
 for so much 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.049
 and then catch wind 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:53.020
 and I get 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.020
 to capital 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.630
 We would do this in all of them and what 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.820
 you can fill in these two things that 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.180
 those of filling also to see by 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.970
 example of honey and also of any 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.610
 marmalade 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.930
 and I would be a lot of things girls 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.870
 if you come up with coordinates for 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.790
 fill it with good work anything 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.510
 girls this was the second part 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.460
 It's not too long but I hope 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.080
 that you have liked the recipe I will leave you 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:29.890
