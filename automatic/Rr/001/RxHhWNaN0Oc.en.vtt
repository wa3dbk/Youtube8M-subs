and here's the Darth Bane RGB with an
ultra<00:00:06.509> edged<00:00:06.690> blade<00:00:08.990> this<00:00:09.990> is<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.380> mid<00:00:11.219> grade

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
ultra edged blade this is the mid grade

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.299 
ultra edged blade this is the mid grade
ultra<00:00:12.630> edge<00:00:12.809> so<00:00:13.469> kind<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.889> thin<00:00:14.099> wall

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
ultra edge so kind of the thin wall

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.279 
ultra edge so kind of the thin wall
ultra<00:00:14.759> edge<00:00:14.910> blade<00:00:17.330> just<00:00:18.330> as<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> comparison<00:00:19.020> I

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
ultra edge blade just as a comparison I

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.019 
ultra edge blade just as a comparison I
actually<00:00:19.410> like<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.920> ultra<00:00:20.250> edge<00:00:20.400> better<00:00:20.789> on

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
actually like the ultra edge better on

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.670 
actually like the ultra edge better on
this<00:00:21.210> RGB<00:00:21.600> saber<00:00:22.080> than<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:23.420> standard<00:00:24.680> clear

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
this RGB saber than the standard clear

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.609 
this RGB saber than the standard clear
polycarbonate<00:00:26.099> blade

polycarbonate blade

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:37.729 
polycarbonate blade
so<00:00:28.619> I'll<00:00:28.680> colors<00:00:29.010> turned<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:36.140> that's<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.440> gold

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
so I'll colors turned on that's the gold

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.319 
so I'll colors turned on that's the gold

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.630 
and here we see the Darth Bane compared
to<00:03:53.550> a<00:03:53.580> stock<00:03:54.290> master<00:03:55.290> replicas<00:03:55.739> blue<00:03:56.069> blade<00:03:56.400> I

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
to a stock master replicas blue blade I

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.640 
to a stock master replicas blue blade I
just<00:03:56.849> wanted<00:03:57.000> to<00:03:57.120> show<00:03:57.330> this<00:03:57.510> because<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:58.290> kept

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
just wanted to show this because I kept

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.000 
just wanted to show this because I kept
saying<00:03:58.890> that<00:03:59.160> the<00:04:00.590> blue<00:04:01.590> was<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.800> least

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
saying that the blue was the least

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.850 
saying that the blue was the least
impressive<00:04:02.340> you<00:04:03.180> can<00:04:03.420> see<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:04.650> massive

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
impressive you can see the massive

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.680 
impressive you can see the massive
replicas<00:04:05.430> is<00:04:05.580> actually<00:04:05.910> slightly<00:04:06.239> brighter

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
replicas is actually slightly brighter

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.430 
replicas is actually slightly brighter
than<00:04:07.940> than<00:04:08.940> the<00:04:09.090> bane<00:04:09.269> using<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.260> blue

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
than than the bane using the blue

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:22.009 
than than the bane using the blue
setting<00:04:18.680> at<00:04:19.680> least<00:04:19.859> that<00:04:20.190> the<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:21.690> end<00:04:21.810> of<00:04:21.930> the

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
setting at least that the the end of the

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:30.050 
setting at least that the the end of the
blade<00:04:27.830> that's<00:04:28.830> a<00:04:29.010> three<00:04:29.430> minute<00:04:29.610> turn<00:04:29.910> off

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
blade that's a three minute turn off

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.540 
blade that's a three minute turn off
because<00:04:30.419> of<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:31.040> massive<00:04:32.040> replica

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
because of the massive replica

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:39.240 
because of the massive replica
soundboard<00:04:33.060> which<00:04:33.240> is<00:04:33.389> installed

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.910 

green<00:04:41.110> means<00:04:42.110> actually<00:04:42.440> pretty<00:04:42.620> impressive

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
green means actually pretty impressive

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.860 
green means actually pretty impressive
on<00:04:43.340> this<00:04:43.550> one

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:05:19.150 

you

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:29.969 

think<00:05:28.360> about<00:05:28.449> this<00:05:28.629> is<00:05:28.839> you<00:05:28.960> can<00:05:29.080> kind<00:05:29.319> of<00:05:29.409> sort

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
think about this is you can kind of sort

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.249 
think about this is you can kind of sort
of<00:05:30.099> kaga<00:05:30.449> pretty<00:05:31.449> click<00:05:31.659> on<00:05:31.809> these<00:05:31.960> things

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:32.259 
of kaga pretty click on these things

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:33.600 
of kaga pretty click on these things
above<00:05:32.559> certain<00:05:32.800> kind<00:05:33.189> of<00:05:33.219> thing<00:05:33.430> like<00:05:33.580> that
