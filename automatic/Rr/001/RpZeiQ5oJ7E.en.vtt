found in the Play Store to demonstrate

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.150 
found in the Play Store to demonstrate
the<00:00:23.519> problem<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.119> this<00:00:24.810> app<00:00:24.990> actually<00:00:25.350> shows

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
the problem and this app actually shows

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.870 
the problem and this app actually shows
you<00:00:26.430> whenever<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.689> registers<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.199> touch<00:00:28.880> by

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
you whenever it registers a touch by

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.420 
you whenever it registers a touch by
drawing<00:00:30.510> colored<00:00:31.289> circles<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.920> as<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.309> can

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
drawing colored circles and as you can

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.840 
drawing colored circles and as you can
see<00:00:32.610> there's<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.880> red<00:00:33.000> circle<00:00:33.270> right<00:00:33.630> now<00:00:34.790> yep

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
so if you hold it the circle will not

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.930 
so if you hold it the circle will not
disappear<00:00:38.879> until<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.300> let<00:00:39.450> go<00:00:40.489> now<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
right now if I were to touch the phone

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.510 
right now if I were to touch the phone

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
screen and in general I found that this

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.160 
screen and in general I found that this
area<00:01:20.280> here<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.670> hotspot<00:01:21.570> whereby<00:01:22.049> I'm

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
area here is the hotspot whereby I'm

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.740 
area here is the hotspot whereby I'm
having<00:01:22.500> most<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.130> my<00:01:23.250> problems<00:01:23.600> but<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
having most of my problems but the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.990 
having most of my problems but the
hotspot<00:01:25.140> can<00:01:25.409> sometimes<00:01:26.100> be<00:01:26.280> up<00:01:26.460> here<00:01:26.729> up<00:01:26.970> here

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
hotspot can sometimes be up here up here

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.870 
hotspot can sometimes be up here up here
up<00:01:27.270> here<00:01:27.630> it's<00:01:28.110> pretty<00:01:28.470> random<00:01:28.740> for<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.610> case

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
up here it's pretty random for this case

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:38.640 
up here it's pretty random for this case
it<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:32.509> lower<00:01:33.509> half<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.049> screen

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:46.380 

okay<00:01:40.260> so<00:01:41.280> once<00:01:42.280> you<00:01:42.430> lift<00:01:42.580> it<00:01:42.760> up<00:01:42.850> it<00:01:45.390> performs

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
okay so once you lift it up it performs

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.560 
okay so once you lift it up it performs
okay<00:01:46.750> again<00:01:51.360> yep

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
okay again yep

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.350 
okay again yep
so<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:54.190> frustrating<00:01:54.760> thing<00:01:54.970> about<00:01:55.060> this

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
so the frustrating thing about this

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.200 
so the frustrating thing about this
issue<00:01:55.630> is<00:01:55.930> that<00:01:56.370> it<00:01:57.370> doesn't<00:01:57.580> show<00:01:57.730> up<00:01:57.970> every

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
issue is that it doesn't show up every

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.290 
issue is that it doesn't show up every
single<00:01:58.480> time<00:01:58.720> and<00:01:59.490> let's<00:02:00.490> say<00:02:00.670> if<00:02:00.820> I<00:02:00.940> were<00:02:01.120> to

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
single time and let's say if I were to

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.060 
single time and let's say if I were to
put<00:02:01.480> it<00:02:01.570> on<00:02:01.630> my<00:02:01.720> table<00:02:01.930> I<00:02:02.290> put<00:02:02.590> a<00:02:02.620> clock<00:02:02.890> down

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
put it on my table I put a clock down

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.380 
put it on my table I put a clock down
here<00:02:03.310> because<00:02:03.610> I<00:02:03.730> don't<00:02:03.790> want<00:02:04.000> to<00:02:04.060> scratch<00:02:04.240> the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
here because I don't want to scratch the

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.540 
here because I don't want to scratch the
phone<00:02:06.510> it<00:02:07.510> performs<00:02:08.080> better<00:02:08.170> than<00:02:08.619> it<00:02:09.280> did<00:02:09.490> on

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
phone it performs better than it did on

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.830 
phone it performs better than it did on
a<00:02:09.700> bit<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:12.370> problem<00:02:12.760> now<00:02:12.910> is<00:02:12.940> that<00:02:13.330> if<00:02:13.660> I

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
a bit and the problem now is that if I

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.810 
a bit and the problem now is that if I
want<00:02:13.960> to<00:02:14.110> get<00:02:14.260> this<00:02:14.410> phone<00:02:14.620> serviced<00:02:15.130> I<00:02:15.430> will

what<00:02:25.450> I<00:02:25.480> came<00:02:26.140> up<00:02:26.290> with<00:02:26.350> was<00:02:26.800> that<00:02:27.010> I<00:02:28.410> would

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
what I came up with was that I would

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.630 
what I came up with was that I would
just<00:02:30.220> take<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:31.810> piece<00:02:32.080> of<00:02:32.110> sponge<00:02:32.640> somehow

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
just take this piece of sponge somehow

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.240 
just take this piece of sponge somehow
lying<00:02:33.880> around<00:02:34.000> in<00:02:34.480> my<00:02:34.630> house<00:02:34.810> it<00:02:35.560> is<00:02:35.770> a<00:02:35.800> piece

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
lying around in my house it is a piece

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.090 
lying around in my house it is a piece
of<00:02:36.400> sponge<00:02:36.670> when<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:37.630> when<00:02:38.230> I<00:02:38.260> actually<00:02:38.620> send

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
of sponge when you when I actually send

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.940 
of sponge when you when I actually send
my<00:02:39.190> heart<00:02:39.460> this<00:02:39.610> in<00:02:39.850> for<00:02:40.090> repair<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.770> I<00:02:41.770> saw

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
my heart this in for repair and I saw

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.850 
my heart this in for repair and I saw
high-density<00:02:42.550> sponge<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:44.140> what<00:02:44.410> I'll<00:02:44.500> do<00:02:44.680> here

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
high-density sponge so what I'll do here

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.229 
high-density sponge so what I'll do here
is<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:46.530> would<00:02:47.530> just<00:02:47.709> put<00:02:48.610> this<00:02:48.790> guy<00:02:49.060> on<00:02:49.209> a

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
is that I would just put this guy on a

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.170 
is that I would just put this guy on a
sponge<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:50.709> move<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:51.070> to<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.340> same<00:02:51.580> place<00:02:51.880> as

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
sponge and move it to the same place as

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.930 
sponge and move it to the same place as
just<00:02:52.570> now<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:53.140> I'll<00:02:54.070> redo<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.520> test<00:02:54.760> on<00:02:54.910> the

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
just now and I'll redo the test on the

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.770 
just now and I'll redo the test on the
sponge<00:02:58.470> as<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.680> can<00:02:59.860> see<00:03:00.070> somehow<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:01.450> sponge

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
sponge as you can see somehow the sponge

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.670 
sponge as you can see somehow the sponge
manages<00:03:02.410> to<00:03:02.910> replicate<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.150> issue<00:03:04.330> as<00:03:04.810> badly

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
manages to replicate the issue as badly

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.360 
manages to replicate the issue as badly
as<00:03:05.860> it<00:03:06.100> did<00:03:06.280> on<00:03:06.310> my<00:03:06.520> bill<00:03:06.730> so<00:03:07.890> it's<00:03:08.890> probably

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
as it did on my bill so it's probably

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.530 
as it did on my bill so it's probably
because<00:03:09.820> my<00:03:10.630> bill<00:03:10.870> is<00:03:11.110> actually<00:03:11.440> a<00:03:11.680> sponge<00:03:12.070> bit

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
because my bill is actually a sponge bit

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.610 
because my bill is actually a sponge bit
yeah<00:03:13.540> it's<00:03:13.810> actually<00:03:13.959> made<00:03:14.290> of<00:03:14.410> high-density

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
yeah it's actually made of high-density

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.810 
yeah it's actually made of high-density
sponge<00:03:15.310> and<00:03:16.590> this<00:03:17.590> is<00:03:17.770> how<00:03:17.920> I<00:03:17.950> plan<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.430> show

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
sponge and this is how I plan to show

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.850 
sponge and this is how I plan to show
the<00:03:18.880> issue<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.270> zoning<00:03:19.600> so<00:03:20.170> if<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:20.500> guys<00:03:20.620> are

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
the issue the zoning so if you guys are

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.380 
the issue the zoning so if you guys are
having<00:03:20.980> intermittent<00:03:21.760> issues<00:03:21.910> if<00:03:22.239> your

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
having intermittent issues if your

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.240 
having intermittent issues if your
touchscreen<00:03:22.900> you<00:03:23.650> know<00:03:23.769> I<00:03:23.800> want<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.040> give<00:03:24.160> this

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
touchscreen you know I want to give this

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.720 
touchscreen you know I want to give this
a<00:03:24.400> try<00:03:24.720> Thanks
