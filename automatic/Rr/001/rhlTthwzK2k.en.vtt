00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.049
 I am on the focus global model 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.000
 events sort of for event from 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.050
 may you say red congress 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.389
 here are a number of manufacturers 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.320
 stage with the stone and one of them 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.349
 also the l 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.789
 car has your new one today 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.170
 phones introduced 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.480
 actually there are even five new ones 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.580
 two telephones in the idle line of which 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.900
 then again does two versions of it 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.550
 as if they are devices themselves 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.840
 actually they are quite different 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.840
 I have the idle here 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.780
 2s in my hands and idle 62 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.460
 4g version of the idle two but also last 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.479
 4g of that has still some 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.530
 disputes 

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:41.839
 in this video I'm going to discuss it 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.309
 and what especially stands out when you 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:45.470
 immediately if you hold 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.930
 idle 2s is a phone with a 5 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.729
 inch screen but with very thin 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.100
 edges around the screen and fairly thin 

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:54.140
 device and its just very light and 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.510
 feels nice actually it is 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.070
 made of plastic but it's a bit rough 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.070
 plastic feels pretty good in the hand 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.839
 and yes for this design with a 5 inch 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.489
 screen are actually quite satisfied 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.950
 about sitting just nice out of it 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.659
 just feels good on the screen of it 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.909
 device is not a 5 inch screen 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.399
 with a full hd resolution only 720 p 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.710
 720 p resolution is of course also fine 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:19.460
 is a bit cheaper for a device 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.159
 from wise idle 2s that will be around 280 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.299
 euro 82 euro MSRP will 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.250
 probably go a little cheaper 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.170
 be in stores of course 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.840
 so that 's really bad you actually get them 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.060
 and if that's 5inch 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.009
 720 p screen is just fine for that 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.170
 viewing angle is not perfect but it is quite 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.670
 good if you look upright then you will see the 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.679
 slightly better off the corner 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.280
 the colors are pretty good anyway 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:44.600
 screen brightness is reasonable 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.600
 furthermore the colors are 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.579
 so just good contrast is not 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.249
 great but also just good enough and 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.719
 all in all yes you're just pretty good 

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:56.179
 screens definitely ahead with racing phone 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:58.069
 like this one in a party of device 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.659
 there is the same running of every part android 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.929
 jellybean on so not android kitkat 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.579
 Android Jelly Bean on this unit 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.520
 Android Jelly bean is natural in itself 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:09.170
 great android version but it is not already 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.280
 the newest lake but it is also one 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.870
 midrange device 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.690
 interface is what we know from idol 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.849
 mini and there idols from last year 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.049
 actually it has become tighter 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.519
 than what we were used to from total 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.569
 are already happy with it 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.370
 further are the adjustment and then 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.340
 compared to standard android not quite 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.620
 large there are some things 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.540
 graphically changes but is further 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.640
 it all a bit the same though 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.590
 in itself nice interface and little 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.599
 Miss Mary that concerns device has one 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.939
 1.2 gigahertz quadcore processor 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.250
 it is going to bring us just 400 process 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.540
 have heard whose with is a bit there 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.739
 vague because different models one 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.299
 walk through each other 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.310
 so it is probably 400 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.860
 process there is no mediatek processor even 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.239
 we are all used to that 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.099
 is also nice at first 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.480
 face is just really very fast 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.430
 of course it is fairly clean 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.629
 installation are not that many 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.790
 applications on 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.780
 And for that matter it's really hard to get there 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.069
 say something about it 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.349
 what is face he just runs fast 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.879
 applications that are on it as standard 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.079
 are quite a lot like the 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.879
 spouse each and there are very many 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:10.069
 Bloatware on device is a pity 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.689
 but at first glance that's it 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.670
 speed of device is not too much 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:15.260
 in that respect it is neat 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.480
 further striking is that device device 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.150
 only 4k or 7.4 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.340
 mm is thick but was also last year 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.230
 with the idol ultra the one with the in between 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.670
 telephony at the mobile world congress now 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.140
 they have the thinnest more but also 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.939
 this device is just very flat 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.090
 that is also neat so he has an 8 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:33.500
 megapixel camera with 1080 p a lot 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.099
 possibility just so that is 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.590
 decently 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.360
 further there is a 21 below 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.219
 milliampere-hour battery is present 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.510
 that is just pretty neat 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:42.709
 device in this segment 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.170
 and yes for two hundred and eighty euros 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.909
 just sickness rights or this idle 2s 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.670
 very good phone is also with 4g 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.060
 support and if that goes out 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.349
 come 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.549
 we are not very curious what 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.549
 this idle 2s is going to do
