00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.650 
figure out where my disk space is
because<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.360> says<00:00:45.570> here<00:00:46.070> it<00:00:47.070> can<00:00:47.250> find<00:00:47.520> 1.3<00:00:48.390> gig

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660

because it says here it can find 1.3 gig
of<00:00:48.870> disk<00:00:49.079> space<00:00:49.340> but<00:00:50.340> if<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.520> deal<00:00:50.730> with

properties on my C Drive it says 26 gig
is<00:00:54.960> used<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.829> I'm<00:00:56.010> not<00:00:56.160> sure<00:00:56.899> we're<00:00:57.899> 13<00:00:58.590> 13

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399

extra<00:00:59.850> gig<00:01:00.180> are<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.870> Vista<00:01:01.879> so<00:01:02.879> maybe<00:01:03.149> some<00:01:03.390> of

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
extra gig are and Vista so maybe some of

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.429 
extra gig are and Vista so maybe some of
you<00:01:03.600> vista<00:01:04.350> wizards<00:01:04.830> out<00:01:05.100> there<00:01:05.549> could<00:01:06.439> help

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
you vista wizards out there could help

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.070 
you vista wizards out there could help
me<00:01:07.619> figure<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:07.920> out<00:01:08.280> i<00:01:08.700> also<00:01:09.240> have<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> D<00:01:09.750> Drive

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
me figure this out i also have a D Drive

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.429 
me figure this out i also have a D Drive
which<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.799> am<00:01:11.010> aware<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:12.780> d<00:01:12.930> drive<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.409> a

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
which I am aware of the d drive is a

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.270 
which I am aware of the d drive is a
recovery<00:01:14.130> disk<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.790> that's<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:16.130> believe<00:01:17.130> it's

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
recovery disk and that's a believe it's

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.210 
recovery disk and that's a believe it's
temp<00:01:17.759> gig

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
temp gig

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.820 
temp gig
there's<00:01:20.060> three<00:01:20.270> gig<00:01:20.600> better<00:01:20.810> begins<00:01:21.290> so<00:01:21.650> it's

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
there's three gig better begins so it's

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.410 
there's three gig better begins so it's
over<00:01:22.070> here<00:01:22.360> but<00:01:24.550> but<00:01:25.550> you<00:01:25.640> have<00:01:25.760> properties<00:01:26.240> on

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
over here but but you have properties on

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.390 
over here but but you have properties on
this<00:01:26.980> yeah<00:01:27.980> it's<00:01:28.190> a<00:01:28.450> tech<00:01:29.450> geek<00:01:29.660> partition<00:01:30.400> and

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
this yeah it's a tech geek partition and

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.260 
this yeah it's a tech geek partition and
it<00:01:31.670> says<00:01:31.940> that<00:01:32.240> three<00:01:32.870> gr<00:01:33.460> 3.6<00:01:34.460> gr<00:01:34.790> being<00:01:34.970> used

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
it says that three gr 3.6 gr being used

it says that three gr 3.6 gr being used
seventh<00:01:36.170> gig<00:01:36.350> that's<00:01:36.710> free<00:01:38.020> my<00:01:39.020> question<00:01:39.590> is

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
seventh gig that's free my question is

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
seventh gig that's free my question is
is<00:01:41.530> what<00:01:42.530> happened<00:01:42.860> to<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.010> other<00:01:43.160> 13<00:01:43.580> gig

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
is what happened to the other 13 gig

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.670 
is what happened to the other 13 gig
that's<00:01:44.030> supposed<00:01:44.240> to<00:01:44.360> be<00:01:44.390> on<00:01:44.570> my<00:01:44.600> C<00:01:44.930> Drive<00:01:44.960> or

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
that's supposed to be on my C Drive or

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.610 
that's supposed to be on my C Drive or
did<00:01:45.860> it<00:01:45.980> go<00:01:46.160> because<00:01:46.700> I<00:01:46.910> want<00:01:47.390> to<00:01:47.480> want<00:01:48.290> to<00:01:48.380> move

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
did it go because I want to want to move

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.380 
did it go because I want to want to move
my<00:01:49.250> old<00:01:49.760> XP<00:01:50.210> computer<00:01:51.400> data<00:01:52.400> on<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:53.180> this

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
my old XP computer data on to this

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.190 
my old XP computer data on to this
larger<00:01:53.990> hard<00:01:54.380> drive<00:01:54.650> but<00:01:55.070> in<00:01:55.280> actuality<00:01:55.700> it's

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
larger hard drive but in actuality it's

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.710 
larger hard drive but in actuality it's
actually<00:01:57.200> smaller<00:01:57.470> so<00:01:57.920> i<00:01:58.850> mean<00:01:59.510> i<00:01:59.600> would

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
actually smaller so i mean i would

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.300 
actually smaller so i mean i would
expect<00:01:59.990> these<00:02:00.350> big<00:02:00.590> things<00:02:00.619> here<00:02:01.070> is<00:02:01.160> the

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
expect these big things here is the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.870 
expect these big things here is the
paging<00:02:01.729> file<00:02:01.970> and<00:02:02.300> the<00:02:02.570> hibernation<00:02:02.990> file<00:02:03.880> so

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
paging file and the hibernation file so

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.790 
paging file and the hibernation file so
that<00:02:04.910> that's<00:02:05.570> understandable<00:02:06.290> that<00:02:06.590> those

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
that that's understandable that those

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.620 
that that's understandable that those
would<00:02:06.950> take<00:02:07.250> up<00:02:07.400> that<00:02:07.430> much<00:02:07.610> space<00:02:07.790> i<00:02:08.390> just

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
would take up that much space i just

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.010 
would take up that much space i just
don't<00:02:08.810> know

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.830

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
where the other 13 gig is I mean 13 gigs

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.710 
where the other 13 gig is I mean 13 gigs
a<00:02:14.050> lot<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.350> information<00:02:14.920> that's<00:02:15.010> basically

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
a lot of information that's basically
