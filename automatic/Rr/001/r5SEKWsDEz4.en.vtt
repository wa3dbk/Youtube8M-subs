00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
like many things on automobiles brake

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.410 
like many things on automobiles brake
problems<00:00:11.070> aren't<00:00:11.400> always<00:00:11.670> what<00:00:11.969> they<00:00:12.240> appear

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
problems aren't always what they appear

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
you hit the brake pedal maybe in the

you hit the brake something shakes you

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.080 
you hit the brake something shakes you
automatically<00:00:23.010> think<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.580> have<00:00:23.789> a

automatically think that you have a

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.870 
automatically think that you have a
warped<00:00:24.600> brake<00:00:25.230> rotor<00:00:25.560> it's<00:00:25.830> no<00:00:26.010> longer<00:00:26.279> smooth

warped brake rotor it's no longer smooth
well<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.689> may<00:00:27.990> not<00:00:28.019> be<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.859> case<00:00:29.070> especially

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
well that may not be the case especially

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.820 
well that may not be the case especially
if<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.420> car<00:00:30.630> has<00:00:30.779> been<00:00:30.929> sitting<00:00:31.230> for<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> long

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
if the car has been sitting for a long

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.819 
if the car has been sitting for a long
period<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.489> time<00:00:32.700> what<00:00:33.540> happens<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.590> rotor

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
period of time what happens is the rotor

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.420 
period of time what happens is the rotor
rusts<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.640> then<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.600> one<00:00:36.870> spot<00:00:37.320> right<00:00:38.010> under

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
rusts and then in one spot right under

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.700 
rusts and then in one spot right under
the<00:00:38.579> pad<00:00:38.820> where<00:00:39.210> it's<00:00:39.390> been<00:00:39.629> sitting<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.440> have

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
the pad where it's been sitting you have

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.779 
the pad where it's been sitting you have
a<00:00:41.070> clean<00:00:41.640> spot<00:00:42.149> like<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.870> well<00:00:43.739> what<00:00:44.280> happens

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
a clean spot like this well what happens

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.029 
a clean spot like this well what happens
here<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.930> builds<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.500> little<00:00:46.770> bit<00:00:46.890> of

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
here is that this builds a little bit of

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.880 
here is that this builds a little bit of
an<00:00:47.129> edge<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.879> either<00:00:48.510> side<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.020> where<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.649> pad

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
an edge on either side of where the pad

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.950 
an edge on either side of where the pad
was<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.940> when<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.210> hit<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.480> brake

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
was and when you hit the brake

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.010 
was and when you hit the brake
that<00:00:52.199> edge<00:00:52.559> as<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.699> pad<00:00:54.000> goes<00:00:54.329> over<00:00:54.719> at<00:00:54.809> that

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
that edge as the pad goes over at that

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.560 
that edge as the pad goes over at that
edge<00:00:55.260> makes<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.309> pulsation<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.360> feel

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
edge makes the pulsation that you feel

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.680 
edge makes the pulsation that you feel
in<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.930> car<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.469> no<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.399> most<00:00:59.609> cases<00:00:59.789> driving

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
in the car and no in most cases driving

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.560 
in the car and no in most cases driving
it<00:01:00.840> will<00:01:01.050> not<00:01:01.410> make<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.949> go<00:01:02.160> away<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:03.270> how<00:01:03.510> do

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
it will not make it go away so how do

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.200 
it will not make it go away so how do
you<00:01:03.750> correct<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.320> well<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.549> start<00:01:05.939> out<00:01:06.150> by

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
you correct it well you start out by

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.020 
you correct it well you start out by
cleaning<00:01:07.049> all<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.950> rust<00:01:08.159> off<00:01:08.460> at<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.790> surface

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
cleaning all the rust off at the surface

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.350 
cleaning all the rust off at the surface
of<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.479> brake<00:01:09.930> rotor<00:01:10.460> using<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.549> grinder<00:01:12.090> such

brake hose on your car brake hoses have

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.420 
brake hose on your car brake hoses have
these<00:01:54.090> little<00:01:54.479> ridges<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:55.350> them<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.920> those

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
the full length of the hose if they're

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.920 
the full length of the hose if they're
twisted<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.790> one<00:02:03.030> that's<00:02:03.450> going<00:02:03.659> to

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
twisted like this one that's going to

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.649 
twisted like this one that's going to
stress<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.710> fabric<00:02:05.280> inside<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.060> hose<00:02:06.270> and

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
stress the fabric inside the hose and

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.869 
stress the fabric inside the hose and
eventually<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.770> hose<00:02:07.920> will<00:02:08.280> break<00:02:08.610> and

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
eventually the hose will break and

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.540 
eventually the hose will break and
you'll<00:02:09.030> have<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.239> brake<00:02:09.509> failure<00:02:09.920> all<00:02:10.920> right<00:02:11.039> in

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
this case it would be really easy

wrong all they have to do is to turn the
caliper<00:02:19.590> over<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.420> in<00:02:21.420> other<00:02:21.629> cases<00:02:21.989> it<00:02:22.319> might

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
caliper over and in other cases it might

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.880 
caliper over and in other cases it might
mean<00:02:22.829> removing<00:02:23.819> the<00:02:24.030> brake<00:02:24.329> hose<00:02:25.290> and

mean removing the brake hose and
straightening<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.519> out<00:02:26.640> but<00:02:27.510> once<00:02:27.750> you're

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
straightening it out but once you're

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.300 
straightening it out but once you're
done<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:29.040> lines<00:02:29.370> should<00:02:29.849> always<00:02:30.180> be

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
done the lines should always be

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.670 
done the lines should always be
absolutely<00:02:32.310> parallel<00:02:32.909> big<00:02:33.780> safety<00:02:34.409> feature
