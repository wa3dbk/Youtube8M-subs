00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
so again here I'm going to explain at

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.200 
so again here I'm going to explain at
the<00:00:05.609> manual<00:00:06.000> a<00:00:06.210> stick<00:00:07.189> transmission<00:00:08.189> see<00:00:08.910> here

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
the manual a stick transmission see here

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.450 
the manual a stick transmission see here
1<00:00:09.599> &amp;<00:00:09.929> 2<00:00:10.620> &amp;<00:00:10.980> 3<00:00:11.010> 4<00:00:11.370> &amp;<00:00:12.059> 5<00:00:12.410> so<00:00:13.410> totally<00:00:13.830> five<00:00:14.099> years

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 4 &amp; 5 so totally five years

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.410 
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 4 &amp; 5 so totally five years
and<00:00:14.730> then<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.330> reverse<00:00:15.949> so<00:00:16.949> when<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:17.970> do<00:00:18.150> the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
and then the reverse so when you do the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.510 
and then the reverse so when you do the
first<00:00:18.720> gear<00:00:19.080> then<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:19.890> need<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.130> press<00:00:20.340> the

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
first gear then you need to press the

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.720 
first gear then you need to press the
clutch<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.359> then<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.859> clutch<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.279> they<00:00:23.490> left

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
clutch and then the clutch in they left

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.890 
clutch and then the clutch in they left
a<00:00:23.939> lot<00:00:24.150> legs<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:25.170> need<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.640> pull<00:00:26.640> left<00:00:27.599> side

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
a lot legs so you need to pull left side

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.460 
a lot legs so you need to pull left side
and<00:00:28.230> then<00:00:28.830> push<00:00:29.310> up<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:30.300> that's<00:00:30.570> called<00:00:31.080> first

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
and then push up so that's called first

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.310 
and then push up so that's called first
gear<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.360> then<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.510> second<00:00:33.870> gear<00:00:34.050> will<00:00:34.290> be

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
gear and then the second gear will be

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.000 
gear and then the second gear will be
you<00:00:34.680> need<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.070> level<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.350> then<00:00:37.350> pull<00:00:37.680> left

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
you need to level it and then pull left

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.410 
you need to level it and then pull left
and<00:00:38.550> then<00:00:39.210> push<00:00:39.480> back<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:41.000> for<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.090> second

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
and then push back to for the second

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.680 
and then push back to for the second
gear<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.340> then<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.430> third<00:00:44.640> gear<00:00:44.910> vice<00:00:45.239> versa

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
gear and then the third gear vice versa

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.450 
gear and then the third gear vice versa
you<00:00:45.809> know<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.500> get<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.280> neutral

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
you know you have to get it in neutral

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.569 
you know you have to get it in neutral
and<00:00:47.969> then<00:00:48.780> place<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.649> middle<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.190> then<00:00:50.370> push

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
and then place the middle and then push

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.510 
and then place the middle and then push
up<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.510> will<00:00:51.690> be<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.899> third<00:00:52.079> gear<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:53.309> then

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
up that will be the third gear and then

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.029 
up that will be the third gear and then
come<00:00:53.789> back<00:00:53.820> again<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.539> then<00:00:54.989> push<00:00:55.199> back<00:00:55.230> right

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
come back again and then push back right

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.020 
come back again and then push back right
to<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.309> fourth<00:00:56.579> here<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.649> then<00:00:58.649> come<00:00:59.640> again

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
to the fourth here and then come again

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.709 
to the fourth here and then come again
the<00:01:00.239> neutral<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.930> then<00:01:01.530> push<00:01:02.280> right<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.969> then

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the neutral and then push right and then

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.920 
the neutral and then push right and then
push<00:01:03.989> up<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.589> will<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.159> fifth<00:01:05.549> again<00:01:05.930> and

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
push up that will be the fifth again and

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.510 
push up that will be the fifth again and
the<00:01:07.170> reverse<00:01:07.409> gear<00:01:07.710> will<00:01:07.979> be<00:01:08.010> there<00:01:08.340> always

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
the reverse gear will be there always

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.080 
the reverse gear will be there always
right<00:01:09.180> turn<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.810> then<00:01:10.710> push<00:01:11.010> back<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.939> will

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
right turn and then push back that will

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.139 
right turn and then push back that will
be<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.360> reverse

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.859 

so<00:01:16.009> this<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.189> little<00:01:17.399> tricky<00:01:17.880> but<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.179> will<00:01:18.689> be

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
so this is little tricky but I will be

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.719 
so this is little tricky but I will be
learned<00:01:19.109> when<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.859> when<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.219> get<00:01:20.399> the<00:01:20.520> chance

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
learned when you when you get the chance

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.980 
learned when you when you get the chance
to<00:01:21.000> get<00:01:21.179> the<00:01:21.299> manual<00:01:21.740> you<00:01:22.740> get<00:01:22.890> transmissions

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
to get the manual you get transmissions

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.490 
to get the manual you get transmissions
and<00:01:25.549> and<00:01:26.549> make<00:01:26.759> sure<00:01:26.969> that<00:01:27.179> when<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.569> put<00:01:28.380> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
and and make sure that when you put the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.969 
and and make sure that when you put the
first<00:01:28.740> gear<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.369> then<00:01:29.609> you<00:01:29.729> need<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.590> are<00:01:31.590> p.m.

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
first gear and then you need to are p.m.

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.800 
first gear and then you need to are p.m.
level

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
level

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.529 
level
it's<00:01:34.200> supposed<00:01:34.679> to<00:01:34.799> be<00:01:34.979> level<00:01:35.459> three<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.390> know

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
it's supposed to be level three you know

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.919 
it's supposed to be level three you know
any<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.840> them<00:01:37.250> releasing<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.429> gas<00:01:38.810> then<00:01:39.810> you

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
any of them releasing the gas then you

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:41.630 
any of them releasing the gas then you
an<00:01:40.049> RPM<00:01:40.409> level<00:01:40.679> supposed<00:01:41.039> to<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.250> three<00:01:41.429> that

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
an RPM level supposed to be three that

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.819 
an RPM level supposed to be three that
way<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.060> car<00:01:42.299> will<00:01:42.569> be<00:01:42.719> move<00:01:42.959> very<00:01:43.439> smoothly

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
way the car will be move very smoothly

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.160 
way the car will be move very smoothly
and<00:01:45.709> when<00:01:46.709> when<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.689> mileage<00:01:48.689> if<00:01:48.899> it's

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
and when when the mileage if it's

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.880 
and when when the mileage if it's
supposed<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.829> cause<00:01:50.099> zero<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.079> 20<00:01:52.079> then<00:01:52.739> you

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
supposed is cause zero to 20 then you

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.010 
supposed is cause zero to 20 then you
need<00:01:53.069> to<00:01:53.250> change<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.819> transmission<00:01:55.670> and<00:01:57.020> when

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
need to change the transmission and when

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.109 
need to change the transmission and when
it<00:01:58.140> goes<00:01:58.349> up<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.799> thirty<00:01:59.099> then<00:01:59.489> your

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
it goes up to thirty then your

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.490 
it goes up to thirty then your
transmission<00:02:00.719> should<00:02:00.869> be<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.289> third

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
transmission should be in the third

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.219 
transmission should be in the third
third<00:02:02.009> do<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.399> love<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.869> and<00:02:03.869> then<00:02:04.020> if<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.200> is

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
third do you love it and then if it is

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.719 
third do you love it and then if it is
40<00:02:04.799> then<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.700> can<00:02:05.939> be<00:02:06.119> third<00:02:06.750> or<00:02:07.079> four<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.829> if

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
40 then it can be third or four and if

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.319 
40 then it can be third or four and if
you<00:02:08.849> go<00:02:09.090> beyond<00:02:09.509> 40<00:02:10.049> then<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.470> should<00:02:10.649> be<00:02:10.829> like

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:11.329 
you go beyond 40 then it should be like

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.660 
you go beyond 40 then it should be like
fifty<00:02:12.329> year<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:13.319> that<00:02:13.500> that's<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.280> way<00:02:14.400> the

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
fifty year so that that's the way the

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.860 
fifty year so that that's the way the
car<00:02:15.000> will<00:02:15.209> be<00:02:15.390> smooth<00:02:18.650> so<00:02:19.650> let's<00:02:20.519> let's<00:02:20.940> give<00:02:21.840> a

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
car will be smooth so let's let's give a

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.130 
car will be smooth so let's let's give a
try<00:02:22.200> okay
