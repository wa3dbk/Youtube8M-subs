00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.209
 yes, I'm still in the pot stand with 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.360
 the stefan and shows us now 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:14.429
 a few new hardware parts has more 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.420
 stand anyway I shoot 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:22.470
 that's why it's the topic 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.289
 As you know, this summer has threatened 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.660
 pro and mac npd in cobra machine and 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.550
 the pending now is all really 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.369
 always what i have always proven to be 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.470
 erhard drives the really euro 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.470
 fit but now fit to the 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.650
 stars very exclusive also priced 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.030
 Of course, more settled up there 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.860
 matching hardware and I'll show you 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.080
 now a few features to the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.720
 single new statues we catch 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.310
 Here it is and it is the normal one 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.770
 pool I always stand a bit 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:56.160
 down here to show 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.040
 here is this normal plastic 1 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.550
 put the rods as smooth 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.040
 slide everything into each other with memory lok 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.100
 and it kept the connection then a 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.350
 very big are metal on metal without 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.710
 of course to confirm it 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.630
 it will be her sleep is really 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.150
 extremely tight because it is not metal too 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.360
 plastic what can always twist 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.820
 and it's almost as much of the metal 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.260
 holds metal and that's it really 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.860
 coming down the holder is here 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.860
 for example 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.579
 of course also steplessly too 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.390
 adjust 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:39.280
 where the special on the variant can 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.320
 of course, adjust the angle 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.360
 You know that from every tank 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.140
 stand you can twist the arm but 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.090
 You can do it now without that 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.979
 people have to write something down if 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.360
 something with memory loks set 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.960
 is further even if you strike too 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.060
 plays again makes it a bit 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.830
 to have quasi has the headroom 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.049
 are three movements with a screw 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.909
 is also a big happy screw 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:08.190
 and team is stuck with one hand 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.190
 and is almost on top of the head as well 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.100
 infinitely adjustable are eight 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.170
 different metal plates there 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.980
 against each other thus in itself attack 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.500
 I do not really have it either 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.720
 understood how exactly it works but it 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.500
 works is very good that the 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.400
 main thing 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.390
 and there is also a small but fine 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.750
 help settings that myself am the 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.760
 microphone is wrong and drums arrive 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.100
 and think the basin is misetic with two 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.470
 centimeters too close or too far away 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.780
 then it starts the banks cover states 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.250
 to move or in the cold English 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.750
 magic lands 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.600
 You can save that with the 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.410
 hardware because the red still this 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.810
 leeway and can virtually the 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.360
 Replace the fine adjustment behind the set 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.190
 must make 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.860
 25 microphone stands and cymbal stand 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.720
 put away that one actually to 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.300
 Different tripod actually found 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.420
 then there is a little detail left 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.160
 basin 14 9 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.470
 that was a very small bearing surface 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.130
 what the vibration behavior and 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.430
 optimizing the damping behavior of the restraint 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.000
 should 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.700
 walter small detail solution the the 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.709
 quick lock therefore wants to know the march 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.690
 extended but also standard in the 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.690
 series always on here 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.859
 which is quasi the combination stands by 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.969
 keep basin 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.829
 there is one more now 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:42.159
 additional variant not only 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:44.290
 This very flexible ball joint 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:47.500
 what fontana me already decades 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.870
 we know that has proven itself 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.920
 also some copied but also the 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.349
 option the whole from the angle to 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.579
 change 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.829
 there are still these poses 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.480
 functions that means you can 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.810
 complete stalls even at an angle 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.879
 but there are also already longer 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.109
 usually in a double circumstances 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.950
 I have remembered it already 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.769
 before 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.540
 There were times it was out of the program 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.720
 taken because it is very expensive but 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.570
 the hardware also priced something about 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.519
 the red of course settled and it 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.009
 is now offered in the series so 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.840
 advised in normal and walk peck 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:29.259
 stand but not in the combination 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:34.419
 stand and at the tom stands it is 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:35.820
 now almost including so much more 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.280
 Now of course there 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.150
 normal double circumstances with too 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:46.170
 malfunction also the 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:47.850
 Adjustments here so you have 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:52.680
 really many options is so 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:55.560
 also set up the whole comfortable 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.720
 and accordingly quickly do that 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.370
 It happens quickly then there is 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.370
 19 manufacturers still exist here below 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.259
 there are a few more things now 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:10.650
 basically, one can talk about it 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:15.539
 the eyepatch that works 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:18.389
 just say so for different sized ones 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.979
 he can just be what you want 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.840
 basically is permanent power but 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:24.509
 when one or two games after 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:28.080
 according to the size it is part 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:30.750
 just open up what they once did 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:35.219
 turn around again and thus 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:36.810
 The angle changes here and I can 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:39.029
 now make the small of the deer need 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.560
 of course it is here she still gives the 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:43.969
 Adjustment and is more 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:48.120
 Of course, adjust the appropriate size 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:50.819
 what I'm good at something so essential 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:54.029
 in the system this this normal 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:55.500
 These normal basketballers trier at 

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:57.689
 snell stalls gives away 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.849
 by the technique now here 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:03.000
 is applied and it has the big one 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:05.580
 advantage that nickel place sports the 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.779
 Baske then enjoy these angles high 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.919
 to screw from below 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:12.419
 of course that has about 15 centimeters 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:16.020
 Totally away that completely falls away 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:18.569
 we also have joints here like almost 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:24.150
 all tamara so you can in 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:27.270
 adjust the angle infinitely and what 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.770
 the whole course has the advantage 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.060
 you notice if you for example a 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:34.460
 then he can play eight inches deep 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.020
 the state of so far down 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.580
 I really like to post 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.050
 anyone can play in front of comfortable 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:43.949
 the usual sitting position is not 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:46.199
 has to change and that is a whole 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:49.349
 substantial advantage because yes, too 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:52.589
 trend again rather to the deep 

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:54.839
 only eight o'clock is going to like it 

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:56.189
 once again taken exactly and so 

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:57.720
 for this is the city that is 

00:06:56.189 --> 00:07:01.340
 Perfect 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.340
 in addition 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.810
 you can already see all these 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:09.650
 statistics because the feet looks a 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:11.660
 big pad it's all very much 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.479
 solidly built and for the right ones 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:17.060
 specialists who slips everything away 

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:18.770
 there are still the spikes that can 

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:21.919
 you always like in the in the 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.540
 wooden floors of jazz clubs frame 

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:26.540
 since the organizers are pleased 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.639
 especially on carpet of course 

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.990
 It works perfectly as he works around 

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:33.169
 avoid slipping 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:36.110
 this part really looks like me 

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:40.729
 find very successful memory lures you 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:41.870
 Of course, everywhere and a very 

00:07:40.729 --> 00:07:44.240
 solid w 

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:49.780
 the whole is there has the series really 

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.780
 he rather massively shows what kind of people are on 

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:55.130
 attach importance to stability and of course 

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:58.370
 the technique of the ideas here I find 

00:07:55.130 --> 00:08:02.600
 has thus really something great 

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:03.979
 come up with that was as far as 

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.919
 I find very cool hardware 

00:08:03.979 --> 00:08:08.990
 nice stable cool features that's it 

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:12.820
 I also stood by the topic so far 

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.820
 Thank you says thank you and see you soon
