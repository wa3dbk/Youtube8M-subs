00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 past time 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.110
 then I will see it grow out 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.229
 dzw matches completely true 

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:09.100
 track 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.969
 worry 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.969
 that rather also appreciate sound such language 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.730
 but those lazy are big and you only have that exciting 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.130
 and it appears this is very small 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.909
 that may make 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:31.079
 it will still look slower very quickly 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.400
 to begin 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.490
 you have to place such a typically the most exciting place 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.960
 there was use as you see 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.960
 clasie has got the coffin in spain 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.770
 etc then I also grabbed a defeat 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.610
 to yes sorry pete 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.020
 as soon as it complains because of course do not want 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.320
 if you can see each other that does 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.000
 so you do is 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.750
 to make beautiful or vice versa is not speaking 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.479
 e 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.250
 is that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.530
 the and 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.530
 the clothing 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.690
 that's not a few either 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:10.969
 this is really very fast with the broadcaster 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.969
 the for schools once on the Dutch one 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.969
 and this time 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.159
 get peacock at the biltse dunes 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.889
 on 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.459
 it became that too 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:54.599
 8 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.789
 the cards also have a nice finish 8 

00:02:57.789 --> 00:03:00.289
 akersloot that was it too 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:01.230
 small but not 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.769
 9 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.769
 batibouw indicates such a tool does not work the client 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.519
 well this is an idiot 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.419
 so much so that we have 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:16.310
 that writing hunt is not everything also to do with being totally postponed 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:19.489
