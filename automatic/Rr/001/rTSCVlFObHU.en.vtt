calm in this video I'm going to show you

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.320 
calm in this video I'm going to show you
how<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.349> tie<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.650> perfection<00:00:14.400> loop<00:00:14.580> it's<00:00:15.179> a

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
how to tie the perfection loop it's a

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.950 
how to tie the perfection loop it's a
very<00:00:15.540> nice<00:00:15.719> little<00:00:16.230> loop<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.710> know<00:00:16.859> how<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.160> tie

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
very nice little loop to know how to tie

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.050 
very nice little loop to know how to tie
you<00:00:18.960> said<00:00:19.230> at<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.500> end<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.520> leader<00:00:20.760> if

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
you said at the end of a leader if

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.470 
you said at the end of a leader if
you're<00:00:21.180> fly-fishing<00:00:21.810> or<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.710> can<00:00:22.859> use<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.480> for

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
you're fly-fishing or you can use it for

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.740 
you're fly-fishing or you can use it for
sinkers<00:00:25.109> if<00:00:25.410> you're<00:00:25.590> bait<00:00:25.800> fishing<00:00:26.449> yeah<00:00:27.449> any

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
sinkers if you're bait fishing yeah any

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.359 
sinkers if you're bait fishing yeah any
purpose<00:00:28.140> where<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.380> where<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:28.890> need<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.130> loop

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
purpose where you where you need a loop

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.299 
purpose where you where you need a loop
and<00:00:29.550> then<00:00:30.619> here's<00:00:31.619> how<00:00:31.980> you're<00:00:32.579> tied<00:00:34.250> okay<00:00:35.250> you

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
and then here's how you're tied okay you

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.970 
and then here's how you're tied okay you
start<00:00:35.700> out<00:00:35.880> by<00:00:35.910> making<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:37.469> loop

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
start out by making a loop

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.959 
start out by making a loop
you'll<00:00:38.940> take<00:00:39.300> below<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.739> main<00:00:40.950> line<00:00:41.219> like<00:00:41.730> so

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
you'll take below the main line like so

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.209 
you'll take below the main line like so
and<00:00:42.840> we'll<00:00:43.200> make<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.379> loop<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.890> bit<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> little

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
and we'll make that loop a bit a little

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.130 
and we'll make that loop a bit a little
bit<00:00:44.460> smaller<00:00:46.100> like<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.579> then<00:00:48.149> for<00:00:49.050> this

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
bit smaller like so and then for this

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.189 
bit smaller like so and then for this
night<00:00:49.350> hold<00:00:49.649> on<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:50.910> loop<00:00:51.180> with<00:00:52.079> your

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
night hold on to to this loop with your

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.560 
night hold on to to this loop with your
fingers<00:00:52.559> here<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.239> that'll<00:00:54.239> make<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.449> easy

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
fingers here and that'll make it easy

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.900 
fingers here and that'll make it easy
for<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.870> control<00:00:55.379> what's<00:00:55.559> going<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:56.010> now

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
for you to control what's going on now

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.450 
for you to control what's going on now
take<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.360> end<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.809> line<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.320> put<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.280> over

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
take the end of the line and put it over

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.229 
take the end of the line and put it over
the<00:01:00.000> loop<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.539> just<00:01:00.570> made<00:01:01.460> like<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.760> it's

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
the loop that you just made like so it's

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.500 
the loop that you just made like so it's
coming<00:01:03.510> over<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.260> loop<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.559> just<00:01:04.589> made<00:01:05.010> and

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
coming over the loop you just made and

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.890 
coming over the loop you just made and
now<00:01:06.530> change<00:01:07.530> hands<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.280> take<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.150> below<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
now change hands and take it below the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.020 
now change hands and take it below the
main<00:01:10.110> line<00:01:10.430> so<00:01:11.430> now<00:01:11.610> you'll<00:01:11.790> have<00:01:11.970> something

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
main line so now you'll have something

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.710 
main line so now you'll have something
like<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:13.159> and<00:01:14.159> you'll<00:01:14.880> basically<00:01:15.119> have<00:01:15.390> two

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
like this and you'll basically have two

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.840 
like this and you'll basically have two
loops<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.290> now<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.100> hold<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.520> here<00:01:19.850> this

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
loops and now you can hold on here this

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.469 
loops and now you can hold on here this
Junction<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.619> now<00:01:22.619> let<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.119> end<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.299> line

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
Junction and now let the end of the line

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.890 
Junction and now let the end of the line
go<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:24.990> between<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.770> two<00:01:26.189> loops<00:01:26.600> it's<00:01:27.600> coming

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
go in between the two loops it's coming

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.539 
go in between the two loops it's coming
here<00:01:28.110> from<00:01:28.290> below<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.770> going<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.130> between<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
here from below and going in between the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.460 
here from below and going in between the
two<00:01:29.880> loops<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:31.670> with<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:32.970> place<00:01:33.290> you<00:01:34.290> can

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
two loops and with that in place you can

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.520 
two loops and with that in place you can
take<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:35.040> loop<00:01:35.820> above<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.450> put<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.259> through

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
take the loop above and put it through

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.830 
take the loop above and put it through
the<00:01:38.159> loop<00:01:38.189> below<00:01:39.229> like<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:41.509> now<00:01:42.509> all<00:01:42.689> you

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
the loop below like so and now all you

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.889 
the loop below like so and now all you
got<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.110> do<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.500> pull<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.430> loop<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.659> main

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
got to do is pull the loop and the main

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.639 
got to do is pull the loop and the main
line<00:01:46.549> like<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.170> push<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.350> end<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
line like so and push the end of the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.580 
line like so and push the end of the
line<00:01:49.829> pull<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.340> end<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.640> line<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.820> bit<00:01:51.060> and

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
line pull the end of the line a bit and

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.370 
line pull the end of the line a bit and
now<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.649> have<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.549> perfection<00:01:53.880> loop<00:01:54.380> of

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
now you have the perfection loop of

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.139 
now you have the perfection loop of
course<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.680> got<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.860> trim<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.549> cut<00:01:57.119> the

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
course you got to trim it and cut the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.700 
course you got to trim it and cut the
line<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.810> off<00:01:59.000> that's<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.560> remember<00:02:01.560> that

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
line and off that's it and remember that

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.800 
line and off that's it and remember that
there<00:02:01.890> are<00:02:02.070> more<00:02:02.399> instruction<00:02:03.149> videos<00:02:03.479> at
