00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 the more you ride the more 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.690
 experience will accumulate it inevitably with 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.660
 outdoor time 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.660
 I am Ilya and today we will talk about Katya 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.720
 for a start it is worth finding out what 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.970
 such a roll forward is a condition affecting 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.400
 bike movement is important to remember that 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.769
 roll forward cannot be measured it can only 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.929
 feel and even then only with experience 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.600
 lovers will appreciate the roll 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.380
 resets from cheap bike to the road 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.329
 and so on what depends the roll 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.210
 feel the knurled frame is very difficult 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.489
 Differences are noticeable only for very expensive 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.160
 models but on a regular bike reel 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.190
 frame plays the smallest role and yet 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.500
 the frame is not affected by the materials 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.210
 and making the bigger the wheel 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.520
 better roll as minor irregularities 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.199
 just not noticed the best 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.270
 29 inches wheels 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.460
 tire pattern than more aggressive 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.830
 tread pattern so much the run 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.080
 if you haven't watched it in this issue 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.510
 You can learn what the tire consists of 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.340
 and in this issue in detail about the figure 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.799
 tread tire width than she already 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.750
 the smaller the contact patch on this also 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.000
 affect the pressure in the chambers here 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.100
 there is a direct connection than less 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.100
 pressure the greater the deformation of the tire 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.729
 on every tire even the cheapest 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.170
 Chinese 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.689
 always indicated recommended 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.740
 pressure range is written in numbers and 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.990
 letters on the side chassis time 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.420
 lubricate all moving parts than 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.160
 fewer parts rub against each other in order 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.570
 better your iron horse rides 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.420
 depreciation when it works 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.850
 irregularities swallow ca slowing down movement to 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.540
 the same during pedaling 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.120
 swinging occurs 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.340
 and part of the effective efficiency is simply lost 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.710
 most affect nanocad back 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.720
 suspension at dvuhpodvesa slightly smaller 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.240
 degrees front fork on models 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.160
 medium and high price category 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.680
 blocking stroke which allows 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.420
 level out the rollback also on how 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.170
 spoils cushioning seatpost 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.220
 pin 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.080
 which by the way does not have a lock 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.120
 aerodynamics at speeds of twenty 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.130
 five kilometers per hour by bike and 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.840
 cyclists begin to act in 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.670
 air drag 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.160
 slowing on as with a head wind 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.320
 impact threshold shifts to 10 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.209
 kilometers an hour it depends on the landing 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.290
 cyclist and optional mounted 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.920
 components for example wings or bags 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.410
 total mass 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.900
 This is especially noticeable during the ascent and 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.970
 acceleration the heavier the bike with the worse 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.580
 roll forward but if you summarize it all in 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.709
 a few phrases then light bike with 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.470
 large wheel diameter narrow tire 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.690
 and the minimum tread pattern will be 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.750
 to have the best roll forward 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.380
 from June 2014 our video blog will be 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.870
 go out steadily three times a month 5 15 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.920
 and on the 25th we will try to release 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.920
 him more often 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.290
 and you can help us in this but for now 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.360
 subscribe to the channel and put likes 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.360
 with you Ilya was bye bye
