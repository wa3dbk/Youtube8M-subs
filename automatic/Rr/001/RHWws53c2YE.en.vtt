00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:08.400
 hello everyone let's start this 

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:11.950
 videotutorial about the airbus 350 of the 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.200
 flight factor we have it here 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.200
 and for that we are going to make a flight from 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:21.840
 the famous Juliana Princess airport 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:25.250
 princess juliana airports we have it 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.250
 we can see it here for him 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.440
 from princess juliana to the 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.800
 Simon Bolivar International Airport 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.600
 of maiquetÃ­a in venezuela 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.820
 one of the reasons why he decided 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.520
 do this video tutorial is that those who 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.000
 appear from this simulator plane x 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.460
 planet 10 are in English and it is always 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.480
 needed some in Spanish 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:55.250
 and that's why I was motivated and we started 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.720
 one of the facilities that this 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.329
 plane is that you have a checklist 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.660
 that is guiding us through the whole operation 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.550
 of the aircraft is a trick that I've 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.909
 discovered that he did not know about 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.729
 simulator explana 10 is that if we squeeze 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.479
 the control key and some number of the 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.950
 keyboard on the numbers keyboard we step on 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.630
 control let's stepped on the number and 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.130
 we configure some of the visions 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.430
 like for example I have some for 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.340
 here some visions here 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.080
 and good control the number pressed and 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.060
 the view is already configured 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.650
 we want it to be either from here or 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.590
 including I have configured 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.780
 from a window that gives us the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.390
 ease to have some some 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.150
 views of the simulator for greater 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.040
 ease well the first thing that 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.310
 we do is go to the top panel and 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.670
 we extend here this battery button and 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.800
 with it we are already ignited some 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.470
 monitors and then we have in this plan 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.330
 it's some basic configurations 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.140
 here we have the basic configurations 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.140
 of the airplane 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.150
 you can not place your taste here we have 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.500
 to work with the mouse wheel I 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.720
 I have her who is why she makes me 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.060
 to modify simply by rotating the 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.490
 Mouse wheel Modify I can 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.990
 set up only added to place 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.610
 click where it has to click 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.560
 to manipulate it to me it seems 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:25.040
 easier here we have this the wheel is 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.140
 the new version brings support on xf 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.250
 more I have it in itself and after this one 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.250
 what security configures 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.270
 the first thing once the plane is on is 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.190
 go some service and equipment and here 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.590
 we put we are going to put the vision from 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.620
 outside the different elements that 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.880
 we consider the equipment first 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.020
 ground current 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.020
 the stairs 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:58.290
 fuel passenger cars 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.940
 load air conditioning all 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.319
 ground elements 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.520
 if you want to scale crazy edition 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:07.880
 selection here but I do not use 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.350
 then we proceed to open the doors 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.020
 of cargo that are these 2 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.930
 on that side and the passenger doors 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.430
 which are here if we do not open the 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.650
 part of passengers we do not have this 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.560
 configuration the aircraft is not going to 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.780
 set for refueling 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.960
 and well we do it once we leave 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.350
 to each passenger aircraft us well 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.060
 we could manually configure 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.190
 placing here or placing here we have 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.060
 a light and medium weight version 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.790
 or placing in the medium watches 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.000
 I will implement them and I will 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.200
 they load the passengers just like the 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.319
 I can place fuel here 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.930
 or placed it in this medium case what 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.960
 place in the values to implement and 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.110
 already proceeds to load 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.870
 what they are 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.870
 passengers and fuel
