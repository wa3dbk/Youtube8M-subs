00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.710
 play off fever at the kassel huskies 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.210
 on thursday rises in the kasseler 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.069
 ice rink the first of five 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.380
 possible semi-finals against the 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.540
 Oberliga rival from Frankfurt it works 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.880
 to climb into the second league more 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.379
 as 4000 cards are already sold fans 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.690
 players and coaches look forward to 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.910
 exciting duels 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.680
 it is the game in mainz that all 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.360
 desired that it comes in the final but 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.710
 now is semi-final it is important that 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.090
 we get ahead because we want to go into 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.450
 final we want to be first and 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.820
 so when our special care 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.170
 preparing for the hessen derby is good 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.940
 that we have many kasseler guys in the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.830
 have team that is specially for 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.570
 derby very important to play for 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.400
 kassel and i do not think frankfurter 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.100
 the only ones we have the advantage 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.600
 play at home at home 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.400
 That may also be a disadvantage 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.110
 I see it as an advantage because we 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.010
 many spectators in the stadium have us 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.480
 whip it forward 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.500
 if it does not work out like that, but 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:00.080
 Ultimately, how crucial will be 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.699
 and where with what pressure the team 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.500
 we can cope better 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.180
 surely the current play will be off 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.400
 mood I think was the opponent is 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.770
 us at eye level 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.300
 we have to give everything to win 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.010
 therefore it does you and of course 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.690
 Much more interesting I do not care about my seat 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.850
 whether in the finals run or now 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.680
 that they come with us I believe everyone 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.330
 somehow aware because I think that 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.630
 so with us the best team in 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.410
 All of Germany is in the top league 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.070
 but we are ready to fight 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.990
 to accept 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.190
 what distinguishes playoffs from the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.630
 normal season the previous ones 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.310
 clashes against frankfurt were 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.720
 everything brief affairs 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.210
 do you think we're up to the playoffs 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.170
 also be the case or will that be one 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.450
 completely different series 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.950
 So yes, it is each game were 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.330
 effect at zero on very clear so now 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.650
 Decide only small things so 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.780
 Now the days are coming 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.520
 daily form on it and every game can 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.000
 can be completely different like that 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.800
 previous 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.540
 why are you beating frankfurt and 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.730
 wiesbaden frankfurt because we are high 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.630
 are motivated and because we are natural 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:00.480
 for the sake of the final goal 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.010
 come and be sure all are doing 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.680
 in Kassel, of course against Frankfurt 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.960
 Hopefully the hall is up 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.090
 Full up and years you could it 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.470
 motivates up to the hair tips there 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.019
 Do you still come up with little things? 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.959
 you really have to be very focused 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.459
 and try everything in the 60 minutes 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.230
 hide and only on time 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.760
 played to concentrate as we did 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.890
 actually winning is in the end 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.620
 No matter why three wins 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.930
 we have to play our game in a disciplined way 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.910
 play and there you have to look what's on 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.970
 comes out 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:36.560
 how important is a good goalkeeper me 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.210
 guess if every shot a hit 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.390
 is then loses quickly 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.860
 so I think that's a tor 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.440
 important as important as the storms 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.540
 are about to shoot 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.960
 and yes I think both can play 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.730
 decide 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.530
 next to her is a defender and 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:58.580
 one of frankfurt very good 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:03:00.140
 knows with emotions with fighting spirit and 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.940
 with the bigger sake 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.530
 who does not now hot like now the 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.280
 play now wants to show this best 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.590
 want 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.780
 he is a wrong it is in the 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.310
 Playoffs already in the semi-final 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.440
 if it is probably the most 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.480
 probably like to finish first 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.030
 but unfortunately have the frankfurter 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.140
 every time only the second place made 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.690
 and we have the advantage there 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.690
 with the homeland right and still use 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.190
 celebrate the final move
