00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.440
 in conclusion 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.430
 then the great hans is the last e 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.890
 unleashes north kraft that will be presented 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.019
 this year and that we will find in stores in 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.899
 all the skis but in the shop is a classic 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:44.570
 floating bass stick that was 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.350
 made from the north kraft in two 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.920
 measures 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:53.379
 a 130 mm x 37 gram weight is 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:58.640
 another the 180 mm x 80 grams of weight 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:01:00.260
 the 130 mm size is a measure that can 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.629
 be used for most of the 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.519
 predators that hunt on the surface or 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.200
 below the water surface in the 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.259
 our waters therefore starting from 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.500
 Bluefish barracuda up to 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:15.259
 get to the amberjacks but also to the tones 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.750
 other tunnidi in the absence and another that 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:21.320
 throws well with a cane from a non 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.350
 there is half and like the older brother 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.240
 is a floating bass stick that is 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.150
 very durable as it is provided 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.630
 of a closed internal steel reinforcement 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.700
 stainless steel and which can normally be reinforced 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.960
 both with single konami anchors 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:42.729
 as in this case while the measure more 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.469
 great is a bait that has been designed 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.240
 deliberately for what the predator 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.850
 prince of our waters or the 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.389
 bluefin tuna in fact has a size 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.090
 decidedly large 180 mm 18 cm for a 

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:59.329
 weight of 80 grams therefore also requires 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.789
 an equipment do it of cannes and di 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.190
 reel capable of being able to move it 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.540
 adequately 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.580
 this is also a very robust bait 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.040
 as you can see it is always provided with 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.140
 Closed reinforcement can be 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.920
 also this one armed with a treble hook or 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.400
 konami singles for clearly being 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.930
 destined for our waters 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.690
 mainly to the red throne yes for 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.730
 trichet it is preferable to arm it with weapons 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.650
 singles just to facilitate the 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.370
 elisa catcher of this species which like 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.670
 we know is is mandatory in most 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.960
 part of the year 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.220
 also this bait can be 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.200
 clearly used for all 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.480
 tropical predators who love to hunt a 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.740
 then we start from the giant rivals 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.740
 until you get roster fish 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.090
 in addition to the very long launch the gand al 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.920
 suffers a series of swimming combined between 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.230
 surface movements and swimming in 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.330
 dipping under the water surface the 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.770
 gand hans is a plastic motorcycle lure is one 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.540
 floating stick betis and therefore can 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.790
 be used in different ways can 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.650
 be used with a swim with a 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.480
 very fast and messy recovery 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.850
 thus limiting almost a skipping 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.550
 the USSR can therefore be used with 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.650
 a recovery at which close with a 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.220
 typical action that goes below the surface 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.440
 water 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.870
 or with long hunts and that 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.160
 therefore give a gait e 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.380
 classic to art 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.880
 below the surface of the water are 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.380
 types of swimming that can be 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.090
 alternating depending on the predators that 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.730
 let's go to undermine then that they hunt 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.319
 more or less its fast or presented 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.720
 a little slower 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.519
 or even simply alternate in the 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.470
 course of the catch just to vary 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.900
 the presentation of our bait 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.450
 thus inducing predators to attack 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.910
 the different moments of their activity 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.290
 so when I'm frenzied maybe 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.269
 with an action a little faster when 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.220
 they are a bit more apathetic with one 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.220
 slightly slower presentation
