00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.590
 the telecom so the market featured the Nicolas field cock of 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.509
 Kickers Offenbach has been determined 4 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:14.509
 I like that 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:17.220
 this is my dream 11 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.539
 standing in the gate 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.539
 Nico Pellatz 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.050
 so take in Bremen played back 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.300
 to go 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.300
 and I have a lot of rooms since Dam » 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.470
 the longest back was certainly with Andersen playing and also in Bremen 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.060
 played together 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.060
 Percent super type can be used both in the 2 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.390
 and he always plays for Bremen 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.480
 and but after contact 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.710
 in the middle then 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.350
 Percent of the four-chain Florian Eck 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.220
 is now playing with Regensburg I have with the 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.170
 Percent in youth at Haching playing together 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.810
 with the toe break has come too 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:00.960
 Besides 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.610
 Alexander Hesse 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.760
 also played teams together in Bremen 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.280
 and also has a lot of fun with him then a legal obligation 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.280
 Bobby Möhler 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.720
 he plays the percent again 0 I have the one played out long 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.940
 Right track in case of theft 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.130
 percent 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.800
 and so Pirker 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.860
 in the left midfield approved 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.980
 that I'm gonna gamble 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.330
 because played together in the youth 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.830
 at Unterhaching 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.700
 Percent Super tasty and light midfield blessing is he could for me 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.650
 also 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.690
 then I could play with the games 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:39.790
 Haas 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.850
 even with me because Offenbach plays together 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.400
 around 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.530
 logically with the man contact 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.340
 Company percent Kevin Artmann percent super left-foot Zuber standards 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.130
 and you can make fun by bus example 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.920
 right is then percent 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.200
 the only one the prominent leaders speak with evil 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.220
 I once played the one he plays one of ours 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.509
 Amateurs against professionals to football public Schalke sure to do so 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.509
 that's why it could do that for me 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.649
 especially in the storm with two peaks 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:14.659
 Thorsten l 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.939
 last played from Burg at that time in Brehms 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:22.420
 Made gold and 17 boys but fun to play with him because 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:25.419
 Robert Lechleiter also did the same with André Pohl 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.069
 the game now 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.409
 Aalen I gave OT interaction in Hachen and he was 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.409
 Always dangerous - because it was fun to play with him 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.389
 this is on 11 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.509
 dealing with MeeGo world situation, he still battles his team for the Manta 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:50.999
 Rise in the second league get rid of Arjan 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:53.979
 Only one interesting team can all be developed that way 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:55.109
 makes 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:56.639
 Yes absolutely 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.239
 make it as you can see where he is about his playful but already one 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.680
 Bit perished and maybe it would be with this team then separate 

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:06.679
 apparently she has run better then would not have escalated so 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:10.729
 "He definitely doubted that example of Tim Wiese for them 

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:13.210
 Third League would do it but you do not know 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.070
 to also most interesting Steffen Haas Main current as fellow Linney 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.910
 but stands 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.209
 one in three women are already coming 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.079
 if Nadal will be a sympathetic troop thanks so much yes 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.659
 Of course, a nice thank you to the pop world and a whole wall 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.909
 was built and was goodbye until next time
