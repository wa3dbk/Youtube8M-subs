00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
interview the first light we're going to

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.880 
interview the first light we're going to
talk<00:00:38.999> about<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.449> our<00:00:39.929> key<00:00:40.230> light<00:00:40.409> that's

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
talk about is our key light that's

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.770 
talk about is our key light that's
generally<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.339> main<00:00:41.489> light<00:00:42.120> for<00:00:42.390> our<00:00:42.449> scene

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
generally the main light for our scene

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.059 
generally the main light for our scene
and<00:00:43.199> we're<00:00:43.319> going<00:00:43.499> to<00:00:43.559> use<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.920> as<00:00:44.039> a

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:44.069 
and we're going to use that as a

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:46.430 
and we're going to use that as a
reference<00:00:44.399> for<00:00:45.269> the<00:00:45.390> color<00:00:45.690> temperature<00:00:45.989> and

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
reference for the color temperature and

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.430 
reference for the color temperature and
intensity<00:00:47.219> as<00:00:47.460> we<00:00:47.699> set<00:00:47.909> our<00:00:48.059> other<00:00:48.300> lights<00:00:48.749> so

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
intensity as we set our other lights so

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.989 
intensity as we set our other lights so
generally<00:00:50.039> speaking<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.609> there<00:00:50.819> are<00:00:50.969> many

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:50.999 
generally speaking and there are many

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:53.270 
generally speaking and there are many
exceptions<00:00:51.379> but<00:00:52.379> if<00:00:52.469> our<00:00:52.559> key<00:00:52.890> light<00:00:53.129> is

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
exceptions but if our key light is

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.000 
exceptions but if our key light is

balanced 256 hundred Kelvin we're going

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.340

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
the focus on our subject as we're

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.600 
the focus on our subject as we're
choosing<00:01:12.870> our<00:01:13.110> key<00:01:13.380> light<00:01:13.590> one<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
choosing our key light one of the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.920 
choosing our key light one of the
biggest<00:01:14.820> things<00:01:15.090> we<00:01:15.180> want<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.420> keep<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.720> mind

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
biggest things we want to keep in mind

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.010 
biggest things we want to keep in mind
is<00:01:16.110> how<00:01:16.260> harsh<00:01:16.590> or<00:01:16.800> soft<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.550> now<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> softer

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
is how harsh or soft it is now a softer

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.540 
is how harsh or soft it is now a softer
light<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.350> going<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.590> come<00:01:19.740> from<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.040> larger

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
light is going to come from a larger

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.150 
light is going to come from a larger
light<00:01:20.790> source<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:22.260> we<00:01:22.380> can<00:01:22.500> do<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.830> by<00:01:22.980> adding

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
light source so we can do that by adding

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.520 
light source so we can do that by adding
modifiers<00:01:23.910> such<00:01:24.030> as<00:01:24.300> a<00:01:24.330> softbox<00:01:24.810> or<00:01:25.080> by

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
modifiers such as a softbox or by

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.620 
modifiers such as a softbox or by
bringing<00:01:25.860> our<00:01:25.950> light<00:01:26.130> closer<00:01:26.520> now<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.330> want<00:01:27.570> to

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
bringing our light closer now we want to

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.450 
bringing our light closer now we want to
be<00:01:27.720> careful<00:01:27.750> because<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.440> softer<00:01:29.010> light<00:01:29.190> source

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
be careful because a softer light source

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.670 
be careful because a softer light source
is<00:01:29.640> not<00:01:29.880> always<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.750> most<00:01:30.780> appropriate<00:01:31.200> for

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
is not always the most appropriate for

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.830 
is not always the most appropriate for
our<00:01:31.710> interview<00:01:32.120> sometimes<00:01:33.120> we<00:01:33.300> want<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.630> harsh

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
our interview sometimes we want to harsh

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.230 
our interview sometimes we want to harsh
your<00:01:33.900> light<00:01:34.200> source<00:01:34.550> but<00:01:35.550> as<00:01:35.700> we're<00:01:35.880> starting

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
your light source but as we're starting

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.180 
your light source but as we're starting
out<00:01:36.390> generally<00:01:37.290> we're<00:01:37.710> going<00:01:37.830> to<00:01:37.890> go<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:38.160> a

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
out generally we're going to go for a

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.070 
out generally we're going to go for a
softer<00:01:38.640> light<00:01:38.850> source<00:01:39.150> because<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.750> lot<00:01:39.960> more

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
softer light source because a lot more

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.440 
softer light source because a lot more

tungsten<00:01:45.300> air<00:01:45.510> we're<00:01:45.870> going<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.080> compare<00:01:46.410> that

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
tungsten air we're going to compare that

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.280 
tungsten air we're going to compare that
to<00:01:46.650> the<00:01:46.920> bare<00:01:47.250> bulb<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.120> tungsten<00:01:48.660> air<00:01:49.050> and

to the bare bulb of the tungsten air and
you're<00:01:49.560> going<00:01:49.650> to<00:01:49.710> see<00:01:49.830> just<00:01:50.100> how<00:01:50.190> much<00:01:50.250> softer

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
you're going to see just how much softer

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.910 
you're going to see just how much softer
the<00:01:51.210> light<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.570> by<00:01:51.870> increasing<00:01:52.170> its<00:01:52.530> apparent

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
the light is by increasing its apparent

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.370 
the light is by increasing its apparent
size<00:01:53.100> through<00:01:53.550> the<00:01:53.640> use<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.300> softbox<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
size through the use of the softbox the

size through the use of the softbox the
next<00:01:55.620> thing<00:01:55.740> we<00:01:55.830> want<00:01:56.010> to<00:01:56.040> keep<00:01:56.190> in<00:01:56.370> mind<00:01:56.400> is

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
next thing we want to keep in mind is

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.540 
next thing we want to keep in mind is
what<00:01:57.150> angle<00:01:57.870> do<00:01:58.200> we<00:01:58.260> place<00:01:58.530> our<00:01:58.680> key<00:01:59.100> light<00:01:59.340> in

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
what angle do we place our key light in

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.490 
what angle do we place our key light in
relation<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.150> our<00:02:00.180> camera<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.230> here<00:02:01.380> we're

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
relation to our camera so here we're

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.840 
relation to our camera so here we're
going<00:02:01.620> to<00:02:01.680> start<00:02:01.950> with<00:02:02.010> the<00:02:02.130> key<00:02:02.430> light<00:02:02.640> right

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
going to start with the key light right

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.640 
going to start with the key light right
over<00:02:02.880> top<00:02:03.330> of<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.659> camera<00:02:03.870> and<00:02:04.140> you're<00:02:04.530> going

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
over top of the camera and you're going

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.080 
over top of the camera and you're going
to<00:02:04.740> notice<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.130> there's<00:02:05.280> very<00:02:05.340> little<00:02:05.640> shape

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
to notice that there's very little shape

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.059 
to notice that there's very little shape
created<00:02:06.659> on<00:02:06.810> our<00:02:06.960> subject<00:02:07.440> from<00:02:07.680> our<00:02:07.830> light

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
created on our subject from our light

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.090 
created on our subject from our light
now<00:02:08.849> as<00:02:09.030> we<00:02:09.209> move<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.509> more<00:02:09.720> off<00:02:09.899> axis<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.860> go

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
now as we move it more off axis and go

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.330 
now as we move it more off axis and go
to<00:02:11.160> 45<00:02:11.640> degrees<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.300> then<00:02:12.569> all<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.750> way<00:02:12.870> to

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
to 45 degrees and then all the way to

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.610 
to 45 degrees and then all the way to
135<00:02:14.340> degrees<00:02:14.940> look<00:02:15.540> at<00:02:15.660> how<00:02:15.780> much<00:02:15.960> more<00:02:16.200> drum

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
135 degrees look at how much more drum

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.399 
135 degrees look at how much more drum
matic<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:17.129> looks<00:02:17.430> so<00:02:18.239> as<00:02:18.390> we<00:02:18.569> go<00:02:18.599> off<00:02:18.900> axis<00:02:19.379> of

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
matic it looks so as we go off axis of

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.380 
matic it looks so as we go off axis of
the<00:02:19.620> camera<00:02:20.010> with<00:02:20.190> our<00:02:20.340> key<00:02:20.580> light<00:02:20.819> we<00:02:21.269> are

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
the camera with our key light we are

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.210 
the camera with our key light we are
getting<00:02:21.540> more<00:02:21.750> shape<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:22.409> our<00:02:22.530> subject<00:02:23.010> and

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
getting more shape in our subject and

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.369 
getting more shape in our subject and
we're<00:02:23.400> also<00:02:23.519> getting<00:02:23.760> more<00:02:24.090> dramatic<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:25.230> the

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
we're also getting more dramatic so the

here<00:03:01.620> are<00:03:02.010> lighting<00:03:02.579> ratios<00:03:03.000> now<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:03.599> may

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
here are lighting ratios now you may

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.509 
here are lighting ratios now you may
have<00:03:03.840> heard<00:03:04.019> that<00:03:04.230> before<00:03:04.379> and<00:03:04.829> an<00:03:05.099> even

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
have heard that before and an even

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.099 
have heard that before and an even
lighting<00:03:05.730> ratio<00:03:06.180> would<00:03:06.359> be<00:03:06.420> one<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.959> one

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
lighting ratio would be one to one

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.020 
lighting ratio would be one to one
meaning<00:03:07.799> that<00:03:07.829> our<00:03:07.920> fill<00:03:08.310> light<00:03:08.519> is<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.879> same

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
meaning that our fill light is the same

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.300 
meaning that our fill light is the same
intensity<00:03:09.390> as<00:03:09.599> our<00:03:09.930> key<00:03:10.319> light<00:03:10.530> when<00:03:11.159> that

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
intensity as our key light when that

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.220 
intensity as our key light when that
happens<00:03:11.819> we're<00:03:11.970> going<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.150> have<00:03:12.299> no<00:03:12.540> shape<00:03:12.930> and

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
happens we're going to have no shape and

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.809 
happens we're going to have no shape and
it's<00:03:13.530> going<00:03:13.620> look<00:03:13.769> very<00:03:14.040> similar<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.700> having

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
it's going look very similar to having

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.759 
it's going look very similar to having
our<00:03:15.000> key<00:03:15.269> light<00:03:15.480> directly<00:03:15.900> behind<00:03:16.109> the<00:03:16.379> camera

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
our key light directly behind the camera

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.309 
our key light directly behind the camera
as<00:03:16.920> we<00:03:17.340> dial<00:03:17.549> our<00:03:17.730> fill<00:03:18.030> light<00:03:18.239> down<00:03:18.599> you're

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
as we dial our fill light down you're

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.809 
as we dial our fill light down you're
going<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.530> notice<00:03:19.680> that<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.099> shadows<00:03:20.489> become

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
going to notice that the shadows become

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.970 
going to notice that the shadows become
more<00:03:21.000> pronounced<00:03:21.480> on<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.959> opposite<00:03:22.470> side<00:03:22.709> of

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
more pronounced on the opposite side of

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.309 
more pronounced on the opposite side of
the<00:03:23.069> key<00:03:23.609> light<00:03:23.790> at<00:03:24.030> this<00:03:24.599> point<00:03:24.840> it's<00:03:25.079> really

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
the key light at this point it's really

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.990 
the key light at this point it's really
up<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.590> you<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.889> think<00:03:26.099> about<00:03:26.190> what<00:03:26.549> you're

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
up to you to think about what you're

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.460 
up to you to think about what you're
trying<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.359> say<00:03:27.389> and<00:03:27.840> how<00:03:28.079> you<00:03:28.109> want<00:03:28.319> the

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
trying to say and how you want the

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.430 
trying to say and how you want the
interview<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.280> feel<00:03:29.760> so<00:03:30.569> try<00:03:30.780> playing<00:03:31.139> with

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
interview to feel so try playing with

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.379 
interview to feel so try playing with
the<00:03:31.590> balance<00:03:31.799> between<00:03:32.099> the<00:03:32.280> fill<00:03:32.609> and<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.849> key

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
the balance between the fill and the key

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.509 
the balance between the fill and the key
until<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:33.959> get<00:03:34.109> the<00:03:34.260> look<00:03:34.560> that<00:03:34.859> you<00:03:35.250> feel<00:03:35.489> is

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
until you get the look that you feel is

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.520 
until you get the look that you feel is
appropriate<00:03:35.760> so<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.840> other<00:03:37.019> thing<00:03:37.109> we<00:03:37.349> want

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
appropriate so the other thing we want

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.780 
appropriate so the other thing we want
to<00:03:37.590> keep<00:03:37.709> in<00:03:37.859> mind<00:03:38.069> as<00:03:38.250> we're<00:03:38.400> talking<00:03:38.519> about

light we're going to talk about is the
hair<00:04:00.060> light<00:04:00.239> now<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.810> job<00:04:01.079> of<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.379> hair<00:04:01.590> light

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
hair light now the job of the hair light

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.740 
hair light now the job of the hair light
is<00:04:01.949> to<00:04:02.099> provide<00:04:02.340> separation<00:04:03.090> between<00:04:03.480> our

talent and the background this is

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.059 
talent and the background this is
especially<00:04:06.299> important<00:04:07.169> if<00:04:07.290> our<00:04:07.620> talent<00:04:07.949> has

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
especially important if our talent has

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.789 
especially important if our talent has
darker<00:04:08.400> hair<00:04:08.699> skin<00:04:09.419> or<00:04:09.569> clothing<00:04:09.629> and<00:04:10.470> we<00:04:10.680> have

darker hair skin or clothing and we have

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.860 
darker hair skin or clothing and we have

a darker background without a hair light
they<00:04:12.989> could<00:04:13.049> easily<00:04:13.379> blend<00:04:13.859> together<00:04:14.099> and<00:04:14.579> you

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
they could easily blend together and you

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.029 
they could easily blend together and you
lose<00:04:14.970> distinction<00:04:15.690> between<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:16.139> two<00:04:16.320> the

we're generally going to try and put it
as<00:04:21.299> far<00:04:21.510> behind<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:22.380> talent<00:04:22.740> as<00:04:22.830> possible<00:04:23.340> but

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
we have to be careful that we don't see

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349 
background can become very bright and we

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:33.260 
background can become very bright and we
can<00:05:31.469> draw<00:05:31.620> attention<00:05:31.919> away<00:05:32.219> from<00:05:32.460> our<00:05:32.819> talent

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270

but without a background light we can

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.860 
but without a background light we can
often<00:05:35.580> find<00:05:35.849> that<00:05:35.999> the<00:05:36.120> background<00:05:36.330> has<00:05:36.659> very
