00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.000 
number there that's supposed to be
height<00:01:48.510> so<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:48.960> was<00:01:49.260> pretty<00:01:49.380> cool<00:01:49.470> now<00:01:49.950> i'm

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
height so that was pretty cool now i'm

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.240 
height so that was pretty cool now i'm
gonna<00:01:50.100> go<00:01:50.190> on<00:01:50.400> to<00:01:50.550> some<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> older<00:01:51.710> rare<00:01:52.710> cards

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
gonna go on to some a older rare cards

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.960 
gonna go on to some a older rare cards
like<00:01:53.730> i<00:01:53.880> said<00:01:53.940> oh<00:01:54.240> i<00:01:54.330> was<00:01:54.780> at<00:01:54.900> this<00:01:54.960> remove<00:01:55.260> it<00:01:55.380> i

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
like i said oh i was at this remove it i

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.520 
like i said oh i was at this remove it i
could<00:01:56.970> do<00:01:57.120> a<00:01:57.150> lot<00:01:57.360> with<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.660> older<00:01:57.870> cards<00:01:58.140> and

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
could do a lot with the older cards and

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.530 
could do a lot with the older cards and
then<00:01:58.650> I<00:01:58.710> got<00:01:58.920> out<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.400> and<00:02:00.180> i<00:02:00.300> recently

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
then I got out of it and i recently

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.980 
then I got out of it and i recently
picked<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:00.990> up<00:02:01.050> again<00:02:01.250> really<00:02:02.250> fun<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.990> here's

energy<00:03:16.860> whatever<00:03:17.190> energy<00:03:17.550> wonder<00:03:17.940> but

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
energy whatever energy wonder but

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.570 
energy whatever energy wonder but
without<00:03:18.959> it<00:03:19.020> you<00:03:19.470> need<00:03:19.650> three<00:03:20.220> normal

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
without it you need three normal

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.370 
without it you need three normal
energies<00:03:20.940> as<00:03:21.360> you<00:03:21.540> can<00:03:21.630> see<00:03:21.750> there<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:22.050> was<00:03:22.170> 80

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
energies as you can see there it was 80

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.260 
energies as you can see there it was 80
damage<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:23.370> if<00:03:23.489> I<00:03:23.550> could<00:03:23.730> get<00:03:23.850> a<00:03:23.880> lot<00:03:24.090> of<00:03:24.120> those

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
damage so if I could get a lot of those

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.630 
damage so if I could get a lot of those
are<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.480> lot<00:03:24.630> ELC<00:03:24.959> X<00:03:25.170> then<00:03:26.070> that<00:03:26.370> would<00:03:26.459> be<00:03:26.489> an

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
are a lot ELC X then that would be an

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.720 
are a lot ELC X then that would be an
amazing<00:03:26.820> attack<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:27.360> 3<00:03:27.510> 4<00:03:27.690> 80<00:03:27.810> attack

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
amazing attack of 3 4 80 attack

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.680 
amazing attack of 3 4 80 attack
hopefully<00:03:29.730> I<00:03:29.790> never<00:03:29.970> got<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.120> use<00:03:30.360> it<00:03:30.390> but

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
hopefully I never got to use it but

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.130 
hopefully I never got to use it but
really<00:03:31.680> cool<00:03:31.920> like<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:32.430> this<00:03:33.180> one<00:03:33.450> is<00:03:33.690> my

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
really cool like it this one is my

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.040 
really cool like it this one is my
strongest<00:03:35.069> card<00:03:35.430> that<00:03:35.550> I<00:03:35.580> have<00:03:35.730> right<00:03:35.819> now

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
strongest card that I have right now

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.470 
strongest card that I have right now
because<00:03:37.050> it's<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.410> Meganium<00:03:37.950> crime<00:03:38.489> it's<00:03:39.180> what

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
because it's a Meganium crime it's what

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.030 
because it's a Meganium crime it's what

i centered my entire deck around that I

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.869 
i centered my entire deck around that I
used<00:03:41.370> right<00:03:41.550> my<00:03:41.790> main<00:03:41.970> deck<00:03:42.239> reyna<00:03:43.340> 150<00:03:44.340> HP<00:03:44.459> its
