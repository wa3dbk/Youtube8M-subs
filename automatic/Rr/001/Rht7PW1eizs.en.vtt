 deformation of both years the formations 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.520

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:39.960
 we will start the huge wave so 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.700
 sometimes it is necessary to cross to 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:47.280
 we are also a museum of mush boxing in 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:51.120
 to say that the bac a diplomatic support 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.610
 of technician diploma but there are some 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.320
 case note there are not even there are 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.630
 students who are very bright even 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.670
 if they have level 4 that I 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.560
 remarks through their students with 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.470
 a ferry level they still arrive at 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.420
 to be among the 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.910
 the majoraux of the promotion of which I 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.920
 will mention the case before me that it is there 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:14.780
 who came with stone his bac level 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:21.290
 and there who came with his mom his 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:23.540
 mom he wanted and there was a 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.520
 bac level and we had difficulties in 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.110
 integrate it initially but one and 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.460
 first year 2nd and 3rd year was 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.710
 among the students congratulate or 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.870
 encouraged by school I do not know if 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.250

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.130
 not only she's fine 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.490
 other people here with a level 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.650
 beat but I see the level a lot 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.600
 better than others are there with a 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.070
 so bin down that tray level 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.950
 it's not very decisive it's the 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.050
 plague the person is his passion it's 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.790
 know things 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.579
 other than 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.230
 the level agrees to respond to 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:59.019

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.240
 training that is done in three 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.800
 years of which one differentiates the stylism 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.260

 planned in three years and training 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.690
 who are two years old like 2d animation 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.870

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.080
 last training we started is 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.580

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.229
 actually in three years but also the 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.090
 students who took a bac + 2 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.949

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.509
 not a training limit they can 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:09.699
 go continue their studies in canada 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:10.780
 is one of the valid reasons for his 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.430
 skis we already know that it's because 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.900
 that they offer scholarships and so we have 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.680
 a lot of students who register at 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.090
 college lasalle for sure working 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.680
 to get this scholarship to go 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.280
 continue their specialty after the ja 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.509
 Montreal room 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.319
 sometimes one of the cases of refusal of 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:27.190
 visas yeah we sweep you know there are 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:28.780
 it's automatic it's not 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.789
 automatic not automatic we are 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.349
 alas tarnishing training so me 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:34.330
 I vote in the students there are piles 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:37.030
 other computers with us that they 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.530
 who helps the students after to prepare 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.360
 their file but if, however, the 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.830
 students do not present a good record 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.020
 that is to say on the financial plan did 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.180
 not the means for sustenance to 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.710
 Montreal, but the agreement 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.400
 the embassy and the 4 euros he can 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.400
 refuse the aim
