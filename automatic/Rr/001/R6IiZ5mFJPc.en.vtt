00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:23.289
 mam has arrived to bring in singh 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:25.989
 I'm attending an evening of leaflets 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.509
 clothes for girls and I look forward 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:30.130
 known this concept of dressing barter on 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.439
 internet just not 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.300
 problematic had invited the world 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.339
 racing to stop accumulating delays of 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.019
 clothes to stop recoil and especially 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:40.210
 things that I did not wear I 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:41.769
 did not know what to do with it and my herring 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.170
 was full and I'm it's a super 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.540
 way to meet people I found 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.149
 it's very friendly in fact and especially 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.579
 to exchange and recycle in fact lo 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:55.120
 this evening I brought back bedsores not 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.640
 luxury brands jeans jackets 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.429
 jewelry bags all that I could 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.379
 find and I can trade where we are 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:04.179
 in barter or case no notion that 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.410
 matter I think I'm going to make 

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:06.880
 good deals there are a lot of things 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.670
 which interests me and especially its 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.330
 violets has managed to bring together people who 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.740
 have the same tastes and we meet again and 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.569
 I think there are some pieces 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.210
 especially waters that I do not like 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:20.350
 bad at all the first empty reason that 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.240
 I did it a little bit because of 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.399
 my boyfriend because I really 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.560
 huge harkis overflow so it took 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.780
 sorting and as I frequented 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.000
 many networks 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.380
 social fashion forums I had 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.200
 the idea of â€‹â€‹actually bringing together friends 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.000
 virtual to exchange our clothes on 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.920
 principle it's simple for example 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.840
 I have a friend who has a nice jacket 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.619
 I like me I only have small tee 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.659
 shirt and ben I want to give him 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.220
 maybe three quests or simple little 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.640
 t-shirt and then a little gem and more 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.600
 for so it's about equal 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.060
 charge you want to organize a 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.040
 bartering at home it's very simple you 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.030
 to deny his few friends you think 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.680
 good for cupcakes it's very 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.790
 important and bring you back all 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.320
 clothes you want to swap 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.119
 here you will see it's very friendly 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.929
 and this to a great way to do 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.929
