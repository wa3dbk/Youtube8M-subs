fireworks<00:00:01.890> talking<00:00:02.760> to<00:00:02.879> you<00:00:03.000> about<00:00:03.149> the

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
fireworks talking to you about the

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.260 
fireworks talking to you about the
selection<00:00:03.929> and<00:00:04.290> use<00:00:04.560> of<00:00:04.859> consumer<00:00:05.700> fireworks

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
selection and use of consumer fireworks

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.129 
selection and use of consumer fireworks
now<00:00:07.049> we're<00:00:07.290> going<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.440> talk<00:00:07.710> about<00:00:07.919> rockets<00:00:08.910> a

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:09.139 
now we're going to talk about rockets a

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.640 
now we're going to talk about rockets a
rocket<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.260> typically<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:12.019> cardboard<00:00:13.019> cone

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
rocket is typically a cardboard cone

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.799 
rocket is typically a cardboard cone
filled<00:00:14.130> with<00:00:14.309> pyrotechnic<00:00:15.030> composition

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
filled with pyrotechnic composition

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.380 
filled with pyrotechnic composition
attached<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.800> rigid<00:00:17.220> stick<00:00:17.850> that's<00:00:18.180> the

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
attached to a rigid stick that's the

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.640 
attached to a rigid stick that's the
guiding<00:00:18.690> stick<00:00:19.320> when<00:00:19.980> ignited<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:21.300> motor

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
guiding stick when ignited the motor

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.070 
guiding stick when ignited the motor
ejects<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.920> propelling<00:00:23.670> compound<00:00:24.359> that

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
ejects a propelling compound that

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.650 
ejects a propelling compound that
propels<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.980> rocket<00:00:26.010> up<00:00:26.670> into<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.180> air<00:00:27.300> and

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
propels the rocket up into the air and

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.509 
propels the rocket up into the air and
gives<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.260> flight<00:00:28.590> pattern<00:00:29.130> or

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
gives you the flight pattern or

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.359 
gives you the flight pattern or
trajectory<00:00:30.740> traditionally<00:00:31.740> Rockets<00:00:32.219> were

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
trajectory traditionally Rockets were

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.150 
trajectory traditionally Rockets were
used<00:00:32.610> just<00:00:32.820> for<00:00:33.360> their<00:00:33.600> trajectory<00:00:34.260> but

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
used just for their trajectory but

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.360 
used just for their trajectory but
lately<00:00:35.780> Rockets<00:00:36.780> have<00:00:36.989> tremendous<00:00:37.710> payloads

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
lately Rockets have tremendous payloads

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.209 
lately Rockets have tremendous payloads
such<00:00:38.700> as<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.629> rocket<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.530> actually<00:00:41.010> has<00:00:41.190> a

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
such as this rocket that actually has a

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.850 
such as this rocket that actually has a
shell<00:00:41.670> attached<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.960> head<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.320> rocket

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
shell attached to the head of the rocket

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.770 
shell attached to the head of the rocket
so<00:00:44.340> at<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.730> height<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.510> flight

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
so at the height of the flight

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.500 
so at the height of the flight
trajectory<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:47.129> shell<00:00:47.430> will<00:00:47.730> detonate<00:00:48.000> and

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
trajectory the shell will detonate and

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.569 
trajectory the shell will detonate and
produce<00:00:49.230> color<00:00:49.920> effects<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.030> noise<00:00:51.360> a

missile<00:00:56.809> is<00:00:57.809> very<00:00:58.109> similar<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.859> functionality

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
missile is very similar in functionality

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.779 
missile is very similar in functionality
to<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> rocket<00:01:00.870> except<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.800> missile<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.430> shaped

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
to a rocket except the missile is shaped

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.390 
to a rocket except the missile is shaped
more<00:01:02.989> conventionally<00:01:03.989> like<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> rocket<00:01:04.860> with<00:01:05.369> a

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
more conventionally like a rocket with a

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.570 
more conventionally like a rocket with a
body<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.119> fins<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:07.260> functionally<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
body and fins but functionally the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.690 
body and fins but functionally the
propelling<00:01:09.150> agent<00:01:09.650> propels<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.890> missile

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
propelling agent propels the missile

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.850 
propelling agent propels the missile
into<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.210> air<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.990> functions<00:01:13.470> exactly

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
into the air and it functions exactly

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.850 
into the air and it functions exactly
like<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> rocket<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:16.939> PVC<00:01:17.939> launch<00:01:18.540> tube<00:01:19.110> should

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
like a rocket a PVC launch tube should

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.030 
like a rocket a PVC launch tube should
be<00:01:19.920> sunk<00:01:20.430> into<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.939> ground<00:01:20.970> at<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.630> 75<00:01:22.350> degree

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
be sunk into the ground at a 75 degree

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.969 
be sunk into the ground at a 75 degree
angle<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:24.000> PVC<00:01:24.630> tube<00:01:24.960> should<00:01:25.290> be<00:01:25.350> sunk<00:01:25.770> into

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
angle the PVC tube should be sunk into

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.429 
angle the PVC tube should be sunk into
the<00:01:26.189> ground<00:01:26.460> at<00:01:26.670> least<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:27.119> third<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.080> half<00:01:28.170> of

long but it can be too short it has to
be<00:01:35.610> long<00:01:35.880> enough<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.049> entire<00:01:37.350> stick<00:01:37.920> can

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
be long enough so the entire stick can

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.969 
be long enough so the entire stick can

you<00:01:44.430> should<00:01:44.670> definitely<00:01:44.850> follow<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.840> flight

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
you should definitely follow the flight

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
it doesn't come down hot and secondly so

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.910 
it doesn't come down hot and secondly so
that<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.030> can<00:01:54.240> retrieve<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.079> not<00:01:55.380> end<00:01:55.680> up

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
that you can retrieve it and not end up

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.999 
that you can retrieve it and not end up
littering<00:01:56.490> your<00:01:56.670> neighbor's<00:01:57.060> property<00:01:58.009> now
