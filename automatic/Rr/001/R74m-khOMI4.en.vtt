nicely<00:01:48.740> -<00:01:49.039> I'm<00:01:49.850> guessing<00:01:50.209> it's<00:01:50.330> going<00:01:50.420> to

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
nicely - I'm guessing it's going to

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.109 
nicely - I'm guessing it's going to
perform<00:01:50.780> well<00:01:51.049> in<00:01:51.080> races<00:01:51.619> them<00:01:51.860> could<00:01:52.700> even<00:01:52.909> be

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
perform well in races them could even be

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.430 
perform well in races them could even be

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
better than the entity it could be the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.499 
better than the entity it could be the
new<00:01:54.619> worm<00:01:54.799> the<00:01:55.399> new<00:01:55.520> best<00:01:55.759> kart<00:01:56.060> on<00:01:56.179> the<00:01:56.299> game
