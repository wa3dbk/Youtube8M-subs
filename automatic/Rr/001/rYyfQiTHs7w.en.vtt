00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 I wish I'm German so many people 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.700
 on the internet they are doing something called 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.319
 draw bad there is that is how to count your 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.570
 story through drawings and I said 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.860
 hey I'm a talented cartoonist and 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.980
 It would be good for you to know me a 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.330
 little more so let's go in 1990 a man 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.039
 called hermann louis and a woman 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.020
 called cecilia del carmen had a 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.000
 son they called german that little 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.859
 bastard over 4 kilos was me the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.750
 second of the family we were my father my 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.949
 mother my older brother and me since 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.449
 I was always born a very person 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.789
 silent was quieter than a photo 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.560
 according to my mother I could spend hours without 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.239
 cry or make noise passed the time and 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.920
 this family of four people stopped 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.309
 be four this person came out of 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.329
 drawing in 1993 when I was three years old 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.910
 my father suffered an accident 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.980
 automotive and died this happened on 24 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.870
 of December of that year yes on Christmas 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.460
 from that day onwards the Christmas 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.760
 in my family they were never again what 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.010
 same 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.780
 my father was a soccer lover I remember 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.100
 that my mother used to say not that god 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.690
 had taken our father so that 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.280
 will play on your soccer team I guess 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.930
 than for a 3-year-old child in the form 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.579
 simpler to understand because your father 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.140
 it's not anymore I never suffered because of the death of 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.579
 my father my mother made sure that what 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.199
 we took the best possible way and 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.430
 she had to suffer a lot of time in 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.210
 silence so that we do not 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.710
 let's find out 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.390
 that there are many other things more the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.010
 I consider the best mom in the world for 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.780
 to avoid the pain and that we will miss it 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.090
 as little as possible my mother took us from 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.100
 trip around the country one day we were 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.659
 in the snow and the other thousand kilometers to 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.040
 north in some desert I spent the 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.479
 most of my childhood traveling and 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.340
 knowing places for that reason I have 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.200
 I've been in more than 10 schools and I've lived 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.820
 in about 20 different houses I'm already so 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.229
 used to that I can no longer be 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.700
 in the same place for a long time a 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.350
 day can be in a country and a day in 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.940
 the other and another I can be on the moon 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.409
 like I've never been in the same city 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.240
 for a long time I had to do 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.340
 many friends and say goodbye to them very 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.960
 soon I do not have those friends of all 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.000
 life for that very reason makes me very 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.649
 easy to say goodbye to people I'm very 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.479
 emotionally independent because 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.220
 I never really had a person in me 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.259
 enough to get to 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.850
 Fondling me at 14 I did not have much 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.170
 goal in life I was doing very well in 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.789
 the school but the truth is that never 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.200
 I was paying attention I'm from that kind of 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.940
 people that while less for the 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.380
 attention more learn in this time 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.149
 I wanted to study civil engineering or 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.710
 some other career that was difficult the 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.420
 I was not interested in the race alone 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.860
 I wanted a challenge something to focus on 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.840
 attention until you reach a village 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.579
 called the edges where I passed the most 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.360
 of my adolescence at school was 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.250
 pretty old 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.450
 I did not talk to anyone I never liked 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.250
 a lot of large groups of people 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.960
 but one day he meets a group of 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.700
 people as idiots as me 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.260
 which soon became 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.060
 my best friends spent the day 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.950
 playing role-playing games destroying 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.660
 property of others and laughing at things without 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.040
 felt one of the best years of my 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.750
 life I also met the one who was my 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.460
 best friend in adolescence and little 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.050
 Then it was my first love until I 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.480
 wrote a song called for said 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.150
 idiot and more importantly I discovered my 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.560
 Passion music at age 14 discovered 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.480
 that music was what I really 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.070
 I was happy and I swore that I would dedicate my life 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.350
 to her so my brother and I started 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.000
 a band called their ex the best band 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.290
 of the world we spent hours playing the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.700
 more horrible songs than someone 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.500
 may have composed but we were 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.600
 happy after many members 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.580
 a max came to the band a guy with a few 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.290
 five years less than us but he had 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.360
 battery and that was the important thing the 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.700
 talent motivation good vibes 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.380
 battery improved nothing with time we 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.910
 we returned very good friends we passed the 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.500
 most of the time together almost 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.450
 always talking about how cool that 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.950
 would be touching in front of 20,000 people not 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.690
 to 20 thousand 11 19.999 not 20 thousand was so 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.130
 convinced that the music was for me 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.319
 that I left school I told my mother 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.659
 I want to be an independent musician 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.280
 my mother said good ok in the end it was not 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.599
 so simple to convince her but like me 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.519
 let me follow my dreams was more 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.139
 important to study to pass all 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.030
 my life in an office being unhappy 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.739
 so from that day and until the day of 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.870
 today I work every day to achieve it 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.430
 remember the best mom in the world to 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.379
 18 I moved to the capital to look 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.670
 better opportunities and a day sitting 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.680
 in my house doing nothing like always 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.299
 I discovered youtube and out of boredom 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.370
 I happened to make a channel called hello 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.079
 I'm german and I posted a video this video 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.790
 called the obvious things in life was a 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.590
 very short video which I only know 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.480
 I showed it to my friends eventually climb 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.250
 video every weekend there was a 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.870
 habit before youtube used to believe that 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.909
 nobody understood me and that my sense of 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.560
 humor was strange and nobody liked him and 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.299
 thanks to these videos I discovered them to 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.549
 you people with the same stupid 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.199
 sense of humor that mine 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.030
 At first he was very shy but 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:08.010
 thanks to you and your support I can each 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.659
 day to be more real in front of the screen in 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.819
 instead of a guy who luckily moved 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.650
 since then provoke laughter and joy 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.150
 with absurd jokes with a sense of 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.820
 so white humor that fell in the childish 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.169
 it became an addiction and I love the 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.970
 today I can say that I am a 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.710
 happy person I'm fulfilling I'm 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.970
 well on track to fulfill my dreams and 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.770
 a lot of that is thanks to you 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.810
 I could say end 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.220
 it really is, there's a lot about the 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.900
 music in what I'm working for 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.430
 that the world can see it, I do not have 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.020
 intentions to leave youtube or 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.090
 abandon them to you so in 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.340
 summary there's a lot of german ahead 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.819
 this is not the end this is just 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.819
 starting
