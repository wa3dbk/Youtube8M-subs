00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.059
 Both cities have their good and bad sides. When it comes to lifestyle, 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.009
 is comparing apples with pears. London is a huge world city, it is 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.009
 noisy, busy and dirty and difficult to move around. Amsterdam is a village, 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.380
 a small city where you can be everywhere in 10 minutes, clean and accessible. 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.280
 When it comes to work, they don't differ much. You have a comparable range of agencies 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:40.280
 and a large pond with creative talent to fish in and the desks are just like that 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.679
 competitive, creative and demanding like the one in London, and that's great. 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:55.159
 This city is therefore an interesting combination. The Netherlands has a fantastic 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.659
 creative heritage, especially in design and there is a fantastic tradition of it 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:07.659
 craftsmanship in this country. It is also an innovative, lively, young country, and so 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:15.030
 there is a lot of young talent here. The creative culture is not yet stuck, so agencies 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.550
 are flexible and there is a lot of innovation. Here on the European mainland 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:27.550
 we are geographically close to where our customers live and work, and that is also an advantage. 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.090
 It is an excellent base for Europe and for those of us who 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.350
 do not speak their languages ​​well. For British or Americans who don't speak many languages, 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.130
 it is a welcoming place because you can come here and everyone in english 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.790
 works and lives, so it is also an excellent base for Europe in that area. 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:59.160
 The creative atmosphere in the Netherlands is actually international. 17 nationalities work there 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:06.160
 in this office of about 42 people. The Dutch are the largest group 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.060
 but that is not yet half of the employees, so the atmosphere is very open and tolerant 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.300
 and it is certainly not the case that the Dutch are against everyone else. 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.090
 It is well integrated. I don't think London is culturally very British, you know, London 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.800
 is more a country in itself, just like New York and I think you know Amsterdam 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.380
 is a bit like that in the Netherlands. If you go north, it is something else, or even 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.830
 very different from Amsterdam. It has the feel of a big city when it comes to work and 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.830
 creativity. I worked in London for 10, 12 years. I love London. Frankly, the 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.900
 here, bureaucracy is not very different. The way of life is fantastic, you are not sitting 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.410
 half life in the metro. People choose their home and workplace for various reasons 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.819
 and Amsterdam has its advantages and disadvantages, just like London, but I love it 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:20.760
 Europe that this strong creative basis is just across the street, seen from 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.040
 London. In Amsterdam it's not just about advertising, it's a very creative city, there 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.709
 many excellent photographers work here, many excellent artists work, there are 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.849
 always exhibitions going on and it is a very creative city to walk into. 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.380
 Many people in Amsterdam cycle everywhere or walk through the city, it is 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.670
 a very beautiful place, so the city itself, the architecture and the water. It is 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.950
 a great way to exclude the advertising world and some new ones 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.069
 get inspiration. \}
