00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.420
 you know all people it's xenon and 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.680
 today we find ourselves on black ops 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.869
 2 for a new gameplay 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.060
 this time it's to introduce you 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.340
 the glam camouflage that has nothing 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.829
 glamorous you'll see that soissons 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.210
 So here is the glam camouflage 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.529
 I was wearing of course my little 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.180
 peacekeeper besides speaking about the 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.520
 peace keeper thank you fanned in for having me 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.660
 lent his season pass for you to play 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.040
 with this weapon because otherwise hello 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.690
 could never have seen that I did not 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.920
 want to download the first dlc 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.769
 that I had bought 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.879
 so thanks to you tease and his chain will be 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.289
 in the description I think if you 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.449
 want to have a little 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:47.339
 turn to see and here you can 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.230
 see how these guys do to boost 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.629
 d2 in psy of course I'm laughing ah but 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.899
 you'll see that brief glam camouflage 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.999
 I wore it on my b 23 r16 ioma 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.379
 peacekeeper of course this camouflage 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:00.480
 we have nothing glam like I 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.249
 Say it's shit honestly 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.440
 would look like a kind of the flake with some 

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:06.090
 obsolete chocapics inside it's 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.680
 really naze clothes I think that 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.150
 it's the most useless camouflage and 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.640
 the ugliest of the game knowing that this thing 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.720
 costs 1 euro 82 for once i'm 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.580
 glad to not have bought me 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.250
 even my sense of mouthing these mouths 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.080
 things they had to tell themselves that needed 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.460
 that he's still making a camouflage so 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.110
 that they did this shit to larach there 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.520
 frankly it's shit for a 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.140
 times at least we can say that the title 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.430
 is more beautiful shot that the camouflage 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.230
 because it's kind of a bag for 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.820
 hand is not specially 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.860
 nice but we'll say it's already 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.790
 better than that chocapic with milk 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.930
 curd so that's brief otherwise I have not 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.130
 great thing to say more about this 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.630
 gameplay game anyway finish of you the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.820
 so present 1.42 maastricht well 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.230
 obviously you know how to read like you 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.780
 are not illiterate you could 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.030
 see in the title 42.5 wallace it's 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.230
 written black on white 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.850
 so here is a little bit as usual 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.960
 a non-lethal gameplay solo on the 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.520
 wine not exact I still do you 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.690
 quickly made my class because good ago 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.890
 a lot of days I wonder all the 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.000
 time my class my class and then it's 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.950
 true what do we know if I was not 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.050
 all this will do good to redo 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.480
 for once so peacekeeper charger 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.640
 fast heavy guns long cannon I know 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.510
 not when we say on call of short we have 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.729
 all and I had bulletproof vest 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.289
 robustness dexterity determination 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.590
 no I had not in 2007 I had looters 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.269
 knicks arras and then c four and b 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.960
 23rd this is how you know my 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.790
 white class 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.260
 will not ask 40 once brief 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.570
 today I had a little topic a 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.890
 little trick that I will talk to you so 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.970
 in fact it's a little bit following 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.160
 the video the last time I'm going 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.620
 poster with the famous rock camouflage 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.510
 so the video at half-time when Yemen 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.560
 i'm going to talk that held mad very life 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.030
 quickly I said I 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.140
 will talk again in a video of tighten 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.360
 crazy because I do it with 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.280
 so the focus is actually this game here I 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.260
 think there are a lot of people we have 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.670
 heard frankly that's not it 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.040
 a lot of noise these days even though the game 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.330
 will come out that next spring or 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.430
 apparently but playing in any case that's 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.840
 what I heard me for now 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.200
 so we are waiting for saab practically in 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.790
 a year 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.680
 the game comes out practically in a good on 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.590
 the next gen on xbox but apparently this 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.550
 would be an exclusive 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.630
 it's clear that this game is already doing 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.400
 a lot about him and me I 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.380
 is looking forward to it because 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.030
 gameplay that I could see so much the 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.620
 lotro stuff going small trailer and 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.600
 pilar the gameplay that we could see the 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.580
 gamescom it's a game that really gives 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.140
 want it looks super super great 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.520
 arcadins much more than a call of 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.610
 duty but I think even the call of 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.440
 infinity ward duty does not arrive at the 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.400
 anklet of the arcade of crazy tahiti 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.560
 because it's really a phew thing 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.670
 clearly with the power jetpacks 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.070
 to move like that by jumping by 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.390
 above the buildings enter the 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.370
 windows with the jetpack it's really 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.090
 hallucinatory 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.830
 let's say it's a bit like a 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.180
 call of duty but with a dimension in 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.320
 more that is that of height because 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.580
 that on call of duty that's it you can 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.740
 do the jump shot etc 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.150
 but you can not like that to go up 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.680
 on the buildings squarely at the 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.120
 vertical just with a jetpack 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.490
 it's clear that it's not call of 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.900
 duty so that's going to add a dimension of 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.340
 what he quotes in my opinion a 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.710
 game that will be much harder to play 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.290
 even if it looks great arcade in all 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.270
 like call of duty mottu pretty fast but 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.530
 it's clear that here I think that with 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.760
 all under the fact of being able 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.140
 dodge the balls and all that is going to be 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.700
 much more important than on call of 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.690
 you can just dropped an old jump 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.890
 shot and maybe it's a game that goes 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.050
 ask for a lot more style 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.460
 and so maybe it's also a game that 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.440
 will be much easier 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.760
 developing competition because if 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.600
 it still took a lot of time 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.430
 to develop 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.020
 even if it is clear that with the mode 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.520
 xp and it's pretty well installed but 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.500
 apparently as with call of duty 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.910
 kids it's going to be a little bit of a comeback 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.140
 back to the competition level 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.790
 which can you expect to have been 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.980
 a madness starts to take over 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.450
 not necessarily take over but 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.510
 let's say who can settle down sustainably 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.520
 this game so begins to come out of 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.080
 every year every two years has 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.460
 good quality with innovations and 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.930
 this is what can really become a very 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.880
 very good competitive game for xbox 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.260
 one so I can not wait to see this 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.790
 that it will give because as I had 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.800
 says in the famous video I'm telling you 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.790
 I spoke earlier 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.740
 me for the moment it is worn if I 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.850
 remake it will be on battlefield May 4 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.590
 crazy title I'm waiting for it at the turn 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.320
 because there everybody leave a 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.610
 little bit of the same starting point it is 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.690
 to say that for example if I put myself 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.710
 to the iss door on what there would already be 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.150
 teams that have been there for years 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.950
 so maybe a crazy it would be a 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.300
 new license so that can motivate 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.560
 like that and that's to make the 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.420
 competition above so in any case 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.770
 I can not wait for them to come out because 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.300
 that even to play in public 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.620
 on it I can really no longer wait and 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.660
 expect it to be one of 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.160
 games that I will post very often on my 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.200
 chain I think that by the next few 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.580
 if i continue youtube by then but my 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.890
 jab so lu not want to stop so 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.510
 it's likely to continue my chain it will be 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.940
 normally the call of duty kid of the 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.750
 battlefield 4 as well as the teil he 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.650
 must I really wait with 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.450
 a lot of impatience 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.740
 in any case I hope that this 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.090
 little gameplay will have pleased you the 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.230
 commentary too 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.540
 so here is no hesitation in leaving a 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.860
 little like so precisely the video has you 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.210
 Please subscribe to the channel if it is 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.470
 not done yet on this match visit 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.130
 see you next time 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.130
 do you speak well
