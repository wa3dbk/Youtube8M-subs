quickly the paper we use in our
experiment<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.390> common<00:01:18.869> type<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.470> people

done by hand since water jet printing

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.929 
done by hand since water jet printing
allows<00:01:28.110> one<00:01:28.350> page<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.890> be<00:01:29.009> reprinted<00:01:29.579> dozens

of times it can help officers save money
on<00:01:32.400> paper<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:33.840> cost<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.259> chemically<00:01:34.680> treating

on paper the cost of chemically treating
the<00:01:35.100> paper<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.579> also<00:01:35.970> relatively<00:01:36.450> low

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.310 

according<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.400> our<00:01:41.430> calculation<00:01:42.360> by<00:01:42.960> treating

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
according to our calculation by treating

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.620 
according to our calculation by treating
the<00:01:43.590> type<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.860> paper<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.850> generally<00:01:45.420> used

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
the type of paper that is generally used

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.590 
the type of paper that is generally used
for<00:01:45.840> printing<00:01:46.470> that's<00:01:46.890> only<00:01:47.340> 5%<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> price

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
for printing that's only 5% to the price

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.969 
for printing that's only 5% to the price
so<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.619> technology<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.460> very<00:01:50.729> cheap<00:01:51.829> the<00:01:52.829> new

so this technology is very cheap the new

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.800 
so this technology is very cheap the new
technology<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.820> also<00:01:54.000> help<00:01:54.299> protect<00:01:54.509> the
