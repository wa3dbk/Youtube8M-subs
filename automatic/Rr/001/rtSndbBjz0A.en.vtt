00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 spoiler alert I recommend you not 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.290
 watch this video until you finish in the 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.389
 same axel word sleeve if you've already seen 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.280
 said to me manga 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.650
 I hope you liked this one 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.299
 video hello very good to all and 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.550
 welcome to a new video today 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.029
 I bring a relatively short video already 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.039
 that I only want to expose you 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.470
 curiosity that I located watching the anime 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.560
 of axel world more specifically in the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.349
 episode 3 I came across this scene is 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.270
 you can see the background at the bottom of the 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.270
 video capturing that image 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.559
 it has nothing to do with the characters 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.200
 main in fact the text is that 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.140
 appears is not of are not the words of 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.590
 None of the people so 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.300
 say that they appear in this image but 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.820
 of the two characters that are in the 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.890
 same the same place in it 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.920
 coffee shop talking to each other 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.010
 without having any relationship with these 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.790
 with this image let's say the text this is not 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.119
 has nothing to do 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.670
 forget the text of the subtitles of 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:12.480
 here what interests us are these two 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.640
 characters as 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:20.460
 I sincerely see them just like 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.430
 scream and is one of his online horde and 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.690
 I add as you will know the creator of axel 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:31.360
 Word and Sword Art Online is the same 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:34.000
 same author therefore 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.310
 a lot of controversy has been created 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.460
 say it looking for the possible relationship 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.920
 between both series 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.840
 I will talk more more daily about this in 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.610
 another video because now I just want 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.970
 focus on this image that would mean 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.740
 that these are scream and you have one in my 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.400
 opinion 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:56.720
 in my opinion these two characters 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.720
 they have been put 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.710
 on request or not on request but because 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.240
 the anime producers the anime have 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.520
 wanted to put them 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.220
 for putting some people instead of putting 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.780
 any invented character then it 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.040
 they have put here is already one is what I 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.430
 I think 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.709
 is what I think but it is my opinion 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.349
 I'm saying that it's true 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.439
 nothing alone is what I think and this 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.230
 would mean to start that these two 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:30.180
 characters have no relationship 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.099
 criteria have no relationship with 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.849
 the two protagonists of the series since 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:40.459
 I do not think they were in the same place 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.459
 without even greeting 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.390
 does not deny that they can appear in 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.550
 a future in the series but it gives less 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:55.410
 credibility the truth 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:58.319
 if this gives rebate enough theories the 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.610
 this really does 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.880
 do not 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.430
 does not help the theories that written and 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.230
 there is one to appear in axel word 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.209
 for nothing what 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.790
 but in my opinion the snatch and 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.620
 that are appearing 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.720
 how 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.430
 background in a 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.500
 in a fund in which the same 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.630
 main characters appear and I do not 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.490
 it seems very logical that they will go back to 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.820
 appear in the series well then 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.810
 basically this was all I wanted 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.750
 show you this picture 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.240
 and above all I want what you think 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.710
 about it in the comments if it's not 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.750
 now I hope that in the future 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:44.020
 when more people see what 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.490
 so what do you put your opinion what 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.710
 is what interests me is what I have 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.270
 done this video I basically want 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:53.590
 I want to see what you think 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:56.230
 what my subscribers think or not or who 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.590
 I see it honestly and good if you like 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:04.810
 this kind of curiosities or opinions 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:07.100
 about more about relationships between series 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.840
 or things like that or curiosities in themselves 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.090
 let me know with a line 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.709
 so well this is all for today 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.450
 I hope you liked it a lot 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.580
 short but I think that 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.810
 that you will like quite a lot I hope so 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.150
 less and those who do not know this 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.070
 information you already know this is not a 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.760
 Fake is truly in the 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.760
 episode 3 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.870
 for nothing that I know does not say in any 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:35.000
 are critical one party only 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.199
 it seems to them or maybe they are for 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.460
 that's what I want you to leave me in 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.539
 the comments 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.539
 so, goodbye
