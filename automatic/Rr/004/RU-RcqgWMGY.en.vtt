00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:23.840
 This time about the foot of the pitcher 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:30.020
 It therefore balance also the distribution of power will have changed 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.710
 This stepping pressure also becomes an important point If you first step out 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.640
 OK 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.329
 First of all this is the basic of the basics 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.960
 After stepping on the plate first 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:43.470
 Please draw a line straight to the catcher at 90 degrees 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.060
 When you pull it 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:52.150
 It's a slope, so go straight from the boat 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.150
 Draw a line to live straight from the form later 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:01:02.379
 It seems this skill when 4 pieces are straight 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:03.650
 Furthermore, it is also in the half-step member's instep is not it a problem with you force enters 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:08.740
 But while 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:14.229
 When the graduate school steps outside, full power runs away 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:15.760
 Just be sure to lowered subsequent out step in to become personnel throw at only arm 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.740
 I want it 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.850
 And it is almost the number of steps of stride 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.730
 It is said that the profane 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.020
 Six to six and a half steps 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:32.560
 there 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:37.149
 Stride is the most force enters also arm has also been said that the place where easy to operate 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:42.250
 It is both lines to Fu say crest if you do not get used very much 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:43.119
 There to clean because you can mark yourself by drawing a line in the place where the cross 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.170
 Can step out 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.170
 It will also be practice
