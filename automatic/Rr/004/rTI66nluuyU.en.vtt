00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.750
 My name is Karen and this is my story 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.889
 the iceland ribbon in 1969 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.670
 I think you could say I was the baby 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.370
 summer product of love 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.350
 and I am an elephant I think it should 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.890
 mention it 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.990
 let's see the first thing I remember is my 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.510
 mom 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.939
 she and the other elephants protected me 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.000
 and they helped me get used to eating 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.140
 fodder and drink like French horn is more 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.140
 difficult than it seems 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.079
 but when I was about 6 months 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.250
 old was captured there was when my 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.620
 life changed 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.100
 I was sent to a place called circus 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:54.730
 ringling bros in america away from me 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.890
 mother and my pack everything I knew 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.559
 they pulled ropes around me and I 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:04.390
 they threw me to the ground they forced me to perform 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:07.680
 tricks up down sit sit on 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:12.190
 this raises the trunk was endless 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.970
 and when he failed lashes shocks 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.220
 electrical and the worst 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.580
 wilcox 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.640
 they hit me and they fit hooks and 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.360
 They tore my skin all because I did not want 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.360
 do your tricks 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.190
 but after this happened all 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.659
 the days for a year I just stopped 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.749
 opposing me hurt too much 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.359
 and some dark trains that were 

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:43.609
 so small that we had to stay 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:46.479
 about our own waste by 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:46.479
 miles and miles 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:53.580
 sometimes I closed my eyes and thought about 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.160
 mom in her warm trunk and in the miles 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.190
 that we used to walk every day with 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.500
 other elephants then the train will 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.310
 I shook and I realized where I was 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:09.000
 it really was inside a train car 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.340
 standing on my own waste in 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.740
 every stop we made our tricks 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.130
 and families with their young children 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.310
 they laugh at us and smile 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.069
 I do not think they knew what was happening to us 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.319
 at least I hope not 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.569
 after the show I do not know 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.700
 they chained and forced us to return to 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.900
 the trains in the direction of the next 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.050
 city 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:38.890
 and this happened for years 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:41.520
 and that's where I am now on the road 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.850
 fewer people come to see me 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.720
 but it's still families with children 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:51.420
 small smiling they can not know 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.140
 what is happening to me is simply not 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.020
 they can know the truth 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.290
 My name is Karen and I need your 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.290
 help
