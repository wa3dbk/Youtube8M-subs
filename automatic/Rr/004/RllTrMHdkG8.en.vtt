basically<00:00:08.120> there<00:00:08.390> are<00:00:08.420> three<00:00:09.130> major<00:00:10.130> setups

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
basically there are three major setups

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.260 
basically there are three major setups
main<00:00:11.270> setups<00:00:11.780> into<00:00:12.820> your<00:00:13.820> quirks<00:00:14.480> you<00:00:15.170> have

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
main setups into your quirks you have

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.609 
main setups into your quirks you have
pivot<00:00:17.270> which<00:00:18.020> is<00:00:18.260> a<00:00:18.939> 180<00:00:19.939> degree<00:00:20.029> turn<00:00:20.450> on<00:00:20.930> or

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
pivot which is a 180 degree turn on or

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.790 
pivot which is a 180 degree turn on or
take<00:00:21.950> off<00:00:22.099> like<00:00:22.369> J<00:00:23.150> step<00:00:23.450> which<00:00:24.020> is<00:00:24.050> running

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
take off like J step which is running

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.310 
take off like J step which is running
into<00:00:25.040> it<00:00:25.239> most<00:00:26.239> people<00:00:26.480> do<00:00:26.599> double<00:00:26.869> perks<00:00:27.079> like

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
into it most people do double perks like

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
into it most people do double perks like
without<00:00:27.919> it<00:00:28.099> another<00:00:28.400> so<00:00:28.610> as<00:00:28.820> Jason<00:00:29.810> and<00:00:30.110> you

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
without it another so as Jason and you

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.360 
without it another so as Jason and you
have<00:00:32.079> Euro<00:00:33.079> step<00:00:33.350> in<00:00:33.680> Euro<00:00:33.890> step<00:00:34.070> is<00:00:34.190> a<00:00:34.220> hybrid

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
have Euro step in Euro step is a hybrid

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.639 
have Euro step in Euro step is a hybrid
it's<00:00:34.910> like<00:00:35.149> I<00:00:35.390> use<00:00:35.570> it<00:00:35.750> as<00:00:35.840> a<00:00:35.870> 90<00:00:36.110> degree<00:00:36.200> pivot

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
it's like I use it as a 90 degree pivot

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.979 
it's like I use it as a 90 degree pivot
almost<00:00:37.489> like<00:00:37.640> J<00:00:37.790> step<00:00:38.030> if<00:00:38.420> you<00:00:38.600> do<00:00:38.720> it<00:00:38.870> right

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
almost like J step if you do it right

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.869 
almost like J step if you do it right
you<00:00:39.050> get<00:00:42.129> enough<00:00:43.129> power<00:00:43.309> out<00:00:43.550> of<00:00:43.579> its<00:00:43.760> do

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
you get enough power out of its do

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.270 
you get enough power out of its do
pretty<00:00:44.090> much<00:00:44.149> whatever<00:00:44.480> you<00:00:44.629> want<00:00:44.780> so<00:00:45.440> that

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
pretty much whatever you want so that

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.330 
pretty much whatever you want so that
being<00:00:46.429> said<00:00:47.050> for<00:00:48.050> the<00:00:48.260> actual<00:00:48.530> work<00:00:48.739> itself<00:00:49.070> I

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
being said for the actual work itself I

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.209 
being said for the actual work itself I
think<00:00:49.910> quarks<00:00:50.239> are<00:00:50.620> like<00:00:51.620> ninety<00:00:52.070> percent

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
think quarks are like ninety percent

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.620 
think quarks are like ninety percent
swing<00:00:52.670> and

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.690 

but<00:00:57.170> you<00:00:57.260> just<00:00:57.500> swing<00:00:57.740> as<00:00:58.130> much<00:00:58.460> as<00:00:58.640> you

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
but you just swing as much as you

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.480 
but you just swing as much as you
possibly<00:00:58.820> can<00:00:59.150> as<00:00:59.450> fast<00:01:00.380> as<00:01:00.860> fast<00:01:01.010> as<00:01:01.280> possible

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:01.490 
possibly can as fast as fast as possible

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.400 
possibly can as fast as fast as possible
as<00:01:01.910> the<00:01:01.970> plasma<00:01:02.450> cannon<00:01:02.810> with<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.020> most<00:01:03.230> power

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
as the plasma cannon with the most power

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.120 
as the plasma cannon with the most power
as<00:01:04.010> a<00:01:04.070> kid

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.649 

yes

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.870 

but<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.679> as<00:01:10.859> you<00:01:11.100> swing<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.490> want<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.700> swing

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
but you as you swing you want to swing

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.370 
but you as you swing you want to swing
up<00:01:11.969> towards<00:01:12.299> like<00:01:12.630> between<00:01:13.020> your<00:01:13.229> nose<00:01:13.319> and

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
up towards like between your nose and

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.889 
up towards like between your nose and
your<00:01:13.619> ear<00:01:13.829> if<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.759> can<00:01:14.999> if<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.359> can't<00:01:15.600> member

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
your ear if you can if you can't member

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.020 
your ear if you can if you can't member
some<00:01:16.140> training<00:01:16.740> for<00:01:16.890> your<00:01:16.950> shoulder<00:01:17.219> but<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
some training for your shoulder but the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.520 
some training for your shoulder but the
goal<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.780> get<00:01:18.899> you<00:01:19.079> with<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
goal for that is to get you with the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.059 
goal for that is to get you with the
most<00:01:19.679> possible<00:01:19.979> flip<00:01:21.319> instead<00:01:22.319> of<00:01:22.439> using<00:01:22.709> your

00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:23.069 
most possible flip instead of using your

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:26.120 
most possible flip instead of using your
arms<00:01:23.219> to<00:01:23.459> go<00:01:23.670> all<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.030> way<00:01:24.060> up<00:01:24.329> like<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:25.130> use

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
arms to go all the way up like this use

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.459 
arms to go all the way up like this use
your<00:01:26.280> arms<00:01:26.670> here<00:01:27.119> shoulder<00:01:27.780> shrug<00:01:27.929> I<00:01:28.170> just

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
your arms here shoulder shrug I just

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:30.020 
your arms here shoulder shrug I just
bring<00:01:28.590> your<00:01:28.799> shoulders<00:01:28.890> up<00:01:29.189> because<00:01:30.000> that

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
bring your shoulders up because that

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.209 
bring your shoulders up because that
when<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:31.020> lift<00:01:31.229> your<00:01:31.380> arms<00:01:31.619> up<00:01:31.740> your<00:01:31.950> shoulder

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
when you lift your arms up your shoulder

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.149 
when you lift your arms up your shoulder
shrug<00:01:32.490> up<00:01:32.640> anyways<00:01:33.259> so<00:01:34.259> instead<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.829> bringing

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
shrug up anyways so instead of bringing

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.039 
shrug up anyways so instead of bringing
your<00:01:35.459> arms<00:01:35.490> up<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:35.880> wasting<00:01:36.509> all<00:01:36.599> this<00:01:36.869> energy

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
your arms up and wasting all this energy

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.990 
your arms up and wasting all this energy
if<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:37.859> stay<00:01:38.039> here<00:01:38.399> with<00:01:38.520> your<00:01:38.640> shoulder

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
if you just stay here with your shoulder

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.660 
if you just stay here with your shoulder
and<00:01:39.149> bring<00:01:39.329> your<00:01:39.420> arms<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.750> hear<00:01:40.130> it's<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.490> much

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
and bring your arms to hear it's so much

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.490 
and bring your arms to hear it's so much
easier<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.179> it<00:01:42.599> makes<00:01:42.629> it<00:01:43.110> makes<00:01:43.319> a<00:01:43.409> big

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
easier and it makes it makes a big

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.199 
easier and it makes it makes a big
difference<00:01:43.560> because<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.159> keeps<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.610> up

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:45.209 
difference because it keeps you up

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:47.929 
difference because it keeps you up
vertical<00:01:46.110> more<00:01:46.319> it<00:01:46.560> makes<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.340> set<00:01:47.579> more<00:01:47.789> and

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
vertical more it makes you set more and

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.490 
vertical more it makes you set more and
gets<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.179> higher

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
gets you higher

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.260 
gets you higher
if<00:01:50.500> you<00:01:50.680> come<00:01:50.890> in<00:01:51.009> at<00:01:51.189> with<00:01:51.369> your<00:01:51.520> swing<00:01:51.759> it's

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
if you come in at with your swing it's

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.420 
if you come in at with your swing it's
just<00:01:52.899> getting<00:01:53.259> to<00:01:53.439> a<00:01:53.469> repetitive<00:01:53.740> motion<00:01:54.250> for

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
just getting to a repetitive motion for

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.459 
just getting to a repetitive motion for
swing-throughs<00:01:54.850> or<00:01:55.119> you<00:01:55.719> can<00:01:55.869> really<00:01:56.079> set

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
swing-throughs or you can really set

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.760 
swing-throughs or you can really set
your<00:01:56.619> double<00:01:56.829> cork<00:01:57.039> and<00:01:58.020> any<00:01:59.020> other<00:01:59.259> type<00:01:59.740> of

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
your double cork and any other type of

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:08.990 
your double cork and any other type of
record<00:02:00.130> or<00:02:00.280> anything<00:02:00.549> like<00:02:00.579> that

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:50.160 

you

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.140 

oh<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.940> trick<00:02:52.650> if

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
oh the trick if

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.830 
oh the trick if
you're<00:02:54.810> struggling<00:02:55.200> with<00:02:55.439> quarks<00:02:55.829> if<00:02:56.840> did

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
you're struggling with quarks if did

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.449 
you're struggling with quarks if did
that<00:02:58.140> style<00:02:58.500> court<00:02:58.829> does<00:02:58.980> not<00:02:59.010> working

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
that style court does not working

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.380 
that style court does not working
gainers<00:02:59.879> or

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.360 

rolling<00:03:03.200> over<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.560> side<00:03:03.740> of<00:03:03.770> the<00:03:03.920> lake<00:03:04.100> if

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
rolling over the side of the lake if

rolling over the side of the lake if
that<00:03:04.550> does<00:03:04.730> not<00:03:04.819> make<00:03:04.970> sense<00:03:05.030> for<00:03:05.300> you<00:03:05.420> think

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
that does not make sense for you think

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.940 
that does not make sense for you think
about<00:03:06.410> a<00:03:06.530> race<00:03:07.540> swing<00:03:08.540> up<00:03:08.720> as<00:03:08.930> you<00:03:09.590> start<00:03:09.830> to

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
about a race swing up as you start to

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.910 
about a race swing up as you start to
roll<00:03:10.130> over<00:03:10.360> turn<00:03:11.360> your<00:03:11.510> plant<00:03:11.930> leg<00:03:12.170> into<00:03:12.560> a

roll over turn your plant leg into a
massive<00:03:13.670> driving<00:03:14.090> force<00:03:14.360> to<00:03:14.630> carry<00:03:14.930> you<00:03:15.080> over

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
massive driving force to carry you over

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.900 
massive driving force to carry you over
like<00:03:15.470> a<00:03:15.530> raisin<00:03:16.270> so<00:03:17.380> like<00:03:18.380> it's<00:03:18.770> the<00:03:19.430> if<00:03:19.730> you

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
their cork I don't know if they think

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.260 
their cork I don't know if they think
about<00:03:24.860> it<00:03:25.040> like<00:03:25.100> this<00:03:25.250> I<00:03:25.490> haven't<00:03:25.910> talked<00:03:26.180> to

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
like the open and like instead of having

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.550 
like the open and like instead of having
that<00:04:09.120> you're<00:04:09.600> right<00:04:09.810> with<00:04:09.990> your<00:04:10.080> swing<00:04:10.350> like

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
that you're right with your swing like

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.100 
that you're right with your swing like
be<00:04:11.460> the<00:04:11.610> driving<00:04:11.850> force<00:04:12.000> it<00:04:12.450> goes<00:04:12.660> up<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:13.050> a

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
be the driving force it goes up to a

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.740 
be the driving force it goes up to a
point<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.590> you<00:04:13.680> rotate<00:04:14.100> around<00:04:14.250> that<00:04:14.750> that's

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
point and you rotate around that that's

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.120 
point and you rotate around that that's
why<00:04:16.020> you're<00:04:16.080> left<00:04:16.410> like<00:04:16.560> you're<00:04:16.830> you're

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
why you're left like you're you're

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.350 
why you're left like you're you're
landing<00:04:17.280> that<00:04:17.520> is<00:04:17.640> so<00:04:17.760> important<00:04:18.090> that<00:04:18.150> keep

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:18.360 
landing that is so important that keep

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.540 
landing that is so important that keep
saying<00:04:18.540> this<00:04:18.660> because<00:04:18.810> I<00:04:18.960> suppose<00:04:19.170> nothing

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:19.550 
saying this because I suppose nothing

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.040 
saying this because I suppose nothing
but<00:04:20.550> treat<00:04:20.910> it<00:04:21.060> like<00:04:21.180> a<00:04:21.210> race<00:04:21.420> think<00:04:21.900> of<00:04:21.989> it

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.050 
but treat it like a race think of it

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.930 
but treat it like a race think of it
like<00:04:22.110> your<00:04:22.350> races<00:04:22.590> so<00:04:22.740> swing<00:04:22.950> up<00:04:23.100> like<00:04:23.130> almost

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
like your races so swing up like almost

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.460 
like your races so swing up like almost
half<00:04:24.210> turn<00:04:24.480> it's<00:04:24.780> almost<00:04:24.930> like<00:04:25.110> a<00:04:25.260> gain<00:04:25.440> or

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
half turn it's almost like a gain or

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.250 
half turn it's almost like a gain or
half<00:04:25.710> or<00:04:26.460> you<00:04:26.940> know<00:04:27.060> Arabian<00:04:27.390> but<00:04:27.810> you<00:04:27.990> want<00:04:28.200> to

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
half or you know Arabian but you want to

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.870 
half or you know Arabian but you want to
you<00:04:28.500> want<00:04:28.530> to<00:04:28.680> treat<00:04:28.830> a<00:04:28.920> market<00:04:29.220> cork<00:04:29.400> and<00:04:29.550> then

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
you want to treat a market cork and then

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:38.950 
you want to treat a market cork and then
think<00:04:30.180> about<00:04:30.270> race<00:04:30.600> out

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.020
