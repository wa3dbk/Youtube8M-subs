00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
basically it records my screen in real

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.880 
basically it records my screen in real
time<00:00:28.010> and<00:00:28.539> shows<00:00:29.539> where<00:00:30.050> my<00:00:30.140> fingers<00:00:30.500> move<00:00:30.710> it

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
time and shows where my fingers move it

where<00:00:31.010> they<00:00:31.100> tap<00:00:31.369> while<00:00:31.789> I'm<00:00:31.880> doing<00:00:32.059> that

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
where they tap while I'm doing that

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.350 
where they tap while I'm doing that
there<00:00:33.230> are<00:00:33.350> a<00:00:33.410> couple<00:00:33.440> other<00:00:34.030> related<00:00:35.030> tweets

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
there are a couple other related tweets

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.240 
there are a couple other related tweets
that<00:00:35.810> do<00:00:35.930> similar<00:00:36.140> things<00:00:36.350> but<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:37.070> cool

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
that do similar things but the cool

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.680 
that do similar things but the cool
thing<00:00:37.280> about<00:00:37.460> this<00:00:37.700> one<00:00:37.940> is<00:00:38.150> that<00:00:38.239> it<00:00:38.540> actually

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
thing about this one is that it actually

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.740 
thing about this one is that it actually
records<00:00:39.380> in<00:00:39.470> real<00:00:39.680> time<00:00:39.950> so<00:00:40.700> there's<00:00:41.120> no<00:00:41.270> delay

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
records in real time so there's no delay

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.910 
records in real time so there's no delay
and<00:00:42.680> in<00:00:43.430> this<00:00:44.180> case<00:00:44.450> I'm<00:00:44.750> able<00:00:44.960> to<00:00:45.110> record<00:00:45.530> and

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
and in this case I'm able to record and

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.590 
and in this case I'm able to record and
speak<00:00:46.340> at<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:46.579> same<00:00:46.790> time<00:00:47.030> without<00:00:47.239> having<00:00:47.540> to

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
speak at the same time without having to

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.380 
speak at the same time without having to
worry<00:00:47.780> about<00:00:47.840> synchronization<00:00:48.770> issues<00:00:49.390> it

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
worry about synchronization issues it

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.120 
worry about synchronization issues it
doesn't<00:00:50.690> have<00:00:50.780> an<00:00:50.930> audio<00:00:51.320> feature<00:00:51.620> yet<00:00:51.920> where

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
doesn't have an audio feature yet where

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.940 
doesn't have an audio feature yet where
it<00:00:52.219> records<00:00:52.670> both<00:00:52.850> audio<00:00:53.300> and<00:00:53.540> the<00:00:54.290> display

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
it records both audio and the display

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.889 
it records both audio and the display
but<00:00:55.640> it<00:00:55.940> should<00:00:56.300> be<00:00:56.329> coming<00:00:56.750> up<00:00:56.840> soon

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
but it should be coming up soon

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.660 
but it should be coming up soon
according<00:00:57.500> to<00:00:57.770> what<00:00:57.950> the<00:00:58.070> developer<00:00:58.640> has

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
according to what the developer has

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.889 
according to what the developer has
hinted<00:00:59.629> at<00:00:59.980> so<00:01:00.980> when<00:01:01.280> you<00:01:01.430> install<00:01:02.120> it<00:01:02.149> it's

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
hinted at so when you install it it's

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.859 
hinted at so when you install it it's
going<00:01:03.110> to<00:01:03.170> show<00:01:03.379> up<00:01:03.469> as<00:01:03.620> an<00:01:03.710> icon<00:01:04.100> on<00:01:04.369> your

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
going to show up as an icon on your

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.239 
going to show up as an icon on your
springboard<00:01:05.869> and<00:01:06.139> as<00:01:06.409> you<00:01:06.530> can<00:01:06.649> see<00:01:06.679> here<00:01:07.100> on

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:07.249 
springboard and as you can see here on

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:09.639 
springboard and as you can see here on
my<00:01:07.369> springboard<00:01:07.929> it<00:01:08.929> has<00:01:09.079> it<00:01:09.259> there<00:01:09.409> and<00:01:09.560> the

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
my springboard it has it there and the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:11.230 
my springboard it has it there and the
little<00:01:09.859> red<00:01:10.009> dot<00:01:10.249> means<00:01:10.459> that<00:01:10.639> i'm<00:01:10.729> recording

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
little red dot means that i'm recording

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.059 
little red dot means that i'm recording
so<00:01:11.509> that<00:01:11.869> means<00:01:12.049> that<00:01:12.229> i'm<00:01:12.350> recording<00:01:13.009> this

00:01:13.059 --> 00:01:13.069 
so that means that i'm recording this

display recorder from your actual screen

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.109 
display recorder from your actual screen
it<00:01:54.200> requires<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:54.679> program<00:01:55.189> called<00:01:55.369> activator

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
it requires a program called activator

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.599

00:01:58.599 --> 00:01:58.609 
so if you want to try that out try that

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:01.499 
so if you want to try that out try that
out<00:01:58.639> you<00:01:58.849> should<00:01:58.999> download<00:01:59.149> it<00:01:59.450> it's<00:01:59.569> free<00:01:59.810> and

usually if you were to turn it on
without<00:02:04.729> activator<00:02:05.479> installed<00:02:06.169> and<00:02:06.560> in<00:02:07.069> use

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
without activator installed and in use
