00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.050
 android and windows android 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.020
 AndrÃ©, of course, were reasons 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.949
 are more versatile to tune the 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.879
 module but you have rooted the mobile or 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:43.449

 phone that you want 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.250
 and because if I tell you the truth I have only 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.860
 had that experience them in a 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.960
 phone have never had beginning and 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.780
 I stay with what you know without android 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.030
 and the terminal that you prefer 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.520
 terminals I had some different 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.729
 brands I'm happy with sony sony 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.729
 xperia 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.330
 windows phone that you want your day that the 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.310
 kind of all the windows phone 1.2 and the 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.619
 tested in a microsoft terminal or in a 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.840
 nokia lumen in that you see him because alumni 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.399
 what has been the experience if you have to 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.930
 pretty regular because it's hard to find 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.420
 applications manage all for the 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.259
 operating system which are there are 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.869
 habitas 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.090
 we are not powerful so I think that in 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.940
 that sense have this address of 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.280
 advantage but you are an android user 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.179
 there is also a phone each 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.340
 motive company I have the staff that is 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:47.810
 I have an audiovisual the election at 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.310
 big differences over everything 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.020
 what do you say in the applications the best 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.950
 it is correctly because it is 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.670
 trying to develop their applications 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.340
 and improvement day to day today can not 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.060

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:05.469

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:09.340

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:14.010
 to applications like mail is 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:16.510
 like social networks I have a lot 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.569

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.510
 aunts stress better than no battery 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.670
 that lasts longer than in the rest of 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.230
 terminals in istanbul two days and in 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.910
 the rest of the day of the video I'm all 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.470
 delighted in it, not because you already know 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.880
 blackberry you also have to add what 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.200
 same implant to test the rest but 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.190

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.880

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.610
 albania ok 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:56.950
 Android or windows phone what do you prefer 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:58.900
 Android because I have not tried any other 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.630
 operating system I have not only had 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.380
 before and from phone brands that is what 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.380
 what better has come out 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.490
 if you want but it has brought me problems and 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.360
 since then it is not in 3 s 4 vale 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.360
 thank you very much nothing 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:24.810
 android 2 1 and it seems we have 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.810
 winner and also by a landslide 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.330
 Android gets three points windows was 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.060

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.430
 and finally black berry also with one 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.010
 it was not necessary to ask everything 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.810
 madrid to realize that 50 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:46.030
 percent take - android 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.030
 android god or windows phone 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:59.849
