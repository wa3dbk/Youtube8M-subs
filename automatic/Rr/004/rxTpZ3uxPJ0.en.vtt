stuff and the Dutch beaner you know so I

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.120 
stuff and the Dutch beaner you know so I
think<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.329> says<00:01:51.450> add<00:01:51.570> link<00:01:51.780> teen<00:01:51.960> grams<00:01:52.259> you

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
think it says add link teen grams you

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.130 
think it says add link teen grams you
can<00:01:53.310> get<00:01:53.430> these<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:54.479> can<00:01:54.600> get<00:01:54.720> two<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:54.960> these

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
can get these you can get two of these

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.719 
can get these you can get two of these
possibly<00:01:55.770> three<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.280> these<00:01:56.399> for<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.700> same

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
possibly three of these for the same

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.149

only three to four grams heavier okay my

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.889 
only three to four grams heavier okay my
opinion<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.119> mean<00:02:03.299> that's<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.600> way<00:02:03.689> I'm<00:02:03.780> gonna

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
opinion I mean that's the way I'm gonna

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.959 
opinion I mean that's the way I'm gonna
go<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.500> know<00:02:04.530> I'm<00:02:04.950> definitely<00:02:05.159> gonna<00:02:05.430> go<00:02:05.700> with

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
go you know I'm definitely gonna go with

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.479 
go you know I'm definitely gonna go with
with<00:02:06.450> sometimes<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.810> little<00:02:06.990> cheaper

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
with sometimes a little cheaper

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:09.380 
with sometimes a little cheaper
particularly<00:02:08.489> if<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.640> can<00:02:08.759> get<00:02:08.849> multiples<00:02:09.270> of

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
particularly if I can get multiples of

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.180 
particularly if I can get multiples of
it<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:10.020> same<00:02:10.170> strength<00:02:10.590> which<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.009> can

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
it and the same strength which you can

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.650 
it and the same strength which you can
so<00:02:11.550> I've<00:02:11.640> been<00:02:11.700> using<00:02:11.879> this<00:02:12.060> for<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.450> little

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
so I've been using this for a little

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.640 
so I've been using this for a little
while<00:02:12.840> now

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
while now

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.380 
while now
I've<00:02:14.010> had<00:02:14.160> them<00:02:14.310> out<00:02:14.489> in<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.970> cold<00:02:15.120> whether

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
I've had them out in the cold whether

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.350 
I've had them out in the cold whether
they<00:02:15.780> work<00:02:15.930> perfectly<00:02:16.260> perfectly<00:02:17.099> well<00:02:17.370> I've

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
they work perfectly perfectly well I've

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.910 
they work perfectly perfectly well I've
used<00:02:18.390> them<00:02:18.690> in<00:02:18.810> some<00:02:19.290> warmer<00:02:19.530> temperatures

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
used them in some warmer temperatures

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.470 
used them in some warmer temperatures
that<00:02:20.069> were<00:02:20.160> perfectly<00:02:20.459> well<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.330> cool

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
that were perfectly well and the cool

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.650 
that were perfectly well and the cool
thing<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:21.690> they<00:02:22.410> make<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.590> lot<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:23.040> different

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
thing is they make a lot of different

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.440 
thing is they make a lot of different
colors<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:24.870> for<00:02:25.530> example<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.130> is<00:02:26.340> my

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
colors so for example this is my

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.410 
colors so for example this is my
fiance's<00:02:27.709> setup<00:02:28.709> as<00:02:28.860> far<00:02:29.069> as<00:02:29.190> her/him<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.269> goes

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
fiance's setup as far as her/him it goes

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.540 
fiance's setup as far as her/him it goes
and<00:02:30.720> she<00:02:30.840> uses<00:02:31.019> these<00:02:31.319> purple<00:02:32.010> ones<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:32.489> you

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
and she uses these purple ones so you

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.520 
and she uses these purple ones so you
can<00:02:32.640> see<00:02:32.790> they<00:02:32.880> make<00:02:32.910> different<00:02:33.120> colors<00:02:33.569> you

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
can see they make different colors you

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.259 
can see they make different colors you
know<00:02:34.590> they<00:02:34.709> make<00:02:34.860> like<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.430> bronze<00:02:35.760> they<00:02:36.090> make<00:02:36.239> a

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
know they make like a bronze they make a

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.360 
know they make like a bronze they make a
green<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.900> black<00:02:37.170> or<00:02:37.980> just<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.220> regular

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
green the black or just a regular

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.800 
green the black or just a regular
natural<00:02:38.970> one<00:02:39.090> they<00:02:39.209> make<00:02:39.360> all<00:02:39.510> kinds<00:02:39.540> of

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
natural one they make all kinds of

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.350 
natural one they make all kinds of
different<00:02:39.989> colors<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.760> you<00:02:41.760> can<00:02:41.849> see<00:02:42.120> I'll<00:02:42.269> do

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
different colors and you can see I'll do

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.630 
different colors and you can see I'll do
a<00:02:42.390> close-up<00:02:42.870> here<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.099> can<00:02:44.220> kind<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.430> see

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
a close-up here so you can kind of see

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.270 
a close-up here so you can kind of see
exactly<00:02:45.450> what<00:02:45.690> this<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:45.959> all<00:02:46.080> about<00:02:46.160> there<00:02:47.160> we

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
exactly what this is all about there we

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.920 
exactly what this is all about there we
go

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
go

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.509 
go
okay<00:02:48.930> super<00:02:49.500> lightweight<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.130> can<00:02:50.160> see<00:02:50.400> they

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
okay super lightweight you can see they

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:51.860 
okay super lightweight you can see they
kind<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.819> come<00:02:50.940> in<00:02:51.060> here<00:02:51.209> and<00:02:51.330> grind<00:02:51.510> this<00:02:51.690> out

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
kind of come in here and grind this out

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.840 
kind of come in here and grind this out
a<00:02:51.900> little<00:02:52.110> bit<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:53.130> got<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.340> wire<00:02:53.549> gate

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
a little bit and you got the wire gate

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.820 
a little bit and you got the wire gate
which<00:02:54.030> I<00:02:54.120> like<00:02:54.299> a<00:02:54.330> lot<00:02:54.600> because<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:55.620> know<00:02:55.709> it's

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
which I like a lot because you know it's

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.250 
which I like a lot because you know it's
the<00:02:55.890> most<00:02:55.980> simplistic<00:02:56.370> design<00:02:56.780> but<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:58.140> know

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
the most simplistic design but you know

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.420 
the most simplistic design but you know
you<00:02:58.319> don't<00:02:58.410> have<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.709> worry<00:02:58.890> about<00:02:58.920> screws

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
you don't have to worry about screws

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.789 
you don't have to worry about screws
locking<00:02:59.849> up<00:02:59.970> in<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.150> wintertime<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:01.080> lot<00:03:01.650> of

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
locking up in the wintertime a lot of

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:02.930 
locking up in the wintertime a lot of
different<00:03:02.069> stuff<00:03:02.310> when<00:03:02.489> you're<00:03:02.580> using<00:03:02.760> a
