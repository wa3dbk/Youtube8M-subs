00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.549
 hello girls welcome once again in 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:06.350
 this time we gathered to learn to do 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.830
 a nice decoration for nails 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.300
 feet with butterflies below girls 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.220
 we start with our decoration 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.920
 where will I use these two colors 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.500
 the white and the neon color we will paint 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.390
 our nails in this way for the 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.539
 next step I will use this color 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.840
 pink and this purple color and a sponge 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.330
 small we will take a little paint 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.239
 rosita conect blanca let's draw the 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.840
 butterfly we will start to give a few 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.700
 little touches this way once 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.440
 we did the top part now let's 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.040
 do the bottom part but with the other 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.650
 colour 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.080
 to give it a mixed effect we are going to 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.110
 use of the two colors in each 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.080
 from the sides this black color what 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.360
 use for the next easy in this 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.400
 step let's take a thin brush and 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.030
 black paint let's delineate the 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.030
 butterfly 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.270
 the wings of the butterfly are already at home 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.530
 now let's do the bottom part 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.530
 what would be the position 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:31.430
 to make butterfly antennas 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:33.830
 let's use a thinner brush 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.050
 once they are still the antennas of 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.050
 the butterfly we are going to add one more wing 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.340
 We are going to paint the bottom of the 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.670
 wing of the butterfly of the same color 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.280
 rosita 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.960
 if the color has simply been passed 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.700
 let's delineate the other time with the 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.900
 black color and ready 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.640
 to give one more detail to this 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.830
 decoration let's make some lines that 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.270
 come out of the bottom part towards 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.920
 up in total would be 3 in the part of 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:12.009
 the tip of the lines we are going to do 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.009
 small dots in each of them 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.900
 As details of the decoration I will 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.060
 use of these stones to put 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.550
 on the wings of the butterfly 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.520
 once we have finished applying the 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.940
 pebbles finally we will apply the base 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.450
 transparent enamel 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.370
 and it would be all 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.379
 this is the final result of our 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.180
 decoration I hope you like ideas and
