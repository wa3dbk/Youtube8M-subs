a lot of the simul overall design

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.229 
a lot of the simul overall design
concepts<00:00:23.859> that<00:00:24.009> you<00:00:24.069> saw<00:00:24.400> on<00:00:24.609> the<00:00:24.759> total<00:00:25.060> one

so<00:00:25.779> starting<00:00:26.109> out<00:00:26.230> on<00:00:26.439> the<00:00:26.529> front<00:00:26.769> portion<00:00:27.189> you

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
so starting out on the front portion you

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.800 
so starting out on the front portion you
have<00:00:27.669> several<00:00:27.970> different<00:00:28.239> layers<00:00:28.599> that

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
have several different layers that

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:29.969 
have several different layers that
they're<00:00:28.960> using<00:00:29.259> here<00:00:29.409> it's<00:00:29.529> actually<00:00:29.619> five

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:29.979 
they're using here it's actually five

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:31.469 
they're using here it's actually five
different<00:00:30.339> layers<00:00:30.489> of<00:00:30.669> material<00:00:31.029> you<00:00:31.390> have

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:31.479 
different layers of material you have

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:32.910 
different layers of material you have
that<00:00:31.630> center<00:00:31.989> portion<00:00:32.259> which<00:00:32.529> is<00:00:32.649> going<00:00:32.800> to<00:00:32.860> be

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
that center portion which is going to be

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.740 
that center portion which is going to be
the<00:00:33.010> bulk<00:00:33.250> of<00:00:33.430> your<00:00:33.460> protection<00:00:33.970> and<00:00:34.329> then<00:00:34.660> you

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
the bulk of your protection and then you

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.480 
the bulk of your protection and then you
have<00:00:34.840> a<00:00:34.899> single<00:00:35.230> density<00:00:35.500> perforated<00:00:36.250> foam

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:36.490 
have a single density perforated foam

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.940 
have a single density perforated foam
here<00:00:36.760> and<00:00:36.940> an<00:00:37.360> additional<00:00:37.900> layer<00:00:38.320> of<00:00:38.650> single

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
here and an additional layer of single

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.740 
here and an additional layer of single
density<00:00:39.070> foam<00:00:39.400> in<00:00:39.580> the<00:00:39.640> outer<00:00:39.820> portion<00:00:39.970> so

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
density foam in the outer portion so

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.910 
density foam in the outer portion so
it's<00:00:40.870> really<00:00:41.050> going<00:00:41.140> to<00:00:41.200> offer<00:00:41.440> a<00:00:41.650> great

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
it's really going to offer a great

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.500 
it's really going to offer a great
little<00:00:42.160> protection<00:00:42.610> being<00:00:42.940> that<00:00:43.090> it<00:00:43.180> doubles

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
little protection being that it doubles

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.480 
little protection being that it doubles
up<00:00:43.660> in<00:00:43.810> certain<00:00:44.140> areas<00:00:44.260> but<00:00:44.860> also<00:00:44.920> being<00:00:45.370> that

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.490 
up in certain areas but also being that

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.850 
up in certain areas but also being that
you're<00:00:45.610> not<00:00:45.700> overloaded<00:00:46.450> with<00:00:46.480> /<00:00:46.840> foams<00:00:47.530> in

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
you're not overloaded with / foams in

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.020 
you're not overloaded with / foams in
areas<00:00:48.130> that<00:00:48.160> you<00:00:48.310> don't<00:00:48.490> need<00:00:48.760> the<00:00:48.880> protection

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
areas that you don't need the protection

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.820 
areas that you don't need the protection
as<00:00:49.450> much<00:00:49.630> so<00:00:50.080> it's<00:00:50.200> going<00:00:50.350> to<00:00:50.410> give<00:00:50.530> this<00:00:50.590> pad<00:00:50.800> a

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
as much so it's going to give this pad a

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.560 
as much so it's going to give this pad a
nice<00:00:50.980> a<00:00:51.040> lightweight<00:00:51.490> feel<00:00:51.790> as<00:00:52.030> well<00:00:52.390> as<00:00:52.450> some

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
nice a lightweight feel as well as some

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.120 
nice a lightweight feel as well as some
great<00:00:52.780> pad<00:00:53.050> coverage<00:00:53.470> so<00:00:53.650> you'll<00:00:53.770> have<00:00:53.860> a<00:00:53.920> good

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
great pad coverage so you'll have a good

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.410 
great pad coverage so you'll have a good
portion<00:00:54.400> of<00:00:54.610> your<00:00:54.730> upper<00:00:54.970> body<00:00:55.090> that's<00:00:55.300> going

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
portion of your upper body that's going

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.360 
portion of your upper body that's going
to<00:00:55.480> be<00:00:55.540> covered<00:00:55.780> by<00:00:55.870> the<00:00:55.930> pad<00:00:56.200> in<00:00:56.980> the<00:00:57.100> center

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
to be covered by the pad in the center

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.830 
to be covered by the pad in the center
you<00:00:57.430> have<00:00:57.490> that<00:00:57.700> hex<00:00:57.940> or<00:00:58.150> material<00:00:58.570> so<00:00:58.690> that's

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
you have that hex or material so that's

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.350 
you have that hex or material so that's
going<00:00:58.930> to<00:00:58.990> be<00:00:59.050> basically<00:00:59.890> the<00:01:00.280> VN<00:01:00.760> foam<00:01:01.120> that

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
going to be basically the VN foam that

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.270 
going to be basically the VN foam that
has<00:01:01.540> the<00:01:01.810> skin<00:01:02.110> added<00:01:02.440> to<00:01:02.560> it<00:01:02.680> then<00:01:02.860> some<00:01:03.070> holes

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
has the skin added to it then some holes

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.219 
has the skin added to it then some holes
cut<00:01:03.579> out<00:01:03.610> to<00:01:04.239> allow<00:01:04.449> it<00:01:04.479> to<00:01:04.659> decrease<00:01:05.199> the

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
cut out to allow it to decrease the

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.529 
cut out to allow it to decrease the
weight<00:01:05.530> by<00:01:06.040> increasing<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.119> overall<00:01:07.149> level

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:07.539 
weight by increasing the overall level

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:09.149 
weight by increasing the overall level
protection<00:01:07.840> then<00:01:08.619> you<00:01:08.710> also<00:01:08.829> have<00:01:08.950> some

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
protection then you also have some

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:10.590 
protection then you also have some
plastic<00:01:09.579> inserts<00:01:09.909> and<00:01:10.119> these<00:01:10.210> little<00:01:10.450> pieces

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
plastic inserts and these little pieces

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.389 
plastic inserts and these little pieces
right<00:01:10.929> in<00:01:10.990> here<00:01:11.409> which<00:01:11.829> is<00:01:11.950> going<00:01:12.069> to<00:01:12.130> increase

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
right in here which is going to increase

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:13.980 
right in here which is going to increase
the<00:01:12.609> overall<00:01:12.700> level<00:01:13.030> protection<00:01:13.299> once<00:01:13.749> again

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
the overall level protection once again

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.690 
the overall level protection once again
like<00:01:14.109> I<00:01:14.229> said<00:01:14.259> but<00:01:14.890> being<00:01:15.100> that's<00:01:15.219> only<00:01:15.520> in

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
like I said but being that's only in

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.910 
like I said but being that's only in
those<00:01:15.819> key<00:01:16.240> hype<00:01:16.659> impact<00:01:17.229> areas<00:01:17.590> you're<00:01:17.799> not

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
those key hype impact areas you're not

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.649 
those key hype impact areas you're not
going<00:01:18.100> to<00:01:18.159> weigh<00:01:18.670> down<00:01:18.789> the<00:01:18.909> pad<00:01:19.179> very<00:01:19.450> much

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
going to weigh down the pad very much

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.109 
going to weigh down the pad very much
going<00:01:20.319> on<00:01:20.530> to<00:01:20.679> the<00:01:20.799> side<00:01:21.039> as<00:01:21.310> far<00:01:21.340> as<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:21.850> arch

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
going on to the side as far as the arch

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.879 
going on to the side as far as the arch
protection<00:01:22.719> goes<00:01:22.869> they<00:01:23.350> went<00:01:23.560> ahead<00:01:23.679> and

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:23.889 
protection goes they went ahead and

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:26.459 
protection goes they went ahead and
increase<00:01:24.249> this<00:01:24.639> and<00:01:24.909> basically<00:01:25.109> the<00:01:26.109> front

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:26.469 
increase this and basically the front

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:27.870 
increase this and basically the front
panel<00:01:26.679> and<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.009> back<00:01:27.219> panel<00:01:27.460> that<00:01:27.639> you'll<00:01:27.759> see

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
panel and the back panel that you'll see

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.819 
panel and the back panel that you'll see
in<00:01:27.939> a<00:01:27.999> moment<00:01:28.119> kind<00:01:28.569> of<00:01:28.659> carry<00:01:28.929> over<00:01:29.170> into<00:01:29.350> the

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
in a moment kind of carry over into the

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.440 
in a moment kind of carry over into the
arch<00:01:30.100> protection<00:01:30.759> so<00:01:31.119> that's<00:01:31.240> going<00:01:31.329> to<00:01:31.389> be

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
arch protection so that's going to be

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.090 
arch protection so that's going to be
one<00:01:31.659> piece<00:01:31.990> so<00:01:32.170> it's<00:01:32.319> going<00:01:32.409> to<00:01:32.469> help<00:01:32.619> decrease

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
one piece so it's going to help decrease

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.039 
one piece so it's going to help decrease
the<00:01:33.429> amount<00:01:33.639> of<00:01:33.909> material<00:01:34.299> required<00:01:34.689> to<00:01:34.899> hold

pieces so you have single density foams

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.350 
pieces so you have single density foams
here<00:02:43.010> there's<00:02:43.400> little<00:02:43.580> single<00:02:43.850> density<00:02:43.970> foams
