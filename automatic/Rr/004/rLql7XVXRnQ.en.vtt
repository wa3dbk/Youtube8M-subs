bit of timing to be able to hack into
these<00:02:27.170> doors<00:02:27.440> before<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.040> system<00:02:28.490> catches

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
these doors before the system catches

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.490 
these doors before the system catches
you<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.180> punts<00:02:29.510> you<00:02:29.630> out<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:30.020> then<00:02:30.080> alarm

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
you and punts you out and then alarm

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.500 
you and punts you out and then alarm
goes<00:02:30.770> off<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:31.880> there's<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.120> lot<00:02:32.300> of<00:02:32.420> these

come<00:03:58.430> out<00:03:58.600> so<00:03:59.600> I<00:03:59.930> don't<00:04:00.470> think<00:04:00.680> they<00:04:00.770> handled

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
come out so I don't think they handled

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.520 
come out so I don't think they handled
it<00:04:01.250> well<00:04:01.459> from<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:01.790> start<00:04:02.120> but<00:04:02.630> towards<00:04:03.350> the

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
it well from the start but towards the

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.080 
it well from the start but towards the
end<00:04:03.680> they<00:04:03.860> definitely<00:04:04.160> were<00:04:04.550> good<00:04:04.850> they

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
end they definitely were good they

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.390 
end they definitely were good they
turned<00:04:05.390> it<00:04:05.570> around<00:04:05.890> they<00:04:06.890> weren't<00:04:07.190> sticking

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
turned it around they weren't sticking

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.470 
turned it around they weren't sticking
to<00:04:07.610> their<00:04:07.730> guns<00:04:07.760> like<00:04:08.030> some<00:04:08.209> of<00:04:08.300> the<00:04:08.360> other

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480

much against them they were just trying

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.320 
much against them they were just trying
to<00:04:30.319> thwart<00:04:30.500> piracy<00:04:31.190> even<00:04:31.849> though<00:04:32.000> it<00:04:32.120> was<00:04:32.210> like

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
to thwart piracy even though it was like

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.809 
to thwart piracy even though it was like
a<00:04:32.389> bad<00:04:32.720> way<00:04:32.960> of<00:04:32.990> going<00:04:33.229> about<00:04:33.560> it<00:04:33.620> I<00:04:34.220> don't<00:04:34.460> hold
