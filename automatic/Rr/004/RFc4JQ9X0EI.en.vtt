 mining suppliers configurarequipos dotcom 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:20.559
 we prefer to leave the present fire before spending the long time 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.259
 loading any operating system 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.689
 in this video or we will teach to remove those applications that 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.550
 his music is what we 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.100
 system start 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.470
 and for that we are going to touch some configurations the windows system 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.470
 so let's see 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.560
 dyn in this video we will teach 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.560
 to remove applications 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.309
 of the system start 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.770
 operative in this case windows 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.370
 good and for that 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.170
 We are going to use 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.170
 system configuration 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.450
 we will find turin 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.770
 accessing at least visible 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.580
 and typing in that conflict 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.580
 just as it is on screen 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.460
 or we can also access by pressing the key 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.350
 windows r 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.030
 i selecting also count producing 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.950
 the chain in that context 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.170
 in either of the two ways 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.570
 we would enter Oaxaca because of the concentration of the system 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.000
 Within the system configuration we will find different tabs 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.140
 that allow us to confirm 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.050
 the start of this cooperative mode 15 stores 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.660
 The first thing I will explain is how 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.040
 remove applications 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.260
 of the start to reduce if the service charge and time 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.280
 quintana the operating system 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.700
 take care one hundred percent 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.460
 I noticed that when you scale and many programs this is added and if they start 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.480
 next to the cooperative system 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.780
 that worry 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.510
 even longer waiting time until we can between fans began 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.550
 ashes 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.140
 our operating system 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.580
 good for it 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.829
 let's go to the home tab of windows p 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:12.499
 and inside that spider fish we find 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:14.969
 a check box 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:18.339
 by default activated 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:23.889
 a group or list of applications as you see the point is loaded points this 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:24.899
 case we see 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:27.019
 that the antivirus is loaded 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.849
 such a young service costs ain 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.819
 the countries of the video cards 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.829
 the signed reader 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.459
 the pdf during this Saturday 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.859
 the first the immense ender 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:44.329
 in order different injuries that are loaded together with the operating system 

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:48.509
 the problem such purpose that there are many applications 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:52.549
 that we do not use in day to day 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:53.869
 first 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:55.259
 increase the time 

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:57.179
 operating system load 

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:59.609
 and on the other hand when loading 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.069
 I know that in the last second plane i 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.029
 consume resources that we have left of another benefit we will present to 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:07.689
 perform 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.659
 so the goal of tutorials 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.599
 detect which applications are not futile 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.499
 John Houston Good Expendables 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:17.769
 i remove the definition 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:18.940
 good for it 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.269
 It is clear that we will have to check 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.029
 what applications and charges next to benicio 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:27.310
 i detect which of them are not dispensable 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.429
 for example 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:31.089
 tulcan does not have to be 

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:33.019
 a dispensable application 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.439
 adobe acrobat 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:36.699
 if I open a pdf file 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:37.840
 directly in 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.279
 windows huelva 

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:41.430
 associate this pdf file 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.329
 adobe acrobat and then it will be when words 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:45.230
 this viewer 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.159
 and it is not therefore we are going to have to have the open from the first hour 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.260
 another service that could perfectly dem all 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.489
 percent and more stain is a problem of 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.399
 video management in order 

00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:02.369
 we will have scada here and stay overnight and you will not be able to cities 

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:03.369
 sativa 

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:07.319
 once I have logged the applications that I do not want to be loaded with the 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.869
 windows start simply 

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:12.939
 pulse about applying 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:16.469
 and once you have to apply the changes directly on ascer 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.500
 now of course as any change in the system 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.879
 does not require resignation 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:25.490
 and when we start 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.240
 this application is that both 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.119
 of selected will no longer return the initial joined operating systems 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.740
 simple moto2 category that results 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.770
 Remove applications from the operating system 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.909
 it's important to have on mind 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:45.939
 it means that you have to detect 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:49.930
 which applications are dispensable and which are not and for that you can search 

00:04:49.929 --> 00:04:52.129
 end information in the rest 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:55.139
 or directly focus our forums 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.199
 by dotcom teams to solve these and other doubts in favor
