00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
over here this is about as long as it is

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.700 
over here this is about as long as it is
right<00:02:07.870> now<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:09.250> that<00:02:10.530> something<00:02:11.530> growing

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
right now and that something growing

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.700 
right now and that something growing
pretty<00:02:11.950> good<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.780> it's<00:02:13.780> been<00:02:13.960> doing<00:02:14.260> well<00:02:14.440> on

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
pretty good and it's been doing well on

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.380 
pretty good and it's been doing well on
the<00:02:15.310> goal<00:02:15.520> is<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:15.970> get<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.710> waist<00:02:17.710> length<00:02:18.390> that

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
the goal is to get it waist length that

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.060 
the goal is to get it waist length that
depends<00:02:19.720> on<00:02:19.900> how<00:02:20.050> heavy<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.500> gets<00:02:20.710> because<00:02:20.980> I

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
depends on how heavy it gets because I

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.800 
depends on how heavy it gets because I
see<00:02:21.250> a<00:02:21.280> lot<00:02:21.460> of<00:02:21.520> people<00:02:21.730> with<00:02:22.000> dreads<00:02:22.480> that

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
see a lot of people with dreads that

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.240 
see a lot of people with dreads that
they've<00:02:22.990> grown<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:23.410> out<00:02:23.530> for<00:02:23.710> a<00:02:23.770> while<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.160> it

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
they've grown it out for a while and it

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.400 
they've grown it out for a while and it
looks<00:02:25.060> heavy<00:02:25.860> so<00:02:26.860> it<00:02:27.750> depends<00:02:28.750> on<00:02:28.930> that<00:02:29.080> but

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
looks heavy so it depends on that but

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.810 
looks heavy so it depends on that but
the<00:02:29.620> goal<00:02:29.800> is<00:02:29.830> to<00:02:30.040> have<00:02:30.280> it<00:02:31.200> wait<00:02:32.200> for<00:02:32.440> me<00:02:32.820> how

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
the goal is to have it wait for me how

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:49.800 
the goal is to have it wait for me how
it<00:02:34.000> goes<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:35.200> here's<00:02:36.070> more<00:02:36.430> shots<00:02:36.850> of<00:02:37.060> it<00:02:48.810> and

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
it goes and here's more shots of it and

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.460 
it goes and here's more shots of it and
the<00:02:50.140> front<00:02:50.320> again<00:02:51.420> so<00:02:52.420> I'm<00:02:53.110> just<00:02:53.260> going<00:02:53.410> to

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
the front again so I'm just going to
