all<00:01:21.090> warfare<00:01:21.299> 3<00:01:21.780> um<00:01:21.990> nothing<00:01:22.650> has<00:01:22.920> been

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
all warfare 3 um nothing has been

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.469 
all warfare 3 um nothing has been
confirmed<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.759> just<00:01:23.970> what<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.180> think

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
confirmed this is just what I think

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.780 
confirmed this is just what I think
should<00:01:24.900> happen<00:01:25.140> maybe<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.310> should<00:01:26.340> send<00:01:26.670> this

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
should happen maybe you should send this

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.359 
should happen maybe you should send this
to<00:01:26.970> some<00:01:27.150> model<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:27.600> three<00:01:27.810> people<00:01:28.200> anyway<00:01:29.070> um

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
to some model for three people anyway um

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.030 
to some model for three people anyway um
I<00:01:29.850> think<00:01:30.030> quickscoping<00:01:30.840> should<00:01:31.200> be<00:01:31.380> back<00:01:31.590> but

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
I think quickscoping should be back but

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.249 
I think quickscoping should be back but
like<00:01:32.220> if<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.000> called<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.479> key<00:01:33.600> for<00:01:33.840> quick<00:01:34.079> swim

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
like if I called the key for quick swim

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.050 
like if I called the key for quick swim
because<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:34.590> black<00:01:34.829> ops<00:01:35.070> like<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.610> took<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.909> lot

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
because in black ops like it took a lot

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.590 
because in black ops like it took a lot
of<00:01:36.119> skill<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.900> liked<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.259> but<00:01:38.250> um<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.729> think

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
of skill and I liked that but um I think

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.749 
of skill and I liked that but um I think
it'd<00:01:39.720> be<00:01:39.750> cooler<00:01:40.259> if<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:41.040> think<00:01:41.400> it'd<00:01:41.490> be<00:01:41.520> better

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
it'd be cooler if I think it'd be better

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.149 
it'd be cooler if I think it'd be better
because<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.899> recoil<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.649> black<00:01:43.920> ops

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
because like the recoil of the black ops

zoom in faster I think it should always

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.870 
zoom in faster I think it should always
be<00:06:39.360> as<00:06:39.570> slow<00:06:39.900> as<00:06:39.930> it<00:06:40.230> is<00:06:40.380> and<00:06:41.130> called<00:06:41.370> it<00:06:41.520> before

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 
be as slow as it is and called it before

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.450 
be as slow as it is and called it before
