00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
the best strategies that I've seen on

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.730 
the best strategies that I've seen on
this<00:00:17.850> map<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.720> what<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.199> basically<00:00:19.350> want<00:00:19.560> to

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
this map and what you basically want to

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.250 
this map and what you basically want to
do<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:20.189> just<00:00:20.369> basically<00:00:20.850> it's<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.900> kind<00:00:22.109> of

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
do is just basically it's to kind of

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.810 
do is just basically it's to kind of
spot<00:00:22.470> something<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.369> get<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.609> was<00:00:23.699> your

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
spot something that you get it was your

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.939 
spot something that you get it was your
friend<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.420> won't<00:00:24.689> be<00:00:24.810> as<00:00:24.900> hard<00:00:24.930> because<00:00:25.350> if

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
friend it won't be as hard because if

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.609 
friend it won't be as hard because if
you<00:00:26.070> do<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.310> solo<00:00:26.810> I'm<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.019> strategy<00:00:28.349> so

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
you do it solo I'm in the strategy so

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.460 
you do it solo I'm in the strategy so
it's<00:00:28.980> gonna<00:00:29.210> more<00:00:30.210> difficult<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:31.109> might<00:00:31.260> take

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
it's gonna more difficult it might take

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.870 
it's gonna more difficult it might take
longer<00:00:31.619> time<00:00:31.949> with<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.399> your<00:00:32.489> friend<00:00:32.730> but

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
longer time with you and your friend but

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.910 
longer time with you and your friend but
it's<00:00:33.000> gonna<00:00:33.120> be<00:00:33.239> way<00:00:33.600> easier<00:00:33.829> because<00:00:34.829> I'm

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
it's gonna be way easier because I'm

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.290 
it's gonna be way easier because I'm
gonna<00:00:35.040> be<00:00:35.100> switching<00:00:35.430> back<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.670> forth<00:00:35.880> with

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
gonna be switching back and forth with

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.229 
gonna be switching back and forth with
me<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.780> my<00:00:36.840> friend<00:00:37.079> Justin<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.160> his<00:00:39.030> link

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.030 
me and my friend Justin and his link
will<00:00:39.360> be<00:00:39.450> in<00:00:39.480> description<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:40.140> think<00:00:40.410> he<00:00:40.920> has<00:00:41.010> a

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
but uh yeah it's gonna switching in

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.389 
but uh yeah it's gonna switching in
between<00:00:45.600> points<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.170> view<00:00:46.260> just<00:00:46.320> like<00:00:46.620> now<00:00:46.770> he

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
between points of view just like now he

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.799 
between points of view just like now he
has<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> staff<00:00:47.760> lightning<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.450> have<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> staff

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809

has a staff lightning and I have a staff
of<00:00:48.840> fire<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.760> what<00:00:50.760> we<00:00:50.850> were<00:00:50.969> doing<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.510> he's

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
of fire and what we were doing is he's

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.900 
of fire and what we were doing is he's
running<00:00:51.989> around<00:00:52.079> by<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.710> first<00:00:53.280> excavation

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
running around by the first excavation

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.819 
running around by the first excavation
site<00:00:54.090> by<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.270> mp40<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:55.350> that's<00:00:55.530> basically

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
site by the mp40 so that's basically

little bit harder because I'm not
getting<00:01:05.400> any<00:01:05.610> light<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.180> don't<00:01:06.689> have<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> pot<00:01:07.260> to

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
pot drops but his area might be a little

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.910 
pot drops but his area might be a little
more<00:01:09.479> tight<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.049> like<00:01:10.229> he<00:01:10.380> just<00:01:10.530> about<00:01:10.680> died

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
more tight and like he just about died

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.980 
more tight and like he just about died
right<00:01:11.100> there<00:01:11.250> but<00:01:11.850> if<00:01:11.939> you're<00:01:12.060> careful<00:01:12.510> and

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
right there but if you're careful and

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.870 
right there but if you're careful and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
you do it you get out of there he's a

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.700 
you do it you get out of there he's a
lotta<00:01:15.119> room<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.420> run<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:16.229> should<00:01:16.259> be<00:01:16.530> able<00:01:16.590> to

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
lotta room to run you should be able to

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.140 
lotta room to run you should be able to
do<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.950> pretty<00:01:17.070> well<00:01:17.189> all<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.790> gotta<00:01:17.970> do<00:01:18.119> is

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
do it pretty well all you gotta do is

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.030 
do it pretty well all you gotta do is
just<00:01:18.509> keep<00:01:18.900> going<00:01:19.229> around<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.710> you're

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
just keep going around and you're

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.859 
just keep going around and you're
probably<00:01:20.369> standing<00:01:21.090> up<00:01:21.330> for<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.630> because

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
probably standing up for this because

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.060 
probably standing up for this because
it's<00:01:22.320> quite<00:01:22.770> important<00:01:24.409> rally<00:01:25.409> decided<00:01:25.950> this

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
it's quite important rally decided this

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.490 
it's quite important rally decided this
one<00:01:26.280> but<00:01:26.490> he<00:01:26.580> does<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:27.270> have<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:28.110> jump<00:01:28.350> down

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
one but he does you have to be jump down

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.530 
one but he does you have to be jump down
and<00:01:28.950> fall<00:01:29.579> back<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.000> he's<00:01:30.119> running<00:01:30.360> all<00:01:30.450> the
