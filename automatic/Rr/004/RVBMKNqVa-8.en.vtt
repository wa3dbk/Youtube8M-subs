00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.650
 or the girl who liked today I bring you a 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.260
 video for this February 14th day of the 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.360
 lovers here in mexico day of san 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.029
 valentine in other places also day of 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.130
 friendship and it's a very easy design 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.230
 based on a design that I presented to you 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.529
 two years ago using insulation tape 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.450
 the tape that I told them to cut out in 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.420
 heart shape cited to make a 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.309
 mold and later spread it in 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.350
 other videos and for that are the videos 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.230
 to spread to share all 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.760
 these ideas and others and good we are going to 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.219
 start with our nails totally 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.500
 clean dry and this time and 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:53.649
 use a colored enamel as a base 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.969
 pearly to highlight more so that 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:01:00.699
 it looks brighter the finished and 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.620
 subsequently perform each of the 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.019
 each of the heart molds 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.120
 with this ribbon the ribbon is very practical 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.400
 to isolate is a tape that 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.940
 used for 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.160
 and electrical issues wiring and all that 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.870
 kind of things but to me it turns out 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.270
 great utility because it adheres 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.270
 perfectly to the nail and not leave 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.610
 Adheres not adhering to more 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.610
 precisely then since the 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.780
 we cut open the mold we apply a 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.480
 normal red enamel and in the part 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.420
 superior we can apply leader if so 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.930
 they want or can leave it like this 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.840
 and then the leader or before the 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.759
 leader can apply a glaze 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.100
 textured if they do not have glaze 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.250
 Textured the same oblitas is going to give 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.870
 that texture 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.030
 another of the things that I love you 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.670
 comment is that if you do not want to do this 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.530
 mold and they are facilitated 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.650
 Freehand hearts is also very 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.610
 simple I prefer to use the mold 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.040
 but you can also do 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.390
 perfectly joining two points of a 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.390
 very practical way 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.280
 let's dry perfectly and here 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.590
 the most important point is that when and 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.500
 I know that hearts are going to apply a 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.400
 Very generous layer of top coat or 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.560
 enamel with glitter is up that layer 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.989
 thick will allow us to adhere 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.079
 sparkling fantasy whims of 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.930
 different ways either of hearts of 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:37.780
 beads droplets are bright 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.549
 very beautiful fantasy that will give you the 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.400
 difference this time to our 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:46.450
 nails and they will look very striking it 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:50.230
 they will look perfectly elegant 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.450
 beautiful very appropriate for this day I 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.069
 I hope you have a very good time 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.069
 remember that you can use the 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.859
 Enamels of the brand of your choice and 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.109
 the colors can give you the variant to 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:04.090
 this design instead of a pink base 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:06.700
 it can be a black base or a base 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.549
 white and there are also bright of 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.500
 different colors these are the ideas 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.479
 that I like to share with you 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.730
 I send a very big kiss and see you in 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:17.269
 the next 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.269
 bye
