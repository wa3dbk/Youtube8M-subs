am sad that he did drop to overall it
makes<00:01:33.930> me<00:01:34.079> not<00:01:34.170> when<00:01:34.320> using<00:01:34.710> but<00:01:34.860> at<00:01:35.340> 63<00:01:36.380> he's

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
makes me not when using but at 63 he's

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.719 
makes me not when using but at 63 he's

got some height on him he's got some
reach<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.150> think<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.450> diving<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.020> reef

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
reach so I think that diving and reef

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.710 
reach so I think that diving and reef
reflexes<00:01:41.310> will<00:01:41.670> definitely<00:01:42.150> help<00:01:42.299> out<00:01:42.450> he

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
reflexes will definitely help out he

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.899 
reflexes will definitely help out he
might<00:01:42.990> be<00:01:43.290> one<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.009> go<00:01:44.280> two<00:01:44.340> goalkeepers

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
might be one of the go two goalkeepers

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.569 
might be one of the go two goalkeepers
