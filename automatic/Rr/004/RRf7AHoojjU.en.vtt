00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.390
 in which I can jump on the jaws 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:16.000
 people just to hide it like that 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:18.400

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.850
 gerald two banks orders one 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.790
 witcher humans genetically modified 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.040
 having undergone several experiments and 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.200
 mutations and granting 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.310
 superhuman like that of dying when 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.310
 they walk on small flames 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.120
 or the one to get torn out the 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.120
 mouth by little bees 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:48.730
 oh no it's because play will tell him 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.730
 granting superhuman abilities 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:55.120
 as a healing facility a force 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.400
 overpowered a great responsiveness of 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.680
 very good reflexes 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.210
 an affinity with magic is 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.980
 why serve witcher 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.210
 mainly as a hunter 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.500
 come personally for me this is 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.420
 more yamakasi than anything else 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.400
 it's so simple and fun to 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.230
 climb on the buildings that I pass 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.810
 my time trying to go higher 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.400
 possible to do a little bit less 10 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.690
 ooo said ears walter - arnaud that 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.150

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:30.730
 do my name 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:35.350
 gerald de rim and I am an assassin 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.150
 kawabe hung what is this brothel I 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:44.920
 jumped from a poor little rock mayor of 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:46.840
 games suspect me to the big world 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.910
 novelty in the witcher 3 is good 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.400
 obviously are open you can 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.110
 go you want like this from a 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.850
 blow the adventure when you want 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.010
 go find aquatic treasures 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.930
 go looking for old 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.640
 Abandoned wealth in old 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.590
 buildings and old cases gloomy 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.730
 or even to fall on a cannibal in 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.720
 to eat the inhabitants of the 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.519
 house you want to pay 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.100
 after if you are of the peaceful kind 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.110
 the witcher 3 will offer you pretty 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.970
 panoramas with a cycle day and night and 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.910
 a weather of what always varied a 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.480
 little bit the game visually and one 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.480
 is not there 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:27.070
 they even put small decorations on the 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.459
 route then after if you like them 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.569
 animals 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.819
 the witcher 3 offers a cloakroom 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.840
 and doe hopping a little bit 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.790
 everywhere in nature 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.370
 you can for example have geese 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.349
 who wander around the cities and zon 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.120
 this giant who are trying to eat you or 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:46.209
 still pigs that is blocking you 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.989
 access to fucking homes but kas aug 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.689
 unloved month fuck yourself fucking in time 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:56.909

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:56.909
 what are we singing super pig 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.430
 because what a story 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.370
 it remains quite simple and interesting 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.290
 for that people did not do what 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.209
 chara and the witcher 2 then are less 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.549
 to meet and have fun then it's 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.350
 sure for what they did especially the 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.120
 witcher 2 yesterday anyway clapboard 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.980
 what I love is the 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.890
 choice in dialogs no more 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.450
 enormously enormously about the history of the 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.850
 less I do not really 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.070
 impression but rather it's about 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.680
 felt about the game we actually create 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.740
 the girac personality two shores in 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.080
 our choices and more with its choices eh 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.210
 Well, it allows us to unlock 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.460
 dialogues hidden way to learn 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.290
 more about the environment water on 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.760
 some characters that accompanies you 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.550
 during your adventure but I'm a 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.030
 monster seems sorry but I have not 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.030
 want to talk about it 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.840
 I too am a monster 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:09.280
 yeah but not only to me if you're a 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.990
 lycanthrope I can help you what a 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.490
 werewolf 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.020
 I have already encountered this kind of problem 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:18.969
 in general it is a simple 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:21.699
 curse who no it's florian 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:25.169

 casano gay tears 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:36.810
 like but their leader allows 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:39.420
 to evoke docu and ass scenes from 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.910
 ass scenes from ass scenes 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.430

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.620
 people is not everything but we still have 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.360
 ass play scenes to unlock so we 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.460
 going to have to go thank you 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.070

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.020

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.850

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:08.250

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.170
 knows trade and developer projects the 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.200
 game but there is a big trip around 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:19.100
 candles can be turned on or off 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:19.100
 all the lights of the day night game 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.300
