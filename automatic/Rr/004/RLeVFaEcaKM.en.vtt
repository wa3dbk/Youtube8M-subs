in<00:00:05.020> this<00:00:05.350> presentation<00:00:05.620> we'll<00:00:06.550> prove<00:00:06.970> that<00:00:07.210> by

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:07.420 
in this presentation we'll prove that by

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.049 
in this presentation we'll prove that by
installing<00:00:07.720> a<00:00:08.200> Terp<00:00:08.469> you<00:00:08.710> water<00:00:09.309> conditioner

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:11.580 
installing a Terp you water conditioner
there'll<00:00:10.540> be<00:00:10.570> a<00:00:10.750> change<00:00:11.230> in<00:00:11.500> the
