occur<00:00:37.540> we're<00:00:38.540> going<00:00:38.660> to<00:00:38.719> curve<00:00:38.899> the<00:00:39.200> angle

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
occur we're going to curve the angle

we're<00:00:56.690> going<00:00:56.840> to<00:00:56.899> get<00:00:57.110> these<00:00:57.440> three<00:00:57.829> ovals

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
we're going to get these three ovals

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.479 
we're going to get these three ovals
from<00:00:59.000> chicane<00:01:02.590> sadly<00:01:03.590> we<00:01:03.710> can<00:01:03.829> only<00:01:03.949> color<00:01:04.250> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.289 
get the same process again and I'm going
to<00:01:29.869> cover<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.259> top<00:01:30.500> one<00:01:30.770> blue<00:01:31.009> this<00:01:31.850> one<00:01:32.119> will

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
to cover the top one blue this one will

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:38.520 
to cover the top one blue this one will
be<00:01:32.450> mirrored<00:01:34.600> I'm<00:01:35.600> gonna<00:01:35.750> do<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.079> same<00:01:36.320> thing

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
be mirrored I'm gonna do the same thing

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.530 
be mirrored I'm gonna do the same thing
top<00:01:39.530> will<00:01:39.710> be<00:01:39.830> blue<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:40.280> this<00:01:40.880> is<00:01:40.940> why<00:01:41.180> we<00:01:41.330> left

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
top will be blue and this is why we left

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.520 
top will be blue and this is why we left
this<00:01:41.810> white<00:01:42.850> I'll<00:01:43.850> fix<00:01:44.060> it<00:01:44.180> with<00:01:44.780> a<00:01:45.050> square

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
this white I'll fix it with a square

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.720 
this white I'll fix it with a square
with<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:46.580> dark<00:01:46.790> blue<00:01:47.030> color<00:01:48.520> we're<00:01:49.520> going<00:01:49.670> to

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
with the dark blue color we're going to

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.950 
with the dark blue color we're going to
do<00:01:49.820> the<00:01:49.970> same<00:01:50.150> stripe<00:01:50.390> so<00:01:50.600> we're<00:01:50.810> going<00:01:50.900> to

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
do the same stripe so we're going to

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.780 
do the same stripe so we're going to
invert<00:01:51.620> the<00:01:51.740> color<00:01:51.950> so<00:01:52.250> instead<00:01:52.460> of<00:01:52.520> black

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
invert the color so instead of black

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.790 
invert the color so instead of black
it's<00:01:53.000> going<00:01:53.150> to<00:01:53.210> be<00:01:53.300> light<00:01:53.510> gray<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:54.560> dark

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
it's going to be light gray the dark

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.090 
it's going to be light gray the dark
gray<00:01:55.010> will<00:01:55.190> stain<00:01:55.400> the<00:01:55.430> same<00:01:56.710> we're<00:01:57.710> coloring

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
gray will stain the same we're coloring

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.500 
gray will stain the same we're coloring
the<00:01:58.640> bottom<00:01:59.120> one<00:01:59.930> blue<00:02:01.150> this<00:02:02.150> one<00:02:02.330> took<00:02:02.450> a

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
the bottom one blue this one took a

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.230 
the bottom one blue this one took a
little<00:02:02.600> bit<00:02:02.870> to<00:02:03.050> fix<00:02:03.350> because<00:02:04.250> this<00:02:04.910> is<00:02:05.060> where

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
little bit to fix because this is where

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.499 
little bit to fix because this is where
the<00:02:05.530> part<00:02:06.530> of<00:02:06.620> the<00:02:06.680> car<00:02:06.890> stops<00:02:07.220> so<00:02:08.119> we're<00:02:08.479> just

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
the part of the car stops so we're just

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.250 
the part of the car stops so we're just
gonna<00:02:08.780> get<00:02:09.080> up<00:02:09.979> until<00:02:10.460> this<00:02:10.640> body<00:02:10.910> line<00:02:11.260> I'm

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
gonna get up until this body line I'm

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.130 
gonna get up until this body line I'm
gonna<00:02:12.440> finish<00:02:12.800> it<00:02:13.040> off<00:02:13.100> with<00:02:13.280> another<00:02:13.640> one

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
gonna finish it off with another one

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.680 
gonna finish it off with another one
roughly<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.320> same<00:02:15.500> size<00:02:15.800> I<00:02:16.360> was<00:02:17.360> kind<00:02:17.600> of

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
roughly the same size I was kind of

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.190 
roughly the same size I was kind of
hasty<00:02:18.790> but<00:02:19.790> if<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.420> could<00:02:20.600> get<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:20.840> perfect

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
hasty but if you could get it perfect

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.710 
hasty but if you could get it perfect
it'll<00:02:21.530> look<00:02:21.709> really<00:02:21.920> good<00:02:22.270> it's<00:02:23.270> already

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
it'll look really good it's already

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.680 
it'll look really good it's already
color<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.200> bottom<00:02:24.350> one<00:02:24.650> blue<00:02:25.300> finish<00:02:26.300> it<00:02:26.570> off

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
color the bottom one blue finish it off

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.850 
color the bottom one blue finish it off
with<00:02:26.900> another<00:02:27.110> circle<00:02:29.290> next<00:02:30.290> we're<00:02:30.680> going<00:02:30.800> to

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
with another circle next we're going to

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.600 
with another circle next we're going to
do<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.280> same<00:02:31.459> stripes<00:02:32.950> we're<00:02:33.950> gonna<00:02:34.130> paint

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
do the same stripes we're gonna paint

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.699 
do the same stripes we're gonna paint
the<00:02:34.760> top<00:02:34.970> one<00:02:35.180> blue<00:02:36.520> so<00:02:37.520> there<00:02:37.970> are<00:02:38.090> a<00:02:38.120> few<00:02:38.180> more

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
the top one blue so there are a few more

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.920 
the top one blue so there are a few more
stripes<00:02:39.709> but<00:02:40.640> in<00:02:40.910> order<00:02:41.120> to<00:02:41.240> get<00:02:41.390> some<00:02:41.540> details

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
stripes but in order to get some details

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.090 
stripes but in order to get some details
I<00:02:42.340> sacrificed<00:02:43.810> their<00:02:44.810> placement<00:02:45.380> so<00:02:45.980> we're

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
I sacrificed their placement so we're

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
I sacrificed their placement so we're
going<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.250> start<00:02:46.400> with<00:02:46.580> numbers<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:49.700> nine<00:02:49.940> one

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
going to start with numbers the nine one

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.520 
going to start with numbers the nine one
one<00:02:50.360> it<00:02:51.140> looks<00:02:51.800> best<00:02:52.040> if<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:52.370> rotate<00:02:52.820> it<00:02:53.530> the

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
one it looks best if you rotate it the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.130 
one it looks best if you rotate it the
tiniest<00:02:55.070> if<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:55.430> go<00:02:55.610> it<00:02:56.480> just<00:02:56.510> adds<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:57.050> the

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
tiniest if you go it just adds to the

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.229 
tiniest if you go it just adds to the
angle<00:02:57.620> of<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:58.459> front<00:02:58.880> end<00:03:00.880> so<00:03:01.880> we're<00:03:02.090> going<00:03:02.180> to

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
angle of the front end so we're going to

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.170 
angle of the front end so we're going to
write<00:03:02.420> police<00:03:02.950> I'm<00:03:03.950> going<00:03:04.100> to<00:03:04.190> skew<00:03:04.489> it<00:03:04.580> so<00:03:04.760> it

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
write police I'm going to skew it so it

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.870 
write police I'm going to skew it so it
almost<00:03:05.390> looks<00:03:05.630> straight<00:03:06.280> it's<00:03:07.280> a<00:03:07.459> little<00:03:07.700> bit

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
almost looks straight it's a little bit

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.630 
almost looks straight it's a little bit
angled<00:03:08.720> I'm<00:03:09.590> going<00:03:09.769> to<00:03:09.830> get<00:03:10.070> it<00:03:10.190> about<00:03:10.400> the

angled I'm going to get it about the
