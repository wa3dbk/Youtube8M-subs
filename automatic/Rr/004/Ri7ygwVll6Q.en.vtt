good morning I want to take you on a
little<00:00:15.980> tour<00:00:16.369> of<00:00:16.430> my<00:00:17.270> revised<00:00:18.010> layout<00:00:19.010> I<00:00:19.509> am

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:20.509 
little tour of my revised layout I am

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:26.160 
little tour of my revised layout I am
focusing<00:00:21.259> on<00:00:21.470> an<00:00:21.619> area<00:00:22.039> where<00:00:23.050> I<00:00:24.050> have<00:00:24.970> added

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
focusing on an area where I have added

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:32.229 
focusing on an area where I have added
or<00:00:27.170> rather<00:00:27.710> replace<00:00:28.400> the<00:00:30.100> unit<00:00:31.100> rack<00:00:31.460> with

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
or rather replace the unit rack with

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.759 
or rather replace the unit rack with
true<00:00:32.599> track<00:00:32.930> from<00:00:33.320> Atlas<00:00:35.080> that<00:00:36.080> would<00:00:36.440> be<00:00:36.590> the

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:36.769 
true track from Atlas that would be the

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:41.020 
true track from Atlas that would be the
second<00:00:37.340> set<00:00:37.580> of<00:00:38.260> rails<00:00:39.260> that<00:00:39.500> in<00:00:40.400> the<00:00:40.610> picture

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
second set of rails that in the picture

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:49.320 
second set of rails that in the picture
I<00:00:41.739> have<00:00:44.650> elected<00:00:45.650> to<00:00:45.890> use<00:00:46.449> the<00:00:47.449> unit<00:00:48.229> rack

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
I have elected to use the unit rack

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:58.539 
I have elected to use the unit rack
double<00:00:50.330> turnout<00:00:52.750> crossover<00:00:54.729> and<00:00:56.379> as<00:00:57.379> it<00:00:57.830> has

00:00:58.539 --> 00:00:58.549 
double turnout crossover and as it has

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:01.990 
double turnout crossover and as it has
the<00:00:58.850> point<00:00:59.180> of<00:00:59.390> transition<00:00:59.930> because<00:01:00.890> my<00:01:01.760> goal

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
the point of transition because my goal

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.479 
the point of transition because my goal
is<00:01:02.239> not<00:01:02.269> only<00:01:02.449> to<00:01:02.809> use<00:01:03.229> true<00:01:03.589> track<00:01:03.860> but<00:01:04.159> to<00:01:04.309> go

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
is not only to use true track but to go

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.590 
is not only to use true track but to go
from<00:01:04.909> a<00:01:05.119> double<00:01:05.330> main<00:01:05.869> line<00:01:06.310> which<00:01:07.330> exists<00:01:08.330> to

to<00:04:10.310> allow<00:04:10.819> me<00:04:11.000> to<00:04:11.120> use<00:04:11.150> this<00:04:11.569> track<00:04:11.959> which<00:04:12.469> is

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
to allow me to use this track which is

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.479 
to allow me to use this track which is
already<00:04:12.919> ballasted<00:04:13.959> and<00:04:14.959> simply<00:04:15.940> fit<00:04:16.940> that

deck bridge or trestle around it

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.350 
deck bridge or trestle around it
I<00:04:22.780> suspect<00:04:23.780> on<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.520> maybe<00:04:25.520> four<00:04:25.940> piers

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360

00:04:28.739 --> 00:04:28.749 
underneath

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:31.989 
underneath
what<00:04:29.749> has<00:04:30.319> not<00:04:30.530> been<00:04:30.770> completed<00:04:31.219> yet<00:04:31.669> is

00:04:31.989 --> 00:04:31.999 
what has not been completed yet is

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:34.629 
what has not been completed yet is
another<00:04:32.930> sighting<00:04:33.590> that<00:04:33.620> will<00:04:33.919> go<00:04:34.069> into<00:04:34.280> this

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
another sighting that will go into this

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.320 
another sighting that will go into this
country<00:04:35.270> grain<00:04:35.749> elevator<00:04:36.289> here<00:04:36.770> and<00:04:37.330> the

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
country grain elevator here and the

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:45.209 
country grain elevator here and the
track<00:04:38.689> that<00:04:40.389> is<00:04:41.389> on<00:04:42.379> this<00:04:42.860> area<00:04:43.509> coming<00:04:44.509> around

00:04:45.209 --> 00:04:45.219 
track that is on this area coming around

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:52.179 
track that is on this area coming around
is<00:04:46.219> a<00:04:46.909> track<00:04:47.740> that<00:04:48.740> is<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:49.370> 14<00:04:50.270> inch<00:04:51.189> radius

00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:52.189 
is a track that is the 14 inch radius

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:59.379 
is a track that is the 14 inch radius
and<00:04:53.830> it<00:04:54.830> merges<00:04:55.400> in<00:04:55.840> again<00:04:56.840> to<00:04:57.169> another<00:04:58.389> double

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
and it merges in again to another double

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:04.540 
and it merges in again to another double
area<00:04:59.870> which<00:05:01.000> has<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.449> double<00:05:03.439> crossover<00:05:03.979> from

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
area which has the double crossover from

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.969 
area which has the double crossover from
unit<00:05:04.939> track<00:05:05.319> so<00:05:06.319> that's<00:05:07.189> it<00:05:07.460> in<00:05:07.729> a<00:05:07.849> nutshell

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
unit track so that's it in a nutshell

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:14.730 
unit track so that's it in a nutshell
a<00:05:10.060> lot<00:05:11.060> of<00:05:11.090> close-up<00:05:11.719> details<00:05:12.199> missing<00:05:12.650> but

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
a lot of close-up details missing but

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.309 
a lot of close-up details missing but
hopefully<00:05:15.740> this<00:05:15.939> captures<00:05:16.939> the<00:05:17.300> essence<00:05:18.139> of

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:18.319 
hopefully this captures the essence of

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:21.129 
hopefully this captures the essence of
my<00:05:18.860> plan
