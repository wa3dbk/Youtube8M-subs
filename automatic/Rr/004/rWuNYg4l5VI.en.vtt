00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:17.100
 games on bandits let me play 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.939
 varfeys and and many can not write on 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.609
 bandits just because I'm sorry 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.430
 just can't write down just because 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.920
 that when you write your own 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.219
 recordings are just a black screen when you 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.860
 see the video also fix it here 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.700
 nothing needs to be changed there 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.300
 Records format although format need here 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.629
 look 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:47.539
 we set the size of a special one then take such 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.660
 what resolution which costs you in 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:54.539
 warface 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:58.140
 continue to put 60 codec x kind of quality is not 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:03.180
 more than eighty well one boats 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:10.229
 l2 bitrate 160 frequency 40 44 thousand avast 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:15.479
 and stereo channels ok here we set up 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:19.229
 further into the goal in seeing direct open window 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.840
 gl when we press something we can't 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.299
 start recording just this button is not 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.150
 active how do we activate it 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.579
 go to warface 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:34.130
 we turn on to control indesit on 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:37.720
 caressing shots and we see that there is a goal 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.180
 Warface lecture and here already 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.090
 you can click on the record that is, you can 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:49.120
 start recording only after 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.870
 you run the warfice in a different way 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.000
 another here 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.520
 tap the area say it will not 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.230
 record because the screen area is 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:02.290
 for the desktop and there I do not know google 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.810
 and or something like that is generally not for games 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.510
 of course some games can 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.110
 register as a minkravt but 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:14.410
 better window management open gl 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:18.450
 this is the best choice well then thank you 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.450
