00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:08.660
 Yes is the Hello Tanaka 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:14.030
 This time, it's been a long time since the gadget says Jetta 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:16.530
 I bought pc-related accessories 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.100
 it's here 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:26.840
 Deferred type external hard drive 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.840
 I bought a product called Western disk Tell students of my book studio 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:36.550
 The capacity is the type of department that was exposed 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:41.980
 The interface is called firewire 800 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:47.140
 We want to look at the middle person in usb 2.0 high 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:49.440
 Yes I will open the box from the side 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.440
 right 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:58.330
 Well then it's something inside but it's also first 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.020
 8 This is the main unit USB cable and fire wire pebble for each one 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.760
 One by one 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:07.720
 Type of ac adapter manual or warranty card warning 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:12.480
 Since the shape of the body is the name is about Tteyuu mybook 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:17.790
 This hardcover encyclopedia might be like this 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:21.510
 Weight back in such a shape 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:28.260
 There is a hole on the surface and you remain as a Malay customer? 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:29.010
 Certainly because this series has no built-in fan , the material of this body is also metal 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:37.100
 But 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:37.100
 I think that it was such a mechanism that escape the heat in the hole of the heat dissipation and metal materials 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.170
 Connector part of the ne firewire interface that is to say from earlier is 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.880
 is not it 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.430
 The part of the body of the well miss skin will be here hey and the two above firewire 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.000
 I 'm here at 800 but usb 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:59.230
 Not a little power 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:03.700
 Cable side, I guess you never Well you say is similar to something in particular looks like 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:09.690
 Thunderbolt connector is smaller usb connector 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.690
 It is a connector of such a shape which is completely different in shape at all 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:17.290
 Dating or rather this Gothenburg, Stan digital manufacturers that pretty well-established in the hard disk 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:24.370
 Mayumenamin carde 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:26.440
 The built-in hard disk is genuinely used with needles and so it is reliable. 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:32.290
 I do not think 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:37.890
 Also I'd bought a model of the interface It is this firewire 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:43.950

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.930
 I have an interface, but with the latest Mac, I think it's now, Princess sb 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.870
 Such as 3.0 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:15.810
 Thunderbolt is a high-speed interface has been added , so now 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.010
 I wonder if I will buy a model 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.680
 Though I think I mean tell Tsu try of this time of my book I'd bought a model 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.730

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.250
 -8 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.910

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.940
 Capacity conversion 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.940

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.040
 Night 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:59.810
 Because it is one base of the same 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:04.640
 You of the can to be added thrown by usb and shaped in the same way as he 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:09.840
 It's not hard, but it can be extended by connecting it again later 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:12.989
 Because there is such a good convenience, do you choose firewire 800?
