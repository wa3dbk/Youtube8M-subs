 in any case if you do not understand 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.130
 very well and I recommend you go through the 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.110
 webpage of between metaphors that is 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.759
 others of the contributors in this 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.110
 project taking advantage that you are already many 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.179
 those who have asked me about this 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.520
 trilogy my recommendation will not be only 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.500
 a book but a very dystopian trilogy 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.090
 interesting is the legend trilogy of 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.009
 mariluz that is already fully published 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.229
 in Spanish, there are only three books 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.030
 legend prodi and champions the last book 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.829
 I read it recently and I loved it is a 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.720
 saga that well if the first book can 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:12.280
 to be a little bit loose, although to me 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.989
 really liked it has a very evolution 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.239
 important of the three books and goes from 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.730
 unless more I assure you I recommend 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.920
 so much in the sade 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.420
 and anvil are the protagonists because they do not 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.549
 it's just a love story, they 're a 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.140
 story is an action novel is a 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.060
 Adventure novel is a novel in the 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.310
 that things do not always come to our 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.830
 taste and that the moments are not lacking 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.989
 of tension and emotional moments and 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.000
 moments then give us more comfort 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.650
 dramatic has everything is a trilogy 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.239
 I recommend a lot and I tell you that 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.489
 it's really worth it for the evolution 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.349
 that has both history and 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.720
 characters throughout the three books 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.819
 and I highly recommend it, which is to see 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.890
 the rest of recommendations I leave the 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.390

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.220
