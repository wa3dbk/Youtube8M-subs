keyboards have all kinds of non-standard
connections<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.700> know<00:00:38.820> there's<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.270> Jama

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
connections you know there's the Jama

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.229 
connections you know there's the Jama
edge<00:00:39.899> connector<00:00:40.590> which<00:00:41.370> everything<00:00:41.820> runs<00:00:42.030> off

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
edge connector which everything runs off

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.330 
edge connector which everything runs off
of<00:00:42.480> these<00:00:42.570> are<00:00:42.719> actually<00:00:43.050> mvs<00:00:43.649> wiring

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
of these are actually mvs wiring

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.040 
of these are actually mvs wiring
standard<00:00:44.820> it's<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.120> little<00:00:45.360> bit<00:00:45.510> different<00:00:45.870> but

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
standard it's a little bit different but

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.479 
standard it's a little bit different but
same<00:00:46.770> basic<00:00:47.160> principle<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.829> with<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.129> you

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
same basic principle and with that you

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.450 
same basic principle and with that you
basically<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:51.390> everything<00:00:52.219> running<00:00:53.219> off

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
basically have everything running off

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.770 
basically have everything running off
this<00:00:53.670> connection<00:00:54.360> now<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.500> order<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.890> do<00:00:56.160> this

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
this connection now in order to do this

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.810 
this connection now in order to do this
lock<00:00:57.780> has<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.199> be<00:00:58.320> changed<00:00:59.000> so<00:01:00.680> for<00:01:01.680> one<00:01:01.890> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
lock has to be changed so for one the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
video outputs RGB red green blue and we

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.800 
video outputs RGB red green blue and we
have<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.729> convert<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.380> to<00:01:10.490> an<00:01:11.490> NTSC<00:01:12.210> signal

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
have to convert that to an NTSC signal

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.270 
have to convert that to an NTSC signal
for<00:01:13.380> television<00:01:14.100> at<00:01:14.400> least<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.880> North<00:01:15.119> America

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
for television at least in North America

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.350 
for television at least in North America
for<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.400> I've<00:01:17.759> used<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.150> really<00:01:18.450> inexpensive

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
for that I've used a really inexpensive

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.609 
for that I've used a really inexpensive
converter<00:01:21.360> or<00:01:22.020> encoder

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
converter or encoder

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.980 
converter or encoder
it's<00:01:23.220> called<00:01:23.490> aya<00:01:23.930> CB<00:01:24.930> o--<00:01:25.229> 4<00:01:26.600> it's<00:01:27.600> actually

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
it's called aya CB o-- 4 it's actually

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.649 
it's called aya CB o-- 4 it's actually
really<00:01:28.170> good<00:01:28.380> bang<00:01:28.950> for<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.310> buck<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.759> other

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
really good bang for the buck the other

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.590 
really good bang for the buck the other
thing<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.079> these<00:01:31.650> boards<00:01:32.040> run<00:01:32.220> off<00:01:32.340> 12<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.090> 5

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
thing is these boards run off 12 and 5

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.109 
thing is these boards run off 12 and 5
volts<00:01:34.020> I've<00:01:34.500> converted<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:35.970> runs

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
volts I've converted it so that it runs

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.060 
volts I've converted it so that it runs
only<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.810> 5<00:01:37.170> volts<00:01:38.689> so<00:01:39.689> with<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.320> we<00:01:40.650> can<00:01:40.829> use

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
only on 5 volts so with that we can use

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.690 
only on 5 volts so with that we can use
a<00:01:41.400> standard<00:01:41.700> AC<00:01:42.360> adapter<00:01:43.130> instead<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.310> an

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
a standard AC adapter instead of an

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.410 
a standard AC adapter instead of an
arcade<00:01:45.149> power<00:01:45.360> supply<00:01:46.790> this<00:01:47.790> will<00:01:48.000> run<00:01:48.149> off<00:01:48.270> a

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
arcade power supply this will run off a

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.690 
arcade power supply this will run off a
5<00:01:48.689> volt<00:01:48.990> 3<00:01:49.500> amp<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.979> what<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.280> want

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
5 volt 3 amp is what you want

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.200 
5 volt 3 amp is what you want
I<00:01:50.729> found<00:01:51.299> an<00:01:51.540> AC<00:01:51.689> power<00:01:52.079> supply<00:01:52.290> for<00:01:52.909> 99<00:01:53.909> cents

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
I found an AC power supply for 99 cents

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.630 
I found an AC power supply for 99 cents
at<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.720> thrift<00:01:54.930> store<00:01:55.049> was<00:01:55.350> 5<00:01:55.560> volt<00:01:55.770> 2.8<00:01:56.310> amps

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
at a thrift store was 5 volt 2.8 amps

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.080 
at a thrift store was 5 volt 2.8 amps
close<00:01:56.969> enough<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:58.049> other<00:01:58.079> thing<00:01:58.350> we<00:01:58.469> do<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:59.090> we

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
close enough the other thing we do is we

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.649 
close enough the other thing we do is we
put<00:02:00.329> audio<00:02:00.659> out<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.280> there<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.509> left<00:02:03.509> and

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
put audio out and there it is left and

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.030 
put audio out and there it is left and
right<00:02:03.840> audio<00:02:03.990> that's<00:02:04.619> one<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:04.979> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
right audio that's one of the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.219 
right audio that's one of the
differences<00:02:05.219> from<00:02:05.670> jamma<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.390> has<00:02:06.689> actual

differences from jamma this has actual

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
far as controllers the really

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.460 
far as controllers the really
interesting<00:02:33.730> thing<00:02:34.120> about<00:02:34.150> these<00:02:34.510> this<00:02:35.230> one's

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
interesting thing about these this one's

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.440 
interesting thing about these this one's
kind<00:02:35.650> of<00:02:35.740> rough<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.430> top<00:02:36.670> was<00:02:36.970> painted

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
kind of rough the the top was painted

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.050 
kind of rough the the top was painted
you<00:02:38.260> know<00:02:38.380> before<00:02:38.770> I<00:02:38.800> did<00:02:39.100> anything<00:02:39.340> dots<00:02:39.820> of

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
you know before I did anything dots of

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.510 
you know before I did anything dots of
the<00:02:40.300> nicer<00:02:40.720> one<00:02:40.900> but<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:42.040> interesting<00:02:42.460> thing

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
the nicer one but the interesting thing

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.660 
the nicer one but the interesting thing
about<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.910> controllers<00:02:43.420> is<00:02:43.780> that<00:02:44.670> these

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
about the controllers is that these

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.480 
about the controllers is that these
boards<00:02:46.150> were<00:02:46.300> made<00:02:46.540> with<00:02:46.810> with<00:02:47.470> these<00:02:47.680> 15<00:02:48.250> pin

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
boards were made with with these 15 pin

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.370 
boards were made with with these 15 pin
controller<00:02:48.910> ports<00:02:49.240> like<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.600> Neo<00:02:49.780> Geo<00:02:50.080> has

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
controller ports like the Neo Geo has

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.980 
controller ports like the Neo Geo has
and<00:02:50.800> I<00:02:51.520> don't<00:02:51.670> know<00:02:51.820> why<00:02:52.120> they<00:02:52.420> did<00:02:52.630> that<00:02:52.660> I'm

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
and I don't know why they did that I'm

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.810 
and I don't know why they did that I'm
not<00:02:53.200> going<00:02:53.320> to<00:02:53.380> complain<00:02:53.770> but<00:02:54.280> it<00:02:54.430> makes<00:02:54.640> it

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
not going to complain but it makes it

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.800 
not going to complain but it makes it
real<00:02:55.030> easy<00:02:55.360> so<00:02:55.710> for<00:02:56.710> example<00:02:57.570> instead<00:02:58.570> of<00:02:58.660> like

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
real easy so for example instead of like

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.770 
real easy so for example instead of like
a<00:02:58.840> super<00:02:59.200> gun<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:01.030> know<00:03:01.150> where<00:03:01.390> your<00:03:01.540> wiring

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
a super gun you know where your wiring

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.480 
a super gun you know where your wiring
controller<00:03:02.350> have<00:03:02.650> ports<00:03:02.980> for<00:03:03.130> controllers

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
controller have ports for controllers

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.460 
controller have ports for controllers
it's<00:03:03.910> already<00:03:04.390> on<00:03:04.540> there<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:04.990> so<00:03:05.170> you<00:03:05.230> can

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
it's already on there and so you can

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.050 
it's already on there and so you can
just<00:03:05.500> plug<00:03:05.890> in<00:03:06.100> a<00:03:06.310> regular<00:03:06.610> Neo<00:03:06.820> Geo

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
just plug in a regular Neo Geo

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.150 
just plug in a regular Neo Geo
controller<00:03:07.480> and<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:07.930> works<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.980> next

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
controller and it works so the next

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.570 
controller and it works so the next
question<00:03:12.370> is<00:03:13.200> why<00:03:14.200> I<00:03:14.590> mean<00:03:15.010> if<00:03:15.220> you<00:03:15.370> have<00:03:15.550> the

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
question is why I mean if you have the

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.330 
question is why I mean if you have the
whole<00:03:15.940> system<00:03:16.510> why<00:03:17.290> would<00:03:17.530> you<00:03:17.650> console<00:03:18.100> as<00:03:18.190> an

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
whole system why would you console as an

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.890 
whole system why would you console as an
arcade<00:03:18.610> board<00:03:18.910> to<00:03:19.120> do<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.360> same<00:03:19.540> thing<00:03:19.750> with

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
arcade board to do the same thing with

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.340 
arcade board to do the same thing with
our<00:03:19.990> K<00:03:20.200> carts<00:03:20.530> that's<00:03:21.070> a<00:03:21.220> very<00:03:21.459> good<00:03:21.610> question

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
our K carts that's a very good question

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.750 
our K carts that's a very good question
the<00:03:23.350> number<00:03:23.770> one<00:03:23.920> reason<00:03:24.280> is<00:03:24.430> price<00:03:26.760> tape

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
the number one reason is price tape

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.930 
the number one reason is price tape
Metal<00:03:28.090> Slug<00:03:28.209> for<00:03:28.600> example<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:30.310> get<00:03:30.520> the<00:03:30.640> first

everyone I've run into has audio
problems<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:43.110> audio<00:04:43.320> is<00:04:43.380> too<00:04:43.440> low<00:04:43.920> or<00:04:43.950> it's

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
problems the audio is too low or it's

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.060 
problems the audio is too low or it's
scratchy<00:04:45.000> or<00:04:45.720> one<00:04:45.960> channel<00:04:46.440> is<00:04:46.560> louder<00:04:46.800> than

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
scratchy or one channel is louder than

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.040 
scratchy or one channel is louder than
the<00:04:47.160> other<00:04:47.280> and<00:04:47.490> during<00:04:48.390> the<00:04:48.480> time<00:04:48.660> these<00:04:48.900> were

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
the other and during the time these were

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.650 
the other and during the time these were
produced<00:04:49.230> the<00:04:49.650> caps<00:04:49.860> were<00:04:50.100> pretty<00:04:50.370> bad<00:04:50.580> and<00:04:50.910> so

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
produced the caps were pretty bad and so

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.870 
produced the caps were pretty bad and so
I've<00:04:51.900> replaced<00:04:52.380> all<00:04:52.620> of<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:52.980> capacitors<00:04:53.670> for

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
I've replaced all of the capacitors for

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.400 
I've replaced all of the capacitors for
the<00:04:54.000> audio<00:04:54.270> section<00:04:54.570> in<00:04:54.840> there<00:04:55.020> the<00:04:55.260> other

the audio section in there the other

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:56.810 
the audio section in there the other
thing<00:04:55.710> is<00:04:55.919> they<00:04:56.310> came<00:04:56.550> with<00:04:56.700> this

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
thing is they came with this

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.670 
thing is they came with this
rechargeable<00:04:57.510> battery<00:04:57.870> this<00:04:58.080> stores<00:04:58.410> the

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
rechargeable battery this stores the

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.710 
rechargeable battery this stores the

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
things of that nature these leak and I

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.600 
things of that nature these leak and I
know<00:05:04.020> like<00:05:04.290> a<00:05:04.350> lot<00:05:04.620> of<00:05:04.740> you<00:05:04.830> guys<00:05:04.980> know<00:05:05.370> about

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
know like a lot of you guys know about

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.150 
know like a lot of you guys know about
like<00:05:06.150> the<00:05:06.660> Amiga<00:05:06.900> systems<00:05:07.470> and<00:05:07.710> how<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:07.830> Amiga

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
like the Amiga systems and how the Amiga

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.340 
like the Amiga systems and how the Amiga
batteries<00:05:08.610> would<00:05:08.790> leak<00:05:09.000> it's<00:05:09.210> the<00:05:09.810> same<00:05:10.080> thing

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
batteries would leak it's the same thing

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.050 
batteries would leak it's the same thing
here<00:05:10.650> so<00:05:11.210> what<00:05:12.210> I<00:05:12.240> did<00:05:12.360> was<00:05:13.610> ivory<00:05:14.610> pon<00:05:14.850> these

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
here so what I did was ivory pon these

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.030 
here so what I did was ivory pon these
I've<00:05:15.330> removed<00:05:15.780> this<00:05:16.050> battery<00:05:16.620> and<00:05:16.830> I've

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
I've removed this battery and I've

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.190 
I've removed this battery and I've
replaced<00:05:17.430> it<00:05:17.640> with<00:05:17.700> a<00:05:17.910> coin<00:05:18.300> cell<00:05:18.600> holder<00:05:18.990> and

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
replaced it with a coin cell holder and

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.490 
replaced it with a coin cell holder and
a<00:05:19.800> cr2032<00:05:20.490> coin<00:05:20.880> cell<00:05:21.419> battery<00:05:21.690> and<00:05:21.930> I<00:05:22.320> also

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
a cr2032 coin cell battery and I also

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.830 
a cr2032 coin cell battery and I also
removed<00:05:23.100> this<00:05:23.370> resistor<00:05:24.030> so<00:05:24.240> that<00:05:24.390> it<00:05:24.510> doesn't

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
removed this resistor so that it doesn't

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.390 
removed this resistor so that it doesn't
run<00:05:24.960> a<00:05:25.020> charge<00:05:25.440> to<00:05:25.800> that<00:05:25.919> battery<00:05:26.220> so<00:05:26.370> the

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
run a charge to that battery so the

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.850 
run a charge to that battery so the
charging<00:05:26.910> system<00:05:27.090> is<00:05:27.419> disabled<00:05:27.960> you<00:05:28.110> know<00:05:28.740> in

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
charging system is disabled you know in

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.620 
charging system is disabled you know in
5-10<00:05:29.430> years<00:05:29.640> down<00:05:29.880> the<00:05:30.000> road<00:05:30.030> when<00:05:30.240> you<00:05:30.360> place

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
5-10 years down the road when you place

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.420 
5-10 years down the road when you place
a<00:05:30.660> battery<00:05:31.140> just<00:05:31.320> put<00:05:31.500> a<00:05:31.530> new<00:05:31.680> coin<00:05:31.950> cell<00:05:32.250> in

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
a battery just put a new coin cell in

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.610 
a battery just put a new coin cell in
the<00:05:32.520> holder<00:05:32.880> so<00:05:33.540> that's<00:05:33.750> the<00:05:34.020> mod<00:05:34.229> that<00:05:34.260> it's

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
the holder so that's the mod that it's

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.170 
the holder so that's the mod that it's
had<00:05:34.830> done<00:05:35.150> so<00:05:36.150> what<00:05:36.600> I'll<00:05:36.720> go<00:05:36.840> ahead<00:05:36.960> and<00:05:37.140> do<00:05:37.290> is

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
had done so what I'll go ahead and do is

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.200 
had done so what I'll go ahead and do is
power<00:05:39.180> this<00:05:39.479> on<00:05:39.919> now<00:05:40.919> I<00:05:40.950> do<00:05:41.100> have<00:05:41.310> a<00:05:41.370> Sony<00:05:41.700> PBM

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
power this on now I do have a Sony PBM

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.700 
power this on now I do have a Sony PBM

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
as these go because it's running off of

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.920 
as these go because it's running off of
an<00:05:48.630> s-video<00:05:49.020> connection<00:05:49.860> so<00:05:50.729> it<00:05:51.330> does<00:05:51.540> work<00:05:51.570> on

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
an s-video connection so it does work on

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.270 
an s-video connection so it does work on
regular<00:05:52.290> TV<00:05:52.470> and<00:05:52.650> it<00:05:52.710> looks<00:05:52.919> great<00:05:53.070> on<00:05:53.250> a
