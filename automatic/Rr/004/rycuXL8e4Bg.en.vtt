00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.000
 a theater box office sold 42 tickets per one piece 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.019
 tickets cost 1 â‚¬ 19 each 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.740
 we use the good progress to make an estimate of the money received by the 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.019
 mayor 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.499
 so if we wished there were decisive 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:19.169
 without the use of everything 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:20.679
 we have mind 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:22.980
 we calculated 42 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.599
 to explain by 19 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.970
 this would give us the colossus pituba itaigara 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.050
 but we want to use the corrosion of the ment 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.380
 we have the first they own the area 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.670
 the corede 2 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.770
 and 19 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.950
 and by the rules of learning 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.910
 we know that they occur from two 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.680
 this doubt 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.140
 she was 40 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.100
 why the u2 to the right of the 4th time down is 5 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.990
 and when it happens 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.740
 the robot does not go down 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.550
 already happens new 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.810
 will have the gift of the teresina area present 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.850
 because with 90 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.170
 supprior error or equal to 5 in the shortage suprior and 5 and when this happens we 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.710
 we do orkut up tempo 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.710
 and now let's do the multiplication of 40 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.310
 I've seen 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.840
 because we just need to know how much is 4 winners 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.940
 these heroes can be presented at the end 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.940
 therefore 4 3 2 is equal to 8 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.240
 and we will present the crisis zeros 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.970
 there are no more humm 2 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.970
 we can then say that we do to the good progress 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.970
 the money received by the ticket office was 808
