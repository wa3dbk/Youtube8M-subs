onto a Buell cyclone motorcycle this is
a<00:00:06.770> 2001<00:00:07.770> Buell<00:00:08.130> cyclone<00:00:08.580> but<00:00:08.730> it<00:00:08.790> should<00:00:08.940> fit

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
a 2001 Buell cyclone but it should fit

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.839 
a 2001 Buell cyclone but it should fit
anything<00:00:09.389> before<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.650> year<00:00:10.830> 2001<00:00:11.490> any<00:00:11.670> of<00:00:11.790> the

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
anything before the year 2001 any of the

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.820 
anything before the year 2001 any of the
tube-frame<00:00:12.240> fuels<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:13.019> consideration<00:00:13.620> yet

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
tube-frame fuels the consideration yet

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.560 
tube-frame fuels the consideration yet
that<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.519> have<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.730> worry<00:00:14.880> about<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.360> tube

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
that you have to worry about is the tube

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.939 
that you have to worry about is the tube

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
here so I had to do a little

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.620 
here so I had to do a little
modification<00:00:17.130> but<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:17.940> fits<00:00:18.119> great<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.420> it

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
modification but it fits great and it

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
works fine a lot of people go with the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:21.859 
works fine a lot of people go with the

straight<00:00:25.680> out<00:00:25.740> with<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:26.039> point<00:00:26.250> on<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.550> end<00:00:26.640> of

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
straight out with a point on the end of

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:27.019 
straight out with a point on the end of
it

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029

that<00:00:27.300> one<00:00:27.449> works<00:00:27.689> great<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.140> Buell<00:00:28.349> but<00:00:28.830> I

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
that one works great on the Buell but I

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:29.900 
that one works great on the Buell but I
just<00:00:29.039> wanted<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.310> go<00:00:29.460> with<00:00:29.580> something<00:00:29.820> a

$125<00:00:33.719> whereas<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.590> know<00:00:34.649> other<00:00:34.800> systems<00:00:35.340> for

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
$125 whereas you know other systems for

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.979 
$125 whereas you know other systems for
the<00:00:35.610> Buell<00:00:35.790> are<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> lot<00:00:36.149> more<00:00:36.329> expensive<00:00:36.570> and

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
the Buell are a lot more expensive and

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.350 
the Buell are a lot more expensive and
you<00:00:37.950> know<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.340> works<00:00:38.489> great<00:00:38.760> it's<00:00:39.030> got<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.210> good

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
you know it works great it's got a good

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.690 
you know it works great it's got a good
flow<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.680> clears<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> frame<00:00:41.340> rails

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
flow and it clears the frame rails

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.760 
flow and it clears the frame rails
if<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.090> shim<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.510> out<00:00:42.660> because<00:00:43.320> I'm<00:00:43.469> about<00:00:43.620> to

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
if you shim it out because I'm about to

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.369 
if you shim it out because I'm about to
show<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.309> video<00:00:44.629> this<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.840> S&amp;S

direct bolt-on for a Sportster or big

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.170 
direct bolt-on for a Sportster or big
twin<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.710> have<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.920> order<00:00:53.070> separate<00:00:53.850> models

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
twin you have to order separate models

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.340 
twin you have to order separate models
for<00:00:54.360> each<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.600> those<00:00:54.719> bikes<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.140> there's<00:00:55.289> a

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
for each of those bikes so there's a

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.290 
for each of those bikes so there's a
separate<00:00:55.590> big<00:00:55.860> 21<00:00:56.250> separate<00:00:56.730> Sportster<00:00:57.149> one

separate big 21 separate Sportster one

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.270 
separate big 21 separate Sportster one
but<00:00:57.420> they<00:00:57.510> look<00:00:57.660> pretty<00:00:57.870> much<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.050> same<00:00:58.280> this

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
but they look pretty much the same this

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.580 
but they look pretty much the same this
particular<00:00:59.699> one<00:00:59.850> is<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> Sportster<00:01:00.390> unit<00:01:00.780> it's

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
particular one is a Sportster unit it's

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.789 
particular one is a Sportster unit it's
got<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:02.010> air<00:01:02.670> cleaner<00:01:02.940> cover<00:01:03.719> mounting<00:01:04.350> bolt<00:01:04.559> in

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
got a air cleaner cover mounting bolt in

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.980 
got a air cleaner cover mounting bolt in
the<00:01:04.979> middle<00:01:05.339> here<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:06.390> your<00:01:06.540> big<00:01:06.689> twin

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the middle here so that on your big twin

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.020 
the middle here so that on your big twin
you<00:01:07.170> can<00:01:07.320> actually<00:01:07.710> reuse<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.430> stock<00:01:08.670> cover

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
you can actually reuse the stock cover

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.330 
you can actually reuse the stock cover
if<00:01:09.600> it's<00:01:09.869> got<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.200> central<00:01:10.590> mounting<00:01:10.950> bolt<00:01:11.130> on

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
if it's got the central mounting bolt on

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.649 
if it's got the central mounting bolt on
it<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.820> that's<00:01:12.000> why<00:01:12.119> they<00:01:12.150> call<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
it and that's why they call it the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.880 
it and that's why they call it the
stealth<00:01:12.900> kit<00:01:13.200> because<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.470> could<00:01:13.740> actually

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
stealth kit because you could actually

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.940 
stealth kit because you could actually
put<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.340> big<00:01:14.630> giant<00:01:15.630> filter<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.229> behind<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
put this big giant filter in behind the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.060 
put this big giant filter in behind the
stock<00:01:17.220> air<00:01:17.970> cleaner<00:01:18.780> cover<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.409> no<00:01:19.740> one<00:01:19.890> would

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
stock air cleaner cover and no one would

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.310 
stock air cleaner cover and no one would
know<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.610> had<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> an<00:01:21.390> aftermarket<00:01:21.960> air

the neat thing about this is that on

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.590 
the neat thing about this is that on
other<00:01:43.829> kinds<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.490> aftermarket<00:01:45.119> air<00:01:45.240> cleaners

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.760 
breather
out<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.250> head<00:01:50.399> bolts<00:01:50.700> somehow<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.770> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
out of the head bolts somehow and the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.410 
out of the head bolts somehow and the
air<00:01:52.920> cleaner<00:01:53.040> kits<00:01:53.399> didn't<00:01:53.670> include<00:01:54.000> anything

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
air cleaner kits didn't include anything

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.030 
air cleaner kits didn't include anything
that<00:01:54.540> would<00:01:54.750> do<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.229> you'd<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.590> buy

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
that would do that so you'd have to buy

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.069 
that would do that so you'd have to buy
an<00:01:56.189> air<00:01:56.310> cleaner<00:01:56.399> kit<00:01:56.729> plus<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.450> breather<00:01:57.750> kit

an air cleaner kit plus a breather kit

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.899 
an air cleaner kit plus a breather kit
that<00:01:58.259> goes<00:01:58.409> with<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.680> now<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.430> one<00:01:59.670> it's

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
that goes with it now this one it's

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.940 
that goes with it now this one it's
actually<00:02:00.180> built<00:02:00.659> into<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.439> unit<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:01.920> you

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
actually built into the unit so you

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.490 
actually built into the unit so you
literally<00:02:02.280> just<00:02:02.549> take<00:02:02.610> off<00:02:02.850> your<00:02:03.090> stock

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
hardware including the breather bolts

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.850 
hardware including the breather bolts
and<00:02:06.450> then<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.750> get<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:07.110> couple<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.680> breather

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
and then you get a couple of breather

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.199 
and then you get a couple of breather
bolts<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.729> come<00:02:08.970> with<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.330> kit

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
bolts that come with this kit

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.789 
bolts that come with this kit
and<00:02:10.329> you<00:02:10.750> can<00:02:10.899> see<00:02:11.140> if<00:02:11.290> you<00:02:11.409> look<00:02:11.439> in<00:02:11.680> these

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
and you can see if you look in these

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.959 
and you can see if you look in these
holes<00:02:12.189> here<00:02:13.950> know<00:02:14.950> how<00:02:15.129> well<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.430> can<00:02:15.579> see

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:15.969 
holes here know how well you can see

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.819 
holes here know how well you can see
that<00:02:16.209> so<00:02:16.689> I've<00:02:16.780> got<00:02:16.930> this<00:02:17.079> q-tip<00:02:17.500> here<00:02:17.680> so

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
that so I've got this q-tip here so

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.729 
that so I've got this q-tip here so
there's<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.099> hole<00:02:18.340> here<00:02:18.640> that<00:02:18.849> goes<00:02:19.079> from<00:02:20.079> where

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
there's a hole here that goes from where

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.660 
there's a hole here that goes from where
the<00:02:20.859> breather<00:02:21.040> bolts<00:02:21.219> go<00:02:21.519> in<00:02:23.159> down<00:02:24.159> here<00:02:24.459> into

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
the breather bolts go in down here into

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.410 
the breather bolts go in down here into
this<00:02:24.790> passageway<00:02:25.299> so<00:02:26.219> your<00:02:27.219> crankcase<00:02:28.060> is

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
this passageway so your crankcase is

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.530 
this passageway so your crankcase is
vented<00:02:28.930> through<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.290> head<00:02:30.359> through<00:02:31.359> these

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
vented through the head through these

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.520 
vented through the head through these
holes<00:02:31.980> into<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.549> carburetor<00:02:34.260> which<00:02:35.260> means

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
holes into the carburetor which means

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.490 
holes into the carburetor which means
you<00:02:36.400> don't<00:02:36.519> have<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.760> worry<00:02:36.939> about<00:02:37.500> routing

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
you don't have to worry about routing

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.500 
you don't have to worry about routing
the<00:02:38.829> breather<00:02:39.219> lines<00:02:39.489> or<00:02:39.790> anything<00:02:40.000> else<00:02:40.239> it's

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
the breather lines or anything else it's

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.890 
the breather lines or anything else it's
it's<00:02:40.780> just<00:02:42.150> unhook<00:02:43.150> all<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.480> old<00:02:43.599> hardware

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
it's just unhook all the old hardware

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.509 
it's just unhook all the old hardware
throw<00:02:44.109> it<00:02:44.169> away<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:44.590> plug<00:02:44.859> this<00:02:44.980> thing<00:02:45.040> in<00:02:45.370> and

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
throw it away and plug this thing in and

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.319 
throw it away and plug this thing in and
you're<00:02:45.609> ready<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:45.879> roll

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
you're ready to roll

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.030 
you're ready to roll
the<00:02:46.840> carburetor<00:02:47.260> kind<00:02:47.409> of<00:02:47.470> pressure<00:02:47.680> fits

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
the carburetor kind of pressure fits

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.770 
the carburetor kind of pressure fits
into<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.340> rubber<00:02:48.639> gasket<00:02:48.879> so<00:02:49.269> this<00:02:49.419> is<00:02:49.540> on<00:02:49.659> the

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
into a rubber gasket so this is on the

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.149 
into a rubber gasket so this is on the
carburetor<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:50.319> then<00:02:50.560> on<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:50.829> intake

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
carburetor and then on the intake

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.440 
carburetor and then on the intake
manifold<00:02:51.669> you<00:02:52.060> can<00:02:52.209> see<00:02:52.359> this<00:02:52.480> black<00:02:54.450> rubber

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
manifold you can see this black rubber

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.879 
manifold you can see this black rubber
gasket<00:02:56.079> here<00:02:57.090> is<00:02:58.090> what<00:02:58.329> the<00:02:58.419> carburetor

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
gasket here is what the carburetor

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.500 
gasket here is what the carburetor
pressure<00:02:59.889> fits<00:03:00.219> into<00:03:00.639> so<00:03:00.819> what<00:03:00.909> I'm<00:03:01.000> gonna<00:03:01.150> do

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
pressure fits into so what I'm gonna do

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.690 
pressure fits into so what I'm gonna do
is<00:03:02.109> shim<00:03:02.409> out<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.680> carburetor<00:03:03.010> just<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.370> little

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
is shim out the carburetor just a little

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.569 
is shim out the carburetor just a little
bit<00:03:03.909> maybe<00:03:04.120> an<00:03:04.419> eighth<00:03:04.599> of<00:03:04.780> an<00:03:04.959> inch<00:03:05.109> at<00:03:05.739> most

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
bit maybe an eighth of an inch at most

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.089 
bit maybe an eighth of an inch at most
so<00:03:07.209> it's<00:03:07.389> not<00:03:07.659> all<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.049> way<00:03:08.139> down<00:03:08.379> into<00:03:08.829> that

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
so it's not all the way down into that

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.970 
so it's not all the way down into that
rubber<00:03:09.340> gasket<00:03:09.969> and<00:03:10.139> then<00:03:11.139> see<00:03:11.379> how<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.560> runs

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
rubber gasket and then see how it runs

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.949 
rubber gasket and then see how it runs
that<00:03:12.609> is<00:03:12.819> to<00:03:12.969> be<00:03:13.120> able<00:03:13.209> to<00:03:13.359> clear<00:03:13.629> the<00:03:13.780> frame

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
that is to be able to clear the frame

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.009 
that is to be able to clear the frame
rails<00:03:14.229> here<00:03:15.389> alright<00:03:16.389> let's<00:03:16.569> take<00:03:16.690> a<00:03:16.750> look<00:03:16.930> at

rails here alright let's take a look at
how<00:03:17.109> this<00:03:17.260> thing's<00:03:17.440> gonna<00:03:17.560> fit<00:03:17.769> on<00:03:17.919> here<00:03:18.159> these

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
how this thing's gonna fit on here these

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.189 
how this thing's gonna fit on here these
are<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.519> frame<00:03:18.849> tubes<00:03:19.209> I've<00:03:19.510> covered<00:03:19.959> with

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:20.199 
are the frame tubes I've covered with

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.599 
are the frame tubes I've covered with
paper<00:03:20.440> so<00:03:20.739> that<00:03:20.769> it<00:03:20.949> don't<00:03:21.099> scratch<00:03:21.400> them<00:03:21.609> up

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
paper so that it don't scratch them up

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.699 
paper so that it don't scratch them up
if<00:03:24.609> it<00:03:24.819> were<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.090> just<00:03:25.299> go<00:03:25.449> on<00:03:25.479> like<00:03:26.109> this<00:03:26.169> even

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
if it were to just go on like this even

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.159 
if it were to just go on like this even
with<00:03:26.859> a<00:03:26.889> couple<00:03:27.220> of<00:03:27.340> rubber<00:03:27.810> there<00:03:28.810> rubber

with a couple of rubber there rubber

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:30.569 
with a couple of rubber there rubber
coated<00:03:29.500> washers<00:03:29.889> that<00:03:29.919> you<00:03:30.129> can<00:03:30.280> put<00:03:30.430> in<00:03:30.549> here

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
coated washers that you can put in here

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.300 
coated washers that you can put in here
it<00:03:31.359> is<00:03:31.599> going<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:31.959> actually<00:03:32.109> be<00:03:32.290> touching<00:03:32.799> the

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
it is going to actually be touching the

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.979 
it is going to actually be touching the
frame<00:03:33.519> tubes<00:03:33.879> and<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.479> engine<00:03:34.780> moves

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
frame tubes and the engine moves

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.839 
frame tubes and the engine moves
independently<00:03:35.169> of<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.680> frame<00:03:35.889> tubes<00:03:36.129> so<00:03:36.609> that

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
independently of the frame tubes so that

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.069 
independently of the frame tubes so that
would<00:03:37.000> just<00:03:37.239> beat<00:03:37.359> the<00:03:37.449> hell<00:03:37.569> out<00:03:37.689> of<00:03:37.720> my<00:03:37.870> tubes

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
would just beat the hell out of my tubes

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.929 
would just beat the hell out of my tubes
and<00:03:38.439> make<00:03:38.620> probably<00:03:39.040> a<00:03:39.069> terrible<00:03:39.459> noise<00:03:39.609> at

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:39.939 
and make probably a terrible noise at

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:41.610 
and make probably a terrible noise at
the<00:03:40.030> same<00:03:40.180> time<00:03:40.479> so<00:03:40.689> what<00:03:40.780> I've<00:03:40.870> got<00:03:41.019> to<00:03:41.139> do<00:03:41.379> if

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
the same time so what I've got to do if

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.460 
the same time so what I've got to do if
I<00:03:42.009> want<00:03:42.189> to<00:03:42.250> use<00:03:42.340> this<00:03:42.519> air<00:03:42.669> cleaner<00:03:42.819> is<00:03:43.470> shim

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
I want to use this air cleaner is shim

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.640 
I want to use this air cleaner is shim
it<00:03:44.590> out<00:03:44.709> here<00:03:45.750> so<00:03:46.750> I've<00:03:46.840> bought<00:03:46.989> some<00:03:47.199> washers

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
it out here so I've bought some washers

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.860 
it out here so I've bought some washers
I'm<00:03:48.009> gonna<00:03:48.159> use<00:03:48.340> some<00:03:48.939> of<00:03:48.970> these<00:03:49.120> washers<00:03:49.689> in

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
I'm gonna use some of these washers in

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.990 
I'm gonna use some of these washers in
conjunction<00:03:50.560> with<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.979> rubber<00:03:51.220> coated<00:03:51.549> metal

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
conjunction with the rubber coated metal

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.420 
conjunction with the rubber coated metal
washers<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:53.290> seal<00:03:54.069> the<00:03:54.310> oil<00:03:55.269> in<00:03:55.620> up<00:03:56.620> here

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
washers to seal the oil in up here

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.009 
washers to seal the oil in up here
and<00:03:57.669> try<00:03:57.819> to<00:03:57.879> bring<00:03:58.090> it<00:03:58.299> out<00:03:58.419> just<00:03:58.629> a<00:03:58.780> little

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
and try to bring it out just a little

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.460 
and try to bring it out just a little
teeny<00:03:59.259> bit<00:04:00.239> now<00:04:01.239> in<00:04:01.659> doing<00:04:02.079> that

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
teeny bit now in doing that

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.249 
teeny bit now in doing that
I'm<00:04:03.069> gonna<00:04:03.189> use<00:04:03.459> two<00:04:03.810> gaskets<00:04:04.810> rather<00:04:05.019> than

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:05.259 
I'm gonna use two gaskets rather than

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:07.110 
I'm gonna use two gaskets rather than
one<00:04:05.470> on<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.859> carburetor<00:04:06.280> to<00:04:06.489> try<00:04:06.759> and<00:04:06.849> push<00:04:06.970> it

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
one on the carburetor to try and push it

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.460 
one on the carburetor to try and push it
back<00:04:07.239> a<00:04:07.269> little<00:04:07.419> bit<00:04:07.750> because<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.109> carburetor

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
back a little bit because the carburetor

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.740 
back a little bit because the carburetor
seats<00:04:09.159> into<00:04:09.430> a<00:04:09.579> little<00:04:09.879> rubber<00:04:10.060> gasket<00:04:10.150> on<00:04:10.720> the

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
seats into a little rubber gasket on the

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.110 
seats into a little rubber gasket on the
intake<00:04:11.079> manifold<00:04:11.560> and<00:04:11.799> so<00:04:12.340> obviously<00:04:12.790> if<00:04:12.970> we

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
intake manifold and so obviously if we

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.490 
intake manifold and so obviously if we
pull<00:04:13.329> the<00:04:13.419> carburetor<00:04:13.780> too<00:04:13.959> far<00:04:14.169> out<00:04:14.290> then

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
pull the carburetor too far out then

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.409 
pull the carburetor too far out then
you're<00:04:14.620> going<00:04:14.709> to<00:04:14.769> get<00:04:14.919> a<00:04:14.949> leak<00:04:15.220> on<00:04:15.459> the<00:04:15.549> intake

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
you're going to get a leak on the intake

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.080 
you're going to get a leak on the intake
manifold<00:04:17.169> and

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
manifold and

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.360 
manifold and
it's<00:04:18.239> gonna<00:04:18.329> run<00:04:18.570> crappy<00:04:18.870> I've<00:04:19.799> seen<00:04:20.130> a<00:04:20.160> bunch

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
it's gonna run crappy I've seen a bunch

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.009 
it's gonna run crappy I've seen a bunch
of<00:04:20.459> people<00:04:20.700> run<00:04:20.880> in<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.060> Arlen<00:04:21.329> s<00:04:21.480> big<00:04:21.720> sucker

of people run in the Arlen s big sucker

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.360 
of people run in the Arlen s big sucker
kit<00:04:22.350> and<00:04:22.470> I<00:04:22.500> don't<00:04:22.590> know<00:04:22.800> if<00:04:22.889> they<00:04:23.010> have<00:04:23.160> to<00:04:23.280> go

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
kit and I don't know if they have to go

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.620 
kit and I don't know if they have to go
through<00:04:23.580> all<00:04:23.700> this<00:04:23.850> to<00:04:24.030> put<00:04:24.150> that<00:04:24.330> on<00:04:24.480> their

through all this to put that on their

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.180 
through all this to put that on their
bike<00:04:24.780> too<00:04:25.110> if<00:04:25.290> it<00:04:25.440> looks<00:04:25.710> pretty<00:04:25.980> much<00:04:26.130> the

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
bike too if it looks pretty much the

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.129 
bike too if it looks pretty much the
same<00:04:26.370> when<00:04:26.669> you<00:04:26.760> look<00:04:26.910> at<00:04:27.060> it<00:04:27.210> on<00:04:27.389> the<00:04:27.840> internet

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
same when you look at it on the internet

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:29.600 
same when you look at it on the internet
but<00:04:28.230> I'm<00:04:28.530> not<00:04:28.740> you<00:04:29.100> know<00:04:29.190> I<00:04:29.220> haven't<00:04:29.370> actually

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
but I'm not you know I haven't actually

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.190 
but I'm not you know I haven't actually
gotten<00:04:29.910> one<00:04:30.090> in<00:04:30.180> my<00:04:30.270> hands<00:04:30.450> and<00:04:30.690> tried<00:04:30.810> to<00:04:30.840> fit

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
gotten one in my hands and tried to fit

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.350 
gotten one in my hands and tried to fit
it<00:04:31.320> on<00:04:31.410> here<00:04:31.710> but<00:04:32.100> this<00:04:32.250> one<00:04:32.400> definitely<00:04:32.580> is

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
it on here but this one definitely is

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.350 
it on here but this one definitely is
gonna<00:04:33.540> touch<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:33.930> frame<00:04:34.110> tubes<00:04:34.970> if<00:04:35.970> you<00:04:36.180> just

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
gonna touch the frame tubes if you just

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.750 
gonna touch the frame tubes if you just
put<00:04:36.570> it<00:04:36.660> in<00:04:36.750> you<00:04:37.380> know<00:04:37.470> just<00:04:38.100> bolt<00:04:38.280> it<00:04:38.430> directly

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
put it in you know just bolt it directly

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.970 
put it in you know just bolt it directly
on<00:04:38.940> so<00:04:39.240> we'll<00:04:39.990> do<00:04:40.080> a<00:04:40.110> little<00:04:40.169> shimmy<00:04:40.440> and<00:04:40.770> we'll

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
on so we'll do a little shimmy and we'll

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.100 
on so we'll do a little shimmy and we'll
see<00:04:41.100> how<00:04:41.190> it<00:04:41.250> works<00:04:41.660> all<00:04:42.660> right<00:04:42.720> so<00:04:42.900> here's<00:04:43.050> the

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
see how it works all right so here's the

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.020 
see how it works all right so here's the
washer<00:04:43.470> stack<00:04:43.680> I'm<00:04:43.830> going<00:04:44.070> with<00:04:44.250> but<00:04:44.790> with<00:04:44.940> the

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
washer stack I'm going with but with the

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.190 
washer stack I'm going with but with the
washers<00:04:45.389> they<00:04:45.510> gave<00:04:45.690> me<00:04:45.870> all<00:04:45.900> the

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
washers they gave me all the

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.320 
washers they gave me all the
rubber-coated<00:04:46.530> metal<00:04:47.280> washers<00:04:48.000> and<00:04:48.210> then

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
rubber-coated metal washers and then

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.760 
rubber-coated metal washers and then
just<00:04:48.570> one<00:04:48.810> extra<00:04:50.479> steel<00:04:51.479> washer<00:04:51.750> in<00:04:52.110> there<00:04:52.320> and

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
just one extra steel washer in there and

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.550 
just one extra steel washer in there and
that'll<00:04:53.100> put<00:04:53.280> it<00:04:54.050> probably<00:04:55.050> an<00:04:55.139> eighth<00:04:55.260> of<00:04:55.440> an

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
that'll put it probably an eighth of an

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.830 
that'll put it probably an eighth of an
inch<00:04:55.650> away<00:04:55.889> from<00:04:56.010> the<00:04:56.280> frame<00:04:56.490> rail<00:04:56.840> maybe

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
inch away from the frame rail maybe

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.940 
inch away from the frame rail maybe
between<00:04:58.020> an<00:04:58.260> eighth<00:04:58.350> of<00:04:58.500> an<00:04:58.620> inch<00:04:58.680> and<00:04:58.830> a

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
between an eighth of an inch and a

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.280 
between an eighth of an inch and a
quarter<00:04:59.100> of<00:04:59.400> an<00:04:59.820> inch<00:04:59.940> at<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:00.750> bottom<00:05:01.139> of<00:05:01.229> the

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
quarter of an inch at the bottom of the

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
air cleaner which should be enough space

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.060 
air cleaner which should be enough space
as<00:05:03.840> long<00:05:03.870> as<00:05:04.110> it's<00:05:04.229> not<00:05:04.350> jumping<00:05:04.680> from<00:05:04.830> side<00:05:05.040> to

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
as long as it's not jumping from side to

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.260 
as long as it's not jumping from side to
side<00:05:05.250> we'll<00:05:06.120> find<00:05:06.389> out

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
side we'll find out

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
side we'll find out
but<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:09.360> reason<00:05:09.570> I'm<00:05:09.660> doing<00:05:09.750> this<00:05:09.870> is<00:05:10.050> you<00:05:10.169> see

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
but the reason I'm doing this is you see

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.810 
but the reason I'm doing this is you see
there<00:05:10.410> are<00:05:10.500> very<00:05:10.650> many<00:05:10.710> threads<00:05:11.100> here<00:05:11.370> so<00:05:11.729> I've

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
there are very many threads here so I've

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.190 
there are very many threads here so I've
put<00:05:11.970> another<00:05:12.150> washer<00:05:12.600> in<00:05:12.720> here<00:05:12.840> I'm<00:05:12.930> afraid<00:05:13.050> I

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
put another washer in here I'm afraid I

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.300 
put another washer in here I'm afraid I
won't<00:05:13.350> have<00:05:13.440> enough<00:05:13.680> threads<00:05:13.919> in<00:05:14.070> the<00:05:14.160> head

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
won't have enough threads in the head

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.409 
won't have enough threads in the head
and<00:05:14.460> it<00:05:14.550> might<00:05:14.669> strip<00:05:14.940> them<00:05:15.120> or<00:05:15.210> they<00:05:15.300> might

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
and it might strip them or they might

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.629 
and it might strip them or they might
work<00:05:15.570> loose<00:05:16.010> all<00:05:17.010> right<00:05:17.040> here's<00:05:17.280> the<00:05:17.340> setup

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
work loose all right here's the setup

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.000 
work loose all right here's the setup
with<00:05:18.030> with<00:05:18.419> only<00:05:18.600> one<00:05:18.900> of<00:05:19.139> these<00:05:19.320> washers<00:05:19.830> in

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
with with only one of these washers in

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.100 
with with only one of these washers in
the<00:05:20.130> mix<00:05:20.340> you<00:05:20.520> can<00:05:20.669> see<00:05:20.850> here<00:05:21.090> already<00:05:21.750> can't

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
the mix you can see here already can't

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.180 
the mix you can see here already can't
now<00:05:22.410> you<00:05:22.500> can<00:05:22.620> see<00:05:22.740> it<00:05:22.800> up<00:05:22.830> here<00:05:22.919> so<00:05:23.070> I've<00:05:23.160> got

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
now you can see it up here so I've got

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.909 
now you can see it up here so I've got
one<00:05:23.580> of<00:05:23.700> these<00:05:23.820> fat<00:05:24.539> washers<00:05:24.990> in<00:05:25.169> and<00:05:25.470> then<00:05:25.800> the

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
one of these fat washers in and then the

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:26.779 
one of these fat washers in and then the
rest<00:05:26.070> of<00:05:26.190> them<00:05:26.280> of<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.460> little<00:05:26.669> rubber

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
rest of them of the little rubber

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.750 
rest of them of the little rubber
washers<00:05:27.330> now<00:05:27.780> you<00:05:27.900> have<00:05:28.080> about<00:05:28.350> a<00:05:29.039> little<00:05:29.100> more

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
washers now you have about a little more

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.400 
washers now you have about a little more
than<00:05:29.820> one<00:05:30.300> of<00:05:30.390> these<00:05:30.510> washers<00:05:30.900> worth<00:05:31.200> of

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
than one of these washers worth of

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.980 
than one of these washers worth of
clearance<00:05:31.860> between<00:05:32.330> the<00:05:33.330> air<00:05:33.479> cleaner<00:05:33.810> and

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
clearance between the air cleaner and

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:56.339 
clearance between the air cleaner and
the<00:05:34.440> frame<00:05:34.680> rail

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:56.349 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:59.079 

all<00:05:57.349> right<00:05:57.499> so<00:05:57.680> as<00:05:57.740> you<00:05:57.830> can<00:05:57.979> see<00:05:58.089> that's

00:05:59.079 --> 00:05:59.089 
all right so as you can see that's

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:00.519 
all right so as you can see that's
plenty<00:05:59.539> of<00:05:59.629> clearance<00:05:59.869> it<00:06:00.050> doesn't<00:06:00.289> look<00:06:00.379> like

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:00.529 
plenty of clearance it doesn't look like

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:02.589 
plenty of clearance it doesn't look like
much<00:06:00.740> but<00:06:01.009> that's<00:06:01.159> plenty<00:06:01.520> it<00:06:02.210> doesn't<00:06:02.509> move

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
much but that's plenty it doesn't move

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:03.820 
much but that's plenty it doesn't move
around<00:06:02.659> at<00:06:02.990> all<00:06:03.110> I<00:06:03.139> wrapped<00:06:03.409> it<00:06:03.499> all<00:06:03.619> the<00:06:03.740> way

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
around at all I wrapped it all the way

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.609 
around at all I wrapped it all the way
up<00:06:03.919> to<00:06:04.099> close<00:06:05.059> to<00:06:05.180> 6000<00:06:05.749> rpms<00:06:06.110> there<00:06:06.349> and<00:06:06.529> it

00:06:06.609 --> 00:06:06.619 
up to close to 6000 rpms there and it

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:09.159 
up to close to 6000 rpms there and it
does<00:06:06.770> not<00:06:06.919> get<00:06:07.610> anywhere<00:06:07.879> close<00:06:08.089> or<00:06:08.509> closing

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:09.169 
does not get anywhere close or closing

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.969 
does not get anywhere close or closing
it<00:06:09.229> any<00:06:09.379> closer<00:06:09.770> to<00:06:10.460> the<00:06:10.580> rails<00:06:10.789> than<00:06:11.089> that<00:06:11.979> so

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:12.979 
it any closer to the rails than that so

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:15.010 
it any closer to the rails than that so
that's<00:06:13.339> good<00:06:13.610> all<00:06:13.999> right<00:06:14.240> with<00:06:14.389> this<00:06:14.509> S&amp;S

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
that's good all right with this S&amp;S

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.719 
that's good all right with this S&amp;S

terms of putting a cover on it if you
want<00:06:34.309> to<00:06:34.370> I<00:06:34.610> think<00:06:34.729> it<00:06:34.879> looks<00:06:35.029> pretty<00:06:35.120> cool<00:06:35.589> in

and<00:06:50.419> paint<00:06:50.689> it<00:06:50.779> black<00:06:50.930> I<00:06:51.080> might<00:06:51.229> do<00:06:51.409> that<00:06:51.559> but

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:51.729 
and paint it black I might do that but

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:53.859 
and paint it black I might do that but
there's<00:06:52.729> not<00:06:52.849> much<00:06:52.999> knee<00:06:53.240> clearance<00:06:53.659> here

00:06:53.859 --> 00:06:53.869 
there's not much knee clearance here

00:06:53.869 --> 00:06:54.159 
there's not much knee clearance here
either

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:54.169 
either

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:58.059 
either
so<00:06:55.119> it's<00:06:56.119> kind<00:06:56.360> of<00:06:56.449> better<00:06:56.709> without<00:06:57.709> a<00:06:57.770> cover

00:06:58.059 --> 00:06:58.069 
so it's kind of better without a cover

00:06:58.069 --> 00:06:59.110 
so it's kind of better without a cover
on<00:06:58.279> it<00:06:58.399> unless<00:06:58.490> you<00:06:58.639> can<00:06:58.669> get<00:06:58.819> something<00:06:58.999> that

00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 
on it unless you can get something that

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.459 
on it unless you can get something that
fits<00:06:59.240> really<00:06:59.539> tight<00:07:00.009> and<00:07:01.009> as<00:07:01.249> a<00:07:01.279> bonus<00:07:02.349> in<00:07:03.349> this

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:03.469 
fits really tight and as a bonus in this

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:05.799 
fits really tight and as a bonus in this
giant<00:07:04.039> box<00:07:04.219> of<00:07:04.459> parts<00:07:04.669> is<00:07:05.059> all<00:07:05.360> stuff<00:07:05.779> that

00:07:05.799 --> 00:07:05.809 
giant box of parts is all stuff that

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:07.209 
giant box of parts is all stuff that
came<00:07:06.139> off<00:07:06.289> of<00:07:06.319> the<00:07:06.439> building<00:07:06.800> doesn't<00:07:06.949> have<00:07:07.069> to

00:07:12.369 --> 00:07:12.379 
canister and everything else if we take

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:14.949 
canister and everything else if we take
a<00:07:12.439> look<00:07:12.589> inside<00:07:13.069> of<00:07:13.399> the<00:07:13.639> stock<00:07:13.849> air<00:07:14.089> box<00:07:14.120> if

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:14.959 
a look inside of the stock air box if

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:16.629 
a look inside of the stock air box if
you<00:07:15.080> can<00:07:15.199> see<00:07:15.349> the<00:07:15.469> stock<00:07:15.740> air<00:07:16.009> box<00:07:16.039> uses

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639 
you can see the stock air box uses

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:17.980 
you can see the stock air box uses
something<00:07:16.909> much<00:07:17.059> like<00:07:17.269> the<00:07:17.389> force<00:07:17.599> winder

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:17.990 
something much like the force winder

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.199 
something much like the force winder
that<00:07:18.499> big<00:07:18.740> tube<00:07:19.069> connects<00:07:19.639> up<00:07:19.729> to<00:07:19.759> that<00:07:20.029> big

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:20.209 
that big tube connects up to that big

00:07:20.209 --> 00:07:21.759 
that big tube connects up to that big
air<00:07:20.360> filter<00:07:20.689> and<00:07:20.809> it<00:07:20.899> was<00:07:21.019> pretty<00:07:21.259> efficient

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:21.769 
air filter and it was pretty efficient

00:07:21.769 --> 00:07:24.449 
air filter and it was pretty efficient
but<00:07:21.919> the<00:07:22.699> gasket<00:07:23.149> was<00:07:23.269> starting<00:07:23.599> to<00:07:23.629> go<00:07:23.899> and

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:24.459 
but the gasket was starting to go and

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:26.769 
but the gasket was starting to go and
one<00:07:25.459> of<00:07:25.519> the<00:07:25.610> bolts<00:07:25.789> got<00:07:26.059> seized<00:07:26.330> in<00:07:26.509> there<00:07:26.629> so

00:07:26.769 --> 00:07:26.779 
one of the bolts got seized in there so

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:28.749 
one of the bolts got seized in there so
I<00:07:26.809> had<00:07:26.930> to<00:07:27.019> drill<00:07:27.229> it<00:07:27.349> out<00:07:27.469> so<00:07:27.800> would<00:07:28.519> have<00:07:28.610> cost

00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:28.759 
I had to drill it out so would have cost

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:31.239 
I had to drill it out so would have cost
me<00:07:28.879> about<00:07:28.969> the<00:07:29.209> same<00:07:29.389> to<00:07:29.599> buy<00:07:29.749> up<00:07:30.249> somebody's

00:07:31.239 --> 00:07:31.249 
me about the same to buy up somebody's

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:33.219 
me about the same to buy up somebody's
old<00:07:31.459> used<00:07:31.819> stock<00:07:32.240> air<00:07:32.449> box<00:07:32.479> and<00:07:32.899> put<00:07:33.019> it<00:07:33.110> back

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:33.229 
old used stock air box and put it back

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:36.159 
old used stock air box and put it back
together<00:07:33.379> it<00:07:33.860> did<00:07:34.039> to<00:07:34.189> just<00:07:34.430> replace<00:07:35.120> it<00:07:35.419> with

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:36.169 
together it did to just replace it with

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:40.290 
together it did to just replace it with
this<00:07:36.349> new<00:07:36.559> unit<00:07:36.949> here

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:40.300 

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.560 

this<00:07:41.300> one<00:07:41.449> looks<00:07:41.659> and<00:07:41.810> works<00:07:41.990> but<00:07:42.169> even<00:07:42.379> better
