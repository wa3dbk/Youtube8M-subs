anyway<00:00:23.220> light<00:00:23.699> thinks<00:00:24.180> it's<00:00:24.390> pretty

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
anyway light thinks it's pretty

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.439 
anyway light thinks it's pretty
impressive<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.800> gets<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.250> be<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.430> particle<00:00:26.970> and

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
impressive it gets to be a particle and

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.259 
impressive it gets to be a particle and
wave<00:00:27.660> at<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.349> same<00:00:28.590> time<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.760> travels<00:00:30.210> at

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
wave at the same time and it travels at

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.179 
wave at the same time and it travels at
the<00:00:30.300> speed<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.689> around<00:00:30.779> 300,000<00:00:31.679> meters<00:00:31.980> per

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
the speed of around 300,000 meters per

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.620 
the speed of around 300,000 meters per
second<00:00:32.610> which<00:00:32.759> means<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:33.180> can<00:00:33.300> get<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
second which means it can get to the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.450 
second which means it can get to the
moon<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.020> back<00:00:34.140> 20<00:00:34.649> times<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.250> single

it's impressive now light a German team

it's impressive now light a German team

using crystals and lasers which is the

using crystals and lasers which is the
most<00:00:48.870> 80s<00:00:49.710> sci-fi<00:00:50.039> thing<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.730> think<00:00:50.940> I've<00:00:51.090> ever

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
most 80s sci-fi thing I think I've ever

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.600 
most 80s sci-fi thing I think I've ever
heard<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.289> you've<00:00:52.559> got<00:00:52.739> an<00:00:52.860> opaque<00:00:53.100> crystal

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
heard of so you've got an opaque crystal

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.340 
heard of so you've got an opaque crystal
and<00:00:53.760> it's<00:00:53.879> atoms<00:00:54.270> are<00:00:54.390> all<00:00:54.420> vibrating<00:00:55.260> around

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
and it's atoms are all vibrating around

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.189 
and it's atoms are all vibrating around
like<00:00:55.949> they<00:00:56.129> do<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.579> at<00:00:57.120> any<00:00:57.239> time<00:00:57.300> those<00:00:57.840> atoms

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
like they do and at any time those atoms

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.750 
like they do and at any time those atoms
could<00:00:58.379> be<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.770> couple<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.160> different<00:00:59.460> states

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
could be in a couple of different states

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.939 
could be in a couple of different states
and<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.059> team<00:01:00.270> fired<00:01:00.629> lasers<00:01:01.230> into<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
and the team fired lasers into the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.160 
and the team fired lasers into the
crystal<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.730> make<00:01:02.879> those<00:01:03.059> atoms<00:01:03.449> exist<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.049> a

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
crystal to make those atoms exist in a

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.740 
crystal to make those atoms exist in a
quantum<00:01:04.799> superposition<00:01:05.729> which<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.510> worst

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
quantum superposition which is the worst

James Bond movie which is a mix of those

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
two states in that superposition the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.760 
two states in that superposition the
opaque<00:01:12.030> crystal<00:01:12.540> became<00:01:12.840> transparent<00:01:13.619> to

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
opaque crystal became transparent to

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.469 
opaque crystal became transparent to
certain<00:01:14.010> kinds<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.280> light<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.850> they<00:01:14.970> fired<00:01:15.270> a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
certain kinds of light so they fired a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.420 
certain kinds of light so they fired a
second<00:01:15.930> laser<00:01:16.080> into<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.680> now<00:01:16.770> transparent

second laser into the now transparent
crystal<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.330> passed<00:01:18.600> through<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.140> then

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
crystal and it passed through and then

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.899 
crystal and it passed through and then
they<00:01:19.409> shut<00:01:19.470> off<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.040> first<00:01:20.250> laser<00:01:20.460> whoops

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
they shut off the first laser whoops

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.940 
they shut off the first laser whoops
crystal<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.689> opaque<00:01:21.990> again<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
crystal is opaque again and the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.649 
crystal is opaque again and the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
are trapped in the crystal now this

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.880 
are trapped in the crystal now this
isn't<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.720> first<00:01:27.780> time<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.290> we<00:01:28.409> put<00:01:28.650> light

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
isn't the first time that we put light

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.440 
isn't the first time that we put light
in<00:01:28.920> its<00:01:29.250> place<00:01:29.520> either<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:30.000> previous

experiment by a German team two years

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.969 
experiment by a German team two years
ago<00:01:32.820> use<00:01:33.060> supercooled<00:01:33.810> atoms<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.439> stop<00:01:34.710> light

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
ago use supercooled atoms to stop light

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.670 
ago use supercooled atoms to stop light
for<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.220> couple<00:01:35.579> seconds<00:01:36.000> why<00:01:36.329> do<00:01:36.390> this

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
for a couple seconds why do this

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.530 
for a couple seconds why do this
basically<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.400> other<00:01:38.549> scientists<00:01:39.119> fear

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
basically so the other scientists fear

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.020 
basically so the other scientists fear
and<00:01:39.780> respect<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.500> but<00:01:41.040> also<00:01:41.220> if<00:01:41.670> we<00:01:41.790> trap

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
and respect you but also if we trap

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.700 
and respect you but also if we trap
light<00:01:42.299> we<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:42.689> use<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.140> store<00:01:43.439> and

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
light we can use it to store and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.050 
light we can use it to store and
retrieve<00:01:43.950> data<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.520> that's<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.729> big<00:01:44.880> deal

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
retrieve data and that's a big deal

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.120 
retrieve data and that's a big deal
because<00:01:45.210> currently<00:01:45.689> computers<00:01:46.500> store<00:01:46.920> data

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
because currently computers store data

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.340 
because currently computers store data

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
as a 1 or a 0 and they process that data

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.590

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
in different states at once we could

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.760 
in different states at once we could
store<00:01:53.579> data<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.149> 1<00:01:54.329> or<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> 0<00:01:54.659> both<00:01:55.290> at<00:01:55.500> once
