00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:10.989

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:12.439
 write reports 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:15.439
 tenge 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:21.249
 it cannot become a god 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:23.769
 if you have a meaning 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:25.989
 but the services of dollars on them are responsibility 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:28.989
 so how best 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:32.770
 say for a term 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.000
 as a culture 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.630
 concern companies 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.610
 Libyan money 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.990

 lead to demotion that she got me all 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.370
 a country 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.670
 it turns out that this is repression against 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.670
 opposition points 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.320
 Prime tass is the third time to say 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.830

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.030

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.290

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.890
 he will not interfere however he also 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.160
 four to seven years 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.650
 more than once thanks to the general 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.670

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.670
 total losses and hire 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.900
 I think that now it seems that objects 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.020
 it is 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.440

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.730

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.220

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.540
 first time passed to a lesser extent 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.000
 gears 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 1 votes 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.920
 in parliament considers 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.800

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.130
 I think it's done 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.080
 this is the one 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.080
