hello<00:00:00.599> this<00:00:00.719> is<00:00:00.780> mr.<00:00:01.050> Buffington<00:00:01.469> and<00:00:01.920> this

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
hello this is mr. Buffington and this

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.910 
hello this is mr. Buffington and this
week<00:00:02.939> I<00:00:03.240> actually<00:00:03.780> was<00:00:04.200> building<00:00:04.620> a<00:00:04.710> chicken

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
week I actually was building a chicken

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.909 
week I actually was building a chicken
coop<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:05.549> I<00:00:06.480> needed<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.170> do<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.379> little<00:00:07.710> bit<00:00:07.890> of

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
coop and I needed to do a little bit of

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.270 
coop and I needed to do a little bit of
math<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.370> figure<00:00:08.519> out<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.540> surface<00:00:10.230> area<00:00:10.679> so

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
math to figure out the surface area so

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.799 
math to figure out the surface area so
that<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:11.460> could<00:00:11.580> buy<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.880> right<00:00:12.300> amount<00:00:12.660> of

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
that I could buy the right amount of

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.440 
that I could buy the right amount of
chicken<00:00:13.440> wire<00:00:13.650> so<00:00:14.549> my<00:00:14.820> chickens<00:00:15.150> don't<00:00:15.269> run

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
chicken wire so my chickens don't run

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.670 
chicken wire so my chickens don't run
away<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:15.870> know<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.080> foxes<00:00:16.440> don't<00:00:16.590> eat

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
away and you know the foxes don't eat

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.859 
away and you know the foxes don't eat
them<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:16.920> things<00:00:17.100> like<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:18.090> what<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.600> have

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
them and things like that so what I have

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.960 
them and things like that so what I have
here<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.350> drawing<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.949> about<00:00:20.640> what<00:00:20.850> my

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
here is a drawing of about what my

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.429 
here is a drawing of about what my
chicken<00:00:21.359> yard<00:00:21.600> looks<00:00:22.020> like<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:23.010> it's<00:00:23.250> 32<00:00:23.910> feet

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
chicken yard looks like so it's 32 feet

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.640 
chicken yard looks like so it's 32 feet
across<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.859> then<00:00:25.949> it's<00:00:26.189> six<00:00:26.550> feet<00:00:26.849> tall<00:00:27.150> and

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
across and then it's six feet tall and

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.840 
across and then it's six feet tall and
16<00:00:28.650> feet<00:00:29.240> here<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:30.390> line<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.679> what<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.250> needed<00:00:32.610> to

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
16 feet here in line so what I needed to

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.970 
16 feet here in line so what I needed to
do<00:00:33.030> was<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.480> buy<00:00:33.630> enough<00:00:34.050> chicken<00:00:34.410> wire<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.920> I

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
do was to buy enough chicken wire that I

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.850 
do was to buy enough chicken wire that I
could<00:00:35.219> wrap<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.640> around<00:00:35.790> all<00:00:36.329> sides<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.620> this

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
could wrap it around all sides of this

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.190 
could wrap it around all sides of this
chicken<00:00:38.160> fence<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.940> some<00:00:39.719> people<00:00:39.989> like<00:00:40.170> to

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
chicken fence and some people like to

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.959 
chicken fence and some people like to
cover<00:00:40.500> over<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.890> top<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.399> wanted<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.790> make

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
cover over the top so I wanted to make

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.880 
cover over the top so I wanted to make
sure<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.180> had<00:00:42.420> enough<00:00:42.450> chicken<00:00:42.989> wire<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.739> I

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
sure I had enough chicken wire so that I

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.340 
sure I had enough chicken wire so that I
could<00:00:43.980> cover<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.489> whole<00:00:44.700> thing<00:00:45.030> should<00:00:45.750> you

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
could cover the whole thing should you

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.799 
could cover the whole thing should you
know<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.739> need<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:48.360> know<00:00:48.480> keep<00:00:48.660> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
know I need to you know keep the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.520 
know I need to you know keep the
chickens<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.320> bad<00:00:50.129> animals<00:00:50.579> out<00:00:50.809> all<00:00:51.809> right<00:00:52.140> so

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
chickens in bad animals out all right so

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.990 
chickens in bad animals out all right so
here's<00:00:52.559> what<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:52.980> needed<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.399> do<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.610> needed<00:00:53.910> to

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
here's what I needed to do I needed to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.860 
here's what I needed to do I needed to
find<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> surface<00:00:54.570> area<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.410> entire

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
find the surface area of this entire

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.369 
find the surface area of this entire
rectangular<00:00:57.870> prism<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:59.039> surface<00:00:59.399> area

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
rectangular prism and the surface area

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:06.770 
rectangular prism and the surface area
is<00:01:02.390> equal<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.750> lateral<00:01:04.170> area<00:01:05.479> or<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.659> other

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
is equal to the lateral area or in other

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.289 
is equal to the lateral area or in other
words<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.200> area<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.860> upright<00:01:08.340> sides<00:01:08.700> and

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
words the area of the upright sides and

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.510 
words the area of the upright sides and
that's<00:01:09.510> what<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.439> would<00:01:10.590> definitely<00:01:10.890> need<00:01:11.340> to

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
that's what I would definitely need to

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.570 
that's what I would definitely need to
fence<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.450> then<00:01:12.930> also<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.860> surface<00:01:14.400> area

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
fence in and then also the surface area

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.359 
fence in and then also the surface area
of<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.240> top<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.500> I'll<00:01:16.650> call<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:19.340> put<00:01:20.340> a

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
of the top so I'll call that put a

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.039 
of the top so I'll call that put a
little<00:01:20.580> T<00:01:20.850> down<00:01:21.090> there<00:01:21.299> for<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.509> surface<00:01:21.900> area

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
little T down there for the surface area

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.969 
little T down there for the surface area
of<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.470> top<00:01:22.970> alright<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:25.020> my<00:01:25.350> total<00:01:25.409> surface

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
of the top alright so my total surface

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.179 
of the top alright so my total surface
area<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.610> equal<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.330> lateral<00:01:27.840> area<00:01:28.290> plus

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
area is equal to the lateral area plus

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.319 
area is equal to the lateral area plus
the<00:01:29.790> surface<00:01:30.150> area<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:31.079> top<00:01:31.500> rectangle

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
the surface area of this top rectangle

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.420 
the surface area of this top rectangle
the<00:01:33.329> lateral<00:01:33.810> area<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.320> found<00:01:34.560> by<00:01:34.799> adding<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
the lateral area is found by adding the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.760 
the lateral area is found by adding the
perimeter<00:01:36.150> or<00:01:36.390> multiplying<00:01:37.200> I'm<00:01:37.409> sorry<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
perimeter or multiplying I'm sorry the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.740 
perimeter or multiplying I'm sorry the
perimeter<00:01:38.340> times<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.270> height<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
perimeter times the height and the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.420 
perimeter times the height and the
reason<00:01:40.470> we<00:01:40.560> do<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.740> it's<00:01:41.040> like<00:01:41.220> we're

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
reason we do that it's like we're

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.359 
reason we do that it's like we're
extending<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.600> side<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.409> side<00:01:43.680> and

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
extending this side and this side and

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.580 
extending this side and this side and
the<00:01:44.700> other<00:01:44.790> two<00:01:45.090> sides<00:01:45.329> out<00:01:45.630> into<00:01:46.320> being<00:01:46.530> a

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
the other two sides out into being a

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.969 
the other two sides out into being a
really<00:01:46.950> long<00:01:47.509> rectangle<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.869> length<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.409> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
really long rectangle the length of the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.700 
really long rectangle the length of the
perimeter<00:01:50.579> makes<00:01:51.299> sense<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.810> then<00:01:52.590> we

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
perimeter makes sense and then we

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.130 
perimeter makes sense and then we
multiply<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.490> length<00:01:54.060> times<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.960> height

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
multiply that length times the height

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.200 
multiply that length times the height
that<00:01:55.320> we<00:01:55.439> have<00:01:56.240> so<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.299> have<00:01:57.600> 16<00:01:58.880> 32<00:02:00.170> 16<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.439> 32

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
that we have so I have 16 32 16 and 32

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.520 
that we have so I have 16 32 16 and 32
alright<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.810> my<00:02:03.960> perimeter<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.680> equal<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.219> two

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
alright so my perimeter is equal to two

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:13.130 
alright so my perimeter is equal to two
times<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.860> length<00:02:09.860> plus<00:02:10.860> two<00:02:11.900> times<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
times the length plus two times the

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.860 
times the length plus two times the
width

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.340 

that's<00:02:16.870> my<00:02:17.230> perimeter<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:19.020> we're<00:02:20.020> going<00:02:20.260> to

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
that's my perimeter and we're going to

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.750 
that's my perimeter and we're going to
multiply<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.920> perimeter<00:02:21.720> times<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.930> height

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.130 

and<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:27.940> will<00:02:28.090> give<00:02:28.120> us<00:02:28.270> our<00:02:28.540> lateral<00:02:28.780> area

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
and that will give us our lateral area

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.230 
and that will give us our lateral area
the<00:02:29.710> next<00:02:30.040> part<00:02:30.280> is<00:02:30.430> that<00:02:30.490> we<00:02:30.760> have<00:02:30.850> to<00:02:31.000> find

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
the next part is that we have to find

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.420 
the next part is that we have to find
the<00:02:31.360> area<00:02:31.570> of<00:02:31.900> this<00:02:31.930> rectangle<00:02:32.290> up<00:02:32.740> top<00:02:32.950> which

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
the area of this rectangle up top which

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:41.400 
the area of this rectangle up top which
is<00:02:33.460> 32<00:02:34.150> feet<00:02:34.390> by<00:02:34.870> 16<00:02:35.560> feet<00:02:39.990> all<00:02:40.990> right<00:02:41.170> and

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
is 32 feet by 16 feet all right and

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.170 
is 32 feet by 16 feet all right and
that's<00:02:41.650> going<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:41.950> give<00:02:42.160> us<00:02:42.190> our<00:02:42.520> total

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
that's going to give us our total

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.850 
that's going to give us our total
surface<00:02:43.420> area<00:02:43.630> let's<00:02:44.230> go<00:02:44.380> ahead<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.620> do<00:02:44.830> a

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
surface area let's go ahead and do a

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.350 
surface area let's go ahead and do a
little<00:02:45.130> bit<00:02:45.340> of<00:02:45.370> math<00:02:45.670> here<00:02:46.000> 32<00:02:46.780> x<00:02:47.080> 2<00:02:47.680> is<00:02:47.710> 64<00:02:48.640> 2

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
little bit of math here 32 x 2 is 64 2

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.520 
little bit of math here 32 x 2 is 64 2
times<00:02:49.630> 16<00:02:49.900> is<00:02:50.050> 32<00:02:52.200> we're<00:02:53.200> going<00:02:53.320> to<00:02:53.410> multiply

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
times 16 is 32 we're going to multiply

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:01.410 
times 16 is 32 we're going to multiply
that<00:02:54.100> times<00:02:54.580> 6<00:02:55.260> plus<00:02:56.260> 32<00:02:59.130> x<00:03:00.130> 16<00:03:00.760> this<00:03:01.150> is<00:03:01.300> going

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
that times 6 plus 32 x 16 this is going

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.980 
that times 6 plus 32 x 16 this is going
to<00:03:01.480> give<00:03:01.660> us<00:03:01.690> our<00:03:01.960> total<00:03:02.350> surface<00:03:03.340> area<00:03:03.760> 32<00:03:04.660> and

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
to give us our total surface area 32 and

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:16.340 
to give us our total surface area 32 and
64<00:03:05.830> is<00:03:05.950> 96<00:03:08.220> x<00:03:09.220> 6<00:03:10.020> plus<00:03:11.020> 32<00:03:14.280> times<00:03:15.280> sixteen

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
64 is 96 x 6 plus 32 times sixteen

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:24.420 
64 is 96 x 6 plus 32 times sixteen
ninety<00:03:17.350> six<00:03:17.620> times<00:03:17.890> six<00:03:18.160> is<00:03:19.800> 576<00:03:20.800> and<00:03:22.410> 32<00:03:23.430> times

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
ninety six times six is 576 and 32 times

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:31.760 
ninety six times six is 576 and 32 times
16<00:03:25.180> is<00:03:27.180> 512<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:30.340> when<00:03:30.459> we<00:03:30.580> add<00:03:30.760> those<00:03:31.060> together

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
16 is 512 and when we add those together

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:39.330 
16 is 512 and when we add those together
we<00:03:32.770> get<00:03:36.810> 1088<00:03:37.810> i<00:03:38.230> don't<00:03:38.680> know<00:03:38.770> if<00:03:38.860> you<00:03:38.950> can<00:03:39.100> see

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
we get 1088 i don't know if you can see

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.120 
we get 1088 i don't know if you can see
that<00:03:39.520> very<00:03:39.730> clearly<00:03:39.790> but<00:03:40.300> 1088<00:03:41.260> square<00:03:41.770> feet

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
that very clearly but 1088 square feet

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.300 
that very clearly but 1088 square feet
so<00:03:42.700> we've<00:03:43.000> discovered<00:03:43.600> the<00:03:43.959> lateral<00:03:44.830> surface

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
so we've discovered the lateral surface

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.580 
so we've discovered the lateral surface
area<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:45.880> then<00:03:46.209> also<00:03:46.480> the<00:03:46.780> surface<00:03:47.200> area<00:03:47.380> of

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
area and then also the surface area of

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.650 
area and then also the surface area of
the<00:03:47.830> top<00:03:48.070> so<00:03:48.520> if<00:03:48.640> I<00:03:48.760> want<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.060> get<00:03:49.209> enough

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
the top so if I want to get enough

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.410 
the top so if I want to get enough
chicken<00:03:49.959> wire<00:03:50.260> I'm<00:03:50.500> going<00:03:50.709> to<00:03:50.800> have<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:50.980> get

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
chicken wire I'm going to have to get

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.830 
chicken wire I'm going to have to get
1,000<00:03:52.420> more<00:03:52.600> than<00:03:54.120> 1088<00:03:55.120> square<00:03:56.020> feet<00:03:56.530> of<00:03:56.760> of

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
1,000 more than 1088 square feet of of

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.790 
1,000 more than 1088 square feet of of
chicken<00:03:58.840> wire<00:04:00.989> so<00:04:01.989> here<00:04:02.170> are<00:04:02.260> my<00:04:02.320> chickens

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
chicken wire so here are my chickens

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.500 
chicken wire so here are my chickens
I<00:04:05.080> got<00:04:06.080> the<00:04:06.230> coop<00:04:06.440> finished<00:04:06.980> and<00:04:07.250> as<00:04:08.210> you<00:04:08.330> can

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
I got the coop finished and as you can

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.350 
I got the coop finished and as you can
see<00:04:08.540> around<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:09.140> outside<00:04:09.560> here<00:04:10.010> i<00:04:11.920> show<00:04:12.920> you<00:04:12.950> I

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
see around the outside here i show you I

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.630 
see around the outside here i show you I
didn't<00:04:14.360> run<00:04:14.570> out<00:04:14.600> of<00:04:14.780> chicken<00:04:15.320> wire<00:04:15.500> we<00:04:16.489> had

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
didn't run out of chicken wire we had

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.729 
didn't run out of chicken wire we had
enough<00:04:16.940> to<00:04:17.120> do<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.360> whole<00:04:17.480> thing<00:04:17.709> because<00:04:18.709> we

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
enough to do the whole thing because we

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.160 
enough to do the whole thing because we
use<00:04:19.040> our<00:04:19.220> equations<00:04:19.790> and<00:04:20.060> we<00:04:20.120> found<00:04:20.870> out<00:04:21.049> how

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
use our equations and we found out how

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.710 
use our equations and we found out how
much<00:04:21.200> stuff<00:04:21.650> we<00:04:21.680> needed<00:04:22.010> so<00:04:22.760> say<00:04:23.450> goodbye<00:04:23.600> to

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
much stuff we needed so say goodbye to

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.230 
much stuff we needed so say goodbye to
the<00:04:23.900> chickens<00:04:24.260> but<00:04:24.560> there<00:04:24.770> they<00:04:24.950> are<00:04:25.240> happy

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
the chickens but there they are happy

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.710 
the chickens but there they are happy
inside<00:04:26.570> their<00:04:26.840> house<00:04:27.220> and<00:04:28.540> they're<00:04:29.540> not<00:04:29.660> going

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
inside their house and they're not going

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.170 
inside their house and they're not going
to<00:04:29.900> be<00:04:30.020> able<00:04:30.050> to<00:04:30.350> get<00:04:30.500> away<00:04:30.620> and<00:04:31.070> no<00:04:31.730> animals

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
to be able to get away and no animals

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.090 
to be able to get away and no animals
hopefully<00:04:32.540> can<00:04:32.690> come<00:04:32.870> in<00:04:33.050> because<00:04:33.680> we<00:04:33.980> use

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
hopefully can come in because we use

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.850 
hopefully can come in because we use
math<00:04:34.370> properly<00:04:35.380> I'll<00:04:36.380> see<00:04:36.590> you<00:04:36.680> guys<00:04:36.740> next

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
math properly I'll see you guys next

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.150 
math properly I'll see you guys next
week<00:04:37.340> and<00:04:37.520> have<00:04:37.640> a<00:04:37.670> wonderful<00:04:37.880> day
