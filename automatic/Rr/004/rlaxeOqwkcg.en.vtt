00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.919
 It is everyone Hello, my name is planted water new work this time 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.240
 Continue to talk about the trap of opening called Blackburn aspirations gambit 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:15.030
 I think 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.410
 This trap is the first world champion Wilhelm in 1895 by Nippon Express 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.790
 Discovered 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:25.830
 Was first used in combat is said to be around 1911 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:26.520
 This time is the game so myself there is a bitter experience that had defeated caught in this trap 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.140
 Use 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:34.199
 This along with some that say whether at that time he had not point while thinking what 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.400
 I would like to explain traps 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:39.970
 At that time I was in upper elementary school 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.060
 Chess's ability was about 1200 ratings 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:47.870
 In this game, I pierced the materials and prescribed yes 4 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:53.090
 Beneath it returns black also in other words, the very is I do not orthodox against it 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:58.450
 We hear this your while to expand that there is no fishing that it is not the eyes at myself for 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:01.720
 I observe this phone while Expand black is not if the cc bracts not 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:05.020
 The one I made me use is Bishop 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:08.909
 Developing a day shop and preparing for casting 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:15.170
 You have to aim at the point of s 7 is a mass Shino 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:19.670
 Here struggling On the other hand in the write was stabbed here seemingly strange Tosa beneath black 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.420
 As I said in the opening taboo, in the opening stage, the same piece is moved over and over again 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.479
 there is no 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.920
 In addition d d's form guard shifted 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:32.090
 So you move the note 25 tab so weak players open the brain 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.159
 And take 25 I do not have it would be Hata bird now towards the position 5 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:40.289
 Further light took the tea shop and teachers 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:43.350
 Why myself I have been attacking the registered Masu Shino as such as a light h 6 at the other up 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:49.380
 I thought I was going to protect this fond 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:53.550
 However Queens of black was pointing the gir This also is commit the opening of the tab 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.910
 It is not disgusting to move the queen many times in the early stages 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:00.660
 I think you have to meet Mon nothing further pawn of f 7 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:06.300
 Yu has King, but white attacks with two pieces 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:10.590
 Rouse himself took this pawn with f 7 wrist and f 7 here 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:13.540
 Furthermore, I fork the land special symbol without this 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:19.900
 Black was pointing modus operandi eat here 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:21.909
 I'm attacking this loop right now, I can force the other person out of here and pop out the other party 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.140
 I was able to exchange 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:32.720
 There is no escape in this hallway nars I look this f art 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:37.819
 This airport guard this loop chose a strategy of taking slowly afterward 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:41.510
 Here black strikes the infertility take 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:45.560
 There is no place for my money to escape 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:50.150
 So you go to be prevented opponent of Cecco 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:55.489
 Here I am covered by one positive light so f 5 Miwako 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:57.870
 I will catch the iron pile 2 especially 7 o'clock I pull the bishop 5 and p shop here 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:01.230
 It prevents the check Te beneath 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:06.390
 Black now points very hand 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:10.250
 Well then you have prepared yourself to watch this video stop the video here and what was your hand 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.250
 Please think about it 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:21.310
 It is this Ting Take s 7 that here was black 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:26.050
 If it is not there, it's not just going to live but checking for love and thinness 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.010
 Without this, the castle is moving now, and the shop controls the sb's pool this day 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.180
 But 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.300
 Can not move because they are pinned by the queen 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:38.240
 Furthermore this king is 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:39.650
 Because I can not move because I am surrounded by my piece, I put myself a choking maid here 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.750
 I lost 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:50.370
 I remember why at that time I was checkmates for a little bit and I was quite disappointed 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:57.590
 Let's see why this has happened 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:04:01.430
 It is the time when not it should be noted that d 4 and the other party has been floated auto No. 2 probably here 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:04.849
 If you are playing against a two-story If, for example influential person 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:10.550
 Well the talent knows all of the opening and so on 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:12.200
 So when such people have assigned themselves an opening tab some sort of flower 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:16.579
 It may be said that there is 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:21.349
 And I think it's the same with chess and life 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:27.740
 In order to put the other party in the tank, it is essential to have a good bait 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:28.580
 The other party is not every day is empty to see the sweet bait that tab you confectionery further this e 5 of the opening 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.039
 It came 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:36.480
 If I don't think so deeply and I go to sleep , my body 9 d 5 and the opponent take another opening tab 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:39.600
 Not bear to worry too much also that has been moved 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:44.820
 The group of pawns are likely to be delicious 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:46.770
 In addition, 4 of f 7 is too much baited and hastened like this and checkmate 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.930
 I have been 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:53.520
 So it is necessary to be very careful when the other party has committed the opening taboo 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:05:00.160
 It can be said that there is 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:03.700
 So take the bait graces in this way will defintely think it better not if there is no self-confidence 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:08.890
 In this way the other party commits a busy opening 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:09.700
 It is the way to cope with the problem when it is squeezed, but if this is a very simple thing 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.120
 Just good 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:19.090
 Is that stab in accordance room of opening 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:20.180
 The rules of the opening control the gun, expand the piece, Cass intrigue to secure the safety of the sword dance 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:25.070
 It was said that 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:31.520
 So, for example , if you had white here, for example casting 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:37.970
 While securing the safety of the ring or without expanding c 3 pieces 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:40.370
 Well one would have chosen to feel like a suspension according to the sending rules , but this one 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:45.090
 It will be been Dangle sweet bait 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:51.990
 And without take a 5 and without take s army and eventually 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:58.050
 I have been forced to commit the opening tab myself to move three times light 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:06:04.320
 Since summarized briefly to the other party have threatened Maybe your confectionery further sweet bait the opening 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:05.080
 Sometimes I think of that point in accordance with the opening of the rule was the moral of the game was 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.639
 I will 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:13.919
 So the video about my Blackburn Zhi gambit is over 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:13.919
 Thank you for watching
