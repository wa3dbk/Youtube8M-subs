00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
going and jump backs variance so your

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.540 
going and jump backs variance so your
feet<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.120> jump<00:00:54.510> hands<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.440> get<00:00:55.949> hit<00:00:56.219> so

feet you jump hands in and get hit so

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.700 
feet you jump hands in and get hit so
see<00:00:57.449> if<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.660> do<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.989> when<00:00:58.170> I'm<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:58.440> my<00:00:58.559> back

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
see if I do that when I'm in my back

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.990 
see if I do that when I'm in my back
here<00:01:03.320> you<00:01:04.320> jump<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:05.220> want<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.519> try<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.760> make<00:01:05.970> it

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
here you jump you want to try to make it

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.020 
here you jump you want to try to make it
as<00:01:06.240> far<00:01:06.659> as<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.110> can<00:01:07.229> go<00:01:07.470> cuz<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.369> farther<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
as far as you can go cuz the farther the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.500 
as far as you can go cuz the farther the
better<00:01:10.100> keep<00:01:11.100> your<00:01:11.280> toes<00:01:11.490> pointed<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.360> air

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
so if they aren't it just looks sloppy

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.850 
so if they aren't it just looks sloppy
