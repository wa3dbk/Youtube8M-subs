00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.910
 compared to other circumstances of 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.460
 big deadlines I have the impression 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.869
 that we are no longer in one side 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.310
 professional we are cleaner and 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.960
 less in leisure in pleasure 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.770
 but behind we think of the Greek private 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.390
 because we knew we were going 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.000
 to run maybe once we do not know 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.860
 too much after a career but there good 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.450
 we prepare better I prepare better my 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.450
 professional system what 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.360
 last year we had been working a 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.920
 little hard that is to say that I had been 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.590
 you are too far away 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.880
 autostart I had done a lot of work 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.100
 nose to the wind at home to try to 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.629
 force and no race of 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.700
 preparation is actually this year I 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.949
 preferred to prepare for the races and then 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.960
 to do jobs at home 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.960
 different a little more to the moral what 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.950
 before last price of america I had 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.110
 really a race of criterium 2 months 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.060
 before it was very little she was still 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.500
 baby a little in a pole we can 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.220
 not say it was perfect but hey you 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.360
 this year is different and better 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.580
 in what and in what areas she 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.280
 has improved 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.380
 behavior in a race start 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.840
 the behavior in a back she is 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.150
 much more dynamic and responsive what 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.710
 after that it's the same pure class as in 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.570
 three years we say we must not evolve 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.460
 it is true that there is his 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.190
 starting class now it's just 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.270
 behavior the maneuverability what and 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.729
 you since last year 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.560
 not me I've seen already so I know what 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.350
 to wait for me even if a scenario does not 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.729
 the other one but the stress will be like 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.670
 usually I think high level of a 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.020
 great price like that we will not evolve 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.410
 to the bar will even go up in pressure 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.729
 and it's true that we have the entire team 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.739
 after such a price of america a 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.560
 other way we now expect to 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.700
 who will we fall by the others all 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.110
 fell by a fallen journalist over 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.530
 and on the back when we know how 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.630
 react 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.700
 price of belgium yes I was expecting 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.800
 a race with a lot of trains and in 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.660
 in the end we had a two wagon that 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.100
 were slowed down and I decided to 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.769
 do the last mile to prepare 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.480
 the mare we know that with her pace 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.739
 come up by mounting his pros so his 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.780
 cup of tea by cons she was 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.310
 up to a straight line and then the 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.150
 weakened her but she did a very good 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.290
 taste to 700 m to me I would have preferred 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.610
 that it is a race that rolls for 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.390
 to be able to follow others and not have 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.950
 need to do the work 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.930
 yes but well I continued my 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.010
 yves childhood for the price of a ticket 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.230
 that is, when she gets ready 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.840
 at least she in a way so I 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.850
 activated things at 1000 m visually 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.650
 it's not very good when we see the end 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.360
 race against me for the 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.700
 let's read the mare's tempo for her 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.689
 preparation is what you have to do 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.980
 what will change for the mare 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:04.959
 compared to the race is what she 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.459
 will be put differently or is that 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.319
 you will leave things as they are 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.840
 compared to the price of america it is 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.040
 can settle it like the year 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.569
 last it's going to be just the blinders 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.560
 we will say that they will differentiate 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.950
 then to a pair of blinders from the 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.769
 starting to be well in the tempo but 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.330
 without making him see others and 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.820
 then at the level 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.800
 she will be ironed in front with everything 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.390
 little facts in rubber is really 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.580
 it's not even steel 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.340
 the plastic then deferred 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.500
 posts you said it stronger than the year 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.140
 last the performances does not show it 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.970
 you rely on what to think it ben 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.950
 precisely that and finally it was the effect 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.080
 to prepare her for the race and see all 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.240
 the flaws that stand out this mare 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.350
 the now in the in a race of 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.880
 old oven because it's the races 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.500
 of old c then the same as at the time 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.810
 where I took the lead and I went away 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.780
 with 20 or 30 meters in this lab I the 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.850
 prepare in the race that I see all these 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.400
 bad default and all these benefits 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.200
 for the price of america 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.730
 the entourage of victory did not wish 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.590
 take part in the america price then 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.910
 than their twins and were qualified 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.530
 ex officio with the victory in the 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.360
 continental 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.850
 it inspires you what the victory she has 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.130
 makes a superb start to the meeting 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.870
 she still won the continental 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.640
 and even before marcel laurent I 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.890
 think so the mare was perfect and 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.050
 maybe mathieu mottier the tree 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.300
 meaning 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.680
 negative throughout its form so 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.200
 it is and reason not to run if he 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.320
 does not have the mare at the top month in the 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.600
 system on 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.040
 we start the meeting with an idea of 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.530
 prepare the mare for the price 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.190
 from america so i have not run at all to 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.510
 every time 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.710
 in the sense of the mare for the 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.050
 races that my body was running I 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.730
 ran for the price of america 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.590
 ideal scenario is already taking a 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.060
 just ok start not to leave 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.980
 too fast in my opinion for her and then 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.590
 have a good a good back that brings me 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.850
 to the entrance of the straight line 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.210
 the first three places and necessarily 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.930
 pretentious but after we never know 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.270
 the opposition this year you judge her 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.100
 how to spend more open since 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.180
 you are that that charm 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.210
 unfortunately for Julian is no 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.220
 so it's really a race 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.840
 normally for ready cash or up in 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.070
 quick 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.090
 there are other horses that go that go 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.410
 put the sticks in the wheels but 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.860
 it's the two horses I think the 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.930
 race 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.350
 those of the pond tiego harrier and 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.940
 roxane griff are real fighters 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.110
 lack of freshness we'll see it's the 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.610
 coaches know better than us but 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.260
 I think it may be playing at 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.670
 eight days is not obvious before the 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.440
 what place mantua would satisfy 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.460
 not for me 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.510
 I would be really happy to be 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.390
 fifth I think it would be a 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.580
 theoretically possible place if I see 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.690
 what I think of the mare through 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.610
 training and according to the course 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.520
 of the race now at the top and 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.810
 it's great below according 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.420
 fixed course the same day it's not 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.910
 obvious to be disappointed but I think 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:52.200
 5th it would be the best of what we can 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.200
 have everything for the mare
