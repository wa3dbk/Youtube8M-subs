00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.240
 I'm going to show you how they can 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.610
 perform what is a tire here in what 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.930
 what is rhinoceros there are more than one way 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.720
 but I'm going to show you 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.820
 nothing more one and that is what we have to 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.200
 do first we must take our 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.710
 curve tool 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.730
 and in the part of the front view we are going 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.890
 to do more or less the next back 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.280
 let's draw what is the basis of the 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.280
 tire 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.350
 Now let's select and write the 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.350
 command to move 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:55.690
 let's go through a point 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.719
 I do not copy anymore here 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.700
 then let's say we close what 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:05.280
 which is the stroke of this side 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:10.070
 and from this other side we select everything and 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.070
 let's solder since we have soldier 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.990
 let's take what is this tool 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:21.310
 of poly line and let's make a line 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.850
 more or less up here and that way 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.740
 now we go 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.350
 We go to this tool here that 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.659
 called revolution and selection of 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.240
 curves to revolutionize let's choose 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.700
 this we are going to give a enter the posts 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.700
 we take here this beginning an end 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.080
 let's give here in 360 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.470
 let's give an enter let's see here in 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.350
 our view of the render and here we have 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.180
 already what is the base of the tire there is 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.409
 Some people with some points in 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.810
 where I see that he makes some tires with 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.729
 Pure extrusion is with this tool 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.729
 and we will see that they are much better 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.110
 so we would be what this tire is 

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:14.350
 we see that the tires are not all 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.350
 straight lines are being with some with 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.390
 some curvatures 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.700
 for this we go to that procedure that 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.050
 I just showed you that 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.260
 now we are creating what is a 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.320
 solid and now we need to add 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.160
 what is a texture and right now I'm going to 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.920
 add a texture that is yours 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.420
 you can add it is the one you want 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.420
 what you design 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.490
 these 2 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.870
 figures 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.870
 I'm going to create a mesh 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.390
 after creating the mesh I will exclude 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.610
 a little bit more so I created a 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.680
 drilling in what are the tires and 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.680
 I'm going to put them in the beginning 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.360
 I'm going to put here from the center 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.520
 Now what I'm going to do is the following 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.100
 I will go to this side 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.920
 in this command on this icon that is 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.240
 called polar matrix asks us 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.070
 selection of the objects to create the 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.950
 matrix we select these two we give a 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.990
 whole and now he asks us a center of 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.960
 the polar matrix we are going to activate for 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:36.319
 what is this here this option 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.989
 of this reference that is center 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.730
 and we already gave him that we want that center 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.620
 now he asks us how many numbers and 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.709
 right now I'm going to put it about 30 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.709
 elements 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.630
 we give what is an enter and we will 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:54.090
 copy what is that texture 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.910
 good these elements through what 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.800
 It's the flame 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.550
 I will copy the list what are these 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.140
 in these elements so they did 33 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.190
 textures series and let's do what 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.440
 following 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.350
 right now if you want it to be with 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.710
 High relief texture you only go to 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:15.200
 make a volea union na and you're going to 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.299
 get the rim like this and if what you 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.940
 you want is to create what is a 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.980
 bas-relief you're going to do the following 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.430
 to be this tool difference 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.770
 guadiana you choose this and then you choose 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.780
 the 3 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.710
 the three blocks of elements or all 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.520
 the elements that you want to subtract and 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.030
 automatically what you are going to do is 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.840
 remove where it is drilling and give 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.780
 count here 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.930
 this 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.430
 all the elements that we copy the 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.650
 we put a little bit towards what was the 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.110
 solid 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.259
 that when making this difference 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.660
 I will remove material and see that 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:57.789
 now we have these elements of 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.740
 this form already have what is a 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:02.480
 difference and a texture this texture on 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.660
 I just did pretty fast 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.270
 I remind you that you can put the 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.750
 that you like you can put some 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.750
 letters 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.479
 let's write again 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.770
 we place them where one likes the 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:37.379
 we also guide 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.379
 and we put them the size you want 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:50.220
 now we are going to this tool to split 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:53.870
 we select select objects 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.870
 all cutting lines 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.810
 and you're working right now what's going to 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:05.260
 to do is just select that 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:08.500
 part and when you do what he is 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:10.510
 the rendering this part that is 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.370
 removing from the letters then the only thing 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.520
 you're going to do is put another material 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.229
 blank material 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.009
 and now I'm going to show you an example 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:22.229
 of how the rendering will look like 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:24.599
 who just did what is this 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:27.479
 section or this cut will keep us in 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:29.370
 the wire view in this way and it's 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:30.720
 just what I was telling you that 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.909
 when you do the rendering you're going to 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.879
 put another color and more or less 

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:38.190
 worked in this way here already 

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:40.260
 had drawn what is the river 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.060
 well here he put a little bit bright 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.130
 missing a bit of brightness what is 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:47.550
 the tire but here you see the 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:50.700
 letters if you put them in another color will 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:54.080
 it seems that it brings them and the rim 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:56.360
 how are the new tires 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.650
 then more or less oil that 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.909
 it must already be rendered obviously 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.569
 and well, I hope you have them 

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:06.419
 it is understood 

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:07.770
 here you see that you have what is a 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:10.619
 texture this is another one that had already 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:13.249
 any doubt worked 

00:07:10.619 --> 00:07:15.679
 Comment below 

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:19.039
 and then if you like this kind of videos 

00:07:15.679 --> 00:07:20.569
 comment below also ask for others and 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:21.679
 well so I help you with this video 

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:23.299
 click on the ads that are going to 

00:07:21.679 --> 00:07:25.309
 be appearing on the right below 

00:07:23.299 --> 00:07:27.019
 before each video that if they are going to be 

00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:28.699
 supporting to say by computer here in 

00:07:27.019 --> 00:07:30.430
 youtube subscribe I also leave you what 

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:32.800
 What are they 

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:35.200

 here today's video my name is 

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.780
 william urbina the industrial designer 

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.800
 and graph and see you in the next 

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.800
 see you later
