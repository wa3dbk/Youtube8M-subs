00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
i'm on 87 here 187 here and then I don't

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.680 
i'm on 87 here 187 here and then I don't
think<00:02:20.620> this<00:02:20.709> worked<00:02:21.040> because<00:02:23.760> I'm<00:02:24.760> on<00:02:24.880> 87<00:02:25.390> I

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
think this worked because I'm on 87 I

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.470 
think this worked because I'm on 87 I
think<00:02:25.900> that's<00:02:26.080> that's<00:02:26.440> not<00:02:26.709> good<00:02:26.890> move<00:02:27.099> here

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
think that's that's not good move here

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:37.620 
think that's that's not good move here
surely<00:02:31.769> hmm<00:02:35.610> it's<00:02:36.610> all<00:02:36.819> actually<00:02:37.090> first<00:02:37.420> thing

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
surely hmm it's all actually first thing

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.620 
surely hmm it's all actually first thing
I<00:02:37.870> this<00:02:38.410> is<00:02:38.620> about<00:02:38.769> move<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:40.030> rook<00:02:40.209> tanks

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
I this is about move the rook tanks

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.140 
I this is about move the rook tanks
first<00:02:41.410> I<00:02:43.530> play<00:02:44.530> rook<00:02:44.739> takes<00:02:44.980> first<00:02:45.370> then<00:02:45.880> light

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
first I play rook takes first then light

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:56.870 
first I play rook takes first then light
tanks<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:52.860> that<00:02:53.860> could<00:02:54.040> be<00:02:54.069> an<00:02:54.190> improvement<00:02:54.580> I

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
tanks and that could be an improvement I

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.370 
tanks and that could be an improvement I
think<00:02:57.880> why<00:02:58.090> is<00:02:58.150> that<00:02:58.239> improvement<00:02:58.840> maybe<00:02:59.140> not

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
think why is that improvement maybe not

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:06.630 
think why is that improvement maybe not
