00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
good laptops to compare we've got the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.320 
good laptops to compare we've got the
Sony<00:00:28.590> Vaio<00:00:28.680> S<00:00:29.099> series<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.060> latest

Sony Vaio S series and the latest

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.720 
Sony Vaio S series and the latest
MacBook<00:00:30.539> Pro<00:00:30.960> these<00:00:31.470> are<00:00:31.710> both<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.340> baseline

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
MacBook Pro these are both the baseline

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.700 
MacBook Pro these are both the baseline
models<00:00:33.120> now<00:00:33.420> both<00:00:33.719> are<00:00:33.899> great<00:00:34.170> brands<00:00:34.469> but

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
models now both are great brands but

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
models now both are great brands but
we're<00:00:34.829> going<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:34.980> get<00:00:35.100> into<00:00:35.340> some<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.579> the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
we're going to get into some of the

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.970 
we're going to get into some of the
differences<00:00:36.149> first<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:37.110> couple<00:00:37.290> similarities

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
differences first a couple similarities

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.410 
differences first a couple similarities
actually<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.610> both<00:00:38.760> computers<00:00:39.239> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
actually in both computers the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.450 
actually in both computers the
processing<00:00:40.050> power<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.620> same<00:00:40.800> okay<00:00:41.399> so

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
processing power is the same okay so

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.970 
processing power is the same okay so
both<00:00:41.700> have<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> 2.3<00:00:42.570> gigahertz<00:00:42.600> Intel<00:00:43.469> Core<00:00:43.800> i5

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
both have a 2.3 gigahertz Intel Core i5

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.700 
both have a 2.3 gigahertz Intel Core i5
processor<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:45.120> four<00:00:45.539> gigs<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.899> RAM<00:00:46.050> they're

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
processor and four gigs of RAM they're

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.020 
processor and four gigs of RAM they're
both<00:00:46.860> about<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.129> same<00:00:47.340> thickness<00:00:47.610> at<00:00:48.000> a

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
both about the same thickness at a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.850 
both about the same thickness at a
little<00:00:48.270> under<00:00:48.480> an<00:00:48.539> inch<00:00:48.690> thick<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.530> how<00:00:49.800> does

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
little under an inch thick so how does

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.490 
little under an inch thick so how does
the<00:00:50.160> BI<00:00:50.340> OS<00:00:50.700> differ<00:00:51.480> from<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.899> MacBook<00:00:52.289> Pro

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
the BI OS differ from the MacBook Pro

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.470 
the BI OS differ from the MacBook Pro
well<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.980> VAIO<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.610> over<00:00:53.879> half<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.300> pound

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
well the VAIO is over half a pound

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.029 
well the VAIO is over half a pound
lighter<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.410> three<00:00:55.710> point<00:00:55.920> eight

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
lighter so this is three point eight

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.580 
lighter so this is three point eight
pounds<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:57.000> macbook<00:00:57.329> pro<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.899> four<00:00:58.320> point

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
pounds and the macbook pro is four point

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.349 
pounds and the macbook pro is four point
four<00:00:58.859> pounds<00:00:59.039> which<00:00:59.520> doesn't<00:00:59.850> sound<00:01:00.059> like<00:01:00.239> a

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
four pounds which doesn't sound like a

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.209 
four pounds which doesn't sound like a
huge<00:01:00.629> difference<00:01:01.050> until<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.710> are<00:01:01.859> carrying

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
huge difference until you are carrying

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.359 
huge difference until you are carrying
it<00:01:02.370> around<00:01:02.460> all<00:01:02.789> day<00:01:03.110> not<00:01:04.110> as<00:01:04.320> fun<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:05.070> get

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
it around all day not as fun you get

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.920 
it around all day not as fun you get
more<00:01:05.549> storage<00:01:05.909> with<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.270> standard<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.630> iOS

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.929 
thing neither computer actually gets
kudos<00:01:25.710> for<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> high<00:01:26.070> resolution<00:01:26.640> screen

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
kudos for a high resolution screen

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.240 
kudos for a high resolution screen
however<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.840> file<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.320> slightly<00:01:28.650> higher<00:01:29.009> at

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
however the file is slightly higher at

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.870 
however the file is slightly higher at
1366<00:01:30.240> by<00:01:30.299> 768<00:01:30.920> versus<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.100> MacBook<00:01:32.430> Pro<00:01:32.640> at

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
1366 by 768 versus the MacBook Pro at

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.350 
1366 by 768 versus the MacBook Pro at
1280<00:01:33.689> by<00:01:33.960> 800<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.950> it's<00:01:35.189> slightly<00:01:35.549> better<00:01:35.909> when

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
1280 by 800 so it's slightly better when

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.990 
1280 by 800 so it's slightly better when

my<00:04:14.660> macbook<00:04:14.870> I<00:04:15.290> get<00:04:15.470> a<00:04:15.500> little<00:04:15.800> lag<00:04:15.980> especially

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
my macbook I get a little lag especially

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.069

one time

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.949 
one time
and<00:04:19.040> I<00:04:19.459> found<00:04:19.579> that<00:04:19.760> the<00:04:19.880> VAIO<00:04:20.060> was<00:04:20.389> actually

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
and I found that the VAIO was actually

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.500 
and I found that the VAIO was actually
pretty<00:04:21.079> snappy<00:04:21.410> and<00:04:22.010> there<00:04:22.520> wasn't<00:04:22.940> too<00:04:23.360> much

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
pretty snappy and there wasn't too much

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.810 
pretty snappy and there wasn't too much
lag<00:04:24.020> in<00:04:24.410> scaling<00:04:25.010> graphics<00:04:25.460> or<00:04:25.550> rendering

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
lag in scaling graphics or rendering

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.270 
lag in scaling graphics or rendering
graphics<00:04:26.150> so<00:04:26.389> that's<00:04:27.080> pretty<00:04:27.229> good<00:04:27.410> being<00:04:28.160> a

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
graphics so that's pretty good being a

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.800 
graphics so that's pretty good being a
