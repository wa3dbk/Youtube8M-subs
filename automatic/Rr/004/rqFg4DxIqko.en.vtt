00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
about the blue dart here that we have

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.030 
about the blue dart here that we have
made<00:00:11.540> we<00:00:12.540> made<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.870> blue<00:00:13.049> dark<00:00:13.349> from<00:00:13.650> plans

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
made we made the blue dark from plans

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.900 
made we made the blue dark from plans
that<00:00:14.400> we<00:00:14.519> got<00:00:14.730> off<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.599> internet

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
that we got off the internet

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.359 
that we got off the internet
this<00:00:17.910> designs<00:00:18.770> was<00:00:19.770> made<00:00:20.070> by<00:00:20.340> Jean<00:00:21.210> Vaughn<00:00:22.369> not

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
this designs was made by Jean Vaughn not

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.689 
this designs was made by Jean Vaughn not
James<00:00:23.699> Bond<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.240> Jean<00:00:24.510> bomb<00:00:25.010> and<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.580> the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
James Bond the Jean bomb and this is the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.840 
James Bond the Jean bomb and this is the
23<00:00:27.269> inch<00:00:27.769> blue<00:00:28.769> dart<00:00:29.570> version<00:00:30.570> -<00:00:31.640> well<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.700> guess

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
23 inch blue dart version - well I guess

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.380 
23 inch blue dart version - well I guess
mine<00:00:33.120> might<00:00:33.420> be<00:00:33.450> version<00:00:34.079> 3d<00:00:34.530> or<00:00:34.910> virgin<00:00:35.910> ad

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
mine might be version 3d or virgin ad

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.229 
mine might be version 3d or virgin ad
infinitum<00:00:37.399> because<00:00:38.399> we<00:00:38.640> made<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:39.000> few<00:00:39.180> changes

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
infinitum because we made a few changes

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.260 
infinitum because we made a few changes
to<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:41.030> so<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.600> wing<00:00:44.059> half<00:00:45.059> of

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
to it and so this is the wing half of

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.920 
to it and so this is the wing half of
the<00:00:45.360> main<00:00:45.539> wing<00:00:45.870> here<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:47.329> then<00:00:48.329> inside<00:00:48.870> that

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
the main wing here and then inside that

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.700 
the main wing here and then inside that
is<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:50.010> tail<00:00:50.579> section<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:53.059> then<00:00:54.469> on<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
is the tail section and then on the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.240 
is the tail section and then on the
table<00:00:56.039> section<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.670> can<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:57.680> the<00:00:58.680> vertical

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
table section you can have the vertical

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.070 
table section you can have the vertical
stabilizer<00:01:01.489> and<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.449> overall<00:01:03.719> plan

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
stabilizer and this is the overall plan

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.280 
stabilizer and this is the overall plan
can<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.559> get<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:08.030> it<00:01:09.030> has<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> little<00:01:09.659> done

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
can you get that it has a little done

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.249 
can you get that it has a little done
ebrill<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.189> wing<00:01:11.369> right<00:01:11.640> here<00:01:14.750> so<00:01:15.750> after

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
ebrill in the wing right here so after

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.390 
ebrill in the wing right here so after
we<00:01:16.380> got<00:01:16.530> done<00:01:18.170> it<00:01:19.170> looked<00:01:19.470> like<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:20.009> oh<00:01:20.280> this

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
we got done it looked like this oh this

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.030 
we got done it looked like this oh this
is<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.970> body<00:01:23.150> anyway<00:01:24.409> and<00:01:25.409> look<00:01:25.619> like<00:01:25.830> this

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
is the body anyway and look like this

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.010 
is the body anyway and look like this
when<00:01:26.280> we<00:01:26.400> got<00:01:26.430> done<00:01:29.180> and<00:01:30.180> it's<00:01:30.360> all<00:01:30.570> made<00:01:30.780> out

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
when we got done and it's all made out

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.399 
when we got done and it's all made out
of<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:32.840> battle<00:01:35.060> protection<00:01:36.060> board<00:01:36.329> we<00:01:37.229> just

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
of this battle protection board we just

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.020 
of this battle protection board we just
call<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.829> fan<00:01:38.189> old<00:01:38.610> foam<00:01:39.060> board<00:01:40.040> and<00:01:41.040> what

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
call it the fan old foam board and what

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.319 
call it the fan old foam board and what
we<00:01:42.180> did<00:01:42.360> was<00:01:42.740> we<00:01:43.740> added<00:01:43.920> an<00:01:44.250> extra<00:01:44.460> element<00:01:44.820> to

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
we did was we added an extra element to

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.539 
we did was we added an extra element to
it<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:45.689> maybe<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.320> version<00:01:46.860> 3<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.159> don't

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
it so maybe this is version 3 I don't

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.609 
it so maybe this is version 3 I don't
know<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.479> we<00:01:48.600> have<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:48.990> thing<00:01:49.320> down<00:01:49.560> the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
know so we have this thing down the

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.510 
know so we have this thing down the
bottom<00:01:50.159> here<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.490> hold<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.790> battery<00:01:52.520> looks

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
bottom here to hold the battery looks

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.350 
bottom here to hold the battery looks
like<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.909> from<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.240> front<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:55.850> think<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.090> kind

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
like that from the front I think it kind

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.319 
like that from the front I think it kind
of<00:01:57.420> looks<00:01:57.479> like<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.869> hatchet<00:01:58.259> fish<00:01:59.329> or

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
of looks like a hatchet fish or

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.670 
of looks like a hatchet fish or
something<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.840> swims<00:02:01.110> around<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
something that swims around in the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.630 
something that swims around in the
accordion<00:02:02.219> from<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.790> side<00:02:04.100> and<00:02:05.100> then

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
accordion from the side and then

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.940 
accordion from the side and then
the<00:02:07.450> directions<00:02:07.960> didn't<00:02:08.259> say<00:02:08.410> what<00:02:08.680> kind<00:02:08.710> of

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
the directions didn't say what kind of

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.390 
the directions didn't say what kind of
power<00:02:09.220> system<00:02:09.759> to<00:02:09.789> use<00:02:10.090> so<00:02:10.710> we<00:02:11.710> just<00:02:11.920> use<00:02:12.160> to

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
power system to use so we just use to

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.270 
power system to use so we just use to
say<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:13.060> brushless<00:02:13.480> outrunner<00:02:13.900> motor<00:02:14.350> here<00:02:15.040> I

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
say a brushless outrunner motor here I

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.710 
say a brushless outrunner motor here I
think<00:02:15.550> it's<00:02:15.700> what<00:02:15.940> 1,100<00:02:16.840> kV<00:02:17.710> and<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:19.300> battery

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
think it's what 1,100 kV and the battery

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.520 
think it's what 1,100 kV and the battery
can<00:02:19.900> either<00:02:20.050> be<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.290> two<00:02:20.560> cell<00:02:20.860> or<00:02:21.130> three<00:02:21.460> cell

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
can either be a two cell or three cell

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.230 
can either be a two cell or three cell
seven<00:02:23.530> fifty<00:02:23.890> or<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.040> hundred<00:02:25.650> milliamp<00:02:26.650> hours

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
seven fifty or a hundred milliamp hours

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.930 
seven fifty or a hundred milliamp hours
and<00:02:28.240> then<00:02:28.510> inside<00:02:30.000> we<00:02:31.000> got<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:32.580> ESC<00:02:33.580> for<00:02:33.850> the

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
and then inside we got the ESC for the

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.240 
and then inside we got the ESC for the
motor<00:02:34.300> right<00:02:34.510> here<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:35.350> there's<00:02:35.709> a<00:02:35.800> receiver

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
motor right here and there's a receiver

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.110 
motor right here and there's a receiver
here<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:37.060> two<00:02:37.750> servos<00:02:38.350> because<00:02:38.740> all<00:02:39.670> it<00:02:39.940> has

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
here and two servos because all it has

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.199 
here and two servos because all it has
is<00:02:40.150> elevator<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:41.290> rudder<00:02:41.820> doesn't<00:02:42.820> have<00:02:42.970> any

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
is elevator and rudder doesn't have any

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.840 
is elevator and rudder doesn't have any
able<00:02:43.540> ROM<00:02:43.720> so<00:02:44.110> that's<00:02:44.920> all<00:02:45.100> he<00:02:45.220> needs<00:02:45.459> this<00:02:45.610> two

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
able ROM so that's all he needs this two

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.600 
able ROM so that's all he needs this two
servos<00:02:49.709> anything<00:02:50.709> else<00:02:50.950> you<00:02:51.070> want<00:02:51.220> to<00:02:51.310> add<00:02:51.400> to

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
servos anything else you want to add to

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.320 
servos anything else you want to add to
it<00:02:51.640> John

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
it John

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.540

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
well not hundred millibars 800 800 800

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.650 
well not hundred millibars 800 800 800
are<00:02:58.090> up<00:02:58.390> face<00:02:58.900> in<00:02:59.670> let<00:03:00.670> me<00:03:00.730> go<00:03:00.850> too<00:03:00.910> far<00:03:01.239> off<00:03:01.450> of

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
are up face in let me go too far off of

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.300 
are up face in let me go too far off of
be<00:03:01.780> too<00:03:01.930> heavy<00:03:02.170> right

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
be too heavy right

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
I think it's got a 3-cell 750 in there

I'll Bobby okay the body plan on this

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.850 
I'll Bobby okay the body plan on this
yeah<00:03:20.320> oh<00:03:20.650> yeah<00:03:21.810> that's<00:03:22.810> given<00:03:23.410> that<00:03:23.590> that's

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
what's making that taper was obvious

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.660 
what's making that taper was obvious
yeah<00:03:31.120> inside<00:03:31.570> the<00:03:32.459> rectangular<00:03:33.459> piece

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
yeah inside the rectangular piece

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.490 
yeah inside the rectangular piece
there's<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.150> tapered<00:03:34.630> piece<00:03:34.870> that<00:03:35.140> you<00:03:35.230> got<00:03:35.380> to

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
there's a tapered piece that you got to

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.610 
there's a tapered piece that you got to
cut<00:03:35.680> out<00:03:37.350> so<00:03:38.350> that's<00:03:38.560> it's<00:03:38.830> not<00:03:39.130> here<00:03:40.620> right

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
what it does I had to pull it out so

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.680 
what it does I had to pull it out so
it's<00:04:55.699> nil<00:04:55.910> nose-heavy

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
it's nil nose-heavy

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:04.589 
it's nil nose-heavy
you<00:04:57.590> had<00:04:57.740> to<00:04:57.860> be<00:04:57.979> that's<00:04:58.460> a<00:04:58.610> good<00:04:58.820> thing<00:04:59.030> yes<00:04:59.360> we

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:08.409 

maybe<00:05:05.599> could<00:05:05.870> use<00:05:06.080> a<00:05:06.110> little<00:05:06.470> more<00:05:07.389> you<00:05:08.389> know

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
maybe could use a little more you know

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.370 
maybe could use a little more you know
down<00:05:08.990> held<00:05:09.380> it<00:05:10.180> which<00:05:11.180> I<00:05:11.360> can't<00:05:11.720> give<00:05:12.020> it<00:05:12.169> some

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
down held it which I can't give it some

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.890 
down held it which I can't give it some
got<00:05:12.590> it<00:05:12.740> all<00:05:12.889> the<00:05:12.979> way<00:05:13.070> down<00:05:13.419> we<00:05:14.419> don't<00:05:14.599> need<00:05:14.840> it

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
got it all the way down we don't need it

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.240 
got it all the way down we don't need it
probably<00:05:17.900> it's<00:05:18.020> better<00:05:18.199> this<00:05:18.409> way<00:05:18.470> because<00:05:18.740> it

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
probably it's better this way because it

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:27.070 
probably it's better this way because it
it's<00:05:19.849> less<00:05:20.060> likely<00:05:20.330> to<00:05:20.509> crack<00:05:20.810> uh<00:05:25.870> take<00:05:26.870> off

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
it's less likely to crack uh take off

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.850 
it's less likely to crack uh take off
some<00:05:27.440> down<00:05:27.740> elevator<00:05:28.340> you<00:05:29.120> see<00:05:29.360> how
