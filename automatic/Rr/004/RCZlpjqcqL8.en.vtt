00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
because although royalty weapons have

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.880 
because although royalty weapons have
different<00:00:48.400> bonuses<00:00:48.940> some<00:00:49.150> of<00:00:49.240> them<00:00:49.360> have

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.240 
extra ammo some of them have faster

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.180

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
different things so it really took me a

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.930 
different things so it really took me a

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
reloaded you can like you know punch to

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.870 
reloaded you can like you know punch to
cancel<00:03:31.410> you<00:03:31.470> can<00:03:31.620> sprint<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:32.010> cancel<00:03:32.370> or<00:03:32.790> you

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.270 
cancel you can sprint to cancel or you
can<00:03:33.000> dash<00:03:33.239> to<00:03:33.480> cancel<00:03:33.870> you<00:03:34.530> know<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.829> reload

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
can dash to cancel you know that reload

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.410 
can dash to cancel you know that reload
and<00:03:35.459> then<00:03:35.519> that<00:03:35.760> you're<00:03:35.880> gonna<00:03:36.000> will<00:03:36.180> already

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
and then that you're gonna will already

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.120 
and then that you're gonna will already
be<00:03:36.510> reloaded<00:03:37.440> even<00:03:37.739> though<00:03:37.859> it<00:03:37.920> was<00:03:38.010> only

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
be reloaded even though it was only

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.250 
be reloaded even though it was only
halfway<00:03:38.459> through<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.940> animation<00:03:39.510> so<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:40.079> ROI

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
halfway through the animation so the ROI

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.710 
halfway through the animation so the ROI
at<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.470> IMR<00:03:40.859> is<00:03:40.980> a<00:03:41.010> tons<00:03:41.400> of<00:03:41.549> plus<00:03:41.730> to<00:03:41.910> it<00:03:42.030> that

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
at the IMR is a tons of plus to it that

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.170 
at the IMR is a tons of plus to it that
additional<00:03:43.170> reload<00:03:44.069> time<00:03:44.370> is<00:03:44.400> just<00:03:44.819> it's

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
additional reload time is just it's

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.629 
additional reload time is just it's
ridiculous<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:46.650> like<00:03:46.799> I<00:03:46.950> said<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.190> IMR<00:03:47.489> is

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
ridiculous and like I said the IMR is

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.190 
ridiculous and like I said the IMR is
one<00:03:47.790> of<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:47.940> highest<00:03:48.269> damage<00:03:48.480> assault<00:03:48.930> rifles

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.059 
the inferno it's all my favorite guns in
the<00:04:43.990> game<00:04:44.110> it's<00:04:44.289> probably<00:04:44.650> my<00:04:44.770> favorite

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:45.069 
the game it's probably my favorite

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:47.999 
the game it's probably my favorite
bal-27<00:04:45.460> I<00:04:46.259> preferred<00:04:47.259> over<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:47.530> obsidian

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
bal-27 I preferred over the obsidian

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:49.499 
bal-27 I preferred over the obsidian
steed<00:04:48.130> just<00:04:48.460> because<00:04:48.639> I<00:04:48.699> like<00:04:48.880> the<00:04:48.910> fast<00:04:49.240> fire

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:49.509 
steed just because I like the fast fire

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:51.450 
steed just because I like the fast fire
rate<00:04:49.539> and<00:04:49.870> how<00:04:50.289> it<00:04:50.410> allows<00:04:50.470> me<00:04:50.830> to<00:04:50.860> rush<00:04:51.250> and

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
rate and how it allows me to rush and

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.279 
rate and how it allows me to rush and
everything<00:04:51.699> like<00:04:51.789> that<00:04:51.849> so<00:04:52.060> the<00:04:52.900> infernal

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
everything like that so the infernal

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.350 
everything like that so the infernal
melts<00:04:53.650> through<00:04:53.860> ammo<00:04:54.280> especially<00:04:55.150> if<00:04:55.270> you

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
melts through ammo especially if you

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.550 
melts through ammo especially if you
don't<00:04:55.479> have<00:04:55.599> extended<00:04:55.930> mags<00:04:56.139> on<00:04:56.319> it<00:04:56.410> if<00:04:56.470> you

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
don't have extended mags on it if you

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.279 
don't have extended mags on it if you
just<00:04:56.710> have<00:04:56.860> the<00:04:56.889> normal<00:04:57.509> the<00:04:58.509> normal<00:04:58.720> clip<00:04:59.139> on

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
just have the normal the normal clip on

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:00.930 
just have the normal the normal clip on

completely melt through it and then

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:04.140 
completely melt through it and then
before<00:05:03.160> you<00:05:03.460> know<00:05:03.580> it<00:05:03.639> you're<00:05:03.729> gonna<00:05:03.789> be<00:05:04.000> out

in<00:05:16.180> the<00:05:16.270> game<00:05:16.419> I<00:05:16.449> love<00:05:16.780> how<00:05:16.960> it<00:05:17.080> just<00:05:17.229> looks

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
in the game I love how it just looks

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.469 
in the game I love how it just looks
like<00:05:17.590> the<00:05:17.800> normal<00:05:18.009> about<00:05:18.159> 27<00:05:18.759> but<00:05:19.180> with<00:05:19.300> that

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
like the normal about 27 but with that

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.240 
like the normal about 27 but with that
purple<00:05:19.840> royalty<00:05:20.139> camo<00:05:20.440> on<00:05:20.650> it<00:05:20.800> doesn't<00:05:20.979> feel

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
purple royalty camo on it doesn't feel

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.379 
purple royalty camo on it doesn't feel
like<00:05:21.310> an<00:05:21.550> inferno<00:05:21.909> or<00:05:22.030> anything<00:05:22.180> like<00:05:22.330> that

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
like an inferno or anything like that

but<00:05:23.080> it<00:05:23.289> does<00:05:23.500> just<00:05:23.770> as<00:05:23.860> much<00:05:24.039> damage<00:05:24.340> and<00:05:24.699> just

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
but it does just as much damage and just

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:26.969 
but it does just as much damage and just
there's<00:05:25.120> a<00:05:25.180> high<00:05:25.360> of<00:05:25.479> a<00:05:25.569> fire<00:05:25.810> rate<00:05:26.020> as<00:05:26.680> the

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
there's a high of a fire rate as the
