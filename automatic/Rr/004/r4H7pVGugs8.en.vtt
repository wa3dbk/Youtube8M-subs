00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.440
 telli then I hope you're fine 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.029
 today we talk about momo cereals 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.020
 that I tried recently is the good 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.030
 that of chicago so the huge pink tube 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:14.280
 which looks like this system to ceyrat 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.830
 double end so their end pattern 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.199
 it's a brush that in turn asks 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:27.150
 is the tenth in the end it's a brush 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:29.880
 and in fiber they create and I listened to it 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.910
 a month I would like and I do not like it 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.010
 not because firstly I find that 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.280
 it's a tube that y standard is really 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.750
 very very big is that life 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.880
 unpleasant because when we want 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.360
 apply it near the sites whose hand 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.250
 left 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.630
 it's very difficult just the corner 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.610
 internally because I'm asking this is a 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.180
 Pénénois' impetus to practices 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.740
 secondly I find that everyone and 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.230
 we purse separately make a 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.470
 work that would have not masked but 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.990
 for me it's the final messi hockey 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.240
 together I find that it weighs down here 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.329
 I find that when they have superimposed 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.159
 gentlemen are not very beautiful they did not 

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:10.350
 not a good price effect it's not like 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.460
 so freddy fossils are rather to one 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.499
 said is wrong 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.350
 a little hard soft what I do not like 

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:18.780
 really and the third negative point 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.549
 mascara I find that it is removed very 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.770
 very very hard the back time 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.189
 that I tried it was really hell 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.789
 I used my normal makeup remover 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.420
 do not remove the patient mascara 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:35.219
 waterproof 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.049
 but if it really bothers me is this 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:38.939
 that this formula is not water repellent 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.619
 can be proven but the second 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.719
 in you counted acid so left 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.979
 viewer the option want my makeup remover 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.359
 can no longer remove then in the 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.609
 shower washed my face is 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:49.020
 usually when I wash my face that 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:51.539
 takes away a good deal of the nationals 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.370
 but not with that and finally on Thursday 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.750
 last with 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.090
 coconut oil really have it all 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.860
 remove and again the age and the past with 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.600
 another makeup remover to remove everything 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.590
 if not the second time I will try to 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.320
 one of the costs I had done 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.910
 heat up before and the sarm and market 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.490
 then if I had the help of hot water 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.050
 from my shower trying to get up this 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.670
 mascara there but I think he went away 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.300
 so bad that I do not want my 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.550
 life to put it 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.540
 but here the second one makes you a 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.640
 good work 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.580
 if I know that at night I thought 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.590
 a lot of time to remove it rubs 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.720
 msil well damaged the skin that is 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.670
 around missiles maybe lettieri 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.020
 what I do not like so since in 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.790
 same interests that are expensive and he 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.950
 cost plus the two gold then 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.250
 frankly I do not think that is worth the 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.560
 trouble 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.150
 if these are you washing series then 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.070
 that it really works minister is going to me 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.990
 tell where it doesnt Pantoute 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.440
 but tell me that for the pleasure of hearing 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.330
 your opinion on the master's good cheer 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.410
 at core gore it was all that 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.060
 I had to tell you the sows I hope 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.550
 that my review my opinion was you 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.300
 helpful and on that eleven years in a 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.500
 next video 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.500
