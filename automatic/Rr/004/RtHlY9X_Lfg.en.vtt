00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:13.219
 so now we join the family 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.290
 this piece of frame was such a relative 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.630
 Thick of the and that is very 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.690
 practically because we are also very thick 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.359
 yarns I speak once the thread 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:28.070
 a video looks a bit like that 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:31.910
 overlap and then here comes the thread 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:39.940
 I 'll do it then I 'll do it 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:50.270
 once in here and so once in here 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:56.020
 it pulls that way then cross over to 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.020
 This mesh attracted by 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.700
 you just go you see now know 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.980
 go from here into this mesh 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.490
 and then I go back to the middle 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:17.620
 or on the other side 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:20.110
 put it through it then it is through 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.350
 I'll go over it again in this net 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.350
 purely 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.860
 I thank you again in this mesh 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.450
 pull that through 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.940
 So what I'm doing here already 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.140
 suggestion for you you can do it 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.390
 Of course, different from them, yes there 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.060
 There are no really solid ones 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.450
 Guidelines how to do it 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.200
 in the end it should be supposed to 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.350
 awarded 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.460
 It is supposed to fulfill two tasks 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.550
 prevent the thread from rising and it 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.310
 should not be visible 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:10.520
 that is if he is so easy the thread 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:14.270
 so beautiful down there by then pulls her 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:17.720
 look here that is a barely noticeable in the 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.060
 compared to this this conclusion and 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.550
 nobody will notice you and you do 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.800
 it just as far as maybe 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.070
 in half to scarf in then you are 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.680
 almost 100 percent sure so when the 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.750
 thread then here often cuts the even 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.430
 nothing can happen or that the 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.410
 father also no progress you can 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.900
 of course, also complete 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.670
 depending on how you want so you can 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.080
 you go on at will then 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.299
 you just cut off the rides and 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.690
 then the whole thing is not accurate 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.280
 the same could be done in the beginning 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.260
 there you will find exactly the same structure 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.790
 in front 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.049
 there you have to start a bit 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.940
 thread 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:03:01.670
 and you can do exactly the same 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:03.620
 doing here yes okay well I do that 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.110
 Now here a little further me 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.030
 do not know enough thread that it 's up to 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.100
 maybe I'll do the end 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.530
 even through to the end and then snow 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.910
 until that is up to you depending 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.250
 after how much work or 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.769
 but want to poke the most important 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.190
 is just what and fulfill sewn 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.940
 should 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.950
 it should not be visible and it should 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.760
 prevent the thread or that the 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:31.390
 that separates the strict one yes that 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.030
 then you can do everything 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.989
 Hope you liked it and was for 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.370
 you interesting 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.370
 Until next time
