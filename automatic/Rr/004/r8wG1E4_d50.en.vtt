00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.490
 and although he is everyone these 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.280
 plants registers for a new 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.679
 video that will be a test of my card 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.230
 graph on the carpet 3 then already a 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.960
 video cancer I want to clarify that this 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.609
 would be a kind of small series so that 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.449
 does not have a child his parents a series 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.670
 but it's kind of a parade of two 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.019
 types of different games so 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.990
 today this is the first game will be 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.950
 so do not you do three we will test 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:38.010
 and then that's without my series in which 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.780
 Regarding this I will therefore be placed for 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.489
 the episode we will say to episode 2 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.320
 will be for example on gta episodes 3 on 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.700
 minecraft ecsta so here I go I 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.090
 will test several games and a heart 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.450
 graphic 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.320
 so if you already have in mind that if 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.570
 you already have in mind simply 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.340
 propose the months I would finally say I 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.530
 see if I have them I do not have a lot 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.210
 no longer the pc game then 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.340
 if some want to know my 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.170
 pc configuration so crowd so 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.829
 all my processor configuration the 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.479
 Graphic card 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.840
 the ram etc everything is in the description 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.020
 or on my channel eventually and that's it 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.630
 here 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.740
 so I repeat again one last time 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:19.399
 is on pc and we will test battlefield 3 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:24.380
 with the graphic card the gti 662 at 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:27.590
 nvidia ouaddou then already we can 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.580
 see that I'm turning it to then you 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.509
 do not see how I did I the 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.119
 rotate I do as much about 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.539
 45 50 fps that's still what I 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.940
 skis frankly that's good and that 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.560
 I make it turn so ultra 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.720
 so it's not it's not what is here 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.649
 everything is ultra finally at least the 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.600
 quality of graphics and in a 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:50.090
 translation stops automatically train 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:53.240
 in 1920 x 1080 60 hertz a screen here 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.179
 everything is an ultra and see that I do 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.250
 turn anyway at 45 50 fps so this 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.659
 which is really what makes it very 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.790
 quite frankly there is nothing to say 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.040
 it's really perfect as long as that 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.090
 pasta without julien until it's not 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.979
 below 30 fps 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.320
 the game is very fluid there is no 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.570
 problem if you start to be in 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.640
 all 27 be ps the sequence allies that's 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.970
 not very good sign but with this card 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.380
 graphically good after not necessary 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.239
 have that khadra girl no longer so 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.190
 you are a shit processor and not 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.540
 a lot of ram and all good that's it 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.620
 may depend but with the daughter of me 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:32.299
 and of my components would not even like 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:34.160
 returned here that say other because 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.470
 so just go to the smoke for 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.549
 see if there are drops in payrolls because 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.650
 we did it but it's a particle 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.000
 sam effah bad of final peace a good there 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.730
 it's not very very at the mill 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.769
 the sun all that is no 50 fps to 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.030
 fragmented grentzingen finally anyway 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.730
 not good here I tell you frankly 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.470
 with this graphics card you do not have 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.450
 no problems, it's okay 3 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.310
 so here it was for episode 1 so 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.750
 I hope it has been useful 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.120
 so there a decanter there that I you 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.500
 really advise then the prices I 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.940
 I'm really sorry I will remember 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.760
 in addition I will send you a link in 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.530
 registration for a price of the card 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.110
 graphic so I was that 162 string he 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.700
 I think it's worth around 1,300 euros 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.810
 others like that i'm not sure at all 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.540
 from me you will see in the 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.580
 description and that's so I hope that 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.140
 this little test would have been useful to you 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.670
 will have helped if you have any questions 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.140
 do not hesitate to ask in 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.340
 comments and I tell you to 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.340
 next tests were going the same
