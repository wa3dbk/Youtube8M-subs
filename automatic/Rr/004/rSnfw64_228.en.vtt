like<00:02:07.200> people<00:02:07.459> like<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.610> loved<00:02:09.000> your<00:02:09.179> first

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
like people like that loved your first

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.270 
like people like that loved your first
record<00:02:09.750> might<00:02:09.899> not<00:02:10.050> like<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.500> but<00:02:10.800> people<00:02:10.979> that

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
record might not like it but people that

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.680 
record might not like it but people that
didn't<00:02:11.520> like<00:02:11.580> your<00:02:11.819> first<00:02:12.000> record<00:02:12.330> might<00:02:12.480> like

didn't like your first record might like

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.960 
didn't like your first record might like
it<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:12.989> it's<00:02:13.140> just<00:02:13.200> kind<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.560> like

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
it so it's just kind of like

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.059 
it so it's just kind of like
re-establishing<00:02:14.970> yourself

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
re-establishing yourself

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.280 
re-establishing yourself
and<00:02:16.250> I<00:02:16.909> know<00:02:16.970> you've<00:02:17.269> kind<00:02:17.569> of<00:02:17.659> said<00:02:17.900> in<00:02:17.989> the

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
past that you know this was the first

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.660 
past that you know this was the first
chance<00:02:20.720> that<00:02:21.049> you've<00:02:21.170> had<00:02:21.349> to<00:02:21.890> make<00:02:22.010> a<00:02:22.040> record

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
chance that you've had to make a record

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.420 
chance that you've had to make a record
in<00:02:23.209> a<00:02:23.390> record<00:02:24.110> making<00:02:24.409> environment<00:02:25.099> not<00:02:25.220> in<00:02:25.370> a

in a record making environment not in a
basement<00:02:25.670> or<00:02:26.030> or<00:02:26.870> I<00:02:28.750> mean<00:02:29.750> that<00:02:30.049> was<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.590> fun

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
basement or or I mean that was a fun

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.300 
basement or or I mean that was a fun
experience<00:02:31.849> for<00:02:31.970> us<00:02:32.209> to<00:02:32.569> kind<00:02:32.870> of<00:02:33.310> literally

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
experience for us to kind of literally

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.369 
experience for us to kind of literally
isolate<00:02:34.790> ourselves<00:02:34.940> in<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.510> studio<00:02:35.840> in<00:02:36.079> the

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
isolate ourselves in the studio in the

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.380 
isolate ourselves in the studio in the
middle<00:02:36.680> of<00:02:36.860> nowhere<00:02:37.159> in<00:02:37.220> Michigan<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:38.030> I

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
middle of nowhere in Michigan and I

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.390 
middle of nowhere in Michigan and I
don't<00:02:39.319> know<00:02:39.379> it<00:02:39.530> felt<00:02:39.650> like<00:02:39.860> a<00:02:39.890> really<00:02:40.099> nice

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
don't know it felt like a really nice

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.240 
don't know it felt like a really nice
bonding<00:02:40.970> experience<00:02:41.090> as<00:02:42.079> opposed<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.620> album

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
bonding experience as opposed to album

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.429 
bonding experience as opposed to album
one<00:02:43.459> which<00:02:43.700> was<00:02:43.909> mostly<00:02:44.239> done<00:02:44.450> by<00:02:44.629> Katie<00:02:44.930> so

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:45.439 
one which was mostly done by Katie so

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
mean we've been writing some new

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.449 
mean we've been writing some new
material<00:03:15.200> it's<00:03:15.349> a<00:03:15.470> little<00:03:15.920> bit<00:03:16.069> outside<00:03:16.220> of

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
material it's a little bit outside of

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.360 
material it's a little bit outside of
the<00:03:16.760> normal<00:03:17.359> ouster<00:03:17.810> formula<00:03:18.349> but<00:03:18.680> not<00:03:18.920> it's

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
the normal ouster formula but not it's

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.699 
the normal ouster formula but not it's
such<00:03:19.730> a<00:03:19.760> huge<00:03:20.030> departure<00:03:20.510> that's<00:03:20.930> I<00:03:21.230> mean<00:03:21.680> I

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
such a huge departure that's I mean I

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:22.839 
such a huge departure that's I mean I
don't<00:03:21.859> know<00:03:21.980> maybe<00:03:22.129> it<00:03:22.310> will<00:03:22.430> freak<00:03:22.669> people

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
don't know maybe it will freak people

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.270 
don't know maybe it will freak people
out<00:03:23.120> I<00:03:23.180> don't<00:03:23.480> know<00:03:23.569> but<00:03:23.870> we're<00:03:24.859> starting<00:03:25.160> to

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
out I don't know but we're starting to

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.409 
out I don't know but we're starting to
inch<00:03:25.790> away<00:03:26.060> from<00:03:26.590> maybe<00:03:27.590> these<00:03:28.209> ideas<00:03:29.209> of<00:03:29.389> what

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
inch away from maybe these ideas of what

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:31.949 
inch away from maybe these ideas of what
else<00:03:29.750> draws<00:03:30.019> into<00:03:30.530> a<00:03:30.560> new<00:03:30.769> realm<00:03:31.099> I<00:03:31.549> think

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
else draws into a new realm I think

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.990 
else draws into a new realm I think
let's<00:03:32.959> go<00:03:33.109> you<00:03:33.470> wanna<00:03:33.709> free<00:03:33.949> a<00:03:34.129> little<00:03:34.730> bit

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
let's go you wanna free a little bit

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.479 
let's go you wanna free a little bit
yeah<00:03:35.930> well<00:03:36.199> I<00:03:36.230> think<00:03:36.349> the<00:03:36.680> thing<00:03:36.859> with<00:03:37.010> Olympia

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
yeah well I think the thing with Olympia

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.319 
yeah well I think the thing with Olympia
was<00:03:37.790> that<00:03:38.030> it<00:03:38.750> was<00:03:39.019> almost<00:03:39.230> like<00:03:39.980> we<00:03:40.549> wanted<00:03:41.030> to

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
was that it was almost like we wanted to

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.800 
was that it was almost like we wanted to
essentially<00:03:41.930> make<00:03:42.430> more<00:03:43.430> of<00:03:43.549> a<00:03:43.760> pop<00:03:44.120> record<00:03:44.389> or

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
essentially make more of a pop record or

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.740 
essentially make more of a pop record or
just<00:03:44.840> like<00:03:45.139> more<00:03:45.349> of<00:03:45.470> it<00:03:45.620> like<00:03:45.799> accessible

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
just like more of it like accessible

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.809 
just like more of it like accessible
record<00:03:47.750> in<00:03:47.870> a<00:03:47.930> way<00:03:48.079> but<00:03:48.769> I<00:03:49.129> kind<00:03:49.579> of<00:03:49.639> feel<00:03:49.790> like

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
record in a way but I kind of feel like

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.430 
record in a way but I kind of feel like
it<00:03:50.000> almost<00:03:50.120> backfired<00:03:50.810> like<00:03:51.019> we<00:03:51.109> ended<00:03:51.230> up

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
it almost backfired like we ended up

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.659 
it almost backfired like we ended up
making<00:03:51.590> like<00:03:51.769> a<00:03:51.889> kind<00:03:52.280> of<00:03:52.310> a<00:03:52.459> more

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:52.669 
making like a kind of a more

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:54.220 
making like a kind of a more
introspective<00:03:53.030> record<00:03:53.780> than<00:03:53.930> the<00:03:53.959> first

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
introspective record than the first

onstage<00:04:45.350> now<00:04:45.770> last<00:04:45.979> time<00:04:46.070> we<00:04:46.190> were<00:04:46.610> here<00:04:46.639> we

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
onstage now last time we were here we

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.740 
onstage now last time we were here we
were<00:04:46.910> six<00:04:47.150> people<00:04:47.300> so<00:04:48.080> that's<00:04:48.229> different<00:04:49.750> yeah

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
were six people so that's different yeah

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.040 
were six people so that's different yeah
it's<00:04:50.990> like<00:04:51.139> I<00:04:51.260> guess<00:04:51.500> because<00:04:51.680> with<00:04:51.949> Olympia<00:04:52.280> a

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
it's like I guess because with Olympia a

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.560 
it's like I guess because with Olympia a
lot<00:04:54.050> of<00:04:54.169> the<00:04:54.350> music<00:04:54.620> is<00:04:55.100> more<00:04:55.639> translates

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
lot of the music is more translates

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.750 
lot of the music is more translates
better<00:04:56.810> to<00:04:57.320> actually<00:04:57.830> play<00:04:58.039> it<00:04:58.190> live<00:04:58.400> where

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
better to actually play it live where

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.159 
better to actually play it live where
would<00:04:58.880> steal<00:04:59.120> a<00:04:59.150> break<00:04:59.449> a<00:04:59.479> lot<00:04:59.780> of<00:04:59.870> the<00:04:59.960> stuff

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
would steal a break a lot of the stuff

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.680 
would steal a break a lot of the stuff
was<00:05:00.320> just<00:05:00.530> like<00:05:00.680> production<00:05:01.220> and<00:05:01.400> beats<00:05:01.639> so<00:05:02.300> we

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
was just like production and beats so we

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.150 
was just like production and beats so we
kind<00:05:02.930> of<00:05:03.080> you<00:05:03.440> know<00:05:03.470> we<00:05:03.650> used<00:05:03.800> to<00:05:03.860> have<00:05:04.010> two

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
backup singers and it was more of like a

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.200 
backup singers and it was more of like a
visual<00:05:06.410> spectacle<00:05:06.919> whereas<00:05:07.760> now<00:05:07.910> with<00:05:07.970> these

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
visual spectacle whereas now with these

Toronto and we lost it

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.260

somewhere<00:05:41.960> at<00:05:42.200> an<00:05:42.320> airport<00:05:42.910> so<00:05:43.910> we<00:05:44.030> had<00:05:44.150> it

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
somewhere at an airport so we had it

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.339 
somewhere at an airport so we had it
remade<00:05:44.740> with<00:05:45.740> new<00:05:46.280> materials<00:05:46.789> and<00:05:47.080> that<00:05:48.080> was

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:48.349 
remade with new materials and that was

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:51.460 
remade with new materials and that was
lost<00:05:48.560> by<00:05:48.800> an<00:05:48.919> airline<00:05:49.099> so<00:05:50.229> unfortunately<00:05:51.229> we

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
lost by an airline so unfortunately we

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.279 
lost by an airline so unfortunately we
don't<00:05:51.620> have<00:05:51.770> our<00:05:51.889> backdrop<00:05:52.370> anymore<00:05:53.229> but<00:05:54.229> I

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
don't have our backdrop anymore but I

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:55.990 
don't have our backdrop anymore but I
think<00:05:54.530> most<00:05:54.770> of<00:05:54.919> the<00:05:55.070> clubs<00:05:55.370> were<00:05:55.699> kind<00:05:55.940> of

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
think most of the clubs were kind of

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.180 
think most of the clubs were kind of
like<00:05:56.210> daunted<00:05:56.690> by<00:05:56.720> our<00:05:56.990> backdrop<00:05:57.380> anyways<00:05:57.889> so

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
like daunted by our backdrop anyways so

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.680 
like daunted by our backdrop anyways so
maybe<00:05:58.550> it's<00:05:58.729> better<00:05:58.940> that<00:05:59.090> we're<00:05:59.419> more<00:05:59.599> of

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
maybe it's better that we're more of

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.839 
maybe it's better that we're more of
like<00:05:59.810> a<00:05:59.840> stripped-down<00:06:00.520> touring<00:06:01.520> part<00:06:01.729> yeah

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:01.849 
like a stripped-down touring part yeah

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:04.300 
like a stripped-down touring part yeah
the<00:06:02.479> lesson<00:06:02.870> we<00:06:02.960> learned<00:06:02.990> last<00:06:03.440> year's<00:06:03.800> don't

have<00:06:04.550> a<00:06:04.580> backdrop<00:06:05.120> unless<00:06:05.930> someone<00:06:06.320> is<00:06:06.590> really

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:07.099 
have a backdrop unless someone is really
