00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:32.190 
layers okay because this is going to

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.820 
layers okay because this is going to

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.800 

with<00:01:41.830> it<00:01:42.520> kind<00:01:42.670> of<00:01:42.850> flares<00:01:43.090> out<00:01:43.270> from<00:01:43.660> the

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
with it kind of flares out from the

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:44.550 
with it kind of flares out from the
armpit

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
armpit

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.910 
armpit
okay<00:01:45.100> so<00:01:45.160> then<00:01:45.580> when<00:01:45.940> you<00:01:45.970> unfold<00:01:46.920> you're

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
okay so then when you unfold you're

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.430 
okay so then when you unfold you're
going<00:01:48.100> to<00:01:48.190> have<00:01:50.310> your<00:01:51.310> pieces<00:01:51.610> I<00:01:52.090> didn't<00:01:52.720> um<00:01:52.930> I

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
going to have your pieces I didn't um I

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.130 
going to have your pieces I didn't um I
didn't<00:01:54.130> cut<00:01:54.310> across<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.970> top<00:01:55.000> of<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.720> sleeve

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
didn't cut across the top of the sleeve

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.400 
didn't cut across the top of the sleeve
so<00:01:56.920> I<00:01:56.950> left<00:01:57.190> it<00:01:57.370> a<00:01:57.430> attach<00:01:58.270> so<00:01:58.660> I<00:01:58.690> left<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.170> fold

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
so I left it a attach so I left the fold

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.860 
so I left it a attach so I left the fold
in<00:01:59.590> place<00:01:59.830> so<00:02:00.100> that<00:02:00.130> I<00:02:00.310> wouldn't<00:02:00.610> have<00:02:00.730> to<00:02:01.060> even

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
in place so that I wouldn't have to even

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.740 
in place so that I wouldn't have to even
so<00:02:02.170> that<00:02:02.380> part<00:02:02.650> so<00:02:02.970> you<00:02:03.970> actually<00:02:04.330> ended<00:02:04.540> up

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
so that part so you actually ended up

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.900 
so that part so you actually ended up
with<00:02:04.990> one<00:02:05.290> whole<00:02:05.620> piece<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:09.429> is<00:02:09.580> your<00:02:09.759> neck

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
with one whole piece this is your neck

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.030 
with one whole piece this is your neck
hole<00:02:10.149> right<00:02:10.330> here<00:02:10.390> and<00:02:10.899> what<00:02:11.710> you're<00:02:11.860> going<00:02:12.010> to

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
hole right here and what you're going to

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.000 
hole right here and what you're going to
do<00:02:12.340> is<00:02:12.640> fold<00:02:13.360> it<00:02:13.660> well<00:02:14.290> you're<00:02:14.800> going<00:02:14.920> to

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
do is fold it well you're going to

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.520 
do is fold it well you're going to
determine<00:02:15.340> which<00:02:15.760> part<00:02:16.120> is<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.780> front<00:02:17.140> and

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
determine which part is the front and

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.130 
determine which part is the front and
you<00:02:18.220> might<00:02:18.400> want<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.670> take<00:02:19.180> your<00:02:19.390> neckline<00:02:19.810> and

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
you might want to take your neckline and

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.640 
you might want to take your neckline and
come<00:02:20.350> down<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.560> little<00:02:20.890> bit<00:02:21.130> in<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.930> neckline

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
come down a little bit in the neckline

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.910 
come down a little bit in the neckline
so<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:25.570> just<00:02:25.840> determine<00:02:26.110> how<00:02:26.380> far<00:02:26.650> you<00:02:26.800> want

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
so you just determine how far you want

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.860 
so you just determine how far you want
