00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.110 
Neil your reflections on on cardi first
of<00:00:01.949> all<00:00:02.040> that's<00:00:02.399> as<00:00:02.520> good<00:00:02.610> as<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:02.790> wind<00:00:02.970> gets

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
of all that's as good as a wind gets

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.380 
of all that's as good as a wind gets
isn't<00:00:03.360> it<00:00:03.419> yeah<00:00:04.910> reflections<00:00:05.910> on<00:00:06.060> it<00:00:06.210> are

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
isn't it yeah reflections on it are

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.509 
isn't it yeah reflections on it are
probably<00:00:06.930> like<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.350> game<00:00:07.680> itself<00:00:08.010> you<00:00:08.370> know

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
probably like the game itself you know

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.250 
probably like the game itself you know
depends<00:00:09.059> if<00:00:09.150> you<00:00:09.210> ask<00:00:09.330> me<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.540> first<00:00:09.690> off<00:00:09.990> you

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
depends if you ask me the first off you

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.780 
depends if you ask me the first off you
get<00:00:10.410> completely<00:00:10.800> different<00:00:11.340> answer<00:00:11.580> than<00:00:11.610> the

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
get completely different answer than the

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.839 
get completely different answer than the
second<00:00:12.179> obviously<00:00:12.570> but<00:00:13.320> overall<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:14.099> an

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
second obviously but overall and an

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.660 
second obviously but overall and an
outstanding<00:00:15.410> performance<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:17.279> result

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
outstanding performance and result

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.029 
outstanding performance and result
considering<00:00:18.359> how<00:00:18.720> poor<00:00:19.650> we<00:00:19.770> were<00:00:19.859> in<00:00:19.980> the

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
considering how poor we were in the

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.429 
considering how poor we were in the
first<00:00:20.220> half<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.730> can<00:00:21.420> look<00:00:21.810> what<00:00:22.050> can<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.289> do<00:00:22.410> for

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
first half I can look what can I do for

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.380 
first half I can look what can I do for
momentum<00:00:23.010> going<00:00:23.550> into<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.850> little<00:00:24.090> busy

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
momentum going into this little busy

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.509 
momentum going into this little busy
fixture<00:00:24.779> schedule<00:00:25.140> that's<00:00:25.260> going<00:00:25.439> up<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.710> lot

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
fixture schedule that's going up a lot

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.820 
fixture schedule that's going up a lot
because<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.779> mean<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.019> never<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.410> never<00:00:28.439> want

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
because I mean you never you never want

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.519 
because I mean you never you never want
to<00:00:29.010> win<00:00:29.220> sort<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.060> way<00:00:30.240> by<00:00:30.840> being<00:00:31.050> sort<00:00:31.470> of

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
to win sort of that way by being sort of

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.160 
to win sort of that way by being sort of
you<00:00:32.340> know<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:33.090> far<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.660> hole<00:00:33.690> as<00:00:34.050> we

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
you know so so far in the hole as we

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.440 
you know so so far in the hole as we
said<00:00:34.350> on<00:00:34.500> Saturday<00:00:35.010> but<00:00:35.040> what<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.090> can<00:00:36.270> use

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
said on Saturday but what you can use

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.270 
said on Saturday but what you can use
from<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.200> ability<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.770> we<00:00:37.890> had<00:00:38.040> to

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
from it is the ability that we had to

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.310 
from it is the ability that we had to
sort<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.910> get<00:00:39.030> sells<00:00:39.329> out<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.840> hole<00:00:40.050> and

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
sort of get sells out of that hole and

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.290 
sort of get sells out of that hole and
go<00:00:40.829> on<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.160> produce<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.700> fantastic

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
go on and produce a fantastic

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.860 
go on and produce a fantastic
performance<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.110> result<00:00:43.940> we<00:00:44.940> we've<00:00:45.690> got<00:00:45.840> to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
performance and result we we've got to

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.420 
performance and result we we've got to
be<00:00:45.989> careful<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.530> we<00:00:46.620> said<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.010> players<00:00:47.129> in

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
be careful and we said to the players in

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.100 
be careful and we said to the players in
there<00:00:47.579> we<00:00:47.760> can't<00:00:48.030> rely<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.870> know<00:00:48.899> we

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
there we can't rely on that you know we

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.779 
there we can't rely on that you know we
can't<00:00:49.350> go<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.530> games<00:00:49.860> thinking<00:00:50.309> well<00:00:50.489> if<00:00:50.610> we<00:00:50.760> go

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
can't go to games thinking well if we go

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.240 
can't go to games thinking well if we go
one<00:00:51.120> down<00:00:51.360> two<00:00:51.600> down<00:00:51.809> don't<00:00:52.140> worry<00:00:52.350> because

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
one down two down don't worry because

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.560 
one down two down don't worry because
there<00:00:53.430> will<00:00:53.550> come<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.789> time<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.329> could<00:00:54.480> be

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
there will come a time and it could be

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.000 
there will come a time and it could be
in<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.660> next<00:00:54.870> game<00:00:55.079> where<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.680> suddenly

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
in the next game where that suddenly

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.010 
in the next game where that suddenly
becomes<00:00:56.399> game<00:00:56.640> over<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.420> can't<00:00:57.690> get

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
becomes game over and you can't get

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.049 
becomes game over and you can't get
yourself<00:00:58.109> out<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.739> but<00:00:59.219> it's<00:00:59.370> not<00:00:59.520> it's<00:00:59.910> not

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
yourself out of it but it's not it's not

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.150 
yourself out of it but it's not it's not
a<00:01:00.120> bad<00:01:00.359> sort<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.870> tool<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.379> have<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.920> back

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
a bad sort of tool to have in the back

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.609 
a bad sort of tool to have in the back
of<00:01:02.340> our<00:01:02.460> minds<00:01:02.670> if<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.030> like<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.449> if<00:01:04.290> and

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
of our minds if you like that if and

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.109 
of our minds if you like that if and
when<00:01:04.799> there<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> time<00:01:05.610> where<00:01:05.850> we're<00:01:06.000> not

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
when there is a time where we're not

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.030 
when there is a time where we're not
firing<00:01:06.450> quite<00:01:06.930> quite<00:01:07.500> as<00:01:07.650> well<00:01:07.770> as<00:01:07.830> we<00:01:07.920> should

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
firing quite quite as well as we should

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.370 
firing quite quite as well as we should
be<00:01:08.430> well<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.479> know<00:01:09.600> we<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:09.930> turn<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.320> around

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
be well we know we can turn it around

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.020 
be well we know we can turn it around
we're<00:01:10.740> capable<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.220> turning<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.580> round<00:01:11.610> but

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
we're capable of turning it round but

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.420 
we're capable of turning it round but
for<00:01:12.540> my<00:01:12.840> objective<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.500> my<00:01:13.650> perspective<00:01:14.280> is

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
for my objective in my perspective is

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.880 
for my objective in my perspective is
that<00:01:14.460> we've<00:01:15.080> let's<00:01:16.080> not<00:01:16.229> have<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.619> get<00:01:16.740> that

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
that we've let's not have to get that

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.010 
that we've let's not have to get that
anyway<00:01:17.189> let's<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:18.210> know<00:01:18.240> let's<00:01:18.330> start<00:01:18.750> better

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
anyway let's you know let's start better

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.780 
anyway let's you know let's start better
at<00:01:19.259> times<00:01:19.560> let's<00:01:19.890> put<00:01:20.100> ourselves<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.610> front

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
at times let's put ourselves in front

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.749 
at times let's put ourselves in front
and<00:01:21.090> not<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.950> worry<00:01:23.159> about<00:01:23.280> how<00:01:23.700> we

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
and not have to to worry about how we

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.940 
and not have to to worry about how we
can<00:01:24.060> recover<00:01:24.330> because<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:25.500> know<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:25.710> work<00:01:25.860> we

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
can recover because you know we work we

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.830 
can recover because you know we work we
don't<00:01:26.070> want<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.250> be<00:01:26.340> recovering<00:01:26.790> too<00:01:27.330> often<00:01:27.689> if

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
don't want to be recovering too often if

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.719 
don't want to be recovering too often if
at<00:01:27.960> all<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.650> isn't<00:01:28.950> isn't<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.280> bad<00:01:29.460> thing<00:01:29.490> to

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
at all but it isn't isn't a bad thing to

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.270 
at all but it isn't isn't a bad thing to
know<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:31.079> can<00:01:31.200> go<00:01:31.380> away<00:01:31.470> from<00:01:31.829> home<00:01:32.009> be

nothing other than that other than the

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.540 
nothing other than that other than the
usual<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.390> knocks<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.019> bumps<00:03:22.140> so<00:03:22.550> pleasingly

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
some of his running in his movement was

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.570 
some of his running in his movement was
very<00:04:16.200> clever<00:04:16.440> particularly<00:04:17.100> for<00:04:17.190> his<00:04:17.340> gold

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
very clever particularly for his gold

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.800 
very clever particularly for his gold
because<00:04:17.910> he<00:04:18.000> could<00:04:18.120> have<00:04:18.209> easily<00:04:18.299> ran<00:04:18.660> off

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
because he could have easily ran off

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.900 
because he could have easily ran off
side<00:04:19.080> and<00:04:19.350> just<00:04:19.769> checked<00:04:20.100> his<00:04:20.220> wrong<00:04:20.519> just<00:04:20.820> to

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
side and just checked his wrong just to

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.190 
side and just checked his wrong just to
make<00:04:21.090> sure<00:04:21.120> he<00:04:21.390> was<00:04:21.479> on<00:04:21.570> side<00:04:21.780> that's<00:04:21.959> clever

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
make sure he was on side that's clever

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.310 
make sure he was on side that's clever
play<00:04:22.970> but<00:04:23.970> there<00:04:24.120> wasn't<00:04:24.270> much<00:04:24.630> that<00:04:24.990> you

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
play but there wasn't much that you

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.420 
play but there wasn't much that you
could<00:04:25.500> you<00:04:25.740> could<00:04:25.860> fault<00:04:26.160> in

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
could you could fault in

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
think we're getting that here now that

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.400 
think we're getting that here now that
we've<00:04:56.729> got<00:04:56.910> squad<00:04:57.240> of<00:04:57.389> players<00:04:57.479> and<00:04:57.750> you<00:04:58.289> know

we've got squad of players and you know

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:59.689 
we've got squad of players and you know
it's<00:04:58.530> easy<00:04:58.650> for<00:04:58.800> me<00:04:58.919> to<00:04:58.949> say<00:04:59.070> that<00:04:59.490> because

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
it's easy for me to say that because

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.400 
it's easy for me to say that because
i'll<00:05:00.240> be<00:05:00.389> the<00:05:00.509> one<00:05:00.630> obviously<00:05:00.990> that<00:05:01.139> has<00:05:01.229> to

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
i'll be the one obviously that has to

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.950 
i'll be the one obviously that has to
tell<00:05:01.590> players<00:05:01.800> that<00:05:02.039> they're<00:05:02.190> not<00:05:02.310> playing

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
tell players that they're not playing

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.230 
tell players that they're not playing
but<00:05:03.960> you<00:05:04.199> don't<00:05:04.889> achieve<00:05:05.039> things<00:05:05.520> with<00:05:05.849> with

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
but you don't achieve things with with

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.879 
but you don't achieve things with with
ten<00:05:06.419> eleven<00:05:06.720> players<00:05:06.870> 12<00:05:07.349> players<00:05:07.620> you

ten eleven players 12 players you

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.040 
ten eleven players 12 players you
achieve<00:05:08.310> it<00:05:08.430> with<00:05:08.460> a<00:05:08.610> squad<00:05:08.910> particularly<00:05:09.449> at

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
achieve it with a squad particularly at

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.719 
achieve it with a squad particularly at
this<00:05:10.259> level<00:05:10.500> because<00:05:10.889> of<00:05:10.949> the<00:05:11.070> volume<00:05:11.460> of

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
this level because of the volume of

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:13.790 
this level because of the volume of
games<00:05:11.910> plus<00:05:12.360> we<00:05:12.570> hope<00:05:12.720> many<00:05:13.080> many<00:05:13.320> cup<00:05:13.560> games

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
younger players in the team who will

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:21.560 
younger players in the team who will
