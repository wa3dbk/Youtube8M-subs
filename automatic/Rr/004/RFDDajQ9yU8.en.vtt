00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
I don't think so let's go back all right

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.180 
I don't think so let's go back all right
so<00:01:59.270> what<00:01:59.420> else<00:01:59.509> does<00:01:59.630> it<00:01:59.660> have<00:01:59.780> it<00:02:00.440> has<00:02:00.619> a<00:02:00.649> 3.5
