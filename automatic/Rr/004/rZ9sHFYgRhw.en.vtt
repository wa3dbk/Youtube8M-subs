before you worry about anything

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.790 
before you worry about anything
happening<00:02:27.390> because<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.840> controller<00:02:28.380> will

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
happening because the controller will

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.970 
happening because the controller will
not<00:02:29.040> start<00:02:29.430> anything<00:02:29.970> for<00:02:30.270> 10<00:02:30.480> minutes<00:02:30.980> thank

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
not start anything for 10 minutes thank
