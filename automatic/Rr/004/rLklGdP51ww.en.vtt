00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:27.609 
bolt to take off I'll show you exactly

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.629 
bolt to take off I'll show you exactly
whatever<00:02:27.910> it's<00:02:28.239> just<00:02:28.359> a<00:02:28.450> little<00:02:28.660> salt<00:02:28.930> I<00:02:29.639> went

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:30.639 
whatever it's just a little salt I went

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:34.949 
whatever it's just a little salt I went
like<00:02:30.760> this<00:02:31.709> on<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:33.280> old<00:02:33.459> struts<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.389> I<00:02:34.540> salt

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
like this on the old struts and I salt

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.900 
like this on the old struts and I salt
it<00:02:35.079> off<00:02:35.260> because<00:02:35.680> on<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.669> old<00:02:36.849> struts<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:39.760> on

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
it off because on the old struts and on

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.270 
it off because on the old struts and on
most<00:02:40.090> of<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.329> stress<00:02:40.540> anyways<00:02:40.930> if<00:02:41.919> you<00:02:41.980> see

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
most of the stress anyways if you see

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.099 
most of the stress anyways if you see
they<00:02:42.489> do<00:02:42.549> not<00:02:42.819> have<00:02:43.120> something<00:02:43.540> where<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:43.930> can

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
they do not have something where you can

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.770 
they do not have something where you can
just<00:02:44.290> pop<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:44.799> off<00:02:44.889> so<00:02:45.790> if<00:02:45.940> you<00:02:46.090> see<00:02:46.299> that<00:02:46.510> right

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
just pop it off so if you see that right

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.190 
just pop it off so if you see that right
there<00:02:47.790> that's<00:02:48.790> where<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.120> used<00:02:49.329> to<00:02:49.450> be<00:02:49.510> we

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
there that's where it used to be we

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.220 
there that's where it used to be we
focus<00:02:50.650> right<00:02:50.859> there

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
focus right there

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.890 
focus right there
that's<00:02:52.920> where<00:02:53.069> it<00:02:53.160> used<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.489> be<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:54.510> sawed

you<00:03:10.050> see<00:03:10.290> I<00:03:10.319> got<00:03:10.650> when<00:03:11.489> it's<00:03:11.580> constant<00:03:12.000> auto

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
you see I got when it's constant auto

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.240

let's<00:03:53.489> see<00:03:53.700> if<00:03:53.880> it<00:03:54.030> opens<00:03:54.209> up<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.690> trunk<00:03:54.930> and

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
let's see if it opens up the trunk and

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.970 
let's see if it opens up the trunk and
can<00:03:55.620> lift<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.160> weight<00:03:56.340> of<00:03:56.459> this<00:03:56.609> spoiler<00:03:57.120> and

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
can lift the weight of this spoiler and

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.520 
can lift the weight of this spoiler and
do<00:03:58.980> its<00:03:59.160> job<00:03:59.370> let's<00:04:00.180> see<00:04:00.359> there<00:04:00.780> we<00:04:00.870> go
