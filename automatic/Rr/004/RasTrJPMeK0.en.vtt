00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.379
 sailing mustard mountaineers welcome in 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.440
 this new sport really after live 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:14.410
 I talk to you about farlane a lot 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.660
 the r's this mode adds so many 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.410
 nm modified in what sense 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.420
 we find renderman mystics therefore the 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.390
 arms of the mystical lander that I am 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.449
 we say as if they were chopsticks 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:32.289
 magical but modified anyway 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:34.120
 we find golems and things like that 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:35.829
 if I do it really well though 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.199
 first to tell you about the under me i want 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.570
 show you these new blocks 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:43.570
 we never have the whole block we find 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.760
 below ground or ruby kolles that 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.699
 that one digs precisely and then we find the 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.510
 ruby block or ruby and after 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:57.010
 let's say we dug finding the ruby 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:01:01.390
 hors we find this veil as if it were 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:04.540
 let's say the cc diamond from this ruby 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.670
 and we can create the ruby ​​block 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.619
 or to block the jacket thanks to 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.930
 this this object 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.600
 then we find all the numbers to render me 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.090
 which are these here besides a sword 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.600
 one shoulder and you love nightfall sword then 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.360
 we find less than really a lot 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.829
 very easy to find and then that before 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.259
 we had to find all the objects here 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:32.950
 and it was really here instead we find again 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.320
 frey immediately goals very easy then then 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.790
 we find all three blocks then 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.189
 we find and ergon and on 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:43.030
 then we find all the various ones 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:45.850
 let's say the mystic's sticks disappeared 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.390
 that this and then we find the various eggs 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.990
 we find the example of the farr l'under then 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.000
 we find luther then we find farm aid 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.420
 and her man or a header man 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.820
 modified famed or by the creators 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.990
 of the mod as if it were a say 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.680
 creation by fans 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.220
 then mystic of the minion or 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.780
 look at it this and mystical then we find 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.270
 classic and her good than the normal one 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.430
 then we find liber farlane of that is 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.300
 rebel let's say this city that makes us 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.690
 bad 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.400
 this and that this mystic kellerman 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.739
 as you can see a little different 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.840
 however that is normal in this 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.209
 normal spa and another there is another 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.530
 already another breed diet that adds the 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.800
 mod 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.750
 then we have and her golem this that the 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.430
 golem we say that attacks everyone as if 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.630
 let's say the goal is the golem of 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.190
 steel 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.780
 then there are as many others as I did 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.940
 see first such as this a 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.310
 this having to make lander 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:55.239
 now I'll show you this would be 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:57.670
 we think look at that this is 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:01.790
 should be let's say what 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:07.310
 you see from skin we say what not to 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:09.470
 home yes what moves after and is 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.530
 found a sword they killed that 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.269
 with the sword I don't think so 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.100
 was the old though if you were the 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.950
 old really a strange thing 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.019
 however it also adds other types of 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.640
 eder man as I did before see how 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:28.880
 example this then adds to them inter 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.040
 then adds terminio is so on besides 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.730
 we find the nightfall sword 2 we can 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.220
 attack let's say the various various exhibitions 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.790
 not only the under me, of course, were 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.500
 more attack locations there is damage and how 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.260
 see it really kills in a short time 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.020
 the various monsters, oh, in this case, no 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.989
 because it's really a lot of heel from 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:56.349
 you ran away and yes and then we find the 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:58.300
 various sticks and I believe that indeed not who 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.340

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.300
