you have a nice little cutout here I

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.440

think<00:02:56.620> that's<00:02:56.769> kind<00:02:56.980> of<00:02:57.040> cool<00:02:57.220> but<00:02:58.030> I<00:02:58.120> just<00:02:58.299> had

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
think that's kind of cool but I just had

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.030 
think that's kind of cool but I just had
to<00:02:58.480> mention<00:02:58.750> that<00:02:58.959> I<00:02:59.140> thought<00:02:59.500> it<00:02:59.590> was<00:02:59.709> kind<00:02:59.980> of

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
to mention that I thought it was kind of

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.720 
to mention that I thought it was kind of
neat<00:03:00.220> but<00:03:01.120> going<00:03:01.660> back<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.200> figures<00:03:02.730> first

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
neat but going back to the figures first

just<00:05:48.889> looking<00:05:49.219> at<00:05:49.339> the<00:05:49.460> arms<00:05:49.909> they're<00:05:50.599> all

00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:50.779 
just looking at the arms they're all

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:52.749 
just looking at the arms they're all
basically<00:05:51.139> the<00:05:51.439> same<00:05:51.589> except<00:05:52.339> for<00:05:52.520> you<00:05:52.669> know

just<00:05:53.000> different<00:05:53.240> pain<00:05:53.659> applications<00:05:54.500> on

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
just different pain applications on

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.329 
just different pain applications on
there<00:05:55.330> so<00:05:56.379> let's<00:05:57.379> go<00:05:57.620> ahead<00:05:57.649> and<00:05:57.919> go<00:05:58.129> over<00:05:58.159> the

00:05:58.329 --> 00:05:58.339 
there so let's go ahead and go over the

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:00.999 
there so let's go ahead and go over the
articulation<00:05:59.270> of<00:05:59.509> the<00:05:59.779> figure<00:06:00.620> I'll<00:06:00.740> just<00:06:00.770> go

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:01.009 
articulation of the figure I'll just go

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:02.320 
articulation of the figure I'll just go
over<00:06:01.159> the<00:06:01.279> articulation<00:06:01.849> of<00:06:01.909> one<00:06:02.089> because

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
over the articulation of one because

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.480 
over the articulation of one because
they're<00:06:02.449> basically<00:06:02.750> all<00:06:02.930> the<00:06:03.050> same<00:06:03.339> the<00:06:04.339> head

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
they're basically all the same the head

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.079 
they're basically all the same the head
goes<00:06:04.699> all<00:06:04.849> the<00:06:04.879> way<00:06:05.060> around<00:06:05.180> on<00:06:05.689> a<00:06:05.750> swivel<00:06:06.289> and

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:07.089 
goes all the way around on a swivel and

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:10.959 
goes all the way around on a swivel and
the<00:06:08.089> arms<00:06:08.779> do<00:06:09.229> go<00:06:09.589> all<00:06:09.770> the<00:06:09.889> way<00:06:09.919> around<00:06:10.009> and

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:10.969 
the arms do go all the way around and

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:15.850 
the arms do go all the way around and
they<00:06:11.659> do<00:06:11.719> go<00:06:11.960> out<00:06:12.169> and<00:06:12.560> in<00:06:13.569> the<00:06:14.569> elbows<00:06:15.289> do<00:06:15.529> band

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
they do go out and in the elbows do band

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.050 
they do go out and in the elbows do band
and<00:06:16.370> the<00:06:16.610> hands<00:06:17.330> do<00:06:17.569> not<00:06:17.870> are<00:06:18.259> articulate<00:06:19.069> and

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060 
and the hands do not are articulate and

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.800 
and the hands do not are articulate and
the<00:06:20.360> hands<00:06:20.719> are<00:06:20.810> all<00:06:20.960> our<00:06:22.029> catcher<00:06:23.029> admits<00:06:23.419> it

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810 
the hands are all our catcher admits it

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.360 
the hands are all our catcher admits it
seems<00:06:24.139> like<00:06:24.319> there<00:06:24.560> are<00:06:24.589> seem<00:06:25.189> to<00:06:25.279> be

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
seems like there are seem to be

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.820 
seems like there are seem to be
oversized<00:06:25.789> compared<00:06:26.419> to<00:06:26.629> the<00:06:27.439> rest<00:06:27.620> of<00:06:27.740> the

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
oversized compared to the rest of the

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.550 
oversized compared to the rest of the
body<00:06:28.120> there's<00:06:29.120> no<00:06:29.270> torso<00:06:29.629> articulation<00:06:30.409> but

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 
body there's no torso articulation but

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.379 
body there's no torso articulation but
there<00:06:30.740> is<00:06:30.919> waste<00:06:31.219> articulation<00:06:32.029> all<00:06:32.149> the<00:06:32.270> way

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:32.389 
there is waste articulation all the way

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:35.019 
there is waste articulation all the way
around<00:06:32.509> and<00:06:33.500> the<00:06:33.919> legs<00:06:34.129> are<00:06:34.310> on<00:06:34.459> a<00:06:34.490> tee<00:06:34.729> crotch

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:35.029 
around and the legs are on a tee crotch

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:38.350 
around and the legs are on a tee crotch
so<00:06:35.360> they<00:06:35.509> go<00:06:35.690> up<00:06:36.190> down<00:06:37.190> and<00:06:37.789> they<00:06:37.940> don't<00:06:38.120> go

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 
so they go up down and they don't go

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.170 
so they go up down and they don't go
back<00:06:38.569> and<00:06:38.810> they<00:06:38.870> don't

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
back and they don't

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.430 
back and they don't
go<00:06:39.240> out<00:06:39.830> view<00:06:40.850> knees<00:06:41.850> do<00:06:42.270> bend<00:06:42.600> that<00:06:42.900> one<00:06:43.110> joint

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 
go out view knees do bend that one joint

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.320 
go out view knees do bend that one joint
at<00:06:43.530> the<00:06:43.650> knees<00:06:43.860> and<00:06:44.250> there's<00:06:44.460> no<00:06:44.759> articulation

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.330 
at the knees and there's no articulation

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.430 
at the knees and there's no articulation
that<00:06:45.630> the<00:06:45.720> ankles<00:06:46.139> or<00:06:46.289> feet<00:06:47.060> so<00:06:48.060> overall<00:06:48.720> I

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 
that the ankles or feet so overall I

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.240 
that the ankles or feet so overall I
like<00:06:50.100> this<00:06:50.880> figure<00:06:51.330> said<00:06:51.600> mainly<00:06:51.990> because

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.250 
like this figure said mainly because

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.100 
like this figure said mainly because
it's<00:06:53.250> not<00:06:53.699> very<00:06:54.030> often<00:06:54.360> that<00:06:54.600> you<00:06:54.750> actually

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.110 
it's not very often that you actually

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:59.900 
it's not very often that you actually
get<00:06:55.470> figures<00:06:56.120> from<00:06:57.120> the<00:06:57.210> flash<00:06:57.810> rogues<00:06:58.910> so

00:06:59.900 --> 00:06:59.910 
get figures from the flash rogues so

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.300 
get figures from the flash rogues so
this<00:07:00.780> is<00:07:00.930> one<00:07:01.080> of<00:07:01.110> those<00:07:01.259> rare<00:07:01.320> opportunities

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.310 
this is one of those rare opportunities

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.600 
this is one of those rare opportunities
to<00:07:02.580> get<00:07:02.789> to<00:07:03.060> and<00:07:03.419> a<00:07:04.229> set<00:07:04.590> so<00:07:04.949> I<00:07:04.979> think<00:07:05.310> that's

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:05.610 
to get to and a set so I think that's

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.420 
to get to and a set so I think that's
kind<00:07:05.850> of<00:07:05.910> neat<00:07:06.120> and<00:07:06.500> also<00:07:07.500> to<00:07:07.560> be<00:07:07.770> able<00:07:07.919> to<00:07:08.250> get

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.430 
kind of neat and also to be able to get

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.689 
kind of neat and also to be able to get
a<00:07:08.910> Jay<00:07:09.210> Garrick<00:07:09.600> flash<00:07:09.930> figure<00:07:10.620> as<00:07:10.770> well<00:07:11.009> and<00:07:11.460> I

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:11.699 
a Jay Garrick flash figure as well and I

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:15.350 
a Jay Garrick flash figure as well and I
think<00:07:11.729> this<00:07:12.090> set<00:07:12.419> also<00:07:12.570> came<00:07:13.050> with<00:07:14.120> a<00:07:15.120> wally

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 
think this set also came with a wally

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.110 
think this set also came with a wally
west<00:07:15.630> flash<00:07:16.020> instead<00:07:16.530> of<00:07:16.680> a<00:07:16.889> jay<00:07:17.759> garrick

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 
west flash instead of a jay garrick

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.909 
west flash instead of a jay garrick
flash<00:07:18.419> as<00:07:18.630> well<00:07:18.840> but<00:07:19.020> i<00:07:19.080> didn't<00:07:19.410> see<00:07:19.530> that<00:07:19.560> a

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 
flash as well but i didn't see that a

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:23.089 
flash as well but i didn't see that a
big<00:07:20.880> lots<00:07:21.289> but<00:07:22.289> if<00:07:22.440> you're<00:07:22.590> a<00:07:22.620> fan<00:07:22.860> of<00:07:22.889> the

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:23.099 
big lots but if you're a fan of the

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:27.830 
big lots but if you're a fan of the
flash<00:07:24.229> mythos<00:07:25.699> i'd<00:07:26.699> recommend<00:07:27.330> that<00:07:27.479> picking
