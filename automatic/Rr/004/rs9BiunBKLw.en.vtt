 application that is for the little ones of 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.160

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.800
 that the kids can see drawings to the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.060

 super simple me at least my daughter 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.460
 -that since I was a year old and little 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.850

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.620
 perfectly and it has happened well enough 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.120

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.530
 I really recommend it to you because it is 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.420

 the chapter that is the chapters we 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.470
 they are updating periodically so 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.940
 more or less we will have the last 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.070
 chapters that have aired on television 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.170
 and it is an application for children 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.119

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.890
 well the next tab is learn 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.470
 english ok here we are going to have the 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.450
 same chapters almost almost the same 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.610
 series are not all ok but it's in 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.569
 most the same series but in the 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.520
 forgiveness language but in English language it is worth 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.959
 well, the children are practicing a 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.420
 little bit since English 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.040
 that makes us really need the truth 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.810
 what else do we have here next 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.690
 eyelash is the one worth it in this 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.370
 tab the children will be able to color 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.630
 about the drawings that you like the most 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.400
 example they want to paint on the pepa 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.700
 pig then be made here to pepa peak 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.110
 you have a lot of topics worth choosing the 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.819
 that you want, I'm going to choose the first one 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.980
 try it and here we can doing 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.780
 pinch-to-zoom so you can see it 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.830
 see if it looks good 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.420
 can you do zoomed to zoom or 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.280
 reduce and paint in more detail 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.160
 zones that you want we have all these 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.260
 colors we can erase I'm going to erase this 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.110
 that I have already painted here the brush is 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.209
 a little bit small so I'm going to catch 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.069
 with the cord brush vale we will choose 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.690
 the eraser so I erase it better 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.630
 He said for example the red color we're going 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.640
 to paint here the moflete vale is a 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.890
 small test so you can see it 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.550
 I am very skillful painting as you see and 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.550
 less on the iphone 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.610
 well I guess you have seen it is painted 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.120
 so if you want to paint for example 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.860
 orange color the snout 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.520
 and I do not want to go out 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.170
 ok we painted it like that 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.050
 is an application that is very good that 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.510
 more good things when the children have 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.580
 done the artwork we can send it 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.300
 by mail from here we can face 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:39.580
 by mail we can send it on facebook 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.580
 and nothing can come out 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.190
 and good as you can see is an application that 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.800
 can keep a little bit at least 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.300
 the entertaining children that we have the most 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.950
 the camera option is worth here we can 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.110
 choose a photo from the album or we can 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.180
 Take a photo instantly by choosing a 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:58.160
 skin that will put us on screen we will 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.160
 choose the pepa peak so you can see it 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.860
 As you can see we put here to george and 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:07.709
 app on screen is worth it and we do 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.900
 the photo and we can share it by email 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.519
 by facebook it seems to me that I am also going to 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.340
 do the test to check it 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:17.970
 let's see if I do the photo what options 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.930
 leave me then let me share it send 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.419
 to clans 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.860
 change clans send to the contest good 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.860
 simply send by email voucher 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.150
 what more options do we have here 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.169
 and it's basically the parents area 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.150
 it is the configuration zone 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.039
 here we have four themes worth is that at 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.349
 The only thing he does is change the 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:44.960
 color of the background and the menu bar 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:46.849
 we have the blue we have the pink we have 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.380
 the orange we have the green I leave it 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.699
 in blue which is the one I like the most good 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.620
 how have you heard before when we 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.750
 We put in some chapter in some 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.759
 series of drawings appears a sound worth 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.889
 to remove those sounds we do 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:00.770
 from here it's worth it if it's a bit annoying and 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.750
 so we can remove it 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.940
 is a little fucked up going to forgive me 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.550
 expression but if we have the sounds 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.710
 sometimes sounds made a sound like 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.199
 a glass that broke and clear you leave 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.150
 your son or daughter with the iphone in the 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:16.250
 couch quietly playing with this 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.289
 application and the goal and blow sound the 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.000
 glass breaking and frightens you 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:21.470
 little better what you have in mind not 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.720
 you're scared that nothing happens 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.659
 just a sound from the application and 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.069
 nothing else this is all I hope this 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.659
 application serves us above all I hope 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:31.370
 that you like that you like your 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:34.400
 children our nephews grandchildren what 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.449
 be and nothing if you liked the video
