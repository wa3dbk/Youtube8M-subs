00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.740
 hello to all of us came to the test 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.780
 blackberry z30 shopping one flank . 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.990
 runes and we traditionally start marks about 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.660
 unpacking such an interesting box 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.859
 here everything is in non-russian language that is all 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.210
 languages ​​other than Russian 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.520
 which is not surprising officially there is not 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.230
 the machine is supplied however the system itself 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.000
 has Russian language and works very 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.920
 I wonder why I wanted 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.120
 show the first inclusion because 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.160
 here everything is very unusual so to speak 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.930
 the parade has been dropped already to this film 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.260
 if I didn't shoot that is specifically 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.530
 to show everything here we see this 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.719
 scoop here is 5 with something screen now i 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.719
 I’ll say for sure when I’ll take it off and show 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.469
 we remove the cover to remove it 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.570
 the program will have to be carried out a little bit 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.850
 the lid is very tight so you need a very 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.140
 strongly or pull over and we shoot 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.660
 see what to wear a five-inch screen 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.630
 almost 3000 milliamp battery 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.600
 model formation here we have 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.500
 SIM card slot is just bigger 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.460
 there is nothing special here and now we are 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:21.270
 we put on 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:23.280
 body glue who hello it here 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.619
 see the volume key two microphones 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:33.329
 apparently here we have port microusb 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.630
 and requests micro with dima focuses 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.560
 So 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:45.729
 top of the headphone is not only power 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:49.450
 Press the power button simultaneously remove 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.450
 from the screen film 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.390
 download is not fast 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.200
 Now everything is from a strip while she 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.930
 impressions can be said 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.080
 initially the heavy stuff back 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.760
 plastic interesting that is, he is not so 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.560
 soft touch or just very soft and 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.390
 It looks like a two-layer, that is, it is on top 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.420
 transparent and under it such a drawing 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:26.319
 interesting under carbon well, naturally 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:28.180
 saw logo blackberry turned screen 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:32.500
 The system boot screen will appear 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:35.200
 10 and now we will see the starter 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.170
 screen yes you can take the language choose 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.910
 Russian is here offered to us already 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.850
 familiarize acquaintance or rather 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.410
 a little system hold left 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.980
 connection over the mobile network snoopy 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.290
 sim cards let us connect to 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.620
 wifi 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.680
 this is required first by first setting 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.330
 the first connection is required 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.829
 connect connects checked 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.829
 update immediately first thing 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.010
 but before that, first we get for 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.010
 conclude an agreement 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.040
 not very fast everything happens 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:32.970
 we finally booted let's 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:35.690
 choose for example our country here too 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.690
 there are lists 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.829
 invited to fight and 1 or 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.829
 create it you can do it later 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:04:00.379
 diagnostics it is more important to include 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:04:02.730
 moving update for region put 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:06.739
 show all checks let's show 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:10.379
 what else do we have here we see 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:13.950
 connection sync cable 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:15.030
 charger charger here is not European 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.479
 well either 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:22.320
 Asian he or he more random than 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:23.849
 and Kay is also possible for England 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.210
 my such 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:29.729
 such meets its bribe apparatus in 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.699
 general triangular requires an adapter for 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.949
 his charger is small that is 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:35.460
 capacity of small only 8 of every 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.710
 custody 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.590
 therefore it is better to use ironically 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.590
 Now more powerful than we would like not naushnichki 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:47.160
 paid with presents then check how 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:54.449
 they sound great with us 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:58.110
 documentation is also a small volume of various 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:00.860
 warranty card designs all 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.860
 and so on 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:09.530
 what we have here is an update by 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.840
 available but we can do it later 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:16.930
 otherwise it will take a long time 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.930
 additional update 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.990
 Now such an assistant turns on 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:26.949
 allows us to understand how to manage 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.949
 by device 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.000
 but it looks like a training mode 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.040
 very interesting , everything is done intuitively 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.300
 principle if you become familiar with 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:05.920
 then please guide 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:08.160
 no difficulties will arise later 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.160
 by this 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:18.770
 everything is intelligible everything is clear everything is in Russian 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.770
 everything is very bright 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.430
 had the experience of dating with barbie cut 10 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.960
 that's where these settings are very strong 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.020
 braked this lead Dima system 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.430
 all the same I was already brought to mind 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.250
 it remains to get to know her and 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.860
 tell you about all the intricacies 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:43.930
 ask questions ask what 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.669
 Interested be sure to tell and 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:49.810
 show well and finally so interesting 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:52.090
 such a thing from this state to 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:57.370
 see some things you can do 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:07:01.630
 just like that and it works again 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:03.990
 clearly not always but cool thing yet 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.990
 once
