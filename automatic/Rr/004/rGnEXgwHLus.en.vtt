00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello to all quiet and welcome guys 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.220
 another video the top five where I do 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.849
 the English city because you speak English 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.920
 a really cool and important thing 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.170
 I do this for the simple fact that 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.270
 I love the commercials as I speak 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.279
 simply in English language but 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.650
 back to serious things welcome to 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.990
 another top five here on the polygon channel 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.359
 of the zeta walkthrough where we can 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.439
 see a headphone if a headphone is in the headphones 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.369
 a headphones a pair of headphones 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.200
 annoying that I always carry 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.420
 behind 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.030
 Today we are here because we will stay here 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.930
 with two top five because I wrote others 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.760
 two new top five to bring you then 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.660
 where then between a secret thing 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.789
 here are the balls there are the leaks 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.410
 eagle for the two top five so me 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.059
 you will see dressed differently both in 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.000
 this one in the next outlet instead 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.820
 fact that I will make two in a row and notice 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.559
 let's talk about it right away with i 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.409
 best games g.br 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.580
 the top five of the five best games 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.580
 by dr 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.720
 in fifth place we find skyrim mi 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.049
 it seemed obvious and logical to put 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.119
 skyrim as a very, very nice game 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.570
 as gdr because obviously I would have put it 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.159
 it is not in the first positions because yes me 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.979
 liked it I loved it 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.700
 in fact work put in the top five gods 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.380
 best games of 2012 but it's not me 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.810
 had taken so much as a gdr game 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.200
 in short, however, it deserves the position that 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.470
 then he has the number 4 the witcher 2 sebini 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.509
 he hasn't played where I put this is 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.159
 that I also want to buy it because 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.070
 it looks pretty nice to me as a game 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.780
 I can absolutely say that based on 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.740
 what I saw reviews of the video 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.530
 gameplay 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.770
 it's really a good game maybe it wo n't be 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.689
 just the maximum playability or 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.670
 maybe even some fun 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.039
 people don't consider it that or 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.020
 consider it as a sky ring 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.370
 wrong in my opinion still remains 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.170
 beautiful game that deserves 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.870
 very much at position 4 of this top 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.450
 five is a simple thing 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.530
 start his position number 3 and kingdom 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:26.489
 kingdom of amalur reckoning if you 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.610
 put together skyrim with a view 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.290
 only in the third person a graphic one 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.510
 little bit more ska cardboard you will have 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.690
 kingdom of amalur reckoning obviously 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.910
 I ca n't compare it with a bar 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.799
 because I don't know Italian well enough to how much 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.549
 it seems I prefer English to Italian 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:47.040
 apparently it was one of the best 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.569
 games that I really enjoyed 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.680
 to buy I bought it on origin 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.120
 however we say that they have all been worth 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.950
 those 10 euros I spent because it was 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.569
 also on offer therefore deserves 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.910
 very much like a place for graphics 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.230
 playability and all because it is 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.510
 It was really a very nice thing 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.459
 as a game also some special skills 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.470
 they really take so much 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.459
 therefore it deserves the position also 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:16.049
 this that at position number 2 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:20.010
 mass effect 3 after playing for 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:23.040
 about 25 hours after it is finished 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.600
 restarted and finished and trying to 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.180
 complete a little all the missions I can 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.010
 say that it was really one of the 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.829
 best gdr games I ever have 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.230
 tried though it's full of bugs 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.609
 in textures and everything because of them 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.400
 I noticed I saw them I wanted to film them 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:40.079
 also but it is not that I can always stay there 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.750
 with fax waiting for a bug because 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.400
 it would be a stupid thing to deserve 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.590
 really this second place because it is 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.880
 really a beautiful game and who doesn't 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.410
 has ever played there must buy 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.519
 certainly the whole complete series 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.769
 because I made the mistake of 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:56.340
 start with the three and therefore not having 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.959
 taken the previous chapters is not 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.090
 that he understood that much 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:03.690
 at the beginning, however, I will also buy chapters 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.850
 previous and I 'll see what I 'll see 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.550
 I got lost in this last chapter 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.070
 of the previous ones and to the position 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:14.330
 number 1 as a title that does not exist 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:18.180
 you would never expect we have a game that is 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:22.230
 old looks pretty lousy 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.930
 but this is not at least for me too 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.300
 full of bugs and glitches and various crap one 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:32.400
 horrible graphics we're talking about what 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:37.740
 ben payer masquerade bloodlines this 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:40.130
 lovisi game I saw him real faces hello 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.590
 I saw it some time ago on steam and I thought 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:46.980
 a gbr game with werewolves vampires 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:51.420
 bullshit different bullshit will be worth it 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:53.670
 if indeed after having tried it and also 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.750
 great not having of course 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:05:00.450
 played a lot because I'm still there 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:04.650
 to try it a little bit to see what 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:06.270
 hides this title from me 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.950
 absolutely tell you who does not have it 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.180
 if he absolutely must or buy or 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.680
 download somehow because it is 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.390
 really a fun thing also 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.000
 so guys this was mine 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.430
 personal top five of the five best 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.520
 gdr games if you know any better 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.750
 or you have your own too 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.370
 opinion regarding these games 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.610
 write it in the comments because to me 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:30.230
 would really really like to know 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:32.220
 so for now it's all a teo greeting 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.160
 goodbye to the next to fail that the 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:40.550
 I'll record right now why I have to 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.550
 force to say goodbye and bye bye
