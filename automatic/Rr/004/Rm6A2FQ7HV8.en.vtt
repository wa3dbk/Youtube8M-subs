00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.540
 the European road safety agency 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.430
 Euroncap known and recognized for its 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.010
 crash test has released the 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.050
 results of his last trials and one 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.300
 of the models evaluated was the Mercedes 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.579
 benz sl that just came to the 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.579
 Argentina and we approve here between this 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.320
 the qualification obtained was one of the 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.750
 higher demonstrating a high level 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.270
 of protection to the occupants in case of 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.910
 frontal impact as well as impacts 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.860
 laterals measured even in the test 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.050
 of impact against a post has a 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.850
 deformation- efficient body 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.739
 the seven airbags avoid greater 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.800
 injuries both the front occupants 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.360
 like the assholes either adults or 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.360
 children in their corresponding chairs 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.790
 two other models were evaluated in the 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.410
 last round of tests and we are interested 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.410
 especially because they will reach the 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.450
 argentina 1 is the progress 2008 the 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.550
 little cross of war that got 5 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.950
 stars is to say the maximum 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.140
 rating that was also achieved 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.270
 for the new generation of the ship but 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.550
 which is the first time that a product of 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.220
 this american brand gets the maximum 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.590
 award obtained especially by the 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.960
 protection to the occupants but it is not 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.880
 however among the best in the 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.030
 pedestrian protection in case of 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.030
 run over 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.619
 these three models were also shown 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.290
 efficient in dynamic tests in 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.549
 which the euroncap evaluates 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:41.090
 mainly the performance of control 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:44.240
 of stability known as sp 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.000
 sc this evaluation was done between 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.280
 others with the new toyota corolla that has 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.280
 demonstrated great dynamic solvency 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.090
 although the test was not done with the 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.460
 Brazilian production model that 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.229
 will arrive next year to Argentina 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.420
 it serves as a reference because it equates 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.420
 this important safety device 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.530
 another one of the last essays that 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.629
 incorporates banking euro to its 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.370
 activities is the evaluation of 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.800
 systems that can avoid shocks 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.650
 as the city safety of volvo that 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.510
 we evaluated recently at the 40 no 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.730
 there are many manufacturers that install 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.830
 these systems in their products that of 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.470
 be equipped in all versions according to 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.530
 euro in cap could reduce to almost 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.010
 30% the accident rate in the 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.010
 European streets 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.569
 the most efficient in terms of use 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:43.329
 in town they were the mercedes benz class 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.090
 the volvo of 40 and the new mitsubishi 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.280
 outlander avoiding the impact until 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.200
 speeds of 50 kilometers per hour 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.780
 that's because its laser sensors 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.639
 they detect the other vehicle and brake the 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.639
 auto autonomously 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:03:00.730
 For its part, the fiat 500 l ford focus 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:04.169
 and the volvo xc60 got in this 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.169
 try an average grade 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.170
 the performance test in conditions 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.150
 is done at speeds of 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.160
 up to 80 kilometers per hour 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.380
 approaching a slow vehicle that 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.570
 It circulates at 20 kilometers per hour 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.180
 again the volvo and the mercedes were 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.070
 the most efficient avoiding the accident 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.170
 although this time is a way the folk bag 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.330
 in new generation golf is to say the 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.710
 seventh that also has an anti radar 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.710
 collision in some versions 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.480
 The important thing about these tests is that 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.730
 the automakers will be seen 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.430
 motivated to incorporate these systems 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.560
 of autonomous braking in a more massive way 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.450
 they do not usually have them for the moment 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.940
 in mind but in the future they will be 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.980
 remembered as the first step towards 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.980
 long road of zero accident
