that<00:03:40.660> you<00:03:40.720> want<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:40.989> go<00:03:41.109> to<00:03:41.169> like<00:03:41.440> all<00:03:41.650> from<00:03:41.799> the

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
that you want to go to like all from the

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.650 
that you want to go to like all from the
background<00:03:42.010> when<00:03:42.400> your<00:03:42.549> outlets<00:03:43.389> sitting

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
background when your outlets sitting

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.119

so again probably towards the end of
this<00:03:48.750> because<00:03:48.900> there's<00:03:49.290> going<00:03:49.379> to<00:03:49.439> be<00:03:49.500> like<00:03:49.650> a

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
this because there's going to be like a

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.619 
this because there's going to be like a
picture<00:03:50.189> that<00:03:50.370> pops<00:03:50.610> up<00:03:50.879> comparing<00:03:51.420> the
