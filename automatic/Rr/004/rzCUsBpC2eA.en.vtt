in<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.230> 50s<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:26.200> what<00:01:26.410> was<00:01:26.530> once<00:01:26.800> the<00:01:27.160> special

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
in the 50s so what was once the special

in the 50s so what was once the special
little<00:01:27.790> side<00:01:28.210> treat<00:01:28.630> now<00:01:29.230> is<00:01:29.500> the<00:01:29.650> main<00:01:29.860> and

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
little side treat now is the main and

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.460 
little side treat now is the main and
much<00:01:30.340> more<00:01:30.550> regular<00:01:30.970> so<00:01:31.690> really<00:01:31.960> any<00:01:32.170> of<00:01:32.380> these

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
much more regular so really any of these

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.600 
much more regular so really any of these
angles<00:01:32.920> should<00:01:33.100> have<00:01:33.220> been<00:01:33.310> enough<00:01:33.490> to

angles should have been enough to

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
tucking into a big old steak so why was

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.870 
tucking into a big old steak so why was
I<00:01:41.740> stalling<00:01:42.310> I<00:01:43.530> realized<00:01:44.530> that<00:01:44.920> what<00:01:45.670> I<00:01:45.700> was

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
I stalling I realized that what I was

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.540 
I stalling I realized that what I was
being<00:01:46.000> pitched<00:01:46.300> was<00:01:46.480> a<00:01:46.510> binary<00:01:46.840> solution<00:01:47.650> it

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
being pitched was a binary solution it

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.850 
being pitched was a binary solution it
was<00:01:48.670> either<00:01:48.880> you're<00:01:49.540> a<00:01:49.570> meat-eater<00:01:49.990> or<00:01:50.290> you're

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
was either you're a meat-eater or you're

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.390 
was either you're a meat-eater or you're
a<00:01:50.890> vegetarian<00:01:51.610> and<00:01:52.450> I<00:01:53.350> guess<00:01:53.560> I<00:01:53.920> just<00:01:54.190> wasn't

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
a vegetarian and I guess I just wasn't

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.760 
a vegetarian and I guess I just wasn't
quite<00:01:54.670> ready

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
quite ready

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.750 
quite ready
imagine<00:01:56.770> your<00:01:57.760> last<00:01:58.000> hamburger

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.510 

so<00:02:03.760> my<00:02:03.880> common<00:02:04.240> sense<00:02:04.740> my<00:02:05.740> good<00:02:05.950> intentions

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
so my common sense my good intentions

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.760 
so my common sense my good intentions
whoops

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
whoops

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.670 
whoops
we're<00:02:08.770> in<00:02:08.830> conflict<00:02:09.340> with<00:02:09.460> my<00:02:09.580> taste<00:02:09.820> buds<00:02:10.150> and

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
we're in conflict with my taste buds and

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.460 
we're in conflict with my taste buds and
I'd<00:02:11.680> commit<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.160> doing<00:02:12.310> it<00:02:12.520> later<00:02:13.240> and<00:02:13.540> not

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
I'd commit to doing it later and not

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.460 
I'd commit to doing it later and not
surprisingly<00:02:15.160> later<00:02:15.880> never<00:02:16.150> came<00:02:16.470> sound

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
surprisingly later never came sound

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.260 
surprisingly later never came sound
familiar<00:02:17.620> so<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:20.260> wondered<00:02:20.970> might<00:02:21.970> there<00:02:22.120> be<00:02:22.150> a

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
familiar so I wondered might there be a

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.620 
familiar so I wondered might there be a
third<00:02:22.360> solution<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.970> I<00:02:25.030> thought<00:02:25.270> about<00:02:25.420> it

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
third solution and I thought about it

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.660 
third solution and I thought about it
and<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:26.020> came<00:02:26.080> up<00:02:26.320> with<00:02:26.500> one<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:26.890> I've<00:02:27.580> been
