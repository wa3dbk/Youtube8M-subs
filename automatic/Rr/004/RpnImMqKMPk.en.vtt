I'll<00:00:40.440> get<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:40.890> but<00:00:41.219> first<00:00:41.940> I'd<00:00:42.210> like<00:00:42.239> to

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
I'll get to that but first I'd like to

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.880 
I'll get to that but first I'd like to
talk<00:00:42.600> about<00:00:42.660> its<00:00:42.960> good<00:00:43.140> points<00:00:43.500> especially

all the original Sonic the Hedgehog
differed<00:00:48.059> from<00:00:48.090> other<00:00:48.329> games<00:00:48.660> with<00:00:48.930> mad<00:00:49.170> speed

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
differed from other games with mad speed

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.650 
differed from other games with mad speed
and<00:00:49.860> dynamic<00:00:50.280> gameplay<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.180> principle

the<00:00:51.870> speed<00:00:52.110> aspect<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.739> still<00:00:52.949> here<00:00:53.219> here<00:00:53.910> you

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
the speed aspect is still here here you

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.970 
the speed aspect is still here here you
have<00:00:54.149> races<00:00:54.600> where<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.930> simply<00:00:55.140> drive<00:00:55.559> and

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
have races where you simply drive and

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.959 
have races where you simply drive and
that's<00:00:56.489> it

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
that's it

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.389 
that's it
there's<00:00:57.480> your<00:00:57.690> speed<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:57.960> guess<00:00:58.350> Plus<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
there's your speed I guess Plus the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.040 
there's your speed I guess Plus the
races<00:00:59.730> aren't<00:00:59.879> only<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.300> ground<00:01:00.539> your

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
races aren't only on the ground your

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.869 
races aren't only on the ground your
vehicle<00:01:01.379> transforms<00:01:02.010> into<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.280> boat<00:01:02.550> or<00:01:02.850> a

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
vehicle transforms into a boat or a

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.880 
vehicle transforms into a boat or a
plane<00:01:03.000> when<00:01:03.480> necessary<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.350> adds<00:01:04.619> some

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
plane when necessary and that adds some

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.460 
plane when necessary and that adds some
speed<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.400> recklessness<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:06.090> suppose<00:01:06.470> also

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
speed and recklessness I suppose also

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.260 
speed and recklessness I suppose also
there's<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> thing<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.070> like<00:01:08.220> revolt<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.909> at

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
there's the thing we like revolt for at

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.940 
there's the thing we like revolt for at
least<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.540> first<00:01:09.750> part<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.530> road<00:01:10.710> there

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
least the first part on the road there

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.560 
least the first part on the road there
are<00:01:11.040> bonuses<00:01:11.520> some<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.119> which<00:01:12.270> lets<00:01:12.479> you

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
are bonuses some of which lets you

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.390 
are bonuses some of which lets you
attack<00:01:12.869> rivals<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.530> slow<00:01:13.710> them<00:01:13.890> down<00:01:13.920> and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
attack rivals to slow them down and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.940 
attack rivals to slow them down and
bypass<00:01:14.729> them<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.659> now<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.200> good<00:01:16.439> comes<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.860> an

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
bypass them and now the good comes to an

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.700 
bypass them and now the good comes to an
end<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.400> crappiness<00:01:18.060> begins<00:01:18.479> I'll<00:01:19.350> start

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
end and the crappiness begins I'll start

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.230 
end and the crappiness begins I'll start
with<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.890> part<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.250> offends<00:01:20.610> me<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> most

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
with the part that offends me the most

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.390 
with the part that offends me the most
as<00:01:21.600> well<00:01:21.840> as<00:01:21.960> many<00:01:22.170> others<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
as well as many others that is the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
as well as many others that is the
donation<00:01:24.030> aspect<00:01:24.630> which<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.400> absolutely

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
donation aspect which is absolutely

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.539 
donation aspect which is absolutely
ridiculous<00:01:27.420> if<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.439> was<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.590> free<00:01:28.920> game<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.189> might

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
ridiculous if it was a free game I might

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.520 
ridiculous if it was a free game I might
be<00:01:29.700> more<00:01:29.880> lenient<00:01:30.090> but<00:01:30.600> after<00:01:30.900> all<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.320> game

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
be more lenient but after all the game

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.630
