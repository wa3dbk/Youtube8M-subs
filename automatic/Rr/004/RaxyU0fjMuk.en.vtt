00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.430
 even at christmas girls it is possible to do 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.220
 a great figure serving ultra-light dishes 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.590
 with few calories but amazing taste 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.630
 and my roast pork with le 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.940
 slices of orange and with mustard 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.710
 constitutes concrete proof of why 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.690
 the beauty of roasts is not just the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.730
 simple preparation like never before 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.279
 but the result they can produce 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.050
 that they manage to create and I made enough 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.590
 very few tricks to get 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.890
 dishes from patricia to prepare this 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.950
 Roast pork is needed 500 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.579
 grams of pork 150 milliliters 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.030
 of red wine 150 milliliters of juice 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.760
 orange then about 20 grams of sugar 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.910
 some anise seeds 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.550
 if you like salt pepper as required 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.910
 to serve we again 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.160
 some anise seeds a couple of oranges 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.750
 preferably untreated and 150 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.640
 grams of a broken state 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.040
 we prepare this roast completely 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.350
 No added fat so no oil 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.990
 and without butter preparation is a lot 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.940
 simple we took a casserole 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.170
 with dimensions approximately equal to those 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.119
 of our piece of pork now 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.259
 we warmed it up a lot we can 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.659
 brown the rock meat la 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.420
 always keeping a sustained flame e 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.159
 being careful not to puncture the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:36.270
 so I also got meat from 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:39.600
 a specific ladle you see or browned 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.429
 perfectly my piece of meat from 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.610
 all sides 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:48.420
 now what we do we add a little 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.950
 of brown sugar and good also with 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.270
 honey, however, in this case 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.270
 I prefer then the brown sugar 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:03.259
 we have caramelized it a little bit 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:09.770
 little by little and now we find out with wine 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:09.770
 red and with orange juice 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.760
 let's resume quickly 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:24.470
 boil if you like you can 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.120
 also add anise seeds per 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.500
 giving a little something special is fine 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.900
 even those very fennel 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.960
 particular and now we continue the 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.480
 baking however very sweet one 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.520
 time to see that the boil has resumed 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.740
 let's lower the fire let's proceed 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.630
 cook gently for about two hours 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.310
 at the end of the two hours 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.350
 we are going to salt and pepper in the meantime 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.960
 we can also grate over a little 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.700
 then of orange peel 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.340
 clearly use orange trees 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.120
 therefore statistically mounts of the 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.130
 organic oranges if during the two hours 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.290
 you notice that the liquid evaporates 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.810
 you will not have to do too much other than 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.520
 maybe add some more wine or if 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.740
 you want to stay a little more on the light in the 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:14.450
 orange juice to thicken yours 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.670
 sauce once it is ready 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.920
 clearly today as you have 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.830
 seen before what needs to be done 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.080
 you need to add some rice starch 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.850
 or potato starch what you get 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.120
 like it better and now we prepare 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.310
 the orange cut live I do 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.660
 see how to prepare the orange you can 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.480
 clearly use the orange that 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.190
 you have grated the rind we take a 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.320
 knife preferably in ceramic for 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.320
 avoid altering active ingredients e 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.390
 let's cut it pretty deep 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.010
 but not too much here to avoid 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.010
 also remove the orange pulp 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.770
 once all the 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.100
 rind we can cut the orange 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.740
 thin thin slices and then serve 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.350
 alternating a slice of roast with one 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.760
 slice of orange another trick 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.730
 important is to cut 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.740
 the roast finely only when you are 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.530
 completely cool I recommend 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.420
 otherwise meat will crumble if 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.830
 you have the slicer even better this way 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.250
 you will be able to get slices 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.739
 thin and very regular 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.080
 in short, our toad slowly 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.540
 she is cooking while I already have it here 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.760
 prepared the dish ready then to 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.460
 center I also put some mustard 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.620
 cut into pieces and then with the sauce 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.630
 I made a short decorations 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.640
 fast and simple dish to prepare e 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.200
 also quite cheap to make a 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.200
 figurine of the environmental day
