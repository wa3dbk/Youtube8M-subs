00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:16.860
 ispo winter 2014 we are at the shoe stand 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.680
 with maximum pellizzari is a novelty 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.480
 absolute to serve almost 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.110
 revolutionary 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.590
 well surely f1 evo will be a product 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.739
 revolutionary because we have included a 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.800
 new mechanism in which we do not 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:37.170
 foresees the use of manual intervention 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.809
 to switch from ski mode to 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.070
 walk mode this definitely a 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.629
 revolution in the world of skiing 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.690
 mountaineering that will bring a lot of 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.999
 benefits for rinses seen on 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.890
 users we have seen that this 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:51.690
 system is also applied to shoes 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.940
 top of the race so this is not the case 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.199
 just one more comfort but also 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.239
 more effective in terms 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.059
 cronometrici 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.249
 certainly not just at the level of 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.550
 chronometer time but above all also 

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:09.230
 at the level of physical benefit as 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.790
 the fact of having to bend to go to 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.320
 move the lever to close the lever for 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.840
 passes by the passage from the mode 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.030
 wake to walk mode anyway 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.510
 involves a physical effort of the athletes 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.030
 that already are however subjected 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.210
 during the downhill climb activity 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.800
 so this also increases door of 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.620
 advantages also from the point of view 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.900
 physical and quite importantly 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.580
 and it is among other things one of the purposes for which 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.420
 we have come to develop this new one 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.280
 di di system we do not define more than 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.430
 closing but passing from mode 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.560
 wake from walk mode we can see 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.560
 what it consists of and how it works 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:56.350
 the boot practically during use 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.690
 always has the mobility of the cuff only 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:06.820
 when it is installed 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:07.570
 on the attachment there is the fixing on the 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.989
 shoes 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:15.370
 on the attack it automatically stops 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:20.100
 the cuff is already ready for the 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:23.910
 descent phase in the moment in which it is 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:27.760
 extracted the boot from the attack 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.590
 automatically the boot to the cuff 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.930
 free that allows you to switch to 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.930
 crazy touring mode
