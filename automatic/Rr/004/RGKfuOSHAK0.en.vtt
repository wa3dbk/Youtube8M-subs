 then but she was already a widow was already 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.480
 I was a widow and I was alone 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.340

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.510
 excited I hugged him said old the 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.739
 sir you see that someone says nothing 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.949
 We said that until death we 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.949
 separate 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:07.700
 We're going to be very nutritious and I'm going to 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.280
 be a step in a steamer this is a 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.080
 Very oriental steamer if I am 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.800
 doing in a wok I have boiling water 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:20.080
 and the anise I have some bamboo sticks and 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.080
 I put my bakur the effect 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.840
 let's put them I said this is a 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.250
 bamboo evaporate the people in the east not 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.830
 it's like the people of the West who 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.440
 we have to steamer that teapot 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.570
 that the pot for this that the pan 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.850
 so this is not most people 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.800
 nothing else has box because in the wok 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.229
 they do absolutely in everything like in this 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.170
 occasion I this time it sounds more 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.570
 putting boiling water a few sticks of 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.080
 bamboo 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.729
 and I put it now it has several floors that 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.890
 it's for cooking also different things 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.330
 at the same time 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.370
 but this occasion nothing wrong with our 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.720
 bamboo laps that forgiveness of recording 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.119
 where and here are we going to do 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.090
 put a layer of napa that is this 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.350
 lettuce if you do not have it does not have it 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.479
 this that surely does not have but is 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.910
 very economical and finds it in the 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.950
 oriental products stores 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.690
 I really buy the funny and 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.490
 I can also feel a thousand things being 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.560
 nothing else also with the wok you can 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.690
 put a pan thing to put a 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.640
 grate and put also this is father 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.260
 because bamboo is something natural 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.530
 it's natural as we all know and it's 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.370
 great cooking here and has two floors 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.370
 we go 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.390
 we are giving extra love here here 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.020
 you can also reheat any 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:54.550
 thing and I think that this part then 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:54.550
 Of course we are going to do 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.110
 criticisms the nails criticize me those of 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.670
 Zorita because it seemed like a lot 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.190
 to keep the art ones I never paint them 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.110
 and look at my dreams is to be very 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.120
 nice now be like betis this me 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.890
 like but in this part in confetti 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.390
 but hey, it's good to have the soldered 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.930
 put half of the heart shrimp and 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:18.370
 nothing else nothing else we will process up 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.370
 that is perfectly fine 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.700
 Y 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.470
 they have put us to see everything from the 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.230
 principle remember that this processor 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:32.910
 it's like everything 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:35.690
 if it is not right those of care will see 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.690
 it's so much 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.920
 everything is being processed perfectly 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.210
 the shrimp one is up here 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.210
 escaped dug 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:52.190
 Now let's add ginger rabito 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.740
 onion 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.290
 soy sauce to make the balls 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.330
 exactly 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.430
 and I'm going to put the rest of the shrimp 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.930
 so I pass it so that people see we're going 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.110
 to put terrestrial more and now nothing else 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.030
 to press I will press nothing else 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.730
 abivan malavé bm in the processor there is a 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.380
 there is a this one button that says press 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.870
 press is this 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:20.790
 I put it on, it puts you away 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:25.370
 Corridito if I pulse we press 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.370
 I have the opportunity that all 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.890
 process caps 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.480
 and this is the joke of using a 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.130
 processor a lot of people say is that a 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.320
 me the onion not the music in the 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.420
 processor many times we do not 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.280
 because we do not know how the 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.310
 appliances and we keep them then this 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.850
 it's a very rare thing forever 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.250
 they go outside the sink are very sharp 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:54.200
 things over we can lift myself up 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.360
 of course I already have the mixture made and 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.860
 I already have some made but I'm going to 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.530
 tell me that I went to the supermarket to buy 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.140

 to make sushi I did not want in morelos 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.510
 because cooking takes longer 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.910
 this is an arborio rice that this 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:14.260
 gadget and chubby we can see the
