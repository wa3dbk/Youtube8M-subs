00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.080 
been thought out by dietitians and
nutritionists<00:01:52.950> why<00:01:53.250> don't<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.490> decide<00:01:53.789> to<00:01:53.969> do

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
nutritionists why don't you decide to do

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.910 
nutritionists why don't you decide to do
this<00:01:54.240> study<00:01:54.539> well<00:01:55.439> one<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.680> things<00:01:55.799> we've

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
this study well one of the things we've

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.200 
this study well one of the things we've
started<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.340> something<00:01:56.579> called<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.789> smarter

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210

lunch remove Minh and a lot of people

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.800 
lunch remove Minh and a lot of people
believe<00:01:59.820> that<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.090> only<00:02:00.210> way<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.420> can<00:02:00.689> get

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
believe that the only way you can get

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.209 
believe that the only way you can get
kids<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.109> eat<00:02:01.170> healthy<00:02:01.469> school<00:02:01.710> lunches<00:02:02.009> is

kids to eat healthy school lunches is
the<00:02:02.430> make<00:02:02.729> up<00:02:02.939> well<00:02:03.570> we<00:02:04.140> find<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:05.549> can

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
the make up well we find that you can

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.520 
the make up well we find that you can
force<00:02:06.240> people<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.719> eat<00:02:06.899> things<00:02:07.049> but<00:02:07.439> they

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
force people to eat things but they

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.410 
force people to eat things but they
don't<00:02:07.619> have<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:08.039> it's<00:02:08.550> not<00:02:08.759> nutrition<00:02:09.179> until

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
don't have to it's not nutrition until

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.880 
don't have to it's not nutrition until
things<00:02:09.569> are<00:02:09.660> eating<00:02:09.869> we<00:02:10.259> find<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.679> whole

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
things are eating we find this a whole

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.670 
things are eating we find this a whole
lot<00:02:11.039> easier<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.750> simply<00:02:12.750> put<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.260> white<00:02:13.410> milk

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
lot easier to simply put the white milk

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.180 
lot easier to simply put the white milk
in<00:02:13.860> front<00:02:14.069> of

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
cooller that increases the number of

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.960 
cooller that increases the number of
kids<00:02:16.200> who<00:02:16.230> take<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:16.560> by<00:02:16.650> 30%<00:02:16.920> or<00:02:17.520> making<00:02:17.910> sure

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
kids who take it by 30% or making sure

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.400 
kids who take it by 30% or making sure
at<00:02:18.090> least<00:02:18.210> half<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.450> coolers<00:02:18.960> white<00:02:19.170> milk

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
at least half the coolers white milk

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.800 
at least half the coolers white milk
that<00:02:20.130> also<00:02:20.400> increases<00:02:20.790> how<00:02:21.060> many<00:02:21.210> how<00:02:21.660> much

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
that also increases how many how much

that also increases how many how much
the<00:02:21.900> kids<00:02:22.080> take<00:02:22.320> there's<00:02:22.800> a<00:02:22.890> lot<00:02:23.040> easier

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
the kids take there's a lot easier

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.450 
the kids take there's a lot easier

mindless eating why we eat more than we

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.940 
mindless eating why we eat more than we
think<00:02:36.870> you've<00:02:37.140> been<00:02:37.230> called<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.590> Sherlock

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
think you've been called the Sherlock

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.410 
think you've been called the Sherlock
Holmes<00:02:39.200> so<00:02:40.200> tell<00:02:40.410> us<00:02:40.440> your<00:02:40.740> insight<00:02:41.190> into<00:02:41.460> into

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
Holmes so tell us your insight into into

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.330 
Holmes so tell us your insight into into
nutrition<00:02:42.780> here<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:43.650> one<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.070> things<00:02:44.220> we

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
nutrition here so one of the things we

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.830 
nutrition here so one of the things we
find<00:02:44.520> is<00:02:44.610> that<00:02:44.640> almost<00:02:45.120> all<00:02:45.300> decisions<00:02:45.810> that

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
find is that almost all decisions that

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.540 
find is that almost all decisions that
kids<00:02:46.110> make<00:02:46.290> at<00:02:46.410> school<00:02:46.590> legends<00:02:46.920> are<00:02:47.340> pretty

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
kids make at school legends are pretty

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.620 
kids make at school legends are pretty
mindless<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:48.150> mean<00:02:48.270> they're<00:02:48.480> basically

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
mindless I mean they're basically

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.300 
mindless I mean they're basically
they're<00:02:49.050> they<00:02:49.200> have<00:02:49.230> fun<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.710> their<00:02:49.860> friends

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
they're they have fun of their friends

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.490 
they're they have fun of their friends
and<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:50.580> we<00:02:51.150> find<00:02:51.450> with<00:02:51.660> fruit<00:02:51.960> that's<00:02:52.260> simply

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
and so we find with fruit that's simply

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.500 
and so we find with fruit that's simply
putting<00:02:53.070> fruit<00:02:53.340> in<00:02:53.490> a<00:02:53.580> bowl<00:02:53.790> next<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.240> a<00:02:54.300> cash

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
putting fruit in a bowl next to a cash

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.030 
putting fruit in a bowl next to a cash
register<00:02:54.720> within<00:02:55.350> two<00:02:55.500> feet<00:02:55.650> of<00:02:55.740> cash

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
register within two feet of cash

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.310 
register within two feet of cash
register<00:02:56.400> increases<00:02:57.330> number<00:02:57.810> kids<00:02:58.080> who<00:02:58.140> take

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
register increases number kids who take

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.190 
register increases number kids who take
it<00:02:58.500> by<00:02:59.100> a<00:02:59.130> hundred<00:02:59.760> and<00:02:59.850> five<00:03:00.030> percent<00:03:00.600> really

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
it by a hundred and five percent really

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.800 
it by a hundred and five percent really
that's<00:03:01.500> just<00:03:01.920> just<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.520> proximity<00:03:02.910> moving<00:03:03.690> it

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
that's just just the proximity moving it

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.360 
that's just just the proximity moving it
there<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:04.140> were<00:03:04.260> giving<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:04.650> vegetable<00:03:05.190> name

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
there you were giving a vegetable name

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.220 
there you were giving a vegetable name
calling<00:03:05.760> something<00:03:06.030> crunchy<00:03:06.600> carrots<00:03:06.990> or<00:03:07.140> you

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
calling something crunchy carrots or you

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.590 
calling something crunchy carrots or you
know<00:03:07.320> x-ray<00:03:08.130> peas<00:03:08.460> increases<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.240> percentage

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
know x-ray peas increases the percentage
