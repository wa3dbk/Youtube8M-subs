before
well<00:02:05.630> that's<00:02:05.810> what<00:02:06.020> is<00:02:06.140> interesting<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:06.800> me<00:02:06.950> is

well that's what is interesting to me is

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.149 
well that's what is interesting to me is
the<00:02:07.370> fact<00:02:07.640> that<00:02:07.929> people<00:02:08.929> like<00:02:09.140> you<00:02:09.739> and<00:02:09.920> me<00:02:10.009> and

the fact that people like you and me and

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.699 
the fact that people like you and me and
others<00:02:10.640> that<00:02:10.879> I've<00:02:11.030> talked<00:02:11.450> with<00:02:11.569> who<00:02:12.440> say

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
others that I've talked with who say

others that I've talked with who say

well I don't like besides I don't like

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.730 
well I don't like besides I don't like
that<00:02:14.629> sort<00:02:14.780> of<00:02:14.840> thing<00:02:14.900> about<00:02:15.140> like<00:02:15.319> this

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.030 

this<00:02:18.300> well<00:02:19.300> it's<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.510> fantasy<00:02:20.140> it's<00:02:20.800> not

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
this well it's a fantasy it's not

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.370 
this well it's a fantasy it's not
science<00:02:21.610> fiction<00:02:22.030> so<00:02:22.240> much<00:02:22.450> as<00:02:22.630> it<00:02:22.780> is<00:02:22.930> space

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
science fiction so much as it is space

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.570 
science fiction so much as it is space
fantasy<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.460> it's<00:02:24.730> about<00:02:24.970> people<00:02:25.450> it's<00:02:25.960> about

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
fantasy and it's about people it's about

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.550 
fantasy and it's about people it's about
fine<00:02:27.580> it's<00:02:27.880> finally<00:02:28.450> about<00:02:28.750> people<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.410> not

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
fine it's finally about people and not

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.580 
fine it's finally about people and not
finally<00:02:30.160> about<00:02:30.400> science<00:02:31.030> so<00:02:31.960> the<00:02:32.170> so<00:02:32.560> the

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
finally about science so the so the

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.180 
finally about science so the so the
energy<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:33.520> of<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:34.090> movie<00:02:34.650> goes<00:02:35.650> towards

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
energy and of the movie goes towards

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.250 
energy and of the movie goes towards
exploring<00:02:36.790> these<00:02:36.940> human<00:02:37.390> relationships<00:02:38.110> and

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
exploring these human relationships and

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.420 
exploring these human relationships and
I<00:02:38.380> think<00:02:38.590> that's<00:02:38.770> what<00:02:38.920> makes<00:02:39.100> it<00:02:39.220> so

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
I think that's what makes it so

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.420 
I think that's what makes it so
accessible<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:40.120> people<00:02:41.130> when<00:02:42.130> you<00:02:42.280> were

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
accessible to people when you were

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.990 
accessible to people when you were
making<00:02:42.580> the<00:02:42.910> film<00:02:42.940> I'm<00:02:43.900> thinking<00:02:44.410> of

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
making the film I'm thinking of

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.640 
making the film I'm thinking of
specifically<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.420> robots<00:02:46.870> for<00:02:47.200> instance

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
specifically the robots for instance

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.190 
specifically the robots for instance
what<00:02:48.430> was<00:02:48.760> that<00:02:48.970> did<00:02:49.330> they<00:02:49.420> have<00:02:49.600> problems

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
what was that did they have problems

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.900 
what was that did they have problems
with<00:02:50.290> those<00:02:50.560> because<00:02:50.800> there<00:02:51.490> were<00:02:51.580> people

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
with those because there were people

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.210 
with those because there were people
inside<00:02:52.360> them<00:02:53.020> there<00:02:53.350> were<00:02:53.440> sometimes<00:02:53.680> people

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
inside them there were sometimes people

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.030 
inside them there were sometimes people
inside<00:02:54.520> and<00:02:55.000> sometimes<00:02:55.870> excuse<00:02:56.800> me<00:02:57.330> the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
inside and sometimes excuse me the

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.260 
inside and sometimes excuse me the
sometimes<00:03:00.040> they<00:03:00.160> were<00:03:00.220> all<00:03:00.460> mechanical<00:03:01.120> there

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
sometimes they were all mechanical there

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.060 
sometimes they were all mechanical there
were<00:03:01.360> about<00:03:01.540> four<00:03:02.020> or<00:03:02.380> five<00:03:02.830> different

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
were about four or five different

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.520 
were about four or five different
versions<00:03:03.730> of<00:03:03.940> our<00:03:04.060> 2d<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:04.810> small<00:03:05.140> robot

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
versions of our 2d to the small robot

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.330 
versions of our 2d to the small robot
and<00:03:06.010> I<00:03:06.790> think<00:03:07.210> only<00:03:07.540> one<00:03:07.930> of<00:03:07.960> them<00:03:08.320> was<00:03:09.100> used

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
and I think only one of them was used

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.480 
and I think only one of them was used
with<00:03:09.580> with<00:03:10.270> a<00:03:10.300> person<00:03:10.720> inside<00:03:10.990> of<00:03:11.050> it<00:03:11.490> but

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
with with a person inside of it but

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.480 
with with a person inside of it but
there<00:03:12.900> they<00:03:13.900> have<00:03:14.050> person<00:03:14.500> evitable<00:03:14.890> problems

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
there they have person evitable problems

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.780 
there they have person evitable problems
with<00:03:15.700> something<00:03:15.970> with<00:03:16.420> that<00:03:16.600> much<00:03:16.870> technology

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
with something with that much technology

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.960 
with something with that much technology
and<00:03:18.790> of<00:03:19.120> course<00:03:19.620> movies<00:03:20.620> are<00:03:20.980> made<00:03:22.170> under<00:03:23.170> such

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
and of course movies are made under such

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.400 
and of course movies are made under such
demands<00:03:24.970> of<00:03:25.270> time<00:03:25.570> and<00:03:26.100> money<00:03:27.100> that<00:03:28.410> it's

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
demands of time and money that it's

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.830 
demands of time and money that it's
inevitable<00:03:30.010> that<00:03:30.330> difficulties<00:03:31.330> arise<00:03:31.630> with

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
inevitable that difficulties arise with

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.120 
inevitable that difficulties arise with
this<00:03:31.990> stuff<00:03:32.200> and<00:03:32.380> everything<00:03:32.590> that<00:03:32.830> was<00:03:32.950> being

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
this stuff and everything that was being

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.590 
this stuff and everything that was being
done<00:03:33.340> was<00:03:33.490> being<00:03:33.670> done<00:03:33.850> for<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:34.090> first<00:03:34.360> time

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
done was being done for the first time

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.500 
done was being done for the first time
so<00:03:35.500> there<00:03:35.650> were<00:03:35.740> a<00:03:35.770> lot<00:03:36.070> of<00:03:36.100> problems

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
so there were a lot of problems

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.720 
so there were a lot of problems
technically<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.810> deal<00:03:38.380> with<00:03:38.620> did<00:03:39.370> this<00:03:39.550> make

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
technically to deal with did this make

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.900 
technically to deal with did this make
for<00:03:39.940> a<00:03:39.970> tenseness<00:03:40.570> no<00:03:41.140> no<00:03:41.500> no<00:03:42.010> I<00:03:42.040> think<00:03:42.460> it<00:03:42.580> just

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
for a tenseness no no no I think it just

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.400 
for a tenseness no no no I think it just
created<00:03:43.840> a<00:03:45.120> well<00:03:46.120> of<00:03:46.330> energy<00:03:46.720> to<00:03:46.930> deal<00:03:47.110> with<00:03:47.260> it

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
created a well of energy to deal with it

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.610 
created a well of energy to deal with it
there<00:03:47.980> was<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.100> lot<00:03:48.280> of<00:03:48.310> energy<00:03:49.200> person<00:03:50.200> are<00:03:50.470> you

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
there was a lot of energy person are you

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.460 
there was a lot of energy person are you
beginning<00:03:51.070> to<00:03:51.220> see<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:52.120> effects<00:03:52.720> of<00:03:52.990> Star
