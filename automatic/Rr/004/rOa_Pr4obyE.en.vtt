 hello today our focus 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.170
 attention 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.839
 7-inch tablets in our opinion this 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.830
 really diagonal device for those 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.310
 users to 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.560
 an ordinary smartphone is no longer enough 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.859
 no desire to carry yourself 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.660
 10 inch models google company 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.750
 periodically releases smartphones by 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.769
 own brand but since 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.899
 the Internet giant does not specialize in 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.100
 producing iron something all the work behind 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.800
 partners do it 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.260
 sometimes eat it si sometimes samsung 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.820
 recent device for group 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.430
 released the company dji and finally 1 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.270
 google tablet 7 inch released 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.250
 company asus ligna no nexus 7 nexus 7 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.969
 appeared in the google store in the summer 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.180
 last year for less than $ 250 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.020
 for the 16 gigabyte model and it's literally 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.570
 blew up the market 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.379
 let's see what this new one is capable of 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.379
 asus tablet 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.729
 compared to other tablets from 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.430
 of our test interface asus nexus 7 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.170
 works most of all turning over 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.570
 scrolls are processed gently 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.299
 unpleasant slowing jerking 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.920
 virtually no noticeable 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.159
 that among all the 7 inch tablets 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.320
 who came to us for testing 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.960
 most 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.050
 devices has only 5 fingers and 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.350
 multitouch and only two of them 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.620
 devices both dash 10 finger one of them 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.750
 This is nexus 7 from asus separately, we note that 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.610
 only asus nexus 7 and all of it 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.860
 oleophobic screen coating what 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.630
 provides better practicality since 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.320
 fingerprints are not so 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.240
 visible and easier to remove hard 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.710
 imagine a more terrible manifestation 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.020
 techno zadrotstvo than trying 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.600
 take a picture of something on the tablet 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.060
 that's the way part of the owners 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.190
 nexus 7 this problem does not threaten in 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.619
 the device is corny there is no rear camera 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.550
 and there is only front and intended 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.509
 for video calls 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.709
 or the consciousness of glamorous portraits 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.230
 it is noteworthy that among the 7-inch 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.239
 brand name tablets as 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.130
 rule does not occur device in 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.860
 Top picking reason for this 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.470
 simple themselves known manufacturers 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.750
 Such as already samsung I consider 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.440
 7 inch tablet like device with 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.090
 initial 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.070
 well, or maximum average 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.049
 some moments are so close 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.750
 relationship google device can and 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.739
 lack of thread tablet has no slot 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.690
 for memory cards 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.760
 but when youd connect devices 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.160
 asus nexus 7 works fine 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.620
 keyboard and mouse but usb does not work 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.049
 drive there is an opinion that removable cards 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.700
 the memory of connecting flash drives is not included 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.140
 run by google how should 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.829
 used operating system 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.829
 android
