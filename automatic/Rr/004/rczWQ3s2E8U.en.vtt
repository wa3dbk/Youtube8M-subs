next<00:01:36.440> we're<00:01:36.800> going<00:01:36.980> to<00:01:37.100> hand<00:01:38.290> thread<00:01:39.290> the<00:01:39.710> nut

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
next we're going to hand thread the nut

00:01:41.620 --> 00:02:00.250 
next we're going to hand thread the nut
to<00:01:42.620> as<00:01:43.159> far<00:01:43.460> as<00:01:43.520> we<00:01:43.790> can<00:01:43.880> get

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.350

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
now I'm going to use my 24 millimeter

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:17.240 
now I'm going to use my 24 millimeter
socket<00:02:04.080> to<00:02:04.650> just<00:02:04.920> tighten<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.580> to<00:02:05.940> be<00:02:06.060> snug

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.340 

oh<00:02:19.100> I<00:02:20.100> realize<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.940> rear<00:02:21.510> wheel<00:02:21.810> was<00:02:22.020> fitting

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
oh I realize the rear wheel was fitting

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.930 
oh I realize the rear wheel was fitting
because<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.590> forgot<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.100> put<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.460> lock<00:02:23.670> on<00:02:23.910> the

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
because I forgot to put the lock on the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:46.300 
because I forgot to put the lock on the
rear<00:02:24.210> brake

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:03:00.540 

let's<00:02:47.310> try<00:02:47.549> this<00:02:47.610> again

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.820 

using<00:03:01.550> my<00:03:01.700> official<00:03:02.239> Vespa<00:03:02.720> workshop<00:03:03.290> manual

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
using my official Vespa workshop manual

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.280 
using my official Vespa workshop manual
I<00:03:04.099> had<00:03:04.489> to<00:03:04.700> look<00:03:04.849> up<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.209> torque<00:03:05.480> for<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:05.989> rear

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
I had to look up the torque for the rear

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.130 
I had to look up the torque for the rear
wheel<00:03:06.680> axle<00:03:07.340> it<00:03:07.970> says<00:03:08.300> here<00:03:08.629> it<00:03:08.750> should<00:03:08.930> be<00:03:09.050> at

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
wheel axle it says here it should be at

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.790 
wheel axle it says here it should be at
least<00:03:09.410> 100<00:03:10.069> 4<00:03:10.489> Newton<00:03:11.120> meters<00:03:11.720> I<00:03:12.019> went<00:03:12.680> online

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
least 100 4 Newton meters I went online

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.420 
least 100 4 Newton meters I went online
I<00:03:13.400> looked<00:03:13.580> at<00:03:14.180> that<00:03:14.360> equals<00:03:14.900> about<00:03:15.430> 76

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
I looked at that equals about 76

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.100 
I looked at that equals about 76
foot-pounds<00:03:19.180> I'm<00:03:20.180> going<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.569> use<00:03:20.660> my<00:03:20.840> torque

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
foot-pounds I'm going to use my torque

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:38.360 
foot-pounds I'm going to use my torque
wrench<00:03:21.380> to<00:03:21.500> make<00:03:21.709> you<00:03:21.830> go<00:03:21.950> to<00:03:22.010> 75<00:03:22.610> foot-pounds

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.580 

I'm<00:03:38.879> going<00:03:39.269> to<00:03:39.420> install<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.989> retaining<00:03:40.379> ring

I'm going to install the retaining ring

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:52.950 
I'm going to install the retaining ring
and<00:03:41.159> then<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.610> cotterpin

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.100 

I<00:03:53.730> couldn't<00:03:54.730> find<00:03:54.910> the<00:03:55.030> exact<00:03:55.420> cotter<00:03:55.780> pin

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
I couldn't find the exact cotter pin

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.530 
I couldn't find the exact cotter pin
used<00:03:56.380> for<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.710> Vespa<00:03:57.130> but<00:03:57.640> I<00:03:57.670> went<00:03:57.910> online<00:03:58.030> and

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
used for the Vespa but I went online and

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.850 
used for the Vespa but I went online and
found<00:03:58.630> out<00:03:59.200> that<00:03:59.230> a<00:03:59.640> 5/32<00:04:00.640> 1/2<00:04:01.420> inch<00:04:01.840> would<00:04:02.650> do

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
found out that a 5/32 1/2 inch would do

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:38.980 
found out that a 5/32 1/2 inch would do
just<00:04:03.640> fine

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.420 

and<00:04:39.990> now<00:04:40.170> going<00:04:40.410> to<00:04:40.590> reinstall<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:41.190> exhaust

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
and now going to reinstall the exhaust

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.790 
and now going to reinstall the exhaust
