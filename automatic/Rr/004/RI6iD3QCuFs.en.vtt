going<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.200> be<00:00:43.320> melting<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.770> PC<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.370> I'm<00:00:44.430> going

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
going to be melting on PC so I'm going

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.190 
going to be melting on PC so I'm going
to<00:00:44.640> give<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:44.879> one<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.210> first<00:00:45.660> run-through<00:00:45.840> of

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
to give this one a first run-through of

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:59.460 
to give this one a first run-through of
our<00:00:46.800> chapter<00:00:47.219> one<00:00:47.579> okay<00:00:48.320> let's<00:00:49.320> go

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:08.730 

okay<00:01:00.470> one<00:01:00.650> second<00:01:01.360> game<00:01:03.640> subtitles<00:01:04.640> yep

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.399 

now<00:01:09.430> this<00:01:09.579> is<00:01:09.640> operating<00:01:10.180> like<00:01:10.270> 16<00:01:10.869> e<00:01:10.960> x<00:01:11.110> 1050

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
now this is operating like 16 e x 1050

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.010 
now this is operating like 16 e x 1050
so<00:01:12.009> it's<00:01:12.220> not<00:01:12.340> a<00:01:12.399> best<00:01:12.640> resolution<00:01:12.939> but<00:01:13.810> as<00:01:13.930> you

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
so it's not a best resolution but as you

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.800 
so it's not a best resolution but as you
can<00:01:14.110> tell<00:01:14.170> it's<00:01:14.619> the<00:01:15.579> frame<00:01:15.850> it's<00:01:16.000> run<00:01:16.210> 30<00:01:16.509> 30

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
can tell it's the frame it's run 30 30

can tell it's the frame it's run 30 30
