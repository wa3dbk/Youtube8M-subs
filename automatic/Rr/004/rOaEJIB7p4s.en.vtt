00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.570 

it's<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.820> fish<00:00:27.060> no<00:00:27.240> better<00:00:27.480> angle<00:00:28.220> from<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.400> in

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.650 
this is probably the worst you see him
right<00:05:08.020> here<00:05:08.380> here<00:05:08.710> is<00:05:08.920> there's<00:05:09.730> the<00:05:09.940> ball<00:05:10.150> the

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
right here here is there's the ball the

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.890 
right here here is there's the ball the
ball<00:05:10.840> has<00:05:10.960> already<00:05:11.170> been<00:05:11.320> in<00:05:12.570> and<00:05:13.570> right<00:05:13.780> went

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
ball has already been in and right went

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:24.640 
ball has already been in and right went
number<00:05:14.020> one<00:05:14.110> hits<00:05:14.410> in<00:05:14.530> this<00:05:14.620> one<00:05:14.740> he<00:05:14.800> falls

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.290 

this<00:05:25.370> is<00:05:25.660> pretty<00:05:26.660> good<00:05:27.639> so<00:05:28.639> from<00:05:28.880> here<00:05:29.030> you<00:05:29.180> can

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
this is pretty good so from here you can

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:39.390 
this is pretty good so from here you can
clearly<00:05:29.540> see<00:05:29.660> he<00:05:29.870> never<00:05:29.990> goes<00:05:30.259> down

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:55.550 

that<00:05:40.400> is<00:05:40.520> very<00:05:40.790> close<00:05:43.449> can<00:05:44.449> I<00:05:44.510> go<00:05:44.660> back<00:05:45.070> okay

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.670 

remember<00:05:56.460> they<00:05:56.580> were<00:05:56.610> on<00:05:56.760> the<00:05:57.050> 3-inch<00:05:58.050> line<00:05:58.380> I

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
remember they were on the 3-inch line I

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:06.560 
remember they were on the 3-inch line I
believe<00:05:59.670> was<00:06:00.090> e<00:06:01.280> exact<00:06:03.200> okay<00:06:04.200> so<00:06:05.300> there's<00:06:06.300> the

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
believe was e exact okay so there's the

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
believe was e exact okay so there's the
ball<00:06:08.360> stretched<00:06:10.010> over<00:06:11.010> the<00:06:11.190> paint<00:06:12.170> he<00:06:13.170> has<00:06:13.410> not

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
ball stretched over the paint he has not

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.810 
ball stretched over the paint he has not
touched<00:06:13.800> yet<00:06:13.980> it's<00:06:14.910> bouncing<00:06:15.660> touch<00:06:16.820> there's

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
touched yet it's bouncing touch there's

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.980 
touched yet it's bouncing touch there's
a<00:06:17.910> little<00:06:18.120> bit<00:06:18.210> of<00:06:18.240> grass<00:06:18.450> under<00:06:18.720> it<00:06:18.810> or<00:06:19.110> turf

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990 
a little bit of grass under it or turf

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.800 
a little bit of grass under it or turf
obviously<00:06:21.990> the<00:06:22.110> rule<00:06:22.230> cannot<00:06:22.470> be<00:06:22.530> changed<00:06:23.810> but

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
obviously the rule cannot be changed but

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.770 
obviously the rule cannot be changed but
from<00:06:25.560> my<00:06:25.680> angle<00:06:26.010> and<00:06:26.700> even<00:06:27.450> some<00:06:27.600> of<00:06:27.690> the

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
from my angle and even some of the

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.700 
from my angle and even some of the
DeSoto<00:06:28.080> fans<00:06:29.210> he<00:06:30.210> was<00:06:30.330> clearly<00:06:30.660> that<00:06:31.050> clearly

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
DeSoto fans he was clearly that clearly

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.159 
DeSoto fans he was clearly that clearly
I<00:06:32.040> was<00:06:32.340> very<00:06:32.550> close<00:06:32.820> but<00:06:33.630> he<00:06:33.750> was<00:06:33.840> in<00:06:33.960> the<00:06:34.080> end

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:34.169 
I was very close but he was in the end

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:37.100 
I was very close but he was in the end
zone<00:06:34.230> and<00:06:35.030> it<00:06:36.030> seemed<00:06:36.300> in<00:06:36.480> this<00:06:36.600> game<00:06:36.780> that<00:06:36.900> I

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
zone and it seemed in this game that I

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:42.470 
zone and it seemed in this game that I
went<00:06:37.350> to<00:06:37.440> DeSoto<00:06:38.630> so<00:06:39.630> I<00:06:41.120> don't<00:06:42.120> think<00:06:42.240> there

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:42.480 
went to DeSoto so I don't think there

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:54.409 
went to DeSoto so I don't think there
are<00:06:42.510> any<00:06:42.900> more<00:06:43.140> replays

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:54.419

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:11.459 
you can see how far he was actually in
the<00:07:09.879> enzyme<00:07:10.330> his<00:07:10.479> whole<00:07:10.629> forearm<00:07:10.960> was<00:07:11.229> in<00:07:11.379> the
