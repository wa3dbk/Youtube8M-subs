its an old-fashioned shaved ice shop.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:44.866

is popular with people of all ages seeking refreshment.

"How is it?"

00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:19.633
 "It's amazing."

00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:22.066
 "Amazing? Thank you."

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:30.799
Ishibashi-san cuts ice just before it starts to melt,
giving it a texture like cotton candy.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.300
"Want to come look?"

00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:40.167

"What does it look like?"

00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:45.100
"A crumpled plastic bag."

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.000
"What a clever expression!"

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.500
"Here you go. Bring it to the kid's chair."

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:04.766
