any I did some tests and it procs

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.660

roughly<00:03:49.790> every<00:03:50.060> three<00:03:50.450> to<00:03:50.480> four<00:03:50.930> minutes

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
roughly every three to four minutes

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.220 
roughly every three to four minutes
that's<00:03:52.670> how<00:03:52.880> how<00:03:53.180> often<00:03:53.540> it<00:03:53.630> was<00:03:53.750> coming<00:03:54.079> out

but<00:03:54.890> it<00:03:55.010> only<00:03:55.130> stays<00:03:55.459> active<00:03:55.760> for<00:03:56.060> about<00:03:56.720> 20

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
but it only stays active for about 20

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.880 
but it only stays active for about 20
seconds<00:03:57.880> so<00:03:58.880> not<00:03:59.239> the<00:03:59.390> greatest<00:04:00.140> of<00:04:00.500> bus<00:04:00.680> I'd

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
seconds so not the greatest of bus I'd

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.160 
seconds so not the greatest of bus I'd
