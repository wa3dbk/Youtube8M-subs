if we go and for exam

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.460 
if we go and for exam
well<00:02:13.950> we<00:02:14.070> open<00:02:14.400> sketch<00:02:14.880> here<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:16.110> can<00:02:16.260> see

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
well we open sketch here you can see

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.110 
well we open sketch here you can see
that<00:02:18.320> that<00:02:19.320> we<00:02:19.440> can<00:02:19.620> write<00:02:19.860> with<00:02:20.190> this<00:02:20.340> in<00:02:21.000> a

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
that that we can write with this in a

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.760 
that that we can write with this in a
way<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.750> just<00:02:21.960> can't<00:02:22.230> do<00:02:22.440> with<00:02:22.740> your

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
way that you just can't do with your

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.490 
way that you just can't do with your
fingers<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:24.480> that's<00:02:24.690> really<00:02:24.990> helpful<00:02:25.230> for

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
fingers and that's really helpful for

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.900 
fingers and that's really helpful for
productivity<00:02:25.890> apps<00:02:26.220> for<00:02:26.460> handwriting

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
productivity apps for handwriting

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.390 
productivity apps for handwriting
recognition<00:02:27.320> for<00:02:28.320> being<00:02:28.530> able<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.830> kind<00:02:29.280> of

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
recognition for being able to kind of

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.830 
recognition for being able to kind of
work<00:02:29.460> while<00:02:29.820> you're<00:02:30.000> standing<00:02:30.210> up<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.660> write

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
work while you're standing up and write

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.680 
work while you're standing up and write
things<00:02:31.080> now<00:02:31.740> what's<00:02:32.730> really<00:02:32.910> neat<00:02:33.210> about<00:02:33.240> this

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
things now what's really neat about this

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.840 
things now what's really neat about this
and<00:02:33.930> really<00:02:34.200> unique<00:02:34.350> is<00:02:34.770> not<00:02:35.370> just<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:35.700> it

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
and really unique is not just that it

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.630 
and really unique is not just that it
can<00:02:35.970> detach<00:02:36.270> but<00:02:36.750> how<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.020> can<00:02:37.140> reattach<00:02:37.410> so<00:02:38.250> if

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
can detach but how it can reattach so if

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.750 
can detach but how it can reattach so if
we<00:02:38.970> take<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.690> helix<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.350> you<00:02:41.220> can<00:02:41.400> see<00:02:41.610> that

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
we take the helix and you can see that

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.360 
we take the helix and you can see that
just<00:02:41.820> like<00:02:42.270> most<00:02:43.110> hybrids<00:02:44.100> that<00:02:44.190> have

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
just like most hybrids that have

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.070 
just like most hybrids that have
detachable<00:02:44.820> it<00:02:45.030> just<00:02:45.180> pops<00:02:45.420> right<00:02:45.570> back<00:02:45.840> in

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
detachable it just pops right back in

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.950 
detachable it just pops right back in
and<00:02:46.290> easily<00:02:47.040> pops<00:02:47.280> in<00:02:47.490> and<00:02:47.610> out<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.660> of<00:02:48.930> course

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
and easily pops in and out and of course

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.500 
and easily pops in and out and of course
you<00:02:49.950> know<00:02:50.070> because<00:02:50.490> it<00:02:50.640> pops<00:02:50.850> in<00:02:51.120> like<00:02:51.300> this

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
you know because it pops in like this

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.860 
you know because it pops in like this
you<00:02:51.720> can<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.970> can<00:02:54.180> do<00:02:54.360> all<00:02:54.540> kinds<00:02:54.780> of<00:02:54.810> things

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
you can you can do all kinds of things

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.360 
you can you can do all kinds of things
with<00:02:55.140> it<00:02:55.260> but<00:02:55.290> what's<00:02:55.620> really<00:02:55.770> key<00:02:56.070> here<00:02:56.100> is

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
with it but what's really key here is

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.400 
with it but what's really key here is
that<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.520> can<00:02:56.700> put<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:56.970> in<00:02:57.090> backwards<00:02:57.410> so

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
that you can put it in backwards so

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.670 
that you can put it in backwards so
check<00:02:59.400> this<00:02:59.550> out<00:02:59.760> you<00:03:00.480> take<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:00.960> and<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.380> stick

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
check this out you take it and you stick

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.090 
check this out you take it and you stick
it<00:03:01.830> in<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.730> dock<00:03:03.300> like<00:03:03.660> so<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:06.290> you<00:03:07.290> can<00:03:07.770> kind

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
it in the dock like so and you can kind

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.350 
it in the dock like so and you can kind
of<00:03:08.130> flip<00:03:08.340> this<00:03:08.520> pork<00:03:08.760> close<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.090> keep<00:03:09.240> it

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
of flip this pork close to keep it

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.480 
of flip this pork close to keep it
covered<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.780> we<00:03:09.930> can<00:03:10.080> flip<00:03:10.260> it<00:03:10.410> over<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:10.890> now

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
covered and we can flip it over and now

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.250 
covered and we can flip it over and now
it<00:03:11.970> is<00:03:12.210> a<00:03:12.240> tablet<00:03:12.540> with<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.810> with<00:03:13.170> the

keyboard dock attached which is going to

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.430 
keyboard dock attached which is going to
give<00:03:14.850> it<00:03:14.940> longer<00:03:15.180> battery<00:03:15.360> life<00:03:15.540> but<00:03:16.260> make<00:03:16.410> it

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
give it longer battery life but make it

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.860 
give it longer battery life but make it
about<00:03:16.710> 3.6<00:03:17.280> pounds<00:03:17.580> but<00:03:18.450> what's<00:03:18.720> interesting

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
about 3.6 pounds but what's interesting

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.290 
about 3.6 pounds but what's interesting
about<00:03:19.230> this<00:03:19.530> position<00:03:20.010> is<00:03:20.190> you<00:03:20.730> can<00:03:20.910> use<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:21.209> in
