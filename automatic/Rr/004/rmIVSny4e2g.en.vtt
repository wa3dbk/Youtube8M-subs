we'll<00:00:24.080> the<00:00:24.259> fear<00:00:24.710> anticipation<00:00:25.699> and<00:00:26.119> pain

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419 
we'll the fear anticipation and pain

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.050 
we'll the fear anticipation and pain
send<00:00:27.230> his<00:00:27.500> heart<00:00:27.740> rate<00:00:27.980> redlining<00:00:28.519> into<00:00:29.000> the

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
send his heart rate redlining into the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.659 
send his heart rate redlining into the
dangerous<00:00:29.480> territory

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:30.669 
dangerous territory

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.970

so<00:00:31.669> is<00:00:31.789> he<00:00:31.939> felt<00:00:32.300> the<00:00:32.449> anticipation<00:00:33.170> you<00:00:33.590> could

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
so is he felt the anticipation you could

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.380 
so is he felt the anticipation you could
see<00:00:34.129> his<00:00:34.250> heart<00:00:34.489> rate<00:00:34.670> started<00:00:35.030> to<00:00:35.120> increase

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
see his heart rate started to increase

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.299 
see his heart rate started to increase
just<00:00:35.989> sort<00:00:36.170> of<00:00:36.230> spiked<00:00:36.530> back<00:00:36.829> and<00:00:37.070> forth

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
just sort of spiked back and forth

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.810 
just sort of spiked back and forth
upwards<00:00:38.120> of<00:00:38.210> about<00:00:38.300> 110<00:00:39.050> 120<00:00:39.829> beats<00:00:40.129> and<00:00:40.670> then

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
upwards of about 110 120 beats and then

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.970 
upwards of about 110 120 beats and then
settled<00:00:41.360> back<00:00:41.540> down<00:00:41.600> to<00:00:41.960> about<00:00:42.110> 90<00:00:42.409> beats<00:00:42.769> or

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
settled back down to about 90 beats or

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.700 
settled back down to about 90 beats or
so<00:00:43.159> that's<00:00:43.879> right<00:00:44.210> even<00:00:44.899> the<00:00:45.320> thought<00:00:45.680> of

during the course of our experiment and

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.720 
during the course of our experiment and
Jason's<00:02:59.640> heart<00:02:59.820> rate<00:03:00.060> ranged<00:03:00.600> from<00:03:00.780> 72<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.800> 182

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
Jason's heart rate ranged from 72 to 182

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.050 
Jason's heart rate ranged from 72 to 182
beats<00:03:03.210> per<00:03:03.510> minute<00:03:03.860> that's<00:03:04.860> what<00:03:05.160> we<00:03:05.400> call<00:03:05.730> a

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
beats per minute that's what we call a

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.840 
beats per minute that's what we call a
workout<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.920> expect<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.460> heart<00:03:08.640> rate<00:03:08.820> to

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
workout and expect the heart rate to

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.240 
workout and expect the heart rate to
increase<00:03:09.030> when<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:09.810> exercise<00:03:10.230> intensely<00:03:11.070> but

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
increase when you exercise intensely but

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
increase so rapidly and of course it did

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.070 
increase so rapidly and of course it did
settle<00:03:20.700> back<00:03:20.910> down<00:03:20.970> but<00:03:21.360> we<00:03:21.510> know<00:03:21.720> he<00:03:21.900> took

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
settle back down but we know he took

that impact at a very high velocity and

that impact at a very high velocity and
it<00:03:25.020> definitely<00:03:25.590> caused<00:03:25.800> a<00:03:25.920> shock<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.310> the
