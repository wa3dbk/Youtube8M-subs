there's two there's not in these but

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.580 
there's two there's not in these but
there's<00:00:48.410> one<00:00:48.530> and<00:00:48.920> this<00:00:49.640> one<00:00:50.230> that<00:00:51.230> i<00:00:51.260> took<00:00:51.469> out

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
there's one and this one that i took out

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.470 
there's one and this one that i took out
so<00:00:52.250> there's<00:00:52.430> two<00:00:52.579> there's<00:00:52.879> two<00:00:52.910> pieces<00:00:53.149> of<00:00:53.329> gum

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
in a pack and i think if you buy it

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.119 
in a pack and i think if you buy it
there<00:00:55.460> is<00:00:55.730> 12<00:00:56.600> packs<00:00:56.929> of<00:00:57.140> about<00:00:57.320> 24<00:00:57.710> pieces<00:00:57.920> of

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
there is 12 packs of about 24 pieces of

00:00:58.129 --> 00:00:59.950 
there is 12 packs of about 24 pieces of
gum<00:00:58.250> and<00:00:58.519> pretty<00:00:59.120> much<00:00:59.179> what<00:00:59.420> you<00:00:59.510> do<00:00:59.660> is<00:00:59.839> you

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
gum and pretty much what you do is you

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.299 
gum and pretty much what you do is you
chew<00:01:00.109> it<00:01:00.140> for<00:01:00.379> 10<00:01:00.530> minutes<00:01:00.710> you<00:01:00.890> have<00:01:00.980> the

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
chew it for 10 minutes you have the

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.610 
chew it for 10 minutes you have the
option<00:01:01.460> to<00:01:01.640> spit<00:01:02.000> it<00:01:02.120> out<00:01:02.210> but<00:01:02.899> i<00:01:02.929> like<00:01:03.379> chewing

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
option to spit it out but i like chewing

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.000 
option to spit it out but i like chewing
it<00:01:03.829> the<00:01:04.960> chemical<00:01:05.960> reaction<00:01:06.350> in<00:01:06.440> your<00:01:06.530> brain<00:01:06.710> i

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
it the chemical reaction in your brain i

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.130 
it the chemical reaction in your brain i
guess<00:01:07.640> you<00:01:07.760> could<00:01:07.850> say<00:01:08.030> only<00:01:08.540> last<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:08.930> first

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
guess you could say only last the first

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.290 
guess you could say only last the first
10<00:01:09.320> minutes<00:01:09.500> so<00:01:09.800> if<00:01:10.280> you<00:01:10.700> like<00:01:10.940> you're<00:01:11.150> chewing

it<00:01:15.439> for<00:01:15.590> 10<00:01:15.740> minutes<00:01:15.920> but<00:01:16.159> if<00:01:16.250> you<00:01:16.310> actually

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400

let me tell you guys about this i'ma get

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.080 
let me tell you guys about this i'ma get
in-depth<00:01:39.229> with<00:01:39.350> this<00:01:39.500> review<00:01:39.890> lethean<00:01:40.880> is<00:01:41.030> the

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
in-depth with this review lethean is the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.580 
in-depth with this review lethean is the
first<00:01:41.329> bioactive<00:01:41.960> which<00:01:42.079> is<00:01:42.200> like<00:01:42.350> green<00:01:42.560> tea

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
first bioactive which is like green tea

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.120 
first bioactive which is like green tea
leaves<00:01:43.009> and<00:01:43.159> then<00:01:43.700> I<00:01:44.030> salonga<00:01:44.869> which<00:01:45.710> I<00:01:46.009> don't

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
leaves and then I salonga which I don't

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.980 
leaves and then I salonga which I don't
even<00:01:46.369> know<00:01:46.640> what<00:01:46.759> I<00:01:46.880> shuang<00:01:47.240> is<00:01:47.479> but<00:01:47.750> it's<00:01:47.869> a

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
even know what I shuang is but it's a

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.539 
even know what I shuang is but it's a
stress<00:01:48.590> reducer<00:01:48.979> mine<00:01:49.159> boost<00:01:49.399> your

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
stress reducer mine boost your

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.429 
stress reducer mine boost your
performance<00:01:49.759> enhancer<00:01:50.450> I<00:01:50.659> think<00:01:51.229> it's<00:01:51.350> like

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
performance enhancer I think it's like

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.709 
performance enhancer I think it's like
in<00:01:51.530> comes<00:01:52.310> from<00:01:52.460> India<00:01:52.729> it's<00:01:53.030> an<00:01:53.180> Indian<00:01:53.479> route

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
in comes from India it's an Indian route

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:57.039 
in comes from India it's an Indian route
yeah<00:01:54.350> there<00:01:54.619> you<00:01:54.710> go<00:01:54.770> indian<00:01:55.219> route<00:01:55.600> so<00:01:56.600> those

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
yeah there you go indian route so those

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.080 
yeah there you go indian route so those
are<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.200> two<00:01:57.409> things<00:01:57.439> that<00:01:57.740> actually<00:01:58.090> enhance

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
are the two things that actually enhance

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.850 
are the two things that actually enhance
the<00:01:59.240> performance<00:01:59.360> when<00:01:59.869> you<00:01:59.930> chew<00:02:00.079> the<00:02:00.229> gum<00:02:00.259> it

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
the performance when you chew the gum it

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.289 
the performance when you chew the gum it
gives<00:02:01.039> you<00:02:01.159> a<00:02:01.189> relaxed<00:02:01.640> focused<00:02:02.060> you're<00:02:02.180> not

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
gives you a relaxed focused you're not

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:03.520 
gives you a relaxed focused you're not
gonna<00:02:02.390> be<00:02:02.509> bouncing<00:02:02.810> off<00:02:02.899> the<00:02:02.930> walls<00:02:03.200> it's<00:02:03.409> not

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
gonna be bouncing off the walls it's not

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.440 
gonna be bouncing off the walls it's not
going<00:02:03.619> to<00:02:03.710> be<00:02:03.829> no<00:02:03.979> energy<00:02:04.850> drink<00:02:05.119> or<00:02:05.390> anything

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
going to be no energy drink or anything

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.179 
going to be no energy drink or anything
like<00:02:05.719> that<00:02:05.869> you're<00:02:06.170> not<00:02:06.289> going<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:06.560> have<00:02:07.070> the

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
like that you're not going to have the

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.770 
like that you're not going to have the
caffeine<00:02:07.549> there's<00:02:07.729> zero<00:02:08.030> caffeine<00:02:08.450> in<00:02:08.630> this

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
caffeine there's zero caffeine in this

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.460 
caffeine there's zero caffeine in this
and<00:02:09.430> so<00:02:10.430> this<00:02:10.670> is<00:02:10.820> what<00:02:10.940> it<00:02:11.030> looks<00:02:11.210> like<00:02:11.470> it's

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
anything so yeah actos hmm I should so

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.000 
anything so yeah actos hmm I should so
within<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.870> first<00:02:45.080> 10<00:02:45.260> minutes<00:02:45.440> what<00:02:45.680> happens

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
within the first 10 minutes what happens

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.949 
within the first 10 minutes what happens
is<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.670> two<00:02:46.850> bioactives<00:02:47.540> that<00:02:47.660> I<00:02:47.690> mentioned

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
is the two bioactives that I mentioned

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.600 
is the two bioactives that I mentioned
they<00:02:48.590> get<00:02:48.739> released<00:02:48.860> in<00:02:49.220> your<00:02:49.370> blood<00:02:49.580> vessels

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
they get released in your blood vessels

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.309 
they get released in your blood vessels
in<00:02:50.000> your<00:02:50.030> mouth<00:02:50.269> and<00:02:50.540> that's<00:02:50.930> what<00:02:51.050> gives<00:02:51.140> you

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
in your mouth and that's what gives you

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.250 
in your mouth and that's what gives you
the<00:02:51.440> it<00:02:51.800> gives<00:02:52.010> you<00:02:52.099> a<00:02:52.130> faster<00:02:52.790> reaction<00:02:53.390> to

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
the it gives you a faster reaction to

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.190 
the it gives you a faster reaction to
the<00:02:54.500> bioactives<00:02:55.269> so<00:02:56.269> that's<00:02:56.690> why<00:02:56.810> in<00:02:57.019> 10

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
the bioactives so that's why in 10

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.850 
the bioactives so that's why in 10
minutes<00:02:57.350> you're<00:02:57.739> good<00:02:57.890> to<00:02:57.980> go<00:02:58.390> so<00:02:59.390> yeah<00:02:59.860> that's

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
minutes you're good to go so yeah that's

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.100 
minutes you're good to go so yeah that's
that<00:03:00.980> like<00:03:01.340> I<00:03:01.459> said<00:03:01.730> two<00:03:02.569> of<00:03:02.660> them<00:03:02.780> coming<00:03:03.049> to

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110
