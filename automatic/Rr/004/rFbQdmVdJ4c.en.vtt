small<00:04:02.790> we<00:04:03.790> come<00:04:03.970> down<00:04:04.090> here<00:04:04.150> to<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.570> side<00:04:07.740> we

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
small we come down here to the side we

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.690 
small we come down here to the side we
can<00:04:08.920> open<00:04:09.430> it<00:04:09.520> up<00:04:09.670> and<00:04:10.320> expand<00:04:11.320> it<00:04:12.780> additional

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
can open it up and expand it additional

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.570 
can open it up and expand it additional
space<00:04:16.110> so<00:04:17.110> now<00:04:17.350> you<00:04:17.799> kind<00:04:18.010> of<00:04:18.070> have<00:04:18.190> a<00:04:18.220> wider
