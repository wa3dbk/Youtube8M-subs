00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
when I walk it squeaks and what I think

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.749 
when I walk it squeaks and what I think
that<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.420> separating<00:01:40.079> from<00:01:40.290> this

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
that is is this is separating from this

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.859 
that is is this is separating from this
somewhere<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.000> middle<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.630> get<00:01:42.840> a

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
somewhere in the middle and I get a

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.260 
somewhere in the middle and I get a
little<00:01:43.020> squeak<00:01:43.470> when<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.740> when<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.280> walk<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:45.210> a

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
little squeak when I when I walk is a

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.350 
little squeak when I when I walk is a
little<00:01:45.659> squeak<00:01:46.079> it's<00:01:47.070> kind<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.369> annoying<00:01:47.700> but

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
little squeak it's kind of annoying but

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.350 
little squeak it's kind of annoying but
as<00:01:48.930> far<00:01:49.290> as<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.680> quality<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.610> boots<00:01:50.880> it's

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360
