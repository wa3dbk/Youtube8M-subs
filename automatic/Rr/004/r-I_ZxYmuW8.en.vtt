00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
end of each point now I will dimension

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.380 
end of each point now I will dimension
this<00:02:23.170> line<00:02:23.530> right<00:02:23.799> here<00:02:23.859> it's<00:02:24.819> supposed<00:02:24.969> to<00:02:25.239> be

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
this line right here it's supposed to be

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.509 
this line right here it's supposed to be
3<00:02:26.200> inches<00:02:27.689> it<00:02:28.689> is<00:02:28.719> fully<00:02:29.170> constrained<00:02:29.890> so<00:02:30.340> now

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
3 inches it is fully constrained so now

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.929 
3 inches it is fully constrained so now
I<00:02:30.549> can<00:02:30.819> click<00:02:31.030> finish<00:02:31.450> sketch<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:34.049> extrude
