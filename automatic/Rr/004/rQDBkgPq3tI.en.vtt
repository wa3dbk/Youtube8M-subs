00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
kicked off but obviously a lot of

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
tensions going on at the time a very

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.849 
tensions going on at the time a very
difficult<00:00:26.699> period<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.779> review<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.349> will<00:00:28.410> stay

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859

now<00:00:29.099> I'm<00:00:29.189> not<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.369> Nazi<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.150> don't<00:00:30.420> want<00:00:30.570> any

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.720 

it's<00:00:36.239> probably<00:00:36.829> quite<00:00:37.829> good<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.309> them<00:00:38.460> really

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
it's probably quite good of them really

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.209 
it's probably quite good of them really
to<00:00:38.910> try<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.450> do<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> range<00:00:40.230> like<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.829> and

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
to try and do a range like this and

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.600 
to try and do a range like this and
obviously<00:00:41.879> being<00:00:42.270> pretty<00:00:42.510> successful<00:00:43.110> at<00:00:43.230> it

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
obviously being pretty successful at it

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.459 
obviously being pretty successful at it
king<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.730> country<00:00:45.079> because<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.320> tough

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469

another<00:00:54.840> nice<00:00:55.110> piece<00:00:56.059> detail<00:00:57.059> phenomenal<00:00:57.930> I

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
another nice piece detail phenomenal I

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.369 
another nice piece detail phenomenal I
mean<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.600> there<00:01:00.600> was<00:01:00.750> obviously<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.320> lot

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
mean this is there was obviously a lot

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.009 
mean this is there was obviously a lot
of<00:01:01.500> research<00:01:01.890> goes<00:01:02.160> into<00:01:02.190> these<00:01:02.489> uniforms<00:01:03.120> I

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
of research goes into these uniforms I

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.219 
of research goes into these uniforms I
mean<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.710> flag<00:01:05.040> itself<00:01:05.519> just<00:01:05.960> draws<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.200> to

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
mean the flag itself just draws you to

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.840 
mean the flag itself just draws you to
it

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
it

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.690 
it
you<00:01:09.420> know<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.260> flag<00:01:10.530> itself<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.159> separates

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
you know the flag itself is separates

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.730 
you know the flag itself is separates
from<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.090> man<00:01:12.299> what's<00:01:12.990> just<00:01:13.229> really<00:01:13.500> hanging

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
from the man what's just really hanging

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.510 
from the man what's just really hanging
in<00:01:13.920> police<00:01:14.250> there<00:01:15.530> the<00:01:16.530> packaging<00:01:17.189> is

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
in police there the packaging is

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.490 
in police there the packaging is
probably<00:01:17.939> one<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> best<00:01:19.020> things<00:01:19.320> about

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
probably one of the best things about

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.100 
probably one of the best things about
this<00:01:19.860> range<00:01:22.159> don't<00:01:23.159> know<00:01:23.340> whether<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.729> can

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
this range don't know whether you can

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.680 
this range don't know whether you can
see

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
see

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:34.950 
see
drop<00:01:26.690> it<00:01:26.840> in<00:01:29.470> cameras<00:01:30.470> not<00:01:30.820> so<00:01:31.820> great<00:01:33.580> um

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
drop it in cameras not so great um

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.890 
drop it in cameras not so great um
basically<00:01:35.960> it's<00:01:36.530> a<00:01:36.680> rather<00:01:36.980> large<00:01:37.310> box<00:01:37.900> it

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
basically it's a rather large box it

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.740 
basically it's a rather large box it
comes<00:01:39.140> in<00:01:39.530> much<00:01:40.520> larger<00:01:40.940> than<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.480> figure<00:01:41.920> and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
comes in much larger than the figure and

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.690 
comes in much larger than the figure and
you<00:01:44.750> know<00:01:44.900> it's<00:01:45.080> really<00:01:45.920> makes<00:01:46.220> it<00:01:46.370> different

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
you know it's really makes it different

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.570 
you know it's really makes it different
something<00:01:47.060> like<00:01:47.240> that<00:01:47.710> you<00:01:48.710> know<00:01:48.860> just<00:01:49.130> the
