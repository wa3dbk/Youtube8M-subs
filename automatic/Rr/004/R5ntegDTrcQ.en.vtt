down<00:02:10.640> into<00:02:10.910> this<00:02:11.209> drain<00:02:11.780> area<00:02:12.230> it's<00:02:13.040> obviously

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
down into this drain area it's obviously

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.750 
down into this drain area it's obviously
designed<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:14.150> drain<00:02:14.420> off<00:02:14.660> water<00:02:15.430> so<00:02:16.430> let's<00:02:16.610> put

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
designed to drain off water so let's put

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.130 
designed to drain off water so let's put
some<00:02:16.790> water<00:02:17.150> in<00:02:17.329> there<00:02:17.420> see<00:02:17.660> what<00:02:17.690> happened

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
some water in there see what happened

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.199 
some water in there see what happened
hey<00:02:18.739> how<00:02:18.860> about<00:02:18.890> that<00:02:19.099> I've<00:02:19.459> got<00:02:19.670> BMW<00:02:20.360> water

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
hey how about that I've got BMW water

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.150 
hey how about that I've got BMW water
this<00:02:23.209> is<00:02:23.450> because<00:02:24.129> I<00:02:25.129> belong<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.560> an<00:02:27.560> autocross

for the students at the events anyway
let's<00:02:38.660> pour<00:02:38.840> some<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:39.109> this<00:02:39.170> down<00:02:39.349> the<00:02:39.530> hall

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
let's pour some of this down the hall

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:49.380 
let's pour some of this down the hall
and<00:02:39.920> see<00:02:40.099> where<00:02:40.220> it<00:02:40.280> comes<00:02:40.459> out

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.510 

yeah<00:02:50.590> there<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.710> is<00:02:51.800> right<00:02:52.010> there

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:04.750 

cloning<00:02:55.520> it<00:02:55.610> down<00:02:56.230> new<00:02:57.230> look<00:03:02.260> well<00:03:03.610> there's<00:03:04.610> a

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
cloning it down new look well there's a

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.700 
cloning it down new look well there's a
little<00:03:05.000> cover<00:03:05.330> panel<00:03:05.810> here<00:03:06.020> but<00:03:06.200> obviously

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
little cover panel here but obviously

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.830 
little cover panel here but obviously
there's<00:03:06.920> a<00:03:07.010> drain<00:03:07.280> that<00:03:07.310> goes<00:03:07.670> down<00:03:10.660> you<00:03:11.660> get

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
there's a drain that goes down you get

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.530 
there's a drain that goes down you get
that<00:03:12.020> out<00:03:12.230> of<00:03:12.350> the<00:03:12.440> way<00:03:12.970> there's<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.060> drain<00:03:14.360> that

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
that out of the way there's a drain that

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.220 
that out of the way there's a drain that
goes<00:03:14.810> down<00:03:15.110> right<00:03:15.740> back<00:03:16.400> of<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:17.630> front<00:03:17.930> tire

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
goes down right back of the front tire

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.910 
goes down right back of the front tire
and<00:03:19.660> they<00:03:20.660> don't<00:03:20.840> run<00:03:21.050> a<00:03:21.080> little<00:03:21.410> tube<00:03:21.620> all<00:03:21.800> the

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
and they don't run a little tube all the

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.410 
and they don't run a little tube all the
way<00:03:22.010> down<00:03:22.190> to<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.400> ground<00:03:22.580> but<00:03:22.850> but<00:03:23.150> there's<00:03:23.330> a

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
way down to the ground but but there's a

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.290 
way down to the ground but but there's a
panel<00:03:23.780> here<00:03:24.020> but<00:03:24.170> it<00:03:24.290> comes<00:03:24.530> out<00:03:24.710> under<00:03:24.950> there

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
panel here but it comes out under there

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.530 
panel here but it comes out under there
so<00:03:26.300> that's<00:03:26.570> what<00:03:26.870> that<00:03:27.170> is<00:03:27.200> and<00:03:27.740> I<00:03:28.450> want<00:03:29.450> to

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
so that's what that is and I want to

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.290 
so that's what that is and I want to
tell<00:03:29.750> you<00:03:30.310> there's<00:03:31.310> nothing<00:03:31.520> in<00:03:31.850> the<00:03:32.000> owners

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
tell you there's nothing in the owners

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.470 
tell you there's nothing in the owners
manual<00:03:32.450> about<00:03:33.050> it<00:03:33.670> there<00:03:34.670> might<00:03:34.850> be<00:03:34.880> something

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
manual about it there might be something

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.510 
manual about it there might be something
in<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.660> factory<00:03:36.110> service<00:03:36.380> manual<00:03:36.560> but<00:03:37.280> I

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
in the factory service manual but I

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.180 
in the factory service manual but I
would<00:03:38.180> suggest<00:03:38.390> to<00:03:38.780> you<00:03:38.810> guys<00:03:39.080> to<00:03:39.380> check<00:03:39.680> that

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.590 

maybe<00:03:43.660> well<00:03:44.660> I<00:03:44.930> guess<00:03:45.800> it<00:03:45.950> depends<00:03:46.250> on<00:03:46.370> how

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
maybe well I guess it depends on how

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.960 
maybe well I guess it depends on how
fast<00:03:47.600> the<00:03:47.990> leaves<00:03:48.290> accumulate<00:03:49.010> you<00:03:49.580> might<00:03:49.760> do

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
fast the leaves accumulate you might do

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.820 
fast the leaves accumulate you might do
it<00:03:50.060> once<00:03:50.270> a<00:03:50.420> year<00:03:50.690> you<00:03:50.900> might<00:03:50.930> do<00:03:51.350> it<00:03:51.470> once<00:03:51.680> a

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
it once a year you might do it once a

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.470 
it once a year you might do it once a
month<00:03:51.860> depending<00:03:52.520> on<00:03:52.760> where<00:03:52.970> you<00:03:53.060> park<00:03:53.300> your

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
month depending on where you park your

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.550 
month depending on where you park your
car<00:03:53.980> but<00:03:54.980> here's<00:03:55.640> why<00:03:55.880> if<00:03:56.600> this<00:03:56.930> were<00:03:57.140> to<00:03:57.350> get

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
car but here's why if this were to get

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.830 
car but here's why if this were to get
clogged<00:03:58.010> up<00:03:58.370> in<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:59.690> water<00:03:59.930> were<00:04:00.260> to<00:04:00.820> backflow

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
clogged up in the water were to backflow

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.590 
clogged up in the water were to backflow
you<00:04:02.840> could<00:04:03.140> damage<00:04:03.760> some<00:04:04.760> of<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:05.000> electrical

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
you could damage some of the electrical

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.720 
you could damage some of the electrical
components<00:04:05.810> under<00:04:06.530> the<00:04:06.560> car<00:04:06.890> right<00:04:07.340> under<00:04:07.610> the

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
components under the car right under the

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.210 
components under the car right under the
hood<00:04:07.940> of<00:04:08.030> the<00:04:08.120> car

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
hood of the car

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.410 
hood of the car
die<00:04:10.690> I'm<00:04:11.690> sure<00:04:11.990> there's<00:04:12.350> some<00:04:12.680> modules<00:04:13.420> here

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
die I'm sure there's some modules here

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.190 
die I'm sure there's some modules here
it<00:04:14.570> could<00:04:14.780> also<00:04:14.989> flow<00:04:15.940> into<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.239> inside<00:04:17.870> the

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
it could also flow into the inside the

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.110 
it could also flow into the inside the
passenger<00:04:18.440> side<00:04:18.890> of<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.100> car<00:04:19.370> because<00:04:20.090> the

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
passenger side of the car because the

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.740 
passenger side of the car because the
water<00:04:20.450> could<00:04:20.690> get<00:04:20.810> up<00:04:20.959> pretty<00:04:21.140> high<00:04:22.630> you<00:04:23.630> know

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
water could get up pretty high you know

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.030 
water could get up pretty high you know
way<00:04:23.930> over<00:04:24.490> in<00:04:25.490> water<00:04:26.120> will<00:04:26.390> find<00:04:26.690> holes<00:04:26.930> to<00:04:27.860> go

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
way over in water will find holes to go

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.090 
way over in water will find holes to go
into<00:04:28.490> so<00:04:29.030> you<00:04:29.090> want<00:04:29.330> this<00:04:29.480> drain<00:04:30.380> area<00:04:30.770> to<00:04:30.950> be

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
into so you want this drain area to be

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.730 
into so you want this drain area to be
kept<00:04:31.280> kept<00:04:31.640> clear<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:32.570> I<00:04:32.930> would<00:04:33.080> suggest<00:04:33.260> dump

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
kept kept clear and I would suggest dump

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.470 
kept kept clear and I would suggest dump
a<00:04:33.800> little<00:04:34.040> water<00:04:34.250> in<00:04:34.550> each<00:04:34.730> side<00:04:35.060> there's<00:04:35.330> one

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
a little water in each side there's one

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.920 
a little water in each side there's one
on<00:04:35.600> the<00:04:35.690> other<00:04:35.720> side<00:04:35.930> there<00:04:36.440> same<00:04:37.310> as<00:04:37.340> this<00:04:37.669> one

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
on the other side there same as this one

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.710 
on the other side there same as this one
the<00:04:38.930> driver<00:04:39.200> side<00:04:39.500> and<00:04:39.650> passenger<00:04:39.890> side<00:04:40.720> clear

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
the driver side and passenger side clear

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.140 
the driver side and passenger side clear
them<00:04:41.840> out<00:04:41.960> of<00:04:42.140> any<00:04:42.230> debris<00:04:42.530> and<00:04:43.070> pour<00:04:44.000> little

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
them out of any debris and pour little
