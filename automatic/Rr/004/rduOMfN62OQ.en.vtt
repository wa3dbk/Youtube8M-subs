each<00:02:02.110> button<00:02:02.610> this<00:02:03.610> is<00:02:03.729> kind<00:02:03.970> of<00:02:04.030> similar<00:02:04.240> to

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
each button this is kind of similar to

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.780 
each button this is kind of similar to
the<00:02:04.750> Xbox<00:02:05.080> layout<00:02:05.560> now<00:02:05.710> so<00:02:05.950> it's<00:02:06.100> very<00:02:06.369> easy<00:02:06.640> to

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
the Xbox layout now so it's very easy to

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.089 
the Xbox layout now so it's very easy to
understand<00:02:07.510> again<00:02:08.229> you<00:02:08.409> can<00:02:08.619> change<00:02:08.830> it<00:02:09.069> to

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
understand again you can change it to

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.070 
understand again you can change it to
your<00:02:09.310> preference<00:02:09.849> and<00:02:10.090> but<00:02:10.659> I<00:02:10.690> think<00:02:10.899> it's<00:02:11.019> a

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
your preference and but I think it's a

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.809 
your preference and but I think it's a
lot<00:02:11.230> easier<00:02:11.409> to<00:02:11.590> understand<00:02:12.190> that<00:02:12.340> was<00:02:12.549> a

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
lot easier to understand that was a

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.849 
lot easier to understand that was a
great<00:02:13.060> addition<00:02:13.329> quit<00:02:14.170> without<00:02:14.290> saving<00:02:14.409> it

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:14.859 
great addition quit without saving it

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:16.379 
great addition quit without saving it

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
started playing minecraft and they used

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.309 
started playing minecraft and they used
to<00:03:41.609> just<00:03:41.790> be<00:03:41.970> wheat<00:03:42.180> so<00:03:42.450> that<00:03:42.870> is<00:03:42.989> a<00:03:43.019> great

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
addition moving on to the more exciting

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.599 
addition moving on to the more exciting
things<00:03:45.480> in<00:03:46.109> what<00:03:46.590> they<00:03:46.739> did<00:03:46.980> do<00:03:47.190> I'm<00:03:47.340> gonna<00:03:47.430> say

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
things in what they did do I'm gonna say

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.280 
things in what they did do I'm gonna say
the<00:03:47.730> best<00:03:47.940> last<00:03:48.299> amounts<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:48.720> do<00:03:48.870> of<00:03:49.019> tea<00:03:49.230> and

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
tea now you can actually see what

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.339 
tea now you can actually see what
happens<00:03:52.769> with<00:03:53.160> XP<00:03:53.849> now<00:03:54.030> if<00:03:54.450> it<00:03:54.630> lands<00:03:54.840> in<00:03:55.109> lava

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
happens with XP now if it lands in lava

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.379 
happens with XP now if it lands in lava
s<00:03:55.560> if<00:03:55.709> I<00:03:55.799> put<00:03:56.010> them<00:03:56.099> up<00:03:56.250> here<00:03:56.459> I<00:03:56.669> can't<00:03:57.120> kill<00:03:57.269> the

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
s if I put them up here I can't kill the

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:58.129 
s if I put them up here I can't kill the
people<00:03:57.720> Oh

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
people Oh

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.620 
people Oh
we<00:03:58.950> survived<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.459> calculative<00:04:00.239> know<00:04:00.359> why

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
we survived the calculative know why

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.210 
we survived the calculative know why
they<00:04:00.810> are<00:04:00.840> babies<00:04:01.260> all<00:04:01.620> right<00:04:01.769> so<00:04:01.889> if<00:04:01.950> I<00:04:02.010> kill

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
they are babies all right so if I kill

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.699 
they are babies all right so if I kill
him<00:04:02.400> you<00:04:03.120> can<00:04:03.269> see<00:04:03.419> that<00:04:03.569> the<00:04:03.660> actual<00:04:03.930> XP<00:04:04.470> now

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
him you can see that the actual XP now

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.750 
him you can see that the actual XP now
force<00:04:05.130> is<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.459> force<00:04:05.489> in<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.880> lava<00:04:07.459> it<00:04:08.459> bends

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
force is the force in the lava it bends

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.789 
force is the force in the lava it bends
that<00:04:09.540> was<00:04:09.660> a<00:04:09.690> very<00:04:09.900> slow<00:04:10.049> pace<00:04:10.260> initially<00:04:10.680> that

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
that was a very slow pace initially that

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.069 
that was a very slow pace initially that
again<00:04:11.040> that's<00:04:11.220> quickly<00:04:11.519> do<00:04:11.639> this<00:04:11.760> if<00:04:12.480> you<00:04:12.630> kill

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
again that's quickly do this if you kill

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.349 
again that's quickly do this if you kill
any<00:04:13.230> any<00:04:13.560> mob<00:04:13.739> and<00:04:13.889> it<00:04:13.980> lands<00:04:14.160> in<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.459> lava<00:04:14.669> or

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
any any mob and it lands in the lava or

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.569 
any any mob and it lands in the lava or
anything<00:04:15.750> in<00:04:16.049> terms<00:04:16.229> of<00:04:16.440> fire<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:16.889> burns<00:04:17.160> and

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
anything in terms of fire and burns and

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.129 
anything in terms of fire and burns and
so<00:04:18.000> that<00:04:18.120> was<00:04:18.209> a<00:04:18.239> lot<00:04:18.419> of<00:04:18.539> in<00:04:18.630> addition<00:04:18.900> that

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
so that was a lot of in addition that

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.379 
so that was a lot of in addition that
they<00:04:19.229> did<00:04:19.380> introduce<00:04:19.889> nothing<00:04:20.400> major<00:04:20.609> but<00:04:21.299> it

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
they did introduce nothing major but it

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.629 
they did introduce nothing major but it
is<00:04:21.510> good<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:21.870> have<00:04:22.019> in<00:04:22.289> your<00:04:22.470> game<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:22.919> last

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
is good to have in your game and last

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.760 
is good to have in your game and last
but<00:04:23.849> not<00:04:24.000> least<00:04:24.240> they<00:04:24.630> change<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.200> particles

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
but not least they change the particles

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.130 
but not least they change the particles
with<00:04:26.010> TNT<00:04:26.340> it<00:04:26.789> pretty<00:04:27.000> much<00:04:27.120> says<00:04:27.360> explosions

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
with TNT it pretty much says explosions

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.220 
with TNT it pretty much says explosions
or<00:04:28.320> not<00:04:28.650> are<00:04:28.860> now<00:04:29.130> more<00:04:29.370> explodey

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
or not are now more explodey

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.440 
or not are now more explodey
if<00:04:30.320> I<00:04:30.410> do<00:04:30.620> this<00:04:30.770> wait<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.490> see<00:04:31.700> the<00:04:31.880> particles

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
if I do this wait to see the particles

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.470 
if I do this wait to see the particles
that<00:04:32.510> they<00:04:32.690> have<00:04:32.870> introduced<00:04:33.380> this<00:04:34.330> look<00:04:35.330> at

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
that they have introduced this look at

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.780 
that they have introduced this look at
it<00:04:35.510> and<00:04:35.750> as<00:04:35.840> you<00:04:36.020> guys<00:04:36.170> can<00:04:36.620> see<00:04:36.920> they<00:04:37.430> now<00:04:37.580> have

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
it and as you guys can see they now have

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.060 
it and as you guys can see they now have
more<00:04:38.030> of<00:04:38.090> an<00:04:38.210> effect<00:04:38.300> in<00:04:38.840> terms<00:04:39.140> of<00:04:39.410> explosions

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
more of an effect in terms of explosions

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.340 
more of an effect in terms of explosions
now<00:04:40.310> I<00:04:40.340> know<00:04:40.460> that<00:04:40.580> was<00:04:40.700> a<00:04:40.730> whole<00:04:41.000> heap<00:04:41.240> of<00:04:41.350> TNT

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
now I know that was a whole heap of TNT

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.050 
now I know that was a whole heap of TNT
so<00:04:42.410> we're<00:04:42.620> gonna<00:04:42.740> do<00:04:42.950> here<00:04:43.190> is<00:04:43.400> I'm<00:04:43.580> gonna<00:04:43.820> grab

so we're gonna do here is I'm gonna grab
just<00:04:44.360> like<00:04:44.510> one<00:04:44.720> or<00:04:44.750> two<00:04:44.870> blocks<00:04:45.290> and<00:04:45.590> show<00:04:45.830> you

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
just like one or two blocks and show you

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.410 
just like one or two blocks and show you
that<00:04:46.130> even<00:04:46.460> with<00:04:46.490> one<00:04:46.880> or<00:04:47.120> two

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
that even with one or two

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.870 
that even with one or two
TNT<00:04:48.350> that<00:04:48.590> the<00:04:48.680> explosion<00:04:49.190> still<00:04:49.460> has<00:04:49.610> a<00:04:49.640> lot

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
TNT that the explosion still has a lot

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.330 
TNT that the explosion still has a lot
of<00:04:49.910> new<00:04:50.330> particles<00:04:50.900> which<00:04:51.080> is<00:04:51.200> good<00:04:51.440> so<00:04:51.710> as<00:04:52.190> you

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
of new particles which is good so as you

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.130 
of new particles which is good so as you
guys<00:04:52.490> can<00:04:52.670> see<00:04:52.730> here<00:04:53.090> watch<00:04:53.420> this<00:04:53.660> it<00:04:53.960> does<00:04:54.110> a

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
guys can see here watch this it does a

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.750 
guys can see here watch this it does a
whole<00:04:54.350> bunch<00:04:54.410> of<00:04:54.770> damage<00:04:54.980> for<00:04:55.430> their

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
whole bunch of damage for their

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.220 
whole bunch of damage for their
particles<00:04:56.210> look<00:04:56.330> awesome<00:04:56.570> so<00:04:56.900> as<00:04:56.960> you<00:04:57.050> guys

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
particles look awesome so as you guys

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.290 
particles look awesome so as you guys
can<00:04:57.440> see<00:04:57.500> there<00:04:57.830> there's<00:04:58.310> more<00:04:58.610> of<00:04:58.670> an<00:04:58.790> effect

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
can see there there's more of an effect

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.690 
can see there there's more of an effect
now<00:04:59.480> as<00:04:59.660> for<00:04:59.870> some<00:05:00.020> other<00:05:00.230> changes<00:05:00.830> it<00:05:01.490> says

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
now as for some other changes it says

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.040 
now as for some other changes it says
lots<00:05:01.940> of<00:05:02.090> fixes<00:05:02.480> and<00:05:02.630> tweaks<00:05:02.660> in<00:05:02.990> the

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
lots of fixes and tweaks in the

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.420 
lots of fixes and tweaks in the
controller<00:05:03.410> layout<00:05:03.680> which<00:05:03.830> I<00:05:03.920> did<00:05:04.160> show<00:05:04.400> you

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
controller layout which I did show you

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.060 
controller layout which I did show you
name<00:05:05.210> tags<00:05:05.540> are<00:05:05.750> visible<00:05:06.200> from<00:05:06.440> favor<00:05:06.740> away

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
name tags are visible from favor away

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.160 
name tags are visible from favor away
now<00:05:07.310> I<00:05:07.550> think<00:05:08.030> this<00:05:08.180> is<00:05:08.300> based<00:05:08.630> for

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
now I think this is based for
