00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:09.920
 great viewers and scheyla cras 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.160
 I'm a writer on the island's peak 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.290
 chubby catching and creating and creating 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.730
 of site health in portugal 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.550
 I'm here today to talk about the 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.900
 diabetes the best as I reviewed it had 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.320
 diabetes 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.540
 at the age of 22 he had several symptoms 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.930
 diabetes despite not use 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.579
 insulin has not been diagnosed with 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.660
 then I had a lot of symptoms and then 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.329
 I started to study literature 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:44.329
 medical sense that I realized this was 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:50.300
 at least one pre-diabetes, either 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:53.510
 whether it is too much hunger is your goal 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.179
 nation in excess of constant thirst and 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.820
 irritability chronic fatigue 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:59.659
 then these are some of the symptoms of 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.120
 diabetes 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.859
 So let's get a little better 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.630
 what is the difference between the two 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:12.680
 type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes is the 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.630
 inability of the pancreas to produce 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:19.880
 hormone called insulin 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:23.000
 he produced a lot or the zé or 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.689
 does not produce so the diabetic ends up 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.939
 needing insulin injected into it 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:32.180
 do this escort role of sugar 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.189
 even the native cells is already the 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.159
 contrary is usually what people 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:40.009
 flame of insulin resistance 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.759
 the pancreas produces insulin sometimes 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.829
 excessively only that 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.799
 she can not play the role of 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:52.270
 listen to sugar and chard and put 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.270
 literally the sugar in there 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.789
 physicians generally began to 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.429
 believe when he becomes a problem of 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.990
 diabetes a long time ago they saw 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:06.350
 which was a problem with blood sugar 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.509
 that the person suffers from high or 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.160
 either had a high cris and mine had 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.350
 too much sugar in the blood 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.470
 so they blamed sugar 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.540
 the problems only that sugar actually 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.120
 not a problem but fat as 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.420
 nowadays it is recognized in the 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.310
 scientific academy is abroad and 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.620
 by the leading medical authorities 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:33.170
 and nutrition in the actuality that I call 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:36.740
 of the Indian Masters Civilizations 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:42.290
 rojects like what some features that 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:44.180
 ends up if you want rural china all of them 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.880
 live by sugar 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:51.770
 only complex bean sugar 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.670
 Potato foods which are extremely rich in 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.040
 sugar 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.010
 only that faces this complex solution 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.940
 refined sugar but are still 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.170
 sugar 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.120
 though nowadays the sugar from 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.480
 fruits are to blame 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.580
 according to the ego there is and intake of 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.430
 even complex carbohydrates 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:17.480
 and in fact the bibi civilizations of 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:20.150
 complex sugar and even so at 80 and 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.210
 90 years old they do not know what this disease is 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.520
 so terrible at the present time is called 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.060
 diabetes 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.110
 so if you are diabetic 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.660
 you 're probably shortening your 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.820
 life in at least six years you have 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.240
 a greater chance of all mortalities 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.940
 an increased risk of an increase in 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.520
 probability of dying at all 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.210
 different types of other diseases 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:50.290
 double the risk of heart disease 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:53.860
 40% higher risk of cancer impotence 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:57.100
 among other complications such as 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.240
 the baptism is Argentina's problems 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.940
 among other problems 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.400
 good is much easier to try to understand the 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:08.480
 generally by its name 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:11.570
 and diabetes mellitus, which is 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.030
 the name of the disease means diabetes 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.770
 means passing through mellitus 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.400
 means honey 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.880
 so that's what we call the is to see 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:26.850
 what is called 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:31.480
 in glycol medicine jury ie 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:34.690
 sugar in the urine every diabetic passes meo 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.010
 through the urine or is written in the 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.610
 sugar when we are believing 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.870
 sugar should be properly 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.380
 used by our body is not 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:47.350
 being played out 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.660
 is that we have a problem and it's more 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.540
 interesting of all is that doctors 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.850
 arguing that most people 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.010
 unaware although in the state of the week 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.710
 great celebrity 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.240
 they show several as diverse 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.340
 scientific and medical research and 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.780
 current scientific research published in the 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:11.200
 leading scientific journals 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:14.350
 you can revert to 75% by 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.440
 75% of insulin use or even 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.630
 end up as completely within a 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.770
 week or two and a vegan diet 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.380
 healthy 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.450
 I'll talk more about her in the next 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.290
 video then how to know if you are 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.180

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.150
 beyond the symptoms that you yourself may 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.640
 to perceive in your daily life that your 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:37.630
 doctor can help diagnose 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:41.970
 you can take a blood glucose test on 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:46.090
 fasting or taking the amount of 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:51.360
 sugar in your fasting blood 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:56.230
 laboratory and fasting blood glucose is 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:58.390
 80 so you're healthy you do not have the 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.560
 who is called empress and very 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.890
 blood sugar

 doctors today 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:33.450

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.800
 diabetes video 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:40.620
 I live on a diet of fruits and vegetables 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:43.530
