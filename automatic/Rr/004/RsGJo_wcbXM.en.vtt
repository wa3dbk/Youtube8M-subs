step-by-step but just kind some pointers

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.770 
step-by-step but just kind some pointers
on<00:00:10.320> how<00:00:10.380> to<00:00:10.530> replace<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.190> antenna<00:00:11.730> mast<00:00:11.790> when

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
on how to replace the antenna mast when

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.990 
on how to replace the antenna mast when
it<00:00:12.960> with<00:00:13.170> when<00:00:13.769> it's<00:00:13.920> broken<00:00:14.309> inside<00:00:14.639> the

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
it with when it's broken inside the

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.790 
it with when it's broken inside the
antenna<00:00:15.680> motor<00:00:17.510> so<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.960> didn't<00:00:19.500> know<00:00:19.560> where<00:00:19.710> the

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
antenna motor so I didn't know where the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.240 
antenna motor so I didn't know where the
antenna<00:00:20.130> motor<00:00:20.340> was<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.730> thought<00:00:20.910> maybe<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.359> was

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
antenna motor was I thought maybe it was

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.730 
antenna motor was I thought maybe it was
inside<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.640> here<00:00:24.420> inside<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.380> engine<00:00:25.500> bay

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
inside in here inside the engine bay

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.410 
inside in here inside the engine bay
it's<00:00:26.070> not<00:00:26.340> it's<00:00:27.090> actually<00:00:27.920> inside<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.099> fender

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
it's not it's actually inside the fender

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.540 
it's not it's actually inside the fender
defender<00:00:30.420> well<00:00:30.570> it's<00:00:30.779> about<00:00:31.520> prob<00:00:32.520> about

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
defender well it's about prob about

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.000 
defender well it's about prob about
right<00:00:32.880> here<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.290> right<00:00:34.290> below<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.680> antenna

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
right here and right below the antenna

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.090 
right here and right below the antenna
probably<00:00:35.640> bout<00:00:35.730> 12<00:00:36.030> inches<00:00:36.300> or<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:36.860> so<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
probably bout 12 inches or so so the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.540 
probably bout 12 inches or so so the
best<00:00:38.550> way<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.790> do<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:40.200> get<00:00:40.829> inside<00:00:41.250> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
best way to do that to get inside the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.729 
best way to do that to get inside the
antenna<00:00:41.969> coil<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:45.590> untape<00:00:46.590> take<00:00:47.219> out<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.670> old

inside open that up take the old masked

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.160 
inside open that up take the old masked
out<00:01:59.490> that'll<00:01:59.969> look<00:02:00.090> like<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.479> probably<00:02:01.079> and

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
out that'll look like that probably and

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.480 
out that'll look like that probably and
put<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.290> motor<00:02:04.469> assembly<00:02:04.890> back<00:02:05.219> together

and<00:02:09.899> then<00:02:10.619> go<00:02:11.250> ahead<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:11.760> have<00:02:12.000> someone<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.750> did

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
and then go ahead and have someone I did

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.430 
and then go ahead and have someone I did
this<00:02:13.230> myself<00:02:13.440> but<00:02:14.190> go<00:02:14.670> ahead<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:14.910> pop<00:02:15.120> the

this myself but go ahead and pop the
turn<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.730> radio<00:02:17.730> on<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.510> them<00:02:18.690> so<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:20.300> antenna

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
turn the radio on so them so the antenna

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.980 
turn the radio on so them so the antenna
activates<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.200> then<00:02:22.800> it'll<00:02:23.550> you<00:02:24.510> can<00:02:24.690> feed<00:02:24.960> it

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
activates and then it'll you can feed it

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.530 
activates and then it'll you can feed it
in<00:02:25.290> feed<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.890> new<00:02:26.040> antenna<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:26.640> right<00:02:26.940> right

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
in feed the new antenna in right right

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.840 
in feed the new antenna in right right
here<00:02:27.840> have<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.260> put<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.590> in<00:02:28.740> and<00:02:28.920> then<00:02:29.040> stick<00:02:29.820> it

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
here have it put it in and then stick it

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.220 
here have it put it in and then stick it
back<00:02:30.090> up<00:02:30.270> in<00:02:30.420> here<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:32.690> there's<00:02:33.690> what<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.110> new

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
back up in here and there's what the new

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.590 
back up in here and there's what the new
one<00:02:34.380> looks<00:02:34.410> like<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:35.070> then<00:02:35.490> I'll<00:02:35.640> demonstrate

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
one looks like and then I'll demonstrate

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.840 
one looks like and then I'll demonstrate
it<00:02:37.050> here<00:02:38.150> works<00:02:39.150> perfect<00:02:41.690> all<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.810> way<00:02:42.900> up<00:02:43.110> and

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
it here works perfect all the way up and

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.360 
it here works perfect all the way up and
there<00:02:44.850> it<00:02:44.970> is<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.360> then<00:02:45.870> as<00:02:46.620> its<00:02:47.010> back<00:02:47.220> off<00:02:47.489> I

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
there it is and then as its back off I

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.010 
there it is and then as its back off I
am<00:02:50.370> NOT<00:02:50.610> mechanical<00:02:51.300> but<00:02:51.450> this<00:02:51.600> seemed<00:02:51.870> pretty

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
am NOT mechanical but this seemed pretty

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.120 
am NOT mechanical but this seemed pretty
easy<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.530> me<00:02:53.239> so<00:02:54.239> there<00:02:54.360> it<00:02:54.450> is<00:02:54.830> it<00:02:55.830> probably

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
easy to me so there it is it probably

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.510 
easy to me so there it is it probably
took<00:02:56.640> me<00:02:56.780> probably<00:02:57.780> about<00:02:58.230> an<00:02:58.470> hour<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:59.280> do<00:02:59.400> the

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
took me probably about an hour to do the

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.699 
took me probably about an hour to do the
whole<00:02:59.700> project<00:03:00.090> from<00:03:00.600> trying<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.380> figure<00:03:01.680> it

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
whole project from trying to figure it

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:02.620 
whole project from trying to figure it
out

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
out

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.729 
out
but<00:03:03.630> hopefully<00:03:04.110> this<00:03:04.380> will<00:03:04.470> give<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:04.680> a

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
but hopefully this will give you a

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.820 
but hopefully this will give you a
little<00:03:05.040> heads<00:03:05.370> up<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:05.850> little<00:03:06.630> heads<00:03:07.260> up<00:03:07.470> head

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
little heads up and little heads up head

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.220 
little heads up and little heads up head
start<00:03:08.160> on<00:03:08.310> what<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:09.060> what<00:03:09.600> I<00:03:09.630> was<00:03:09.840> doing<00:03:10.110> so

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
start on what I what I was doing so

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.660 
start on what I what I was doing so
maybe<00:03:10.470> you<00:03:10.590> can<00:03:10.739> get<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:10.980> done<00:03:11.070> in<00:03:11.250> 30<00:03:11.489> 40

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
maybe you can get it done in 30 40

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.660 
maybe you can get it done in 30 40
