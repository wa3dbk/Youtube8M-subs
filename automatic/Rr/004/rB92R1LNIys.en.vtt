middle the river and so on and for me
the<00:00:33.140> most<00:00:33.289> useful<00:00:33.590> type<00:00:33.949> of<00:00:34.100> net<00:00:34.250> for<00:00:34.430> that

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
the most useful type of net for that

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.180 
the most useful type of net for that
purpose<00:00:35.020> is<00:00:36.020> the<00:00:36.260> guy<00:00:36.410> net<00:00:36.620> the<00:00:36.769> salmon<00:00:37.039> guy

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
purpose is the guy net the salmon guy

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.130 
purpose is the guy net the salmon guy
net<00:00:37.399> the<00:00:38.179> sound<00:00:38.390> guy<00:00:38.539> net<00:00:38.719> comes<00:00:38.899> in<00:00:39.019> two

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
net the sound guy net comes in two

ask<00:00:43.069> us<00:00:43.309> well<00:00:43.550> how<00:00:43.579> do<00:00:43.729> you<00:00:43.819> put<00:00:43.940> it<00:00:44.030> together

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
ask us well how do you put it together

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.209 
ask us well how do you put it together
so<00:00:44.569> what<00:00:45.289> I<00:00:45.319> thought<00:00:45.440> I'd<00:00:45.559> do<00:00:45.710> is<00:00:45.769> just<00:00:46.010> briefly

so what I thought I'd do is just briefly
show<00:00:46.399> you<00:00:46.579> how<00:00:46.789> the<00:00:46.850> going<00:00:47.120> it<00:00:47.269> goes<00:00:47.449> together

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
show you how the going it goes together

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.610 
show you how the going it goes together

the water stood on your own out in the
middle<00:01:04.070> of<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.190> river<00:01:04.309> just<00:01:05.119> literally<00:01:05.420> clips

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
middle of the river just literally clips

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.050 
middle of the river just literally clips
off<00:01:05.930> very<00:01:06.500> simply<00:01:06.770> on<00:01:06.920> one<00:01:07.070> hand<00:01:07.340> and<00:01:07.610> that's

off very simply on one hand and that's

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.520 
off very simply on one hand and that's
the<00:01:08.270> big<00:01:08.420> benefit<00:01:08.810> of<00:01:08.900> the<00:01:08.960> guy<00:01:09.080> net<00:01:09.260> it's<00:01:09.410> a

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
the big benefit of the guy net it's a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.430 
the big benefit of the guy net it's a
one-handed<00:01:10.250> use<00:01:10.510> the<00:01:11.510> net<00:01:11.690> itself<00:01:11.990> will<00:01:12.200> slide

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
one-handed use the net itself will slide

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.150 
one-handed use the net itself will slide
down<00:01:12.470> down<00:01:13.190> the<00:01:13.310> handle<00:01:13.610> like<00:01:14.150> so<00:01:14.740> and<00:01:15.740> come<00:01:16.040> to

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
down down the handle like so and come to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.830 
down down the handle like so and come to
the<00:01:16.280> end<00:01:16.430> where<00:01:16.940> there's<00:01:17.150> a<00:01:17.210> screw<00:01:17.480> in<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.720> end

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
the end where there's a screw in the end

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.720 
the end where there's a screw in the end
of<00:01:17.930> this<00:01:17.990> handle<00:01:18.380> collects<00:01:19.070> the<00:01:19.250> operates<00:01:19.580> on

of this handle collects the operates on

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.490 
of this handle collects the operates on
a<00:01:19.760> flange<00:01:20.060> basis<00:01:20.510> and<00:01:20.780> actually<00:01:21.050> locks<00:01:21.290> the

a flange basis and actually locks the
net<00:01:21.680> on<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.490> end<00:01:22.610> so<00:01:22.730> it<00:01:22.790> doesn't<00:01:22.820> fall<00:01:23.210> off

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
net on the end so it doesn't fall off

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.390 
net on the end so it doesn't fall off
and<00:01:23.990> when<00:01:24.110> you<00:01:24.140> actually<00:01:24.290> get<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.770> net<00:01:24.950> in<00:01:25.160> the

downstream<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.480> sound<00:03:15.690> is<00:03:15.750> probably<00:03:15.989> going

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
downstream the sound is probably going

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.050 
downstream the sound is probably going
to<00:03:16.200> be<00:03:16.260> downstream<00:03:16.739> with<00:03:16.830> me<00:03:16.950> anyway<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.940> when

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
to be downstream with me anyway and when
