00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.230
 the theme of the great patriotic 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.280
 it seems they have exhausted the poppy and why not 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.370
 too long within that whit 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.049
 no local conflict people 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.890
 fiercely shot each other 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.830
 too many countries from the judges were stung and 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.380
 if someone is inspiring standing 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.030
 perennial meat grinder approached 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.360
 parasitized by dropping the sleeves 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.290
 on the topic here just do not reform this 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.009
 no seriousness 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:29.659
 We offer you a video review 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:32.300
 continue quickly 2 Khiva Stalingrad on 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.300
 background round rub 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.220
 the first thing that is striking presence 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.690
 single player mode 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.460
 before this was not 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.640
 immediately imagine a mass attack 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.730
 violently offensive or opposite the emphasis on 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.389
 defense 

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:49.199
 apartment massacre nightly sorties 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:50.870
 sniper doyle 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.620
 and all this in terms of ultra realism he 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.560
 walking from the lamps of Kiev but it was not there 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.210
 the drug frankly fumbled possums 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.270
 us under the guise of a story campaign on 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.690
 board ship cards 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.720
 for which the insane wounds of the nost bota 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.350
 moreover, we strongly 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.960
 recommend to pass on the ticket nicknames of these 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.780
 so to speak 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.610
 almost a third of the achievement tied 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.810
 exactly on single 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.590
 and what is even more insulting is the company for Russians 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.300
 available only after the completion of the German 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.540
 it is very very sad but we will not 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.550
 lose heart rador quickly never before 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.790
 This single did not climb single she always lived 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.790
 only network battles 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.859
 and yes all the salt in the form of the Spaniard 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:37.279
 in incessant multiplayer 

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:38.000
 battles 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.410
 heaps of specialization from simple cannon 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.140
 meat rifle steam grenades 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.650
 up to platoon commander armed to the teeth 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.360
 almost always in the death of a native bullet though 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.870
 case of a minor injury in the arm or 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.570
 leg can be bandaged 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.720
 close to real flight ballistics 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.740
 bullets gravity did you know 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.190
 value and so on everything has been repeatedly 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.180
 apparently 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.780
 time-tested however there are new 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.780
 series 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.490
 soldier morale 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.250
 when Putin's head starts to whistle 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.220
 more common when mortar suitcases 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.819
 hitting 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.260
 lie dangerously close your baez 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.599
 starts to worry a lot in the eyes of 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.389
 it darkens the surrounding floats 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:19.439
 drink does not want to focus 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.219
 not to say that it hurt much but 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:24.639
 it helps the best Russian soldier 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.190
 understand what it is 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.730
 be in the crucible of battlefield above your head 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.730
 you do not know slippers 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:35.979
 the second innovation was the shelter system 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:36.609
 Well 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.209
 where do without her 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.959
 as we could already be convinced by experience 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.859
 other first-person projects such 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:43.649
 tricks do not roll 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:46.479
 but here is a campfire blast 2 they donâ€™t even 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:48.959
 interfere infrequently but sometimes useful 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.999
 drop a wall to the deduction of benam 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:53.429
 or horror substitution ibaka trenches 

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:56.309
 taking cover your fighter is being tortured trying not 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:57.790
 shine body parts 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.770
 in fact from such a maneuver 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.040
 cold neither hot 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.720
 but it was redone and 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.720
 augmented game modes their three 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:09.019
 headlights fight almost good old kinder 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:09.529
 match 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:11.939
 with one forest honors sometimes the score may 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:14.639
 go not on prague anna human resources 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.319
 who quickly scooped the opportunity 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.839
 reinforcements who did you lose 

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:21.109
 territory phased capture points and 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:21.959
 to objects 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.179
 tense tactful mode what 

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:26.519
 noteworthy the total match time is often not 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.199
 attacking matters 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:30.159
 whips up and another timer requires 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:31.859
 move on to seize 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.059
 more aggressive 

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:34.899
 so much so that the defenders can 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:37.899
 strain and beat off a point or even two 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:40.540
 and landau 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.490
 regime combines the previous two 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.930
 it's fast and hard 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.500
 which fighters are defending 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.430
 teams not eligible for sunday 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.509
 until the end of the round 

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:52.009
 and the attacker can lift from the fallen to 

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:53.509
 attack wave another 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:55.369
 contractions in this mode of rapid and 

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:57.939
 require both personal skill and meticulous 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:00.939
 coordination of actions 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.859
 developed gras of sliding found engine 3 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:06.409
 the whole picture turned out very even 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:09.180
 nice beautiful rays of light shadow 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.249
 atmospheric city ruins 

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:13.589
 call locations just a good language 

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:15.539
 doesn't turn because literally 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:18.019
 each doll is worked here 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.340
 the position of each pothole and drawer 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.349
 thought out 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:24.610
 word and beautiful and wisely the same goes for 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.119
 the sound of a whistle crashing all this still 

00:04:27.119 --> 00:04:29.199
 juicy believable 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.689
 Moreover, the developers have gone 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:32.969
 on and probably made the most 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:35.539
 realistic dubbing in a blair fashion 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:36.270
 leaders 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.229
 what other igor Soviet soldiers 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:41.349
 can with such a fire such a text hold 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:42.590
 and swearing 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.240
 as a time unwritten words and poured 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.840
 I die now men believe if Russian 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.850
 called the enemy German bastards is the most 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.059
 gentle and sweet what he said 

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:55.459
 unfortunately this whole holiday is expensive 

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:57.429
 spoiled this is topical and dogs 

00:04:57.429 --> 00:05:00.279
 completely the game can fly almost to 

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:02.559
 any moment sometimes even without boot 

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:04.930
 plus optimization 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.039
 you know yo she is very strange 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.529
 the coupe jumps as he pleases without any 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:11.969
 reasons carter west premises can 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:13.969
 godless give back while on 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:16.259
 open spaces destroyed villages for example 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:18.530
 there will be no braking 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.790
 developers have already released a bunch of patches 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.770
 total bovine gigabyte 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.479
 but it seems this is just the beginning of work on 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:28.460
 mistakes 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.190
 p only 120 and the course of Stalingrad is very 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.050
 good excellent network modes 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.110
 great card design 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.580
 at the mouth of the atmosphere violently shooting with 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.949
 careful relationship realism 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:42.129
 this is tactful very good jokes 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:44.289
 earned high praise 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:47.389
 but the raw here is the unfinished look 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:50.509
 merchant allegedly single player campaign 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:52.360
 don't let i try 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.360
 good luck and give speeches to the program 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.180
 percent
