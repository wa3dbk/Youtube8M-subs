 a worker who therefore has a heavy job 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:26.469

 and full of everything ready for new hires for road sales is one 

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:48.199
 I wish the company saves a lot of money 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:51.219
 it is sold for salary sale 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:52.919

 0 € 70 per month the order 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.089
 for the maintenance of one yet, if 

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:06.650
 7 euros the previous month. hired worker 3 euros, six 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.109
 gross per month 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.809
 we are at the therapeutic fury against workers 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:14.769
 the most serious fact common 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:20.090
 and that if a worker decides over the course of his working life the bow 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.549
 working relationship 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.469
 d overcome to ask for more famous ones 

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:29.009
 I ask you to be respected it is said that the strike used because if 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:30.350
 risk strikes 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.419
 the dismissal 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.919
 so these are the things that are written 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.559
 for this reason 

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:38.360
 we are in presence 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.710
 I'm not gay 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.400
 a dump I miss a fierce violation 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.879
 the constitutional rights 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:51.620
 at this point italy 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.050
 returned 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.840
 main reasoning editor 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.790
 the fiat wants to produce 280,000 cars in the pomigliano plant in 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.979
 detail of the panda 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:09.050
 and I believe that trade union and while with it is to produce 280,000 high 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.849
 the fair can be done at this 280,000 cars with 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:15.659
 the three work shifts 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:19.949
 if I believe that the union must state how to make a restaurant work 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:26.259
 efficient company to make productive company a competitive company award 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.479
 what values ​​Italy supports but who said it 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.610
 that to do these things one must not have a letter to the slave 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:39.330
 because when you don't even know Milan 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.240
 to strike 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.979
 and look at that 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:45.849
 the strike does it a lot 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:47.960
 recovering from dreams 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:54.399
 earning 1150 euros a month that there is no one who strikes at all 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:59.300
 so it is clear that going to strike a fundamental right provided for 

00:05:59.299 --> 00:06:00.979
 constitutional free 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:04.190
 Italy of values ​​says dear marchionne 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:10.349
 seems to have it already who recognized you managed to act as a fiat 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:13.349
 a company that is a world market leader 

00:06:13.869 --> 00:06:18.490
 you see me not discussing in the newspapers you talk to the workers 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.490
 it will be because a worker be enslaved 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:27.200
 before or after the rebels and therefore the factory does not work 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.880
 because factories and offices work when workers do 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.600
 feel 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.789
 involved participant 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:38.419
 and finally the last data that we take as Italy, cover with text 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:45.119
 we have removed it in the past will never know how happy these were said 

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:49.369
 quote tires to keep us going back to work in Naples that they have 

00:06:49.369 --> 00:06:52.149
 sold the other 10,000 workers 

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:54.339
 penis goal to share 

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:57.930
 dvd when rossi is in conflict there is no minister 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:03.259
 and he called the parties he said come to my room you don't get liquid if 

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:05.099
 I'm 

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:06.569
 what does a lot 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:09.680
 saccone dark lake that 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.330
 he simply decided to give the fiat newspaper apart and insult 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.130
 workers 

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.710
 but this is not the minister of labor, this is the minister of precariousness 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.210
 in unemployment list 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.639
 text results work 

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:23.460
 therefore then 

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.939
 but that really is a blasphemy in the church equivalent 

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:33.369
 and this story and what government instead of calling the daughter the responsibility 

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:38.789
 for the union organization the game where there are already 50 takes part 

00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:41.789
 players against 2 50 favor of the fiat 

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:45.219
 in our heart the cesarean port guitar
