them<00:01:30.630> were<00:01:30.689> actually<00:01:31.110> penalties<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.159> guess

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
them were actually penalties so I guess

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.590 
them were actually penalties so I guess

period<00:03:02.720> do<00:03:02.900> not<00:03:03.200> do<00:03:03.470> it<00:03:03.620> do<00:03:04.310> not<00:03:04.489> take<00:03:04.670> that<00:03:04.910> but

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
period do not do it do not take that but

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.180 
period do not do it do not take that but
that<00:03:05.239> also<00:03:05.420> poses<00:03:05.750> a<00:03:05.870> problem<00:03:06.170> because<00:03:06.650> he<00:03:06.860> is

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
that also poses a problem because he is

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.250 
that also poses a problem because he is
a<00:03:07.220> right<00:03:07.670> wing<00:03:07.880> and<00:03:08.090> most<00:03:08.420> of<00:03:08.569> the<00:03:08.630> time<00:03:08.810> you're

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
a right wing and most of the time you're

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.870 
a right wing and most of the time you're
going<00:03:09.440> to<00:03:09.500> be<00:03:09.590> cutting<00:03:09.799> inside<00:03:10.220> with<00:03:10.700> that

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
going to be cutting inside with that

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.400 
going to be cutting inside with that
weak<00:03:11.120> foot<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:11.540> that<00:03:11.900> you're<00:03:12.019> most<00:03:12.200> likely

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
weak foot and that you're most likely

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.530 
weak foot and that you're most likely
going<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.709> try<00:03:13.430> to<00:03:13.459> finesse<00:03:13.760> what<00:03:14.390> an

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
going to try to finesse what an

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.390 
going to try to finesse what an
absolutely<00:03:15.019> incredible<00:03:15.080> shot<00:03:15.830> that<00:03:16.040> was<00:03:16.190> I

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
absolutely incredible shot that was I

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.550 
absolutely incredible shot that was I
mean<00:03:16.819> that<00:03:17.239> was<00:03:17.510> pretty<00:03:17.870> much<00:03:17.989> a<00:03:18.049> long<00:03:18.320> shot

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
mean that was pretty much a long shot

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.140 
mean that was pretty much a long shot
and<00:03:18.799> it<00:03:18.859> was<00:03:18.980> right<00:03:19.160> on<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.370> ground<00:03:19.579> as<00:03:19.760> a<00:03:19.790> worm

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
and it was right on the ground as a worm

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
hit or miss with him that seemed the

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.590 
hit or miss with him that seemed the
same<00:03:46.160> exact<00:03:46.400> way<00:03:46.579> of<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:46.760> week<00:03:46.880> but<00:03:47.060> he<00:03:47.420> scored

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
same exact way of the week but he scored

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.030 
same exact way of the week but he scored
some<00:03:47.780> really<00:03:47.989> nice<00:03:48.170> goals<00:03:48.410> from<00:03:48.500> me<00:03:48.680> with<00:03:48.920> his

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
some really nice goals from me with his

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.620 
some really nice goals from me with his
weak<00:03:49.250> foot<00:03:49.489> but<00:03:49.850> then<00:03:50.000> there<00:03:50.180> were<00:03:50.239> some<00:03:50.420> times

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
weak foot but then there were some times

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.569 
weak foot but then there were some times
when<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:51.019> shots<00:03:51.319> were<00:03:51.440> absolutely<00:03:52.130> terrible

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
when the shots were absolutely terrible

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.490 
when the shots were absolutely terrible
so<00:03:52.880> it<00:03:53.209> was<00:03:53.359> kind<00:03:53.540> of<00:03:53.600> a<00:03:53.690> hit<00:03:53.840> or<00:03:53.959> miss<00:03:53.989> you

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
so it was kind of a hit or miss you

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.259 
so it was kind of a hit or miss you
didn't<00:03:54.829> really<00:03:54.950> know<00:03:55.130> what<00:03:55.160> to<00:03:55.280> expect<00:03:55.370> but

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
didn't really know what to expect but

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.520 
didn't really know what to expect but
when<00:03:56.420> he<00:03:56.510> do<00:03:56.660> put<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:56.930> ball<00:03:57.079> on<00:03:57.109> his<00:03:57.350> right

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
when he do put the ball on his right

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.890 
when he do put the ball on his right
foot<00:03:57.680> you<00:03:57.980> were<00:03:58.100> gonna<00:03:58.310> score<00:03:58.639> no<00:03:59.120> 9<00:03:59.420> out<00:03:59.630> of<00:03:59.660> 10

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
foot you were gonna score no 9 out of 10

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.319 
foot you were gonna score no 9 out of 10
times<00:04:00.200> every<00:04:00.859> single<00:04:01.160> time<00:04:01.370> and<00:04:01.579> as<00:04:01.970> some<00:04:02.209> of

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
times every single time and as some of

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:03.309 
times every single time and as some of
the<00:04:02.389> goalkeepers<00:04:02.870> that<00:04:02.989> I<00:04:03.019> was<00:04:03.200> playing

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319

against this guy which I was absolutely

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.180 
against this guy which I was absolutely
mind-blowing<00:04:08.780> about<00:04:09.079> so<00:04:09.380> another<00:04:09.920> thing<00:04:10.010> I

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
mind-blowing about so another thing I

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.800 
mind-blowing about so another thing I
want<00:04:10.370> to<00:04:10.430> bring<00:04:10.609> up<00:04:10.670> is<00:04:10.850> his<00:04:11.030> positioning<00:04:11.630> when

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
want to bring up is his positioning when

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.569 
want to bring up is his positioning when
it<00:04:11.930> does<00:04:12.079> come<00:04:12.290> to<00:04:12.470> right-wing<00:04:12.680> typically

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
it does come to right-wing typically

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.819 
it does come to right-wing typically
guys<00:04:13.760> as<00:04:14.000> you<00:04:14.030> know<00:04:14.389> he<00:04:14.690> is<00:04:14.840> come<00:04:15.170> he<00:04:15.440> comes<00:04:15.709> to

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
guys as you know he is come he comes to

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.979 
guys as you know he is come he comes to
the<00:04:15.889> default<00:04:16.310> right<00:04:16.880> mid<00:04:17.150> and<00:04:17.359> so<00:04:17.840> that's

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
the default right mid and so that's

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.569 
the default right mid and so that's
obviously<00:04:18.200> where<00:04:18.620> he<00:04:18.769> is<00:04:18.859> supposed<00:04:19.010> to<00:04:19.340> play

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
obviously where he is supposed to play

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.250 
obviously where he is supposed to play
he<00:04:19.970> doesn't<00:04:20.269> hide<00:04:20.389> many<00:04:20.630> more<00:04:20.870> crates<00:04:21.109> which

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
he doesn't hide many more crates which

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.440 
he doesn't hide many more crates which
definitely<00:04:21.620> play<00:04:21.919> into<00:04:22.280> your<00:04:22.310> benefit<00:04:22.909> but

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
one of the things that I was really

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.620 
one of the things that I was really
concerned<00:04:25.370> about<00:04:25.820> was<00:04:26.300> the

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
concerned about was the

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.350 
concerned about was the
his<00:04:27.020> glistening<00:04:27.230> he<00:04:27.650> tended<00:04:28.160> to<00:04:28.610> run<00:04:28.850> very

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
his glistening he tended to run very

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.390 
his glistening he tended to run very
very<00:04:29.660> wide<00:04:29.960> so<00:04:30.320> if<00:04:30.560> you're<00:04:30.860> trying<00:04:31.070> to<00:04:31.190> score

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
very wide so if you're trying to score

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.250 
very wide so if you're trying to score
goals<00:04:31.460> to<00:04:31.760> this<00:04:31.910> guy<00:04:32.090> it<00:04:32.810> is<00:04:32.930> a<00:04:32.960> little<00:04:33.080> bit

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
goals to this guy it is a little bit

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.780 
goals to this guy it is a little bit
difficult<00:04:33.470> he's<00:04:34.130> probably<00:04:34.280> more<00:04:34.550> meant

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
difficult he's probably more meant

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.330 
difficult he's probably more meant
across<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.300> ball<00:04:35.450> in<00:04:35.630> 86<00:04:36.410> piece<00:04:36.620> and<00:04:36.860> you<00:04:37.250> know

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
across the ball in 86 piece and you know

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.790 
across the ball in 86 piece and you know
obviously<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:37.940> 84<00:04:38.360> passing<00:04:38.810> both<00:04:39.260> stats<00:04:39.590> are

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
obviously the 84 passing both stats are

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.410 
obviously the 84 passing both stats are
very<00:04:40.070> very<00:04:40.310> solid<00:04:40.790> as<00:04:40.910> you<00:04:41.030> can<00:04:41.210> tell<00:04:41.390> right

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
very very solid as you can tell right

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.660 
very very solid as you can tell right
there<00:04:41.600> on<00:04:41.870> the<00:04:41.900> car<00:04:42.230> so<00:04:42.680> he<00:04:42.860> will<00:04:43.100> be<00:04:43.130> able<00:04:43.310> to

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
there on the car so he will be able to

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.610 
there on the car so he will be able to
you<00:04:43.970> know<00:04:44.090> cross<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.510> ball<00:04:44.690> and<00:04:44.840> for<00:04:44.960> you<00:04:45.140> but

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
you know cross the ball and for you but

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.860 
you know cross the ball and for you but
he<00:04:45.800> does<00:04:46.010> tend<00:04:46.310> to<00:04:46.370> run<00:04:46.550> extremely<00:04:47.090> wide<00:04:47.600> and

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
he does tend to run extremely wide and

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.900 
he does tend to run extremely wide and
obviously<00:04:48.470> his<00:04:48.740> weak<00:04:49.010> but<00:04:49.220> is<00:04:49.400> his<00:04:49.550> left<00:04:49.730> foot

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
obviously his weak but is his left foot

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.730 
obviously his weak but is his left foot
so<00:04:50.240> when<00:04:50.360> you<00:04:50.450> are<00:04:50.630> cutting<00:04:50.870> in<00:04:51.110> with<00:04:51.530> him

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
so when you are cutting in with him

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.860 
so when you are cutting in with him
since<00:04:52.040> he<00:04:52.130> is<00:04:52.250> a<00:04:52.280> right<00:04:52.580> wing<00:04:52.790> I'll<00:04:53.150> it<00:04:53.510> is<00:04:53.720> a

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
since he is a right wing I'll it is a

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.420 
since he is a right wing I'll it is a
little<00:04:54.020> bit<00:04:54.170> difficult<00:04:54.440> but<00:04:54.980> make<00:04:55.220> sure<00:04:55.250> you
