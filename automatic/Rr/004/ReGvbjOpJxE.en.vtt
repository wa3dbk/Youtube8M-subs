my Vulcan blood and I think this likely
then<00:02:33.190> attack<00:02:33.700> becomes<00:02:34.120> even<00:02:34.330> more<00:02:34.360> imperative

then attack becomes even more imperative

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.470 
then attack becomes even more imperative
and<00:02:35.320> this<00:02:36.280> character<00:02:36.790> will<00:02:36.910> be<00:02:36.940> a<00:02:37.090> constant

find it possible to understand spunk and

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.490 
find it possible to understand spunk and
in<00:06:47.310> perhaps<00:06:48.310> some<00:06:48.700> moments<00:06:49.450> admire<00:06:49.840> spock<00:06:50.320> and
