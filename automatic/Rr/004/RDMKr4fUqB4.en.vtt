00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.490
 Hello 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.749
 i was angry factory 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:10.809
 and once again would like to do 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.829
 fountain 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:14.829
 share information make my career 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:17.019
 I'm in May, Chinese 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:18.529
 that is, on the topic 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.259
 Togo 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:22.639
 On one for those people perhaps 

00:00:22.639 --> 00:00:25.499
 which they do not believe 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:28.499
 and the police that you can 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.359
 confront man words 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.600
 but spent take away and all that 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.180
 means 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.000
 that's just to teach 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.120
 percent 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.640
 he is chinese 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.760
 little 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.540
 so that you understand how 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.360
 Maliki here for comparison the stove 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.480
 slaves 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.260
 blade length 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.480
 Well, you see 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.030
 to hurry about five humpbacks 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.340
 centimeters 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.840
 here however 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.720
 now on viewing 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.120
 on a simple example, take 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.140
 a piece of chicken is 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.030
 in the usual outskirts 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.360
 As you can see 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.020
 means 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.020
 loud feed 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.060
 such caps the Karpachev community speak 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.710
 structure you see 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.670
 by thickness 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.880
 if you compare 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.320
 it is clear that for such a gesture 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.680
 here if again, well, just you look 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.100
 what can be done 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.310
 but with such a small knife 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.920
 chinese knife 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.200
 that is, it is the docking let's say so under 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.600
 a knife about how much and why 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.730
 who needs working condition 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.420
 absolutely authorized 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.020
 for wearing 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.800
 the children survived but wait 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.100
 however yogurt is there I don't know 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.910
 just 5 pennies but 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.770
 let's get a look 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.580
 what will happen 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.200
 while it happens 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.680
 with a piece of this meat which is structured 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.740
 looks like 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.410
 then the human race is natural 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.680
 factory 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.280
 what will happen 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.000
 when we discussed 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.410
 in addition, besides, I will not Transbaikalians 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.969
 will beat 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:11.609
 vinegar and will do very short 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:13.139
 movements 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:14.999
 and here I will end at this distance 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:15.960
 literally 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.099
 but it looks like what happens to that 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.589
 piece of meat 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:22.589
 but let's see 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.769
 the picture is very short 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.899
 eu countries 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:37.259
 to these cities of revda in the outback 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:40.259
 the depth turned out 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.339
 cube here 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:45.039
 depth delirium 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:48.189
 such 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.100
 but now if people show 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.100
 somewhere gone 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.679
 like politicians 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.679
 Means Chinese legs and father 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.829
 so guys 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.129
 be careful of the main let's 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.969
 once motors 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:14.199
 so here it is in the film everything was all 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:16.889
 did happen can also immediately prize 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.409
 places 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:20.309
 give another look swing 

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:22.639
 there was practically no nomination very 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.029
 short 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:27.029
 one more time first 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:33.279
 now since now 

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:35.349
 wine cottages 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.419
 short movement 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:41.419
 everything is absolutely cut on the shoulder 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:45.629
 the trip 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.669
 this is a simple movement without smell 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:50.749
 depth again look 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:52.799
 depth is useful 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.799
 by value 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.799
 well, almost all these two ships 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.979
 here and write 

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.979
 where and how can it enter 

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:07.869
 so let's not after all 

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:09.059
 laugh 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:10.679
 let's welcome to 

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:12.259
 reality 

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:14.169
 Me too 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:16.889
 absolutely assures that the knife 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.180
 this is a very dangerous weapon so i 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.579
 now got a knife have the opportunity 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.579
 you run away headlong 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.340
 Nikitinu laughing 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.900
 how remarkably easy to add 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.629
 knife 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:31.409
 you see what happens with the piece 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:32.110
 meat 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.229
 and it could be your hands here 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.990
 imagine if you understand so rub 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.969
 the more movement is very short 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:41.549
 but with easy enough but 

00:04:41.549 --> 00:04:43.179
 imagine if the decline popov 

00:04:43.179 --> 00:04:44.279
 lose 

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:46.699
 so what good luck 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.449
 I wish not to fall anyway 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.180
 situations are especially difficult 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.110
 thank you for your attention the guy was 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.880
 until next time
