00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.140
 she is around the birth of Jesus Christ his 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.430
 coming into the world is the main reason 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.409

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:14.880
 this month but behind this all is very 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:18.000
 such an ugly little story 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.780
 when christ did not even know where to be born 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.240
 when Mary and Joseph searched the manger 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.790
 at least give birth to a child because it came 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.810
 it's time to be born and indeed he 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.360
 came to the world and the holiday that we 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.420
 today we celebrate with gifts with good 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.250
 mood music all the scenery and 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.790
 all the others personally cost him very much 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.820
 high price 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.030
 large cost price of suffering incarnation 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.840
 son of god in a normal human body 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.659
 then with all that we have so much 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.650
 good in this christmas season and so 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.380

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.549

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.280
