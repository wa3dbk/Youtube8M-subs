00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
anyway so I didn't have that so I just

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.670 
anyway so I didn't have that so I just
used<00:01:32.310> normal<00:01:32.700> just<00:01:32.880> meeting<00:01:33.210> right<00:01:33.869> okay<00:01:34.619> so

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
used normal just meeting right okay so

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.550 
used normal just meeting right okay so
next<00:01:34.950> step<00:01:35.190> is<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.580> add<00:01:35.760> in<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.060> cheese<00:01:36.530> okay

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.999 
it's terrible for the mob effort yeah I
would<00:02:00.479> say<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.840> it's<00:02:00.960> quite<00:02:01.170> effortless<00:02:01.710> you

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
would say that it's quite effortless you

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.889 
would say that it's quite effortless you
just<00:02:02.250> have<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.430> basically<00:02:02.700> dice<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.509> garlic

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
just have to basically dice the garlic

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.260 
just have to basically dice the garlic
and<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.170> onions<00:02:05.030> mmm

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
and the onions mmm

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.540 
and the onions mmm
yeah<00:02:06.600> that's<00:02:06.840> about<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.410> everything<00:02:08.130> else<00:02:08.310> is

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
yeah that's about it everything else is

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.889 
yeah that's about it everything else is
that<00:02:08.580> question<00:02:09.090> for<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.450> guess<00:02:09.660> what<00:02:09.810> the

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
that question for so I guess what the

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.810 
that question for so I guess what the
amount<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.289> effort<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.830> really<00:02:11.039> not<00:02:11.280> better<00:02:11.519> so

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
amount of effort is really not better so

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.449 
amount of effort is really not better so
this<00:02:12.269> recipe<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:12.840> for<00:02:13.080> cooking<00:02:13.800> potato<00:02:14.160> chips

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
this recipe is for cooking potato chips

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.490 
this recipe is for cooking potato chips
in<00:02:14.610> your<00:02:14.640> microwave<00:02:15.120> apparently<00:02:15.810> supposed<00:02:16.200> to

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
in your microwave apparently supposed to

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.800 
in your microwave apparently supposed to
work<00:02:16.709> so<00:02:17.250> it's<00:02:17.730> very<00:02:17.910> easy<00:02:18.030> what<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.570> have<00:02:18.690> to

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
work so it's very easy what you have to

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.770 
work so it's very easy what you have to
do<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.380> basically<00:02:19.640> slice<00:02:20.640> your<00:02:21.120> potato

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
do is to basically slice your potato

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.920 
do is to basically slice your potato
really<00:02:22.560> really<00:02:23.040> thin<00:02:23.280> like<00:02:23.550> this<00:02:23.580> so<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.420> try<00:02:24.780> my

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
really really thin like this so I try my

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.990 
really really thin like this so I try my
best<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:25.590> this<00:02:25.890> is<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.160> thickness<00:02:26.340> down<00:02:26.700> here

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
best so this is the thickness down here

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000 
best so this is the thickness down here
if<00:02:27.239> you<00:02:27.510> have<00:02:27.870> something<00:02:28.230> called<00:02:28.500> mandolin

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
if you have something called mandolin

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.069 
if you have something called mandolin
slicer<00:02:29.160> it's<00:02:29.760> supposed<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.180> be<00:02:30.360> more<00:02:30.510> uniform

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
slicer it's supposed to be more uniform

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:32.930 
slicer it's supposed to be more uniform
and<00:02:31.260> maybe<00:02:31.530> thinner<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:32.370> first<00:02:32.640> thing<00:02:32.790> you're

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
and maybe thinner the first thing you're

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.390 
and maybe thinner the first thing you're
supposed<00:02:33.269> to<00:02:33.329> do<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.989> cook<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.500> chips<00:02:35.160> in

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
supposed to do is to cook the chips in

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.030 
supposed to do is to cook the chips in
olive<00:02:36.060> oil<00:02:36.269> put<00:02:36.780> in<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.989> bit<00:02:37.140> of<00:02:37.260> salt<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:37.950> I'm

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
olive oil put in a bit of salt so I'm

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.860 
olive oil put in a bit of salt so I'm
going<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.220> mix<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.579> up<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:39.060> recipe<00:02:39.480> also<00:02:39.570> says

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
going to mix it up the recipe also says

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.690 
going to mix it up the recipe also says
we're<00:02:40.079> supposed<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.560> use<00:02:40.769> a<00:02:40.799> cooking<00:02:41.250> spray<00:02:41.519> on

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
we're supposed to use a cooking spray on

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.789 
we're supposed to use a cooking spray on
your<00:02:41.820> plate<00:02:42.090> but<00:02:42.900> I'm<00:02:43.170> not<00:02:43.290> gonna<00:02:43.440> bother<00:02:43.680> with

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
your plate but I'm not gonna bother with

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.820 
your plate but I'm not gonna bother with
that

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
that

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.680 
that
so<00:02:46.310> next<00:02:46.520> I'm<00:02:46.760> supposed<00:02:47.090> to<00:02:47.120> put<00:02:47.300> it<00:02:47.390> into<00:02:47.480> the

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
so next I'm supposed to put it into the

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.080 
so next I'm supposed to put it into the
microwave<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:48.500> put<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:49.520> in<00:02:49.610> for<00:02:49.730> two<00:02:49.910> to<00:02:50.060> three

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
microwave and put it in for two to three

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.090 
microwave and put it in for two to three
minutes<00:02:50.390> but<00:02:50.810> it<00:02:51.020> really<00:02:51.500> depends<00:02:51.920> on<00:02:52.010> the

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
minutes but it really depends on the

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.340 
minutes but it really depends on the
thickness<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:53.000> microwave<00:02:53.420> power<00:02:53.630> so

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
thickness and the microwave power so

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.630 
thickness and the microwave power so
basically<00:02:54.710> you<00:02:54.920> just<00:02:55.100> have<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.310> keep<00:02:55.490> checking

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
basically you just have to keep checking

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.310 
basically you just have to keep checking
if<00:02:55.970> you<00:02:56.090> stuff<00:02:56.300> it<00:02:56.420> Brown<00:02:56.660> you're<00:02:56.930> supposed<00:02:57.230> to

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
if you stuff it Brown you're supposed to

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.170 
if you stuff it Brown you're supposed to
flip<00:02:57.500> it<00:02:57.680> over<00:02:57.800> and<00:02:58.310> you<00:02:58.640> don't<00:02:58.820> do<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.060> other

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
flip it over and you don't do the other

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.740 
flip it over and you don't do the other
side<00:03:00.550> so<00:03:01.550> this<00:03:01.730> is<00:03:01.850> what<00:03:02.030> it<00:03:02.090> looks<00:03:02.240> like<00:03:02.390> after

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
side so this is what it looks like after

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.200 
side so this is what it looks like after
three<00:03:02.900> minutes<00:03:03.140> it's<00:03:03.980> not<00:03:04.220> brown<00:03:04.610> it<00:03:05.060> is

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
three minutes it's not brown it is

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.970 
three minutes it's not brown it is
really<00:03:06.170> soggy

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
really soggy

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.980 
really soggy
just<00:03:07.580> put<00:03:07.820> in<00:03:08.030> for<00:03:08.240> another<00:03:08.390> two<00:03:08.690> minutes

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
just put in for another two minutes

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:16.030 
just put in for another two minutes
something<00:03:10.720> whoa<00:03:15.040> now

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
something whoa now

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.160 
something whoa now

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
they're chips

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.250 
they're chips
oopsy-daisy<00:03:18.500> I<00:03:19.100> think<00:03:19.820> the<00:03:20.480> recipe<00:03:20.870> did<00:03:21.050> ask

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.990 
me to oil the plate which I set you know
3d<00:03:24.260> carbon<00:03:24.590> or<00:03:24.800> why<00:03:25.040> don't<00:03:25.250> you<00:03:25.370> do<00:03:25.580> that<00:03:25.760> so<00:03:25.940> I
