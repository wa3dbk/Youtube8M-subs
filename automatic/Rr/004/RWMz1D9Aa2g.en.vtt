00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:13.139
 and then good personal beauty in the tutorial 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.049
 today I'm going to teach you how 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.439
 create a bootable USB stick to install 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.910
 windows 7 is a tutorial that was in the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.119
 my old channel 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.279
 however it was with other software I solved 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.710
 make this video again with the 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.420
 software because easier software 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.420
 to perform this procedure 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.120
 Good, I'll leave you to download the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.480
 windows 7 iso on my site this is the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.480
 iso 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.550
 you must have a pen drive with no 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.250
 minimum six gigs 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.539
 I do not think there is a pen drive with 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.399
 five gigs 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.219
 so you should have a pen drive with 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.469
 six days minimum 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.949
 as you can see here he has more 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.879
 than four gigabytes a bit more than 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.250
 what four books 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.740
 then the 4gb pen drive will either not be 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.350
 enough to install windows 7 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.350
 Alright, good 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.900
 software will be on the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.740
 description is self-executing you do not 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.690
 need to install at that moment you already 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.240
 Plug the pen drive into your computer 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.409
 [Music] 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:37.380
 after plugging you start the software 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:39.049
 click run click here below 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.210
 in this option 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.289
 and here you will select the one where the 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.710
 your pendrive 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:51.240
 in my case it is here on disk g 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.179
 you should check this option for 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.560
 format your pendrive 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.880
 if you have anything you need 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.990
 to be saved 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.429
 you save because before because 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.210
 was able to install windows 7 on the pen 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.850
 drive 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.590
 it will have to format everything that is 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.649
 contained in the pendrive then you mark 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.030
 this option 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.380
 here you will select your 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.140
 computer 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.540
 What are you going to put on that? 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.560
 Our case is from windows 7 so you go 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.870
 down to the bottom is that you will have the option 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.930
 much to addictions 7 and 8 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.609
 You select and here you go. 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.700
 Select where is this in your 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:36.160
 computer you want here in browser 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.819
 and will look for where is this in your 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.489
 computer 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.410
 in my case it's here that's all that 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:46.950
 I'm using the same one that you're going 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.950

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.769

 then install windows on the 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.170
 your pendrive 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.519
 When you finish this procedure, 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.970
 appear to you if you want 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:13.299
 add another iso to your pendrive 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.019
 if you have a pen drive with enough 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.720
 space 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:20.890
 you can put more than one system 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:24.459
 such as windows 8.1 but not 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:28.720
 if we install here only you 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:31.420
 will click on ends done this the windows 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.230

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.069
 for you to format the computer is fine 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.799
