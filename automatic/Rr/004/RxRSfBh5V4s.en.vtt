just like this so put one here one the
other<00:01:48.450> direction<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:49.170> can<00:01:49.350> actually<00:01:49.500> remove

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
other direction you can actually remove

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.249 
other direction you can actually remove
it<00:01:50.070> as<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.430> need<00:01:50.610> if<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.180> want<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.450> do<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.780> so

it as you need if you want to do that so

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.810 
it as you need if you want to do that so
that's<00:01:52.530> another<00:01:52.710> option<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.340> third<00:01:53.610> option

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
that's another option the third option

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.450 
that's another option the third option
is<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.540> comes<00:01:54.720> with<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> magnetic<00:01:55.409> base<00:01:55.799> trip<00:01:56.159> so

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
is it comes with a magnetic base trip so

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.490 
is it comes with a magnetic base trip so
you<00:01:56.880> just<00:01:57.090> put<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.450> on<00:01:57.659> here<00:01:57.899> pull<00:01:58.140> off<00:01:58.320> them

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
you just put this on here pull off them

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.670 
you just put this on here pull off them
pull<00:01:59.460> off<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.729> backing<00:01:59.939> here<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.680> right

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
pull off the backing here and right

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.100 
pull off the backing here and right
there<00:02:01.829> sars<00:02:02.490> backwards<00:02:03.030> thrown<00:02:03.540> on<00:02:03.659> here<00:02:03.930> and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
there sars backwards thrown on here and

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.600 
there sars backwards thrown on here and
you<00:02:04.259> can<00:02:04.380> stick<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.710> on<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.890> metal<00:02:05.070> services

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
you can stick it on the metal services

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.760 
you can stick it on the metal services
so<00:02:06.030> they're<00:02:06.329> on<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.479> fridge<00:02:06.840> step<00:02:07.259> throw<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.649> on

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
so they're on a fridge step throw it on

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.100 
so they're on a fridge step throw it on
you<00:02:08.399> know<00:02:08.520> your<00:02:08.879> metal<00:02:09.300> toolbox<00:02:09.539> anywhere

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
you know your metal toolbox anywhere

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.340 
you know your metal toolbox anywhere
where<00:02:10.289> there's<00:02:10.470> there's<00:02:10.830> metal

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
where there's there's metal

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.310 
where there's there's metal
you<00:02:11.860> put<00:02:12.130> it<00:02:12.220> on<00:02:12.310> there<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:13.750> that's<00:02:13.990> really

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
you put it on there so that's really

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.470 
you put it on there so that's really
what<00:02:14.560> makes<00:02:14.770> this<00:02:15.010> unique<00:02:15.220> on<00:02:15.670> bonus<00:02:16.150> is<00:02:16.330> it

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
what makes this unique on bonus is it

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.940 
what makes this unique on bonus is it
goes<00:02:16.600> on<00:02:16.750> three<00:02:17.020> double<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.290> batteries<00:02:17.680> which

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
goes on three double a batteries which

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.680 
goes on three double a batteries which
are<00:02:17.980> included<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:19.060> there's<00:02:19.210> like<00:02:19.360> just<00:02:19.570> make

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
are included and there's like just make

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.060 
are included and there's like just make
sure<00:02:19.870> that<00:02:19.900> when<00:02:20.050> you<00:02:20.230> do<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:20.560> I've<00:02:20.860> already

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
sure that when you do it I've already

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.860 
sure that when you do it I've already
removed<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.400> base<00:02:21.580> here<00:02:21.820> but<00:02:21.970> remove<00:02:22.720> the

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
removed the base here but remove the

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.060 
removed the base here but remove the
change<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.230> batteries<00:02:23.620> which<00:02:23.740> you<00:02:23.860> really

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
change the batteries which you really

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.740 
change the batteries which you really
will<00:02:24.190> need<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.370> do<00:02:24.490> for<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.730> very<00:02:24.760> long<00:02:25.180> time<00:02:25.240> is

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
will need to do for a very long time is

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.360 
will need to do for a very long time is
because<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.200> LEDs<00:02:26.560> in<00:02:26.740> there<00:02:26.860> you<00:02:27.160> just

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
because of the LEDs in there you just

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.520 
because of the LEDs in there you just
sewer<00:02:27.700> an<00:02:27.880> easy<00:02:28.090> operation<00:02:28.510> air<00:02:28.810> just<00:02:29.410> right

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
sewer an easy operation air just right

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.380 
sewer an easy operation air just right
there<00:02:29.560> pops<00:02:30.100> off<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:30.490> they're<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.240> three

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
there pops off and they're the three

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.810 
there pops off and they're the three
batteries<00:02:31.810> it<00:02:32.080> does<00:02:32.410> have<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.950> already<00:02:33.610> removed

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
batteries it does have a already removed

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.220 
batteries it does have a already removed
it<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.060> little<00:02:34.180> pull<00:02:34.450> tab<00:02:34.690> here<00:02:34.870> so<00:02:35.020> when<00:02:35.140> you

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
it a little pull tab here so when you

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.570 
it a little pull tab here so when you
get<00:02:35.410> this<00:02:35.530> make<00:02:35.740> sure<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:35.950> pull<00:02:36.100> that<00:02:36.190> tab<00:02:36.400> out

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
get this make sure you pull that tab out

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.310 
get this make sure you pull that tab out
to<00:02:36.760> activate<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.300> batteries<00:02:37.720> it's<00:02:37.960> just<00:02:38.260> a

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
to activate the batteries it's just a

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.110 
to activate the batteries it's just a
conservator<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.280> don't<00:02:39.460> receive<00:02:39.820> one<00:02:40.000> with

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
conservator you don't receive one with

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.880 
conservator you don't receive one with
dead<00:02:40.270> batteries<00:02:40.720> put<00:02:41.170> it<00:02:41.260> back<00:02:41.350> on<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.830> just

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890
