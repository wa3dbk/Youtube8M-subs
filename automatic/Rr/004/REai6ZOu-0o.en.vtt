experience I think that it was really

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.800 
experience I think that it was really
the<00:00:29.320> program<00:00:29.910> itself<00:00:30.910> that<00:00:31.330> drew<00:00:31.660> me<00:00:31.780> to

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
the program itself that drew me to

potentially in French and the MBAs and
other<00:00:42.640> schools<00:00:43.030> looked<00:00:43.300> interesting<00:00:43.989> but

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
other schools looked interesting but

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.529 
other schools looked interesting but
there<00:00:44.350> was<00:00:44.499> no<00:00:44.739> other<00:00:44.769> place<00:00:45.010> in<00:00:45.789> Canada<00:00:46.420> that

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539 
there was no other place in Canada that

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:49.410 
there was no other place in Canada that
had<00:00:46.780> this<00:00:46.989> specific<00:00:47.679> framework<00:00:48.460> the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
had this specific framework the

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.719 
had this specific framework the
advantage<00:00:49.839> that<00:00:49.870> Concordia<00:00:50.469> has<00:00:50.649> is<00:00:51.129> I<00:00:51.489> feel

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:51.729 
advantage that Concordia has is I feel

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:54.660 
advantage that Concordia has is I feel
like<00:00:51.819> a<00:00:52.420> lot<00:00:52.659> of<00:00:52.690> the<00:00:53.440> graduate<00:00:54.100> level<00:00:54.129> studies

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
like a lot of the graduate level studies

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.469 
like a lot of the graduate level studies
are<00:00:55.359> flexible<00:00:56.170> if<00:00:56.710> you<00:00:56.979> show<00:00:57.280> initiative<00:00:58.120> and

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:58.479 
are flexible if you show initiative and

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:00.450 
are flexible if you show initiative and
you<00:00:58.780> lay<00:00:59.199> out<00:00:59.229> a<00:00:59.350> clear<00:00:59.559> path<00:00:59.889> of<00:01:00.190> what<00:01:00.339> you

way it has exceeded my expectations

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:49.190 
way it has exceeded my expectations
actually<00:01:46.729> so<00:01:47.729> if<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:47.910> had<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.270> pick<00:01:48.510> one<00:01:48.720> word<00:01:48.960> to

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
actually so if I had to pick one word to

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.690 
actually so if I had to pick one word to
describe<00:01:49.229> my<00:01:49.770> experience<00:01:49.890> here<00:01:50.550> at<00:01:50.580> the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
describe my experience here at the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.060 
describe my experience here at the
Concord<00:01:51.119> University<00:01:51.690> in<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.810> MSG<00:01:52.259> program<00:01:52.740> so

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
Concord University in the MSG program so

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.090 
Concord University in the MSG program so
far<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.520> would<00:01:53.610> be<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.060> it's<00:01:54.210> very<00:01:54.450> exciting

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
far it would be that it's very exciting

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.140 
far it would be that it's very exciting
if<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.160> had<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.369> pick<00:01:56.490> one<00:01:56.520> word<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.940> would<00:01:57.030> be

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
if I had to pick one word it would be

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
if I had to pick one word it would be
challenging<00:01:58.040> but<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.100> think<00:01:59.390> as<00:02:00.390> well<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.660> have

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
challenging but I think as well I have

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.160 
challenging but I think as well I have
to<00:02:01.320> say<00:02:01.550> rewarding<00:02:02.550> it's<00:02:03.479> actually<00:02:03.899> something

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
to say rewarding it's actually something

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.600 
to say rewarding it's actually something
