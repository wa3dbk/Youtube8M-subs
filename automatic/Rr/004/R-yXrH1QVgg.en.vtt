 today we talk about a video game that 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.719
 without exaggerating it changed history 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.210
 of video games 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.830
 a game that you will surely know 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.619

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.320

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.950
 aspects related to the graphic engine at 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.110

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.270
