00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.830
 all greetings before starting to want 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.930
 tell you that each subsequent 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.330
 the video will be released only after 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.300
 as previous ie previous 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.890
 the review will gain 1000 views 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.320
 let's say it is easier for me and you are spoiled 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.390
 will not start want subaru from max 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.490
 which was downloaded but about a year 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:30.570
 back that is November 12, 2011 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.470
 yes that's it so there is no car 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.440
 relief 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.190
 native sounds what else is needed on it 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.760
 absent 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.350
 light map and on it, too, no, despite 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.640
 the fact that the model was converted year 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.180
 back arrow goes on the desired path 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.000
 that is, in those days modders were already able 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.129
 make normal arrows for 1 gloss 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.440
 wonderful except conspicuous 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.210
 green tasty texture can not 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.860
 please that in this envelope 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.760
 present texture 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.739
 damage 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.170
 that is, when the accident smooth texture 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.579
 becomes rough from jambs I can 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.960
 mark the line on the door which 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.299
 becomes rough after a frontal 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.040
 collision and what surprised me instead 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.110
 texture lattice superimposed texture 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.570
 bodywork is rarely found in 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.280
 Atman also does not leave envelopes 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.750
 the feeling that the front wheels 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.659
 the car is shifted too much and 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.479
 forward in physics I can say that what 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.810
 she's perfectly tuned to others 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.920
 mods from max overclocking from 0 to hundreds 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.150
 quite dynamic 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.750
 brakes are good sometimes too 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.180
 good I think subaru from max i 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.900
 I will finish as the subaru turn 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.020
 but 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.750
 root and there will be a lot of things to say i am 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.110
 I think just do not understand the idea of image 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.520
 I mean light, I choose at random 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.100
 I don't even know which one is poking at all 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.620
 color and now choose well, we initially 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:58.610
 see a standard camera i don't know how 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:02:02.430
 Well call it even less 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.660
 standard camera to communicate what I 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.340
 honestly, it's not clear what it is 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.500
 mutating door handles as they 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.020
 shimmer blue green colors 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.990
 red shorter than horror what that 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.060
 it seems to me that the steering wheel is taken from another 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.620
 an envelope and as it is at least 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.650
 there is a relief he is on it 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.180
 relief I think that's enough 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.370
 honestly i don't know what a mirror 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.260
 why is a black stripe on it suddenly 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.930
 It turned out well, probably so it should be 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.570
 also on the body will lead the salon imposed 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:38.820
 curve bump it can be seen when 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.519
 the body will start blinking now I will wait 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.140
 this my blinked well and let's 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.060
 order initially caught my eye 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.709
 which is the same as max's 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:54.220
 no texture on the lattice which should 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:56.770
 be what else 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:01.810
 curve texture on the headlights which should 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:05.350
 be black as far as I know around headlights 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.930
 around the wheel shifted forward not as 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.240
 max is much further or therefore not 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.810
 stuck in the body but handling it 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.300
 not affected but looks like say god 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.490
 also root decided once again us 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:23.260
 please sticking out of the shelves 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:26.370
 front bumper also visible remnants 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.630
 other bumper shaped headlights that sticks out 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.850
 in the bumper this should not be 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:36.220
 as far as I know what else lights 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:39.150
 some damn not in the color of the car I do not know 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.160
 when it was usually chrome there 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.940
 instead of chromium there may be something gray 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:51.700
 obviously not the color of the car is also the place of the lattice 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:53.140
 radiator we have nothing that violet 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:04:00.400
 green don't even know what to call it 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:02.800
 to be honest here is blinking at all 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.630
 the texture is not clear why in the inside 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.970
 model root decided not to bother not 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.269
 remove old steering wheel 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:14.769
 let it be really also salon 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:16.269
 the model is slightly lower than the exterior exactly 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.519
 Because of this, the driver seems so 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:22.160
 low sitting in the outer model 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.319
 With regards to shooters so in this envelope 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.599
 they go much better than previous 

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:30.080
 envelopes from the root 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:32.449
 in this case, it moves almost 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.930
 along the desired trajectory but still need 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:42.680
 it would be a little work but again 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:43.970
 This man does not give a hint because judging 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.879
 on the speedometer the engine spins 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:50.629
 up to 10,000 turns 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:52.699
 I sincerely hope that this is not so in 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:56.150
 anyway the arrow is adjusted crookedly 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:59.300
 I have a question about the speedometer 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:04.460
 Here at the moment, purely suppose I 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:09.530
 food that they are you no suppose given 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:12.860
 The moment I drive 100 kilometers per hour and what 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:15.669
 then shows the inner circle if on 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:19.340
 outside kilometers per hour then on the inside 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:21.050
 I don't know what she's inside if you 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.599
 look in the side mirrors of the car 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.219
 then you will not see the body there 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:27.380
 same situation the central mirror in 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:30.620
 which is not enough that there is no body so 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.990
 still missing part of the salon mysticism not 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.759
 otherwise 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.860
 I also want to draw attention to the fact that 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:38.960
 I posted my theme with mods 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.840
 texture damage on subaru impreza 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.580
 that is, as well as max 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.069
 there is data on this machine 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:49.219
 texture but i didn't set 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:51.009
 did not put them because I thought 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:53.150
 their 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:57.310
 ugly let's say to me they are not 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.310
 already there you like the fan 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:03.050
 I think the completion will not be for anyone 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:07.360
 the surprise is that i would choose subaru from 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.360
 max because it is better 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.229
 and because it is more qualitative 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:14.520
 I see no other reason 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:17.610
 cars of the same quality 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:21.990
 performance is better in the rest of the choices behind 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:23.930
 you at the end wanted to say a small well 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.449
 little request cool 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:31.350
 scarring if you do fashion give 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:33.630
 attention to the details that is the same handles 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.300
 door that glow so understand you 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:38.070
 wanted to do chrome if you do 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.690
 chrome do something and by lesson if not 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:43.080
 It turns out that we do a simple gray 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:45.990
 texture that arrows arrow you 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:52.020
 almost got another perry export 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:54.620
 and everything would be straight your beauty also 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:58.260
 learn to make relief 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:00.840
 it is in principle done very easily that 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:05.070
 Well, do not be lazy because because of laziness 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:08.930
 you get such shoals on 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.930
 thank you all for watching
