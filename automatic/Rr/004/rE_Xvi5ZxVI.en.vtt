00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.130
 hello, I'm javi and this is the channel 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.870
 easy garden in the next video I'm going to 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.230
 continue with the training pruning of 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.230
 cherry tree 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.490
 we have here the cherry tree has arrived the 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.310
 winter and we will continue pruning 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.140
 of training in this case in system 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.000
 low glass 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.849
 remember that the low March has very 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.940
 low height of trunk where emerge the 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.980
 main branches 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.010
 these would be the branches that are going to 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:43.780
 conform the first level of the skeleton 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.909
 of our cherry trees and as you know this 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.730
 plantation was carried out well entrance 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:51.129
 the spring in the operation that we are going to 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.620
 have to perform today if it had 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.019
 realized the plantation in winter it 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.000
 I could have done this operation in 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.280
 spring with which we would take 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.530
 Advance a lot of time 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.840
 as regards the training of 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.080
 this tree 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.440
 as it was not so the development because more 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.470
 slower and we are forced to 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.840
 perform this operation as I say now 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.410
 in winter winter pruning is a 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.020
 invigorating pruning chipude made 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.869
 must perform on the leaf fall in 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.800
 this case descent to the overflow 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.760
 of the flames 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:33.570
 starting to break those buds is 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.780
 starting to sprout again the tree is 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.300
 good to avoid choosing the moment of 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.399
 the pruning in cold and rainy weather because 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.570
 in that way we avoid the problem 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:47.390
 phytosanitary as it indicates bacteriosis 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.360
 we have the main branches that have 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.330
 a length close to the meter 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.479
 the size up to 20 30 centimeters 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.270
 with that we got the tree 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.860
 develop a bunch of branches that are going to 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.860
 conform the most secondary plant of 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.020
 selected clear how many branches are 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.390
 able to emit the flames that we have 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.920
 in near misses where we will give the 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.900
 cut 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.390
 the secondary branches we can choose 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.790
 to better shape the skeleton of 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.880
 tree we're going to help from the scissors 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.300
 pruning 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.090
 we leave that about 20 30 centimeters in 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.730
 this case we are going to take this part these 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.670
 things we're going to cut here because 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.340
 this is where the largest number of buds in 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.470
 this case of wood there and we are going to 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.740
 favor growth very many 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.540
 secondary branches take into account that 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.200
 where we see the cut let's try 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.800
 that there is a 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.260
 a bud just below the cut and 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.120
 we will also try to give the cut 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.400
 inclined to avoid rot 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.629
 due to the accumulation of water with the 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.819
 inclined cut favor the 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:59.510
 elimination of that water when when 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.510
 there are precipitations 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.519
 Well, we already have the cut made 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:30.159
 if we had that is not the case 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.170
 twigs over here that cross or that 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.090
 they have less rigor would also be 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.280
 convenient to eliminate them so they do not 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.689
 remain cut the tree and that this one 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.710
 develop more branches 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:42.950
 high schools 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.660
 with this winter pruning operation we 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.300
 there is nothing more to wait for it 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.450
 develop many secondary branches and 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:53.680
 the next operation we do is 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.290
 will be done in late spring 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.969
 but with this pruning advice 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.340
 It is easier to perform pruning 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:03.000
 formation of your greetings and even 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.000
