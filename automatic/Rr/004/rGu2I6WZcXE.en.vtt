00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.040
 you will receive these same actors ready to jump to a few months to 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.199
 see them killed 

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:12.199
 to try to gain a lot of time in the air 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.000
 so already there are two kinds of a mortar amortize the classic right ya 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.310
 a few years 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.880
 unfortunately mamma since since the since does especially arrive there he will congratulate 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.570
 now 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.030
 and for that it's a bit more technical amortization but there will be a little 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.810
 more time 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.490
 the damper 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.460
 save time what happened faster on the jump take off - o 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.300
 the body started with the classic right cushioning when you start to 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.660
 by the way that make amortization rather chosen to an easy deaf to a table 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.720
 with a dream boss call 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.140
 a beautiful reception 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.380
 r after coming a little faster 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.330
 a fake bend the legs 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.930
 arms and legs 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.390
 and another to absorb% vs. 10 but the bump 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.410
 a rer after cases of high-strength eye drops 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.820
 the like kind to tease the road forward 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.920
 and well the land in the recession for immediately to regain a place 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.300
 to amortize filed through me I cut gaza badly worth it 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.760
 we must add to that a hug and scenario really much faster or 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.700
 not 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.920
 e 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.950
 by the way early must be really careful in part did not go through 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:30.710
 the ramp 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.010
 because 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.920
 it's a little the opposite of what you learn in the middle of the place the promise 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.220
 twenty 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.880
 the hague cut the gas necessarily it takes us a little towards the sea 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.370
 there they had to attend 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.900
 the language for the center of the city it is necessary to choose preferably a call to 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.900
 the end of the season not too bad 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.450
 on the other hand, it's still long enough to know how 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.810
 bring back the motorcycle for reception ouattara 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.510
 after there is pay for both sides for me I had to do 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.509
 that their side 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.900
 the purpose of the basement in back facade take the call across 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.459
 she got off the bike before the call flap to get to take off the 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.509
 rumors before the crete 

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:20.579
 for the moment as little as possible and as soon as possible 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.159
 the principle of scrap is percent and become a lot more about the lot 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:29.529
 after if you layer the right motorist you take the trouble the right will see 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:35.689
 siemens diapers the bike of such to take off earth in the top 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.449
 you use theater 

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:42.400
 it's another world to make the crest and that's what will make you 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.450
 to allow to bring back the bike by pulling on the right handle a little 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.090
 for her to recover right nothing I can leave no 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:55.030
 after there is one trick percent the little tips commonly 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.129
 look at the age 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.029
 those agencies who think that a motor right he kept his right leg the 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:02:59.359
 handle 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:00.839
 to support him 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:04.189
 at rates especially not the semto get out a point because if we get to 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:05.799
 touch the crest 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.189
 and normally it's perfect to make a superman and finish next to the 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.119
 motorbike 

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:15.739
 in conclusion scrabble c that's what he can do after if it's not 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.659
 do it this not to no longer me 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.260
 a disaster because young people come on the field of cross has not 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.299
 a lot of places where you can really make an effort to win 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.859
 I can save time you can save a lot more time by taking a 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.749
 turn correctly transcendence 

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:30.569
 going further 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.459
 who do not spend a lot of energy so on a run it goes 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.249
 be hard to do it themselves on it all night all the way 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:37.479
 mandate 

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:40.269
 so you can not do it 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.429
 now to you no longer the double 

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:46.319
 you can just a little amorphous about the right to know neither where nor when I 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.730
 make ruts montpellier in france already well 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.389
 claiming they're entitled what I believe is that bonus for us 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.799
 so
