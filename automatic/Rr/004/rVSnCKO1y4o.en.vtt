00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
the analog sticks they seem to be they

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.040 
the analog sticks they seem to be they
work<00:00:26.880> they<00:00:27.060> are<00:00:27.090> pretty<00:00:27.570> good<00:00:28.519> they<00:00:29.519> feel<00:00:29.550> nice

guys we are back and I have tried out
this<00:01:03.920> this<00:01:04.920> controller<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.519> little<00:01:05.820> bit<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.299> I

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
this this controller a little bit and I

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.980 
this this controller a little bit and I
have<00:01:07.760> you<00:01:08.760> know<00:01:08.790> my<00:01:09.090> verdict<00:01:09.479> about<00:01:09.600> it

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.830 

out<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.799> scale<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.729> one<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.909> ten<00:01:15.299> with<00:01:15.780> one

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
out of a scale of one to ten with one

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.880 
out of a scale of one to ten with one
being<00:01:16.610> unplayable<00:01:17.610> or<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.689> know<00:01:18.780> return<00:01:19.650> to

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
being unplayable or you know return to

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.310 
being unplayable or you know return to
manufacturer<00:01:20.759> because<00:01:20.909> it's<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.240> bad<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.479> ten

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
manufacturer because it's so bad and ten

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.870 
manufacturer because it's so bad and ten
being<00:01:22.530> awesome<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.159> know<00:01:23.189> I'd<00:01:23.369> never<00:01:23.580> buy

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
being awesome you know I'd never buy

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.120 
being awesome you know I'd never buy
something<00:01:24.270> else<00:01:24.680> I<00:01:27.170> would<00:01:28.170> probably<00:01:28.380> have<00:01:28.829> to

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
something else I would probably have to

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.520 
something else I would probably have to
give<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:30.680> five<00:01:31.680> or<00:01:32.310> six<00:01:33.000> maybe<00:01:33.530> it's

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
give this a five or six maybe it's

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.280 
give this a five or six maybe it's
playable<00:01:35.130> but<00:01:35.520> there<00:01:35.700> are<00:01:35.820> some<00:01:36.290> definite

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
playable but there are some definite

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.870 
playable but there are some definite
definite<00:01:38.000> defects<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.860> number<00:01:40.860> one<00:01:41.100> when

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
definite defects to it number one when

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.600 
definite defects to it number one when
it<00:01:41.909> comes<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.390> mapping<00:01:42.630> out<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.079> controls

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
it comes to mapping out the controls

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.080 
it comes to mapping out the controls
inside<00:01:44.610> programs<00:01:45.710> when<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:47.189> when<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.729> set

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
inside programs when you when you set

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.330 
inside programs when you when you set
this<00:01:48.439> analog<00:01:49.439> stick<00:01:50.149> as<00:01:51.229> controls<00:01:52.340> it

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
this analog stick as controls it

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.420 
this analog stick as controls it
actually<00:01:53.820> sets<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.420> believe<00:01:54.720> up<00:01:55.350> with<00:01:56.040> set<00:01:56.280> as

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
actually sets I believe up with set as

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.760 
actually sets I believe up with set as
button<00:01:56.790> number<00:01:57.060> one<00:01:57.299> number<00:01:58.020> two<00:01:58.500> number

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
button number one number two number

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.639 
button number one number two number
three<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.490> number<00:01:59.520> four<00:02:00.079> the<00:02:01.079> downside<00:02:01.619> that

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
three and number four the downside that

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.060 
three and number four the downside that
is<00:02:02.130> these<00:02:03.119> are<00:02:03.420> also<00:02:03.600> as<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.079> can<00:02:04.259> see<00:02:04.500> one<00:02:04.860> two

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
is these are also as you can see one two

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.839 
is these are also as you can see one two
three<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:05.969> four<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:07.170> what<00:02:07.350> happens<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.950> you

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
three and four so what happens is you

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.040 
three and four so what happens is you
can't<00:02:09.149> actually<00:02:09.479> use<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.760> very<00:02:11.760> much<00:02:12.050> at

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
can't actually use this very much at

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.980 
can't actually use this very much at
least<00:02:13.319> in<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.530> program

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
least in the program

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.250 
least in the program
I<00:02:14.020> used<00:02:14.440> which<00:02:14.740> was<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.100> an<00:02:15.580> NES<00:02:16.030> emulator<00:02:16.690> and

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
I used which was a an NES emulator and

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.500 
I used which was a an NES emulator and

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
and 64 emulator one called 64 and it

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.140 
and 64 emulator one called 64 and it
wasn't<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:22.900> big<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.410> deal<00:02:23.880> because<00:02:24.880> most

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
wasn't that big of a deal because most

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.760 
wasn't that big of a deal because most
emulators<00:02:25.720> you're<00:02:25.900> going<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.080> be<00:02:26.140> using<00:02:26.530> for

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
emulating the the problem is the zone

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.890 
emulating the the problem is the zone
here<00:03:04.690> it's<00:03:05.380> eight<00:03:05.680> Direction<00:03:06.400> right<00:03:07.090> but

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
here it's eight Direction right but

here it's eight Direction right but
there's<00:03:08.080> no<00:03:08.350> in-between<00:03:09.060> like<00:03:10.060> there's<00:03:10.960> you

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
there's no in-between like there's you

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.220 
there's no in-between like there's you
know<00:03:11.530> right<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:12.550> up<00:03:13.300> and<00:03:13.770> you<00:03:14.770> know<00:03:16.140> you<00:03:17.140> know

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
know right and up and you know you know

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.640 
know right and up and you know you know
north<00:03:17.620> east<00:03:17.860> whatever<00:03:19.020> but<00:03:20.020> it<00:03:20.260> just<00:03:20.440> goes

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
north east whatever but it just goes

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.550 
north east whatever but it just goes
straight<00:03:21.070> boom<00:03:21.460> so<00:03:22.060> you<00:03:22.170> send<00:03:23.170> when<00:03:23.440> you're

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
straight boom so you send when you're

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.700 
straight boom so you send when you're
moving<00:03:23.740> you<00:03:24.370> tend<00:03:24.670> to<00:03:24.760> move<00:03:25.000> like<00:03:25.330> very<00:03:26.170> blocky

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
moving you tend to move like very blocky

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.550 
moving you tend to move like very blocky
and<00:03:26.980> you<00:03:27.220> can't<00:03:27.550> make<00:03:27.790> fluid<00:03:28.450> motions<00:03:29.290> when

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
and you can't make fluid motions when

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.520 
and you can't make fluid motions when
you're<00:03:29.770> playing<00:03:30.760> which<00:03:31.630> is<00:03:31.660> really<00:03:32.320> difficult

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
you're playing which is really difficult

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.520 
you're playing which is really difficult
which<00:03:33.040> is<00:03:33.070> really<00:03:33.580> it's<00:03:33.790> a<00:03:34.330> huge<00:03:34.780> defect<00:03:35.290> and

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
which is really it's a huge defect and

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.190 
which is really it's a huge defect and
it<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:35.860> it<00:03:36.520> it<00:03:37.270> really<00:03:37.480> takes<00:03:37.780> away<00:03:37.990> for<00:03:38.140> the

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
it and it it really takes away for the

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.240 
it and it it really takes away for the
control<00:03:38.650> you<00:03:38.770> have<00:03:38.800> over<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.340> character<00:03:41.220> so<00:03:42.220> I

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
control you have over the character so I

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.510 
control you have over the character so I
would<00:03:42.610> keep<00:03:42.820> that<00:03:42.880> in<00:03:43.330> mind<00:03:44.280> when<00:03:45.280> you're

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
would keep that in mind when you're

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.270 
would keep that in mind when you're
thinking<00:03:45.550> about<00:03:46.000> buying<00:03:46.180> this<00:03:46.330> controller<00:03:47.280> if

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
thinking about buying this controller if

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.880 
thinking about buying this controller if
you<00:03:48.700> really<00:03:49.180> want<00:03:49.720> really<00:03:50.110> fluid<00:03:50.650> gameplay

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
you really want really fluid gameplay

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.510 
you really want really fluid gameplay
I'm<00:03:51.370> not<00:03:51.670> sure<00:03:52.000> you'd<00:03:52.270> want<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.540> get<00:03:52.720> this<00:03:53.520> I'm

I'm not sure you'd want to get this I'm
gonna<00:03:54.790> continue<00:03:55.150> to<00:03:55.330> use<00:03:55.600> it<00:03:55.780> because<00:03:56.200> I<00:03:56.230> feel

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
gonna continue to use it because I feel

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.310 
gonna continue to use it because I feel
like<00:03:57.150> it's<00:03:58.150> not<00:03:58.360> you<00:03:58.630> know<00:03:58.720> that's<00:03:58.870> not<00:03:59.080> that

big<00:03:59.530> of<00:03:59.650> a<00:03:59.740> deal<00:03:59.920> but<00:04:00.850> it<00:04:01.000> does<00:04:01.270> take<00:04:01.660> away<00:04:01.930> from

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
big of a deal but it does take away from

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.900 
big of a deal but it does take away from
motion<00:04:02.470> control<00:04:03.070> that<00:04:03.220> you<00:04:03.280> have<00:04:03.310> over<00:04:03.550> your

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
motion control that you have over your

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.560 
motion control that you have over your
character<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:06.130> d-pad<00:04:06.610> that<00:04:06.940> I<00:04:06.970> used<00:04:07.300> when

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
character the d-pad that I used when

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.980 
character the d-pad that I used when
playing<00:04:07.870> in<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.580> in<00:04:09.580> the<00:04:09.970> NES<00:04:10.240> thing<00:04:10.630> was<00:04:10.810> very

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
another thing on the controller it felt

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.150 
at least in the emulators I tried
actually<00:04:56.340> didn't<00:04:56.640> register<00:04:57.350> these<00:04:58.350> top

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
actually didn't register these top

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.720 
actually didn't register these top
shoulder<00:04:59.640> buttons<00:05:00.200> so<00:05:01.200> you<00:05:01.560> know<00:05:02.160> the<00:05:02.250> L<00:05:02.400> and<00:05:02.640> R

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
shoulder buttons so you know the L and R

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.230 
shoulder buttons so you know the L and R
buttons<00:05:03.090> so<00:05:03.900> I'm<00:05:04.620> not<00:05:04.980> sure<00:05:05.040> if<00:05:05.460> that<00:05:05.490> goes

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
buttons so I'm not sure if that goes

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.750 
buttons so I'm not sure if that goes
through<00:05:06.510> all<00:05:06.570> emulators<00:05:07.140> but<00:05:07.410> I'm<00:05:08.100> warning

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
through all emulators but I'm warning

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.320 
through all emulators but I'm warning
you<00:05:08.790> if<00:05:09.180> they<00:05:09.510> didn't<00:05:09.900> register<00:05:10.110> for<00:05:10.620> mine

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
you if they didn't register for mine

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:18.980 
you if they didn't register for mine
so<00:05:15.410> overall<00:05:16.410> it<00:05:17.040> it's<00:05:17.670> I'm<00:05:18.090> gonna<00:05:18.330> give<00:05:18.540> it<00:05:18.630> a<00:05:18.690> 5

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
so overall it it's I'm gonna give it a 5

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.010 
so overall it it's I'm gonna give it a 5
out<00:05:19.020> of<00:05:19.260> 10<00:05:19.350> which<00:05:19.950> isn't<00:05:20.220> great<00:05:20.870> but<00:05:21.870> it<00:05:21.930> was

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
the install for the rumble feature

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.980 
the install for the rumble feature
because<00:06:28.850> all<00:06:29.850> the<00:06:30.150> reviews<00:06:30.510> I<00:06:30.660> read<00:06:30.810> online

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
because all the reviews I read online

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.680 
because all the reviews I read online
said<00:06:31.500> that<00:06:31.620> this<00:06:31.800> CV<00:06:32.310> actually<00:06:32.580> had<00:06:32.700> a<00:06:32.729> sort<00:06:33.660> of

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
said that this CV actually had a sort of

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.450 
said that this CV actually had a sort of
virus<00:06:34.080> on<00:06:34.229> it<00:06:34.380> and<00:06:34.530> I'm<00:06:34.620> not<00:06:34.740> sure<00:06:34.800> if<00:06:35.070> it<00:06:35.220> still

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
virus on it and I'm not sure if it still

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.969 
virus on it and I'm not sure if it still
if<00:06:35.789> that's<00:06:36.030> still<00:06:36.390> the<00:06:36.599> case

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:36.979 
if that's still the case

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:38.990 
if that's still the case
but<00:06:37.979> I<00:06:38.010> didn't<00:06:38.220> want<00:06:38.340> to<00:06:38.430> take<00:06:38.520> that<00:06:38.729> chance

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
but I didn't want to take that chance

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.920 
but I didn't want to take that chance
and<00:06:39.150> I<00:06:39.240> didn't<00:06:39.419> really<00:06:39.599> make<00:06:39.690> a<00:06:39.750> difference

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
and I didn't really make a difference

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.719 
and I didn't really make a difference
move<00:06:40.320> for<00:06:40.440> the<00:06:40.500> rumble<00:06:40.680> feature

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:41.729 
move for the rumble feature

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:43.040 
move for the rumble feature
so<00:06:41.879> it<00:06:42.029> doesn't<00:06:42.270> have<00:06:42.389> any<00:06:42.539> sort<00:06:42.659> of<00:06:42.749> rumble

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
so it doesn't have any sort of rumble

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.179 
so it doesn't have any sort of rumble
feature<00:06:43.199> even<00:06:43.469> though<00:06:43.559> it's<00:06:43.710> advertised

00:06:44.179 --> 00:06:44.189 
feature even though it's advertised

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:46.820 
feature even though it's advertised
because<00:06:44.659> I'm<00:06:45.659> not<00:06:45.990> gonna<00:06:46.169> be<00:06:46.379> the<00:06:46.499> one<00:06:46.680> that

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
because I'm not gonna be the one that

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.529 
because I'm not gonna be the one that
takes<00:06:47.129> the<00:06:47.309> chance<00:06:47.580> to<00:06:47.879> put<00:06:48.089> a<00:06:48.120> virus<00:06:48.300> on<00:06:48.509> my

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539 
takes the chance to put a virus on my
