back to it later cover the printed bit

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.060 
back to it later cover the printed bit
which<00:01:44.030> is<00:01:44.090> dry<00:01:44.330> with<00:01:44.990> a<00:01:45.020> bit<00:01:45.229> of<00:01:45.259> newspaper<00:01:45.740> and

which is dry with a bit of newspaper and

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.700 
which is dry with a bit of newspaper and
then<00:01:46.759> roller<00:01:47.540> down<00:01:47.780> and<00:01:48.110> it<00:01:48.259> will<00:01:48.350> fill<00:01:48.500> in<00:01:48.619> the

then roller down and it will fill in the

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
space and you'll see to get a continuous

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.810 
space and you'll see to get a continuous
repeat<00:01:52.940> pattern<00:01:53.300> the<00:01:53.810> key<00:01:54.020> is<00:01:54.259> plus<00:01:55.220> or<00:01:55.460> minus

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
repeat pattern the key is plus or minus

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.840 
repeat pattern the key is plus or minus
and<00:01:56.080> slight<00:01:57.080> overlap<00:01:57.440> so<00:01:58.280> you<00:01:58.399> see<00:01:58.550> the<00:01:58.640> true

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
and slight overlap so you see the true

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.300 
and slight overlap so you see the true
slight<00:01:59.210> has<00:01:59.390> merged<00:01:59.600> with<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.840> deer<00:02:00.110> and<00:02:00.500> then

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
slight has merged with the deer and then

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.210 
slight has merged with the deer and then
it<00:02:01.490> goes<00:02:01.610> a<00:02:01.640> seamless<00:02:02.030> finish
