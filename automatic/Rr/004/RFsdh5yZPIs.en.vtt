00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.639
 pixels that is a movie that has 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.500
 presented and his trailer is a movie 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.240

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.090
 making this movie based on a 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.390
 trailer that came out a few years ago that 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.920
 it was called pixel just like the movie and 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.759
 this movie based on that trailer in 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.380
 tells the story of an alien race 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.870
 that invades the earth and good 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.510
 takes on the aspect of videogames 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.160
 of the 80's games that were in the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.440

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.090
 that there was in the 80s a time in the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.550

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.940
 information about the crisis of the 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.989
 video games of 1983 because a moment in 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.239
 that were almost on the verge of 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.879
 disappear and good referring to the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.770
 movie is funny the trader starts to 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.719

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.620
 year 82 to space and it leaves the system 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.620
