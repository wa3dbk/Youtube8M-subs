00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.100 
three pieces of TNT or at least in my
case<00:02:09.830> it's<00:02:10.190> three<00:02:10.490> three<00:02:11.150> pieces<00:02:11.330> of<00:02:11.510> TNT<00:02:11.900> that

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
case it's three three pieces of TNT that

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.410 
case it's three three pieces of TNT that
fall<00:02:12.290> into<00:02:12.560> some<00:02:12.739> water<00:02:13.060> when<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.209> falls

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
fall into some water when that falls

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.570 
fall into some water when that falls
into<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:14.750> water<00:02:14.780> it'll<00:02:15.770> come<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.130> about<00:02:16.250> here

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
into the water it'll come to about here

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.850 
into the water it'll come to about here
and<00:02:16.790> it'll<00:02:17.060> blow<00:02:17.330> up<00:02:17.510> now<00:02:18.170> what<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.739> water

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
and it'll blow up now what the water

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.410 
and it'll blow up now what the water
does<00:02:19.010> is<00:02:19.430> it<00:02:19.580> makes<00:02:19.610> it<00:02:19.940> so<00:02:20.120> it<00:02:20.360> doesn't

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
does is it makes it so it doesn't

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.530 
does is it makes it so it doesn't
explode<00:02:21.340> or<00:02:22.340> blow<00:02:22.730> up<00:02:22.820> everything<00:02:23.030> around<00:02:23.330> it

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
explode or blow up everything around it

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.020 
explode or blow up everything around it
but<00:02:24.440> what<00:02:24.620> it<00:02:24.709> does<00:02:24.890> indeed<00:02:25.100> do<00:02:25.340> is<00:02:25.550> make<00:02:26.000> a

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
but what it does indeed do is make a

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.610 
but what it does indeed do is make a
force<00:02:26.450> so<00:02:27.200> TNT<00:02:28.010> can<00:02:28.250> be<00:02:28.340> pushed<00:02:28.550> by<00:02:28.760> other<00:02:28.940> T&amp;T

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
force so TNT can be pushed by other T&amp;T

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.840 
force so TNT can be pushed by other T&amp;T
so<00:02:30.620> I'm<00:02:30.770> gonna<00:02:30.890> place<00:02:31.070> this<00:02:31.250> last<00:02:31.459> piece<00:02:31.670> of

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
so I'm gonna place this last piece of

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.510 
so I'm gonna place this last piece of
TNT<00:02:32.209> and<00:02:32.330> then<00:02:32.450> explain<00:02:32.750> how<00:02:33.130> this<00:02:34.130> redstone

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
TNT and then explain how this redstone

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.820 
TNT and then explain how this redstone
works<00:02:34.880> I'm<00:02:35.450> placing<00:02:35.630> sus<00:02:36.050> bit<00:02:36.260> of<00:02:36.350> TNT<00:02:36.680> right

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
works I'm placing sus bit of TNT right

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.270 
works I'm placing sus bit of TNT right
here<00:02:37.160> so<00:02:38.030> ultimately<00:02:38.870> these<00:02:39.590> three<00:02:39.950> pieces<00:02:40.100> of

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
here so ultimately these three pieces of

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.449 
here so ultimately these three pieces of
TNT<00:02:40.730> need<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.090> be<00:02:41.180> lit<00:02:41.330> up<00:02:41.450> before<00:02:41.930> this<00:02:42.080> one<00:02:42.459> so

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
TNT need to be lit up before this one so

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.759 
TNT need to be lit up before this one so
this<00:02:44.209> one<00:02:44.270> gets<00:02:44.600> lit<00:02:44.750> up<00:02:44.840> these<00:02:45.290> ones<00:02:45.410> get<00:02:45.590> lit

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
this one gets lit up these ones get lit

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.890 
this one gets lit up these ones get lit
up<00:02:45.799> instantly<00:02:46.310> at<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.549> same<00:02:46.730> time<00:02:47.000> but<00:02:47.780> then

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
up instantly at the same time but then

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.289 
up instantly at the same time but then
that<00:02:47.930> last<00:02:48.380> one<00:02:48.650> this<00:02:48.980> one<00:02:49.160> right<00:02:49.250> here<00:02:49.310> has<00:02:50.180> to

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
that last one this one right here has to

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.009 
that last one this one right here has to
go<00:02:50.390> through<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.600> series<00:02:50.840> of<00:02:50.959> delays<00:02:52.570> so<00:02:53.570> it<00:02:53.810> gets

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
go through a series of delays so it gets

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.810 
go through a series of delays so it gets
lit<00:02:54.290> up<00:02:54.410> later<00:02:54.709> so<00:02:54.980> that<00:02:55.220> way<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:55.400> can<00:02:55.489> be<00:02:55.610> blown

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
lit up later so that way it can be blown

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.380 
lit up later so that way it can be blown
with<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.060> mouth<00:02:56.209> before<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:56.660> explodes<00:02:58.390> so

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
with the mouth before it explodes so

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.080 
with the mouth before it explodes so
that's<00:02:59.600> really<00:02:59.750> about<00:02:59.930> it<00:03:00.200> I<00:03:00.410> mean<00:03:00.850> it's<00:03:01.850> very

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
that's really about it I mean it's very

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.880 
that's really about it I mean it's very
simplistic<00:03:02.660> I<00:03:02.870> just<00:03:03.410> wanted<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:03.620> do<00:03:03.739> something

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
simplistic I just wanted to do something

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.350 
simplistic I just wanted to do something
cool<00:03:04.160> because<00:03:04.340> I've<00:03:04.519> seen<00:03:04.549> all<00:03:04.760> these<00:03:04.850> cannons

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
cool because I've seen all these cannons

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.300 
cool because I've seen all these cannons
but<00:03:05.510> none<00:03:05.780> of<00:03:05.810> them<00:03:05.930> look<00:03:06.110> neat<00:03:06.320> and<00:03:06.560> I<00:03:07.190> thought

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
but none of them look neat and I thought

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.890 
but none of them look neat and I thought
a<00:03:07.370> gas<00:03:07.670> does<00:03:07.970> a<00:03:08.000> perfect<00:03:08.239> example<00:03:08.510> of<00:03:08.900> that

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
a gas does a perfect example of that

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.059 
a gas does a perfect example of that
whoo<00:03:11.900> sheep

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
whoo sheep

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.360

sorry anyways I place this it sets off
the<00:03:16.519> series<00:03:16.790> of<00:03:16.849> things<00:03:16.969> those<00:03:17.329> three<00:03:17.719> tMT's

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
the series of things those three tMT's

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.239 
the series of things those three tMT's
drop<00:03:18.439> into<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.709> water<00:03:18.859> and<00:03:19.069> push<00:03:19.219> forward

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:19.249 
drop into the water and push forward

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:21.729 
drop into the water and push forward
then<00:03:20.030> that<00:03:20.269> last<00:03:20.480> one<00:03:20.659> gets<00:03:20.870> lit<00:03:21.109> those<00:03:21.409> first

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
then that last one gets lit those first

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.800 
then that last one gets lit those first
three<00:03:21.950> blow<00:03:22.159> up<00:03:22.280> push<00:03:22.639> the<00:03:22.670> TNT<00:03:23.239> it<00:03:23.480> lands<00:03:23.659> on

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
three blow up push the TNT it lands on

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.899 
three blow up push the TNT it lands on
this<00:03:23.959> dude's<00:03:24.200> heart<00:03:24.439> and<00:03:24.680> then<00:03:25.310> his<00:03:25.430> head

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:25.909 
this dude's heart and then his head

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:31.119 
this dude's heart and then his head
explodes<00:03:28.989> so<00:03:29.989> we're<00:03:30.620> going<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:30.799> watch<00:03:30.920> it<00:03:31.040> one

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
explodes so we're going to watch it one
