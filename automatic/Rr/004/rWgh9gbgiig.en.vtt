00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.799 

now<00:00:08.700> that<00:00:09.030> we<00:00:09.300> have<00:00:09.630> created<00:00:09.990> various<00:00:10.830> roads

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
now that we have created various roads

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.440 
now that we have created various roads
around<00:00:12.809> our<00:00:13.230> environment<00:00:14.000> including<00:00:15.000> curved

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
around our environment including curved

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.470 
around our environment including curved
surfaces<00:00:16.139> tight<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.189> narrow<00:00:17.520> right<00:00:18.270> head

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
surfaces tight and narrow right head

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.609 
surfaces tight and narrow right head
turns<00:00:18.720> u-turns<00:00:20.000> using<00:00:21.000> simple<00:00:21.360> brushes<00:00:21.779> we

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
turns u-turns using simple brushes we

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.400 
turns u-turns using simple brushes we
need<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.950> begin<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.580> block<00:00:24.210> these<00:00:24.510> areas<00:00:25.140> off

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
need to begin to block these areas off

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.790 
need to begin to block these areas off
with<00:00:26.070> using<00:00:26.279> brushes<00:00:26.699> props<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.869> terrain

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
with using brushes props and terrain

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.490 
with using brushes props and terrain
we're<00:00:29.609> going<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.910> start<00:00:30.390> off<00:00:30.570> with<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.170> basic

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
we're going to start off with a basic

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.439 
we're going to start off with a basic
intersection<00:00:32.220> and<00:00:32.460> we're<00:00:33.120> going<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.300> use

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:33.449 
intersection and we're going to use

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:36.350 
intersection and we're going to use
brushes<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.170> create<00:00:34.350> sidewalks<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.489> then

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
brushes to create sidewalks and then

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.320 
brushes to create sidewalks and then
just<00:00:36.780> go<00:00:37.379> from<00:00:37.590> there<00:00:37.769> so<00:00:38.580> the<00:00:38.670> first<00:00:38.879> step<00:00:39.090> is

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.330 
just go from there so the first step is

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.819 
just go from there so the first step is
to<00:00:39.630> create<00:00:40.520> sidewalks<00:00:41.520> using<00:00:42.000> simple<00:00:42.300> brushes

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
to create sidewalks using simple brushes

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.530 
to create sidewalks using simple brushes
so<00:00:43.829> let's<00:00:44.070> go<00:00:44.309> into<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.790> top<00:00:44.969> view<00:00:45.210> I'm<00:00:45.360> just

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
so let's go into the top view I'm just

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.660 
so let's go into the top view I'm just
going<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.719> take<00:00:45.930> these<00:00:46.350> these<00:00:47.219> few<00:00:47.489> brushes

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
going to take these these few brushes

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.190 
going to take these these few brushes
I'm<00:00:47.940> going<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.239> resize<00:00:48.600> them<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:48.960> I'm<00:00:49.050> going

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
I'm going to resize them and I'm going

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.450 
I'm going to resize them and I'm going
to<00:00:49.290> duplicate<00:00:49.680> them<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.600> create<00:00:51.600> sidewalks

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
to duplicate them and create sidewalks

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.799 
to duplicate them and create sidewalks
now<00:00:53.460> I'm<00:00:53.520> going<00:00:53.700> to<00:00:53.760> duplicate<00:00:54.180> them<00:00:54.329> onto<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
now I'm going to duplicate them onto the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.510 
now I'm going to duplicate them onto the
other<00:00:55.020> side<00:00:57.020> so<00:00:58.020> we<00:00:58.140> have<00:00:58.289> sidewalks<00:00:58.530> on<00:00:59.039> each

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
other side so we have sidewalks on each

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.600 
other side so we have sidewalks on each
side<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.059> I'm<00:01:00.510> gonna<00:01:00.949> push<00:01:01.949> them<00:01:02.160> up<00:01:02.309> eight

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
side and I'm gonna push them up eight

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.029 
side and I'm gonna push them up eight
units<00:01:03.559> and<00:01:05.390> then<00:01:06.390> we<00:01:06.509> need<00:01:06.690> to<00:01:06.960> texture<00:01:07.890> them

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:08.039 
units and then we need to texture them

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:10.730 
units and then we need to texture them
so<00:01:08.640> here<00:01:08.820> let's<00:01:09.060> go<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.240> our<00:01:09.810> face<00:01:10.259> set<00:01:10.440> achieve

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
so here let's go to our face set achieve

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.460 
so here let's go to our face set achieve
and<00:01:11.039> let's<00:01:11.220> click<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:11.909> browse<00:01:12.150> under<00:01:13.080> filter

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
and let's click on browse under filter

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
and let's click on browse under filter
we<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:13.799> type<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.640> kerb<00:01:15.140> we<00:01:16.140> have<00:01:16.320> few<00:01:16.710> curved

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
we can type in kerb we have few curved

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.030 
we can type in kerb we have few curved
surfaces<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.689> we<00:01:18.780> can<00:01:18.900> add<00:01:19.110> for<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> side<00:01:19.770> of

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
surfaces that we can add for the side of

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.640 
surfaces that we can add for the side of
the<00:01:20.310> sidewalk<00:01:20.520> I'm<00:01:20.939> just<00:01:21.510> gonna<00:01:21.630> add<00:01:21.869> these<00:01:22.110> to

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
the sidewalk I'm just gonna add these to

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.359 
the sidewalk I'm just gonna add these to
the<00:01:22.770> side<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:25.170> apply<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.560> texture<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the side and apply the texture to the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.530 
the side and apply the texture to the
side<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.820> brush<00:01:27.229> and<00:01:28.790> then<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:29.909> can<00:01:30.060> go<00:01:30.270> and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
side of the brush and then we can go and

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.859 
side of the brush and then we can go and
filter<00:01:31.350> concrete<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.369> we<00:01:33.090> can<00:01:33.240> go<00:01:33.810> through

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
filter concrete and we can go through

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.140 
filter concrete and we can go through
some<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.650> various<00:01:34.950> concrete<00:01:35.460> options

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
some of the various concrete options

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.210 
some of the various concrete options
that<00:01:36.240> we<00:01:36.329> have<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.689> we<00:01:36.780> can<00:01:36.810> apply<00:01:37.110> on<00:01:37.470> top<00:01:37.920> on

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
that we have that we can apply on top on

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.880 
that we have that we can apply on top on
the<00:01:38.460> sidewalk<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:39.570> can<00:01:39.720> also<00:01:39.869> go<00:01:40.200> back<00:01:40.409> into

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
the sidewalk we can also go back into

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.969 
the sidewalk we can also go back into
and<00:01:41.430> filter<00:01:41.790> Road<00:01:42.000> we<00:01:42.479> can<00:01:42.630> also<00:01:42.810> use<00:01:43.500> some<00:01:43.860> of

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
and filter Road we can also use some of

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.039 
and filter Road we can also use some of
these<00:01:44.100> Road<00:01:44.579> textures<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.299> we'll<00:01:45.720> have<00:01:45.900> to

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
these Road textures and we'll have to

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.800 
these Road textures and we'll have to
scale<00:01:46.409> them<00:01:46.650> in<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.729> those<00:01:47.970> textures<00:01:48.360> are<00:01:48.659> not

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
scale them in so those textures are not

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.740 
scale them in so those textures are not
stretched<00:01:49.140> out<00:01:49.399> so<00:01:50.399> here<00:01:50.610> we<00:01:50.729> have<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:51.240> basic

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
stretched out so here we have a basic

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.469 
stretched out so here we have a basic
kerb<00:01:52.200> created<00:01:52.799> now<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.670> would<00:01:53.850> be<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.030> basic

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
kerb created now this would be the basic

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.170 
kerb created now this would be the basic
way<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.689> create<00:01:55.110> curved<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.649> sidewalks<00:01:56.180> now

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
way to create curved and sidewalks now

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.030 
way to create curved and sidewalks now
to<00:01:57.630> take<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.110> step<00:01:58.140> further

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
to take it a step further

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.789 
to take it a step further
most<00:01:59.820> of<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.149> sidewalks<00:02:00.659> especially<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.649> add

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
most of the sidewalks especially I add

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.800 
most of the sidewalks especially I add
right-hand<00:02:02.549> turns<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.030> left-hand<00:02:03.360> turns<00:02:03.570> or

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
right-hand turns and left-hand turns or

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.850 
right-hand turns and left-hand turns or
intersections<00:02:04.439> they<00:02:05.159> are<00:02:05.460> curved<00:02:06.439> along<00:02:07.439> with

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
intersections they are curved along with

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.520 
intersections they are curved along with
the<00:02:08.070> road<00:02:08.450> so<00:02:09.450> just<00:02:09.690> like<00:02:09.840> we<00:02:10.019> have<00:02:10.049> our

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
the road so just like we have our

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.120 
the road so just like we have our
texture<00:02:11.250> shown<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.910> it's<00:02:12.090> curving<00:02:12.420> around

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
texture shown that it's curving around

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.259 
texture shown that it's curving around
we<00:02:14.130> will<00:02:14.310> need<00:02:14.549> to<00:02:14.700> do<00:02:14.820> something<00:02:15.239> very

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
we will need to do something very

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.110 
we will need to do something very
similar<00:02:15.720> with<00:02:16.110> our<00:02:16.440> curb<00:02:16.709> so<00:02:17.489> another<00:02:17.910> way<00:02:18.090> to

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
similar with our curb so another way to

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.690 
similar with our curb so another way to
do<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:18.629> is<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.950> use<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.190> same<00:02:20.370> method

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
do so is to use the same method

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.229 
do so is to use the same method
that<00:02:20.849> we<00:02:21.000> used<00:02:21.209> before<00:02:21.450> on<00:02:21.930> creating<00:02:23.239> wedges

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
that we used before on creating wedges

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.259 
that we used before on creating wedges
or<00:02:24.480> tight<00:02:25.410> right<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:25.890> turns<00:02:26.129> so<00:02:26.430> what<00:02:27.030> we<00:02:27.120> need

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
or tight right and turns so what we need

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.119 
or tight right and turns so what we need
to<00:02:27.300> do<00:02:27.450> is<00:02:27.540> we<00:02:27.690> first<00:02:28.080> we<00:02:28.230> need<00:02:28.379> to<00:02:28.500> create<00:02:28.800> the

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
to do is we first we need to create the

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.790 
to do is we first we need to create the
space<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:30.239> where<00:02:30.480> our<00:02:30.540> wedge<00:02:31.080> is<00:02:31.290> going<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.620> go

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
space to where our wedge is going to go

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.780 
space to where our wedge is going to go
so<00:02:32.550> let's<00:02:32.730> go<00:02:32.879> into<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.330> block<00:02:33.480> tool<00:02:33.750> and

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
so let's go into the block tool and

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.490 
so let's go into the block tool and
under<00:02:35.790> primitives<00:02:36.330> we're<00:02:36.510> gonna<00:02:36.599> set<00:02:36.900> objects

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
under primitives we're gonna set objects

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.630 
under primitives we're gonna set objects
to<00:02:38.310> arch<00:02:38.700> we<00:02:39.630> need<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.900> draw<00:02:40.110> this<00:02:40.290> out<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.769> we

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
to arch we need to draw this out and we

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.600 
to arch we need to draw this out and we
have<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.819> brush<00:02:42.120> that's<00:02:42.660> at<00:02:43.080> 80<00:02:43.349> by<00:02:43.590> 80<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:44.459> let's

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
have a brush that's at 80 by 80 so let's

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.759 
have a brush that's at 80 by 80 so let's
click<00:02:44.790> enter

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
click enter

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.479 
click enter
now<00:02:46.769> wall<00:02:47.130> with<00:02:47.400> needs<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.269> be<00:02:48.390> half<00:02:48.950> of<00:02:49.950> the

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
now wall with needs to be half of the

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.580 
now wall with needs to be half of the
brush<00:02:50.700> so<00:02:51.540> in<00:02:51.660> our<00:02:51.720> case<00:02:51.989> it's<00:02:52.260> going<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:52.500> be

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
brush so in our case it's going to be

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.190 
brush so in our case it's going to be
forty<00:02:53.010> number<00:02:53.580> of<00:02:53.700> sides<00:02:53.970> set<00:02:54.269> to<00:02:54.390> eight<00:02:54.569> this

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
forty number of sides set to eight this

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.640 
forty number of sides set to eight this
is<00:02:55.260> fine<00:02:55.730> we're<00:02:56.730> going<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.239> start<00:02:58.200> angle

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
is fine we're going to start angle

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.830 
is fine we're going to start angle
let's<00:02:58.860> try<00:02:59.130> 90<00:02:59.489> and<00:02:59.670> this<00:03:00.269> is<00:03:00.420> what<00:03:00.569> we<00:03:00.660> need

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
let's try 90 and this is what we need

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.130 
let's try 90 and this is what we need
because<00:03:01.019> we<00:03:01.140> want<00:03:01.530> our<00:03:01.739> curve<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:03.000> be<00:03:03.209> curving

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
because we want our curve to be curving

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.860 
because we want our curve to be curving
on<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:04.980> road<00:03:05.160> along<00:03:05.670> with<00:03:05.970> this<00:03:06.180> line<00:03:06.480> and

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
on to the road along with this line and

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.319 
on to the road along with this line and
if<00:03:07.500> we<00:03:07.709> treat<00:03:07.980> this<00:03:08.130> preview<00:03:08.579> as<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.760> top-down

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
if we treat this preview as a top-down

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.690 
if we treat this preview as a top-down
view<00:03:09.650> this<00:03:10.650> is<00:03:10.769> how<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:10.950> brush<00:03:11.250> is<00:03:11.400> going<00:03:11.519> to

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
view this is how the brush is going to

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.880 
view this is how the brush is going to
be<00:03:11.819> created<00:03:12.269> and<00:03:12.450> then<00:03:13.290> add<00:03:13.470> height<00:03:13.709> we're

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
be created and then add height we're

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.789 
be created and then add height we're
gonna<00:03:14.010> set<00:03:14.310> this<00:03:14.459> at<00:03:14.670> zero<00:03:14.930> click<00:03:15.930> OK<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:16.680> then

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
gonna set this at zero click OK and then

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.250 
gonna set this at zero click OK and then
we<00:03:16.890> can<00:03:17.040> take<00:03:17.220> this<00:03:17.459> brush<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.090> we<00:03:18.930> can<00:03:19.079> drag

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
we can take this brush and we can drag

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.960 
we can take this brush and we can drag
it<00:03:19.470> right<00:03:19.500> in<00:03:19.829> here<00:03:20.010> now<00:03:20.910> we<00:03:21.390> can<00:03:21.420> simply<00:03:22.019> take

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
it right in here now we can simply take

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.979 
it right in here now we can simply take
the<00:03:23.970> texture<00:03:24.360> on<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.750> side<00:03:24.930> here<00:03:26.120> alt<00:03:27.120> right

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
the texture on the side here alt right

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.080 
the texture on the side here alt right
click<00:03:28.700> onto<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.819> curb<00:03:31.670> so<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.790> texture

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
click onto the curb so the texture

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.569 
click onto the curb so the texture
curves<00:03:33.450> along<00:03:33.840> with<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.109> service<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:34.709> then

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
curves along with the service and then

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:40.670 
curves along with the service and then
we<00:03:35.700> have<00:03:35.880> a<00:03:36.569> wedge<00:03:37.290> for<00:03:37.620> our<00:03:37.980> curb<00:03:38.370> now<00:03:39.440> we<00:03:40.440> also

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
we have a wedge for our curb now we also

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.620 
we have a wedge for our curb now we also
have<00:03:40.980> this<00:03:41.100> gap<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:41.579> we<00:03:41.670> can<00:03:41.819> simply<00:03:42.209> fix<00:03:42.450> this

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
have this gap so we can simply fix this

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.550 
have this gap so we can simply fix this
by<00:03:42.840> going<00:03:43.230> into<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.650> side<00:03:43.859> view<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:45.560> I'm

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
by going into the side view and I'm

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.710 
by going into the side view and I'm
going<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.980> bring<00:03:47.190> this<00:03:47.340> up<00:03:47.519> so<00:03:47.819> it<00:03:48.329> matches<00:03:48.510> the

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
going to bring this up so it matches the

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.330 
going to bring this up so it matches the
top<00:03:49.049> of<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.290> road<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.799> I'm<00:03:49.920> just<00:03:50.100> simply

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
top of the road and I'm just simply

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.949 
top of the road and I'm just simply
going<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.549> take<00:03:50.730> this<00:03:51.630> brush<00:03:52.280> and<00:03:53.780> I'm<00:03:54.780> going

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
going to take this brush and I'm going

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.180 
going to take this brush and I'm going
to<00:03:55.019> duplicate<00:03:55.470> it

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.280 

and<00:03:58.670> now<00:03:58.880> I'm<00:03:58.970> going<00:03:59.210> to<00:03:59.450> extend<00:03:59.810> this<00:03:59.990> brush

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
and now I'm going to extend this brush

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:06.580 
and now I'm going to extend this brush
here<00:04:00.890> and<00:04:01.040> then<00:04:01.700> duplicate<00:04:02.450> it<00:04:02.480> on<00:04:02.720> here<00:04:05.590> so

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
here and then duplicate it on here so

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.570 
here and then duplicate it on here so
now<00:04:06.710> we<00:04:06.770> have<00:04:07.160> a<00:04:07.930> curved<00:04:08.930> surface<00:04:09.580> sidewalk

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
now we have a curved surface sidewalk

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.270 
now we have a curved surface sidewalk
and<00:04:10.820> this<00:04:11.450> area<00:04:11.720> blocked<00:04:12.020> off<00:04:12.260> and<00:04:12.920> then<00:04:13.130> we

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
and this area blocked off and then we

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.220 
and this area blocked off and then we
can<00:04:13.310> treat<00:04:13.640> this<00:04:13.820> area<00:04:14.180> with<00:04:14.390> a<00:04:14.420> texture<00:04:15.050> that

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
can treat this area with a texture that

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.240 
can treat this area with a texture that
sort<00:04:15.590> of<00:04:15.710> more<00:04:16.340> matches<00:04:16.850> to<00:04:17.260> this<00:04:18.260> curve<00:04:18.590> so

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
sort of more matches to this curve so

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.030 
sort of more matches to this curve so
this<00:04:19.790> method<00:04:20.120> would<00:04:20.480> be<00:04:20.540> the<00:04:20.810> most<00:04:20.989> basic<00:04:21.920> and

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
this method would be the most basic and

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.250 
this method would be the most basic and
simplest<00:04:22.550> way<00:04:22.730> to<00:04:22.760> block<00:04:23.270> off<00:04:23.600> and<00:04:23.900> create

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
simplest way to block off and create

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.080 
simplest way to block off and create
sidewalks<00:04:24.770> now<00:04:25.220> to<00:04:25.280> take<00:04:25.670> this<00:04:25.820> a<00:04:26.060> step

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
sidewalks now to take this a step

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.320 
sidewalks now to take this a step
further<00:04:26.630> we<00:04:27.500> can<00:04:27.620> begin<00:04:28.010> using<00:04:28.280> props<00:04:28.790> to

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
further we can begin using props to

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.630 
further we can begin using props to
create<00:04:29.630> curves<00:04:29.990> if<00:04:30.500> we<00:04:30.680> click<00:04:30.920> on<00:04:31.070> to<00:04:31.490> the

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
create curves if we click on to the

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
we have various curbs that we can use so

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.260

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
straight curbs that we can use so first

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.240

let's<00:04:58.330> let's<00:04:59.330> use<00:04:59.630> this<00:04:59.900> for<00:05:00.530> our<00:05:00.560> corner

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
let's let's use this for our corner

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.780 
let's let's use this for our corner
let's<00:05:01.640> take<00:05:01.880> this<00:05:02.060> and<00:05:02.840> let's<00:05:03.280> position<00:05:04.280> it

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
let's take this and let's position it

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.140 
let's take this and let's position it
right<00:05:05.270> alongside<00:05:05.800> right<00:05:06.800> over<00:05:07.040> here<00:05:07.310> now

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
right alongside right over here now

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.909 
right alongside right over here now
let's<00:05:08.360> bring<00:05:08.630> this<00:05:08.810> down

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:22.899 

and<00:05:14.039> then<00:05:14.580> we<00:05:14.669> need<00:05:14.819> to<00:05:15.199> rework<00:05:16.199> our<00:05:16.379> brushes

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:22.909 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:27.890 

and<00:05:24.949> pull<00:05:25.949> in<00:05:26.189> some<00:05:26.490> of<00:05:26.610> these<00:05:26.699> brushes<00:05:26.999> so<00:05:27.779> we

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
and pull in some of these brushes so we

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.649 
and pull in some of these brushes so we
can<00:05:28.050> create<00:05:28.520> more<00:05:29.520> space<00:05:29.849> where<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.180> curb<00:05:30.479> is

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:30.659 
can create more space where the curb is

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:36.019 
can create more space where the curb is
going<00:05:30.900> to<00:05:31.020> go<00:05:33.650> so<00:05:34.650> here<00:05:34.919> we<00:05:35.099> have<00:05:35.249> our<00:05:35.460> wedge<00:05:35.699> we

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:36.029 
going to go so here we have our wedge we

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:38.450 
going to go so here we have our wedge we
have<00:05:36.210> a<00:05:36.419> prop<00:05:36.749> static<00:05:37.199> for<00:05:37.919> the<00:05:37.979> curb<00:05:38.189> that

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
have a prop static for the curb that

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.550 
have a prop static for the curb that
adds<00:05:38.909> a<00:05:39.060> little<00:05:39.210> bit<00:05:39.360> more<00:05:39.539> detail<00:05:39.960> to<00:05:40.229> the

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
adds a little bit more detail to the

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.519 
adds a little bit more detail to the
side<00:05:41.069> of<00:05:41.340> the<00:05:41.669> sidewalk<00:05:42.139> so<00:05:43.139> then<00:05:43.289> we<00:05:43.379> can

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:43.529 
side of the sidewalk so then we can

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:45.739 
side of the sidewalk so then we can
simply<00:05:43.830> take<00:05:44.009> this<00:05:44.279> we<00:05:45.120> can<00:05:45.270> duplicate<00:05:45.689> it

00:05:45.739 --> 00:05:45.749 
simply take this we can duplicate it

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:49.070 
simply take this we can duplicate it
change<00:05:46.740> this<00:05:47.069> world<00:05:47.490> model<00:05:47.939> to<00:05:48.150> something

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
change this world model to something

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.439 
change this world model to something
else<00:05:49.229> to<00:05:49.500> a<00:05:49.529> more<00:05:50.219> straight<00:05:50.580> curb<00:05:50.819> there<00:05:51.300> is

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:51.449 
else to a more straight curb there is

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:55.610 
else to a more straight curb there is
curb<00:05:51.719> straight<00:05:52.110> that's<00:05:52.800> 128<00:05:53.520> units<00:05:54.379> so<00:05:55.379> we<00:05:55.469> can

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
curb straight that's 128 units so we can

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.260 
curb straight that's 128 units so we can
take<00:05:55.800> this<00:05:55.979> we<00:05:56.310> can<00:05:56.490> rotate<00:05:56.909> it<00:05:59.120> and<00:06:00.120> if<00:06:00.180> we

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
take this we can rotate it and if we

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.269 
take this we can rotate it and if we
take<00:06:00.449> a<00:06:00.479> look<00:06:00.659> at<00:06:00.840> here<00:06:01.050> on<00:06:01.139> the<00:06:01.229> side<00:06:01.439> we<00:06:02.099> have

00:06:02.269 --> 00:06:02.279 
take a look at here on the side we have

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:04.429 
take a look at here on the side we have
our<00:06:02.310> curb<00:06:02.819> and<00:06:03.389> then<00:06:03.539> we<00:06:03.629> can<00:06:03.779> begin<00:06:03.930> to<00:06:04.110> take

00:06:04.429 --> 00:06:04.439 
our curb and then we can begin to take

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:07.159 
our curb and then we can begin to take
this<00:06:04.590> curb<00:06:04.830> and<00:06:05.069> just<00:06:05.310> simply<00:06:06.050> duplicate<00:06:07.050> it

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
this curb and just simply duplicate it

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:14.179 
this curb and just simply duplicate it
along<00:06:09.680> the<00:06:10.680> entire<00:06:10.949> sidewalk<00:06:12.560> and<00:06:13.560> when<00:06:14.159> I

00:06:14.179 --> 00:06:14.189 
along the entire sidewalk and when I

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:16.459 
along the entire sidewalk and when I
take<00:06:14.460> these<00:06:14.699> three<00:06:15.150> and<00:06:16.110> we're<00:06:16.289> going<00:06:16.409> to

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:16.469 
take these three and we're going to

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:21.050 
take these three and we're going to
duplicate<00:06:16.919> them<00:06:17.069> on<00:06:17.249> to<00:06:17.610> the<00:06:17.759> other<00:06:17.909> side<00:06:20.060> so

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
duplicate them on to the other side so

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.999 
duplicate them on to the other side so
this<00:06:21.270> is<00:06:21.539> a<00:06:21.569> more<00:06:21.930> detailed<00:06:22.199> way<00:06:22.620> a<00:06:22.830> little

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:23.009 
this is a more detailed way a little

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:25.219 
this is a more detailed way a little
better<00:06:23.310> way<00:06:23.520> to<00:06:24.089> create<00:06:24.270> sidewalks

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:25.229 
better way to create sidewalks

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:27.369 
better way to create sidewalks
I'm<00:06:25.680> begin<00:06:26.250> blacken<00:06:26.610> off<00:06:26.729> the<00:06:26.879> street<00:06:27.150> and

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:27.379 
I'm begin blacken off the street and

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:30.200 
I'm begin blacken off the street and
then<00:06:28.379> if<00:06:28.680> we<00:06:29.099> want<00:06:29.279> to<00:06:29.460> begin<00:06:29.639> to<00:06:29.849> add

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
then if we want to begin to add

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.110 
then if we want to begin to add
buildings<00:06:30.930> we<00:06:31.169> can<00:06:31.319> simply<00:06:31.939> continue<00:06:32.939> from

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
buildings we can simply continue from

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.689 
buildings we can simply continue from
here<00:06:33.180> and<00:06:33.629> now<00:06:34.439> that<00:06:34.469> we<00:06:34.740> have<00:06:34.889> our<00:06:35.039> sidewalk

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:35.699 
here and now that we have our sidewalk

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:39.170 
here and now that we have our sidewalk
just<00:06:36.539> begin<00:06:37.050> to<00:06:37.199> expand<00:06:37.680> further<00:06:38.039> and<00:06:38.370> add

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
just begin to expand further and add

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:46.020 
just begin to expand further and add
further<00:06:39.569> detail<00:06:40.050> to<00:06:40.349> the<00:06:40.500> environment

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.030 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.880 

now<00:06:47.030> let's<00:06:47.210> browse<00:06:47.840> for<00:06:48.170> a<00:06:48.230> texture<00:06:48.680> let's

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:48.890 
now let's browse for a texture let's

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:59.589 
now let's browse for a texture let's
type<00:06:49.550> in<00:06:49.730> building

00:06:59.589 --> 00:06:59.599 

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:02.989 

so<00:07:00.599> here<00:07:00.809> we<00:07:00.960> have<00:07:01.199> our<00:07:01.740> intersection<00:07:02.490> we<00:07:02.789> have

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:02.999 
so here we have our intersection we have

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:06.049 
so here we have our intersection we have
our<00:07:03.240> curb<00:07:03.779> our<00:07:04.139> sidewalk<00:07:04.889> and<00:07:05.189> a<00:07:05.639> simple

00:07:06.049 --> 00:07:06.059 
our curb our sidewalk and a simple

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:08.629 
our curb our sidewalk and a simple
building<00:07:06.360> with<00:07:06.779> a<00:07:06.809> player<00:07:07.710> scale<00:07:08.129> for

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 
building with a player scale for

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:10.070 
building with a player scale for
reference<00:07:08.999> so<00:07:09.089> we<00:07:09.270> can<00:07:09.419> take<00:07:09.569> a<00:07:09.599> look<00:07:09.779> at<00:07:09.930> how

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 
reference so we can take a look at how

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.619 
reference so we can take a look at how
this<00:07:10.259> looks<00:07:10.669> along<00:07:11.669> with<00:07:11.879> a<00:07:12.059> human<00:07:12.419> reference

00:07:12.619 --> 00:07:12.629 
this looks along with a human reference

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:15.679 
this looks along with a human reference
in<00:07:12.960> here<00:07:13.139> so<00:07:13.710> this<00:07:13.860> is<00:07:14.009> a<00:07:14.039> basic<00:07:14.249> way<00:07:14.550> to<00:07:14.689> block

00:07:15.679 --> 00:07:15.689 
in here so this is a basic way to block

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:17.719 
in here so this is a basic way to block
off<00:07:15.930> and<00:07:16.289> begin<00:07:16.559> creating<00:07:16.919> sidewalks<00:07:17.550> and

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:17.729 
off and begin creating sidewalks and

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.959 
off and begin creating sidewalks and
curbs<00:07:17.969> to<00:07:18.719> detail<00:07:19.139> more<00:07:19.529> of<00:07:19.830> around<00:07:20.610> the<00:07:20.759> road

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:20.969 
curbs to detail more of around the road

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:24.019 
curbs to detail more of around the road
so<00:07:21.779> here<00:07:21.990> I<00:07:22.020> spent<00:07:22.499> about<00:07:22.710> 10<00:07:23.399> minutes<00:07:23.669> just

00:07:24.019 --> 00:07:24.029 
so here I spent about 10 minutes just

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:27.200 
so here I spent about 10 minutes just
making<00:07:24.930> the<00:07:25.469> sidewalk<00:07:26.009> and<00:07:26.309> the<00:07:26.580> street

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.210 
making the sidewalk and the street

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.790 
making the sidewalk and the street
intersection<00:07:28.199> a<00:07:28.319> little<00:07:28.529> bit<00:07:28.649> more

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 
intersection a little bit more

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.600 
intersection a little bit more
believable<00:07:29.129> I<00:07:29.550> swapped<00:07:30.479> out<00:07:30.689> the<00:07:30.719> curb<00:07:31.339> with<00:07:32.339> a

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:32.610 
believable I swapped out the curb with a

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.989 
believable I swapped out the curb with a
more<00:07:32.939> of<00:07:33.240> what<00:07:33.930> it<00:07:34.169> matches<00:07:34.680> our<00:07:34.830> Road<00:07:35.129> so<00:07:35.969> I

00:07:35.989 --> 00:07:35.999 
more of what it matches our Road so I

00:07:35.999 --> 00:07:38.329 
more of what it matches our Road so I
got<00:07:36.360> rid<00:07:36.509> of<00:07:36.629> this<00:07:36.809> little<00:07:37.229> nasty<00:07:37.680> pavement

00:07:38.329 --> 00:07:38.339 
got rid of this little nasty pavement

00:07:38.339 --> 00:07:39.679 
got rid of this little nasty pavement
underneath<00:07:38.729> that<00:07:38.879> we<00:07:38.999> had<00:07:39.149> showing<00:07:39.569> I

00:07:39.679 --> 00:07:39.689 
underneath that we had showing I

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:41.719 
underneath that we had showing I
replaced<00:07:40.379> the<00:07:40.499> texture<00:07:40.889> on<00:07:41.039> top<00:07:41.279> of<00:07:41.520> the

00:07:41.719 --> 00:07:41.729 
replaced the texture on top of the

00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:44.659 
replaced the texture on top of the
sidewalk<00:07:42.419> and<00:07:42.749> I<00:07:43.139> added<00:07:43.409> a<00:07:43.499> few<00:07:43.680> props<00:07:43.979> as<00:07:44.279> well

00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:44.669 
sidewalk and I added a few props as well

00:07:44.669 --> 00:07:46.279 
sidewalk and I added a few props as well
as<00:07:44.819> replaced<00:07:45.240> the<00:07:45.330> texture<00:07:45.689> on<00:07:45.839> the<00:07:45.959> building

00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:46.289 
as replaced the texture on the building

00:07:46.289 --> 00:07:48.469 
as replaced the texture on the building
so<00:07:46.860> you<00:07:46.919> can<00:07:47.339> see<00:07:47.550> that<00:07:47.759> this<00:07:47.909> is<00:07:48.119> a<00:07:48.149> very

00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:48.479 
so you can see that this is a very

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:50.480 
so you can see that this is a very
powerful<00:07:48.959> method<00:07:49.139> for<00:07:49.319> creating<00:07:49.649> your

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:50.490 
powerful method for creating your

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.059 
powerful method for creating your
sidewalks<00:07:51.119> and<00:07:51.389> with<00:07:51.990> a<00:07:52.020> few<00:07:52.409> more<00:07:52.740> prop

00:07:53.059 --> 00:07:53.069 
sidewalks and with a few more prop

00:07:53.069 --> 00:07:54.679 
sidewalks and with a few more prop
statics<00:07:53.580> around<00:07:53.999> that<00:07:54.209> you<00:07:54.300> can<00:07:54.479> really

00:07:54.679 --> 00:07:54.689 
statics around that you can really

00:07:54.689 --> 00:07:59.659 
statics around that you can really
create<00:07:55.349> a<00:07:55.889> unbelievable<00:07:56.659> environment
