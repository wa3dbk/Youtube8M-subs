00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
like the middle of it google keyboard

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.440 
like the middle of it google keyboard
I'm<00:04:16.070> surprised<00:04:16.489> it's<00:04:16.700> not<00:04:16.760> one<00:04:17.000> for<00:04:17.150> google

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
I'm surprised it's not one for google

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.250 
I'm surprised it's not one for google
keyboard<00:04:17.830> as<00:04:18.830> you<00:04:19.220> can<00:04:19.340> see<00:04:19.690> they're<00:04:20.690> all<00:04:20.870> teal

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
keyboard as you can see they're all teal

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.249 
keyboard as you can see they're all teal
so<00:04:21.590> it's<00:04:21.769> pretty<00:04:22.490> obvious<00:04:23.030> which

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:24.259 
so it's pretty obvious which

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:30.529 
so it's pretty obvious which
don't<00:04:25.259> have<00:04:26.479> a<00:04:27.479> theme<00:04:28.319> or<00:04:28.620> a<00:04:28.740> mask<00:04:29.580> for<00:04:29.819> it<00:04:30.120> so

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
don't have a theme or a mask for it so

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.760 
don't have a theme or a mask for it so
as<00:04:31.349> you<00:04:31.560> can<00:04:31.620> see<00:04:31.770> when<00:04:31.919> you<00:04:32.009> open<00:04:32.039> your<00:04:32.370> app
