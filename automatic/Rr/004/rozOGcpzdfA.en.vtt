00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
so here I have some hexagons that I've

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.459 
so here I have some hexagons that I've
already<00:00:47.170> sewn<00:00:47.469> together<00:00:47.739> and<00:00:48.640> I<00:00:48.760> have<00:00:48.969> a<00:00:49.000> row

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
already sewn together and I have a row

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.400 
already sewn together and I have a row
sewn<00:00:50.469> ready<00:00:51.100> to<00:00:51.340> attach<00:00:51.730> to<00:00:52.539> the<00:00:52.870> other<00:00:53.050> piece

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
sewn ready to attach to the other piece

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.799 
sewn ready to attach to the other piece
let<00:00:54.190> me<00:00:54.309> talk<00:00:54.550> about<00:00:54.579> how<00:00:55.000> we<00:00:55.059> sew<00:00:55.449> the<00:00:55.480> rows

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
let me talk about how we sew the rows

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.549 
let me talk about how we sew the rows
together<00:00:56.969> hexagons<00:00:57.969> have<00:00:58.329> two<00:00:58.809> sides<00:00:59.199> that

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
together hexagons have two sides that

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.459 
together hexagons have two sides that
have<00:01:00.010> a<00:01:00.039> straight<00:01:00.579> of<00:01:00.730> grain<00:01:00.760> and<00:01:01.449> the<00:01:02.199> other

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
have a straight of grain and the other

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:05.430 
have a straight of grain and the other
four<00:01:02.859> sides<00:01:03.190> are<00:01:03.609> going<00:01:04.059> to<00:01:04.120> be<00:01:04.379> pretty<00:01:05.379> much

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
four sides are going to be pretty much

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.550 
four sides are going to be pretty much
bias<00:01:06.000> we<00:01:07.000> want<00:01:07.240> to<00:01:07.420> sew<00:01:07.659> the<00:01:07.900> rows<00:01:08.079> together

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
bias we want to sew the rows together

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.460 
bias we want to sew the rows together
with<00:01:09.100> a<00:01:09.130> straight<00:01:09.610> of<00:01:09.820> green<00:01:10.119> edges<00:01:10.479> together

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
with a straight of green edges together

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.760 
with a straight of green edges together
so<00:01:12.460> I<00:01:12.490> would<00:01:12.850> just<00:01:13.060> place<00:01:13.540> one<00:01:13.570> at<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.320> bottom

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
so I would just place one at the bottom

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.830 
so I would just place one at the bottom
of<00:01:15.009> this<00:01:15.610> row<00:01:15.939> and<00:01:16.470> stitch<00:01:17.470> on<00:01:17.770> this<00:01:18.159> edge<00:01:18.430> I

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
of this row and stitch on this edge I

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.300 
of this row and stitch on this edge I
don't<00:01:19.840> want<00:01:20.020> to<00:01:20.140> stitch<00:01:20.350> completely<00:01:20.979> from

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
don't want to stitch completely from

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.370 
don't want to stitch completely from
edge<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:21.549> edge<00:01:21.790> but<00:01:22.329> I<00:01:22.450> want<00:01:22.630> to<00:01:22.750> start<00:01:23.020> about<00:01:23.200> a

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
edge to edge but I want to start about a

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.910 
edge to edge but I want to start about a
quarter<00:01:23.950> of<00:01:23.979> an<00:01:24.100> inch<00:01:24.250> in<00:01:24.549> from<00:01:25.450> the<00:01:25.479> corner

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
quarter of an inch in from the corner

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.100 
quarter of an inch in from the corner
down<00:01:26.920> and<00:01:27.369> stop<00:01:28.030> about<00:01:28.390> a<00:01:28.450> quarter<00:01:28.869> of<00:01:28.899> an<00:01:29.020> inch

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
down and stop about a quarter of an inch

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.910 
down and stop about a quarter of an inch
away<00:01:29.380> from<00:01:29.619> the<00:01:29.920> edge<00:01:30.189> I<00:01:30.549> don't<00:01:31.329> usually<00:01:32.259> mark

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
away from the edge I don't usually mark

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.539 
away from the edge I don't usually mark
actually<00:01:33.700> I<00:01:33.939> never<00:01:34.060> mark<00:01:34.689> a<00:01:35.250> mark<00:01:36.250> to<00:01:36.430> the

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
actually I never mark a mark to the

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.030 
actually I never mark a mark to the
first<00:01:36.850> hexagons<00:01:37.450> quilt<00:01:37.750> I<00:01:37.899> made<00:01:38.140> and<00:01:38.409> that

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
first hexagons quilt I made and that

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.459 
first hexagons quilt I made and that
took<00:01:39.280> so<00:01:39.490> long<00:01:39.520> I<00:01:39.939> decided<00:01:40.329> I<00:01:40.689> did<00:01:40.990> not<00:01:41.020> enjoy

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:41.469 
took so long I decided I did not enjoy

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.480 
took so long I decided I did not enjoy
that<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:43.119> I<00:01:43.509> discovered<00:01:44.110> that<00:01:44.560> I<00:01:44.920> don't<00:01:45.250> need

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
that so I discovered that I don't need

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.510 
that so I discovered that I don't need
to<00:01:45.670> mark<00:01:45.909> I<00:01:47.009> can<00:01:48.009> just<00:01:48.930> estimate<00:01:50.399> because<00:01:51.399> I

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
to mark I can just estimate because I

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.350 
to mark I can just estimate because I
don't<00:01:52.149> want<00:01:52.450> to<00:01:52.539> go<00:01:53.280> completely<00:01:54.280> a<00:01:54.640> quarter<00:01:55.240> of

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
don't want to go completely a quarter of

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.690 
don't want to go completely a quarter of
an<00:01:55.479> inch<00:01:55.600> from<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.960> end<00:01:56.170> anyway<00:01:56.680> I<00:01:56.979> want<00:01:57.610> to

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
an inch from the end anyway I want to

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.849 
an inch from the end anyway I want to
stop<00:01:57.969> about<00:01:58.240> one<00:01:58.539> stitch<00:01:58.899> away<00:01:59.109> from<00:01:59.320> the

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859 
stop about one stitch away from the

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:04.349 
stop about one stitch away from the
quarter<00:02:00.430> inch<00:02:00.700> dot<00:02:01.060> if<00:02:01.810> if<00:02:02.200> I<00:02:02.469> had<00:02:02.770> made<00:02:03.369> a<00:02:03.759> mark

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:04.359 
quarter inch dot if if I had made a mark

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:07.859 
quarter inch dot if if I had made a mark
or<00:02:04.570> a<00:02:04.659> dot<00:02:05.140> at<00:02:05.649> the<00:02:05.920> quarter<00:02:06.280> inch<00:02:06.869> position

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
or a dot at the quarter inch position

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.139 
or a dot at the quarter inch position
and<00:02:08.110> stitched<00:02:08.590> completely<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:09.430> that<00:02:09.580> dot<00:02:09.820> my

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
and stitched completely to that dot my

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.229 
and stitched completely to that dot my
seams<00:02:10.450> wouldn't<00:02:10.810> lay<00:02:10.929> flat<00:02:11.200> anyway<00:02:11.500> so<00:02:12.190> I<00:02:12.550> want

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
seams wouldn't lay flat anyway so I want

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.910 
seams wouldn't lay flat anyway so I want
to<00:02:13.269> mark<00:02:13.540> it<00:02:13.750> if<00:02:13.959> you're<00:02:14.140> not<00:02:14.200> going<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.620> stop

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.430 
so here's my row and I'm going to attach
it<00:02:20.650> to<00:02:20.680> this<00:02:20.980> group<00:02:21.220> over<00:02:21.640> here<00:02:21.880> so<00:02:22.599> this<00:02:23.170> is

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
it to this group over here so this is

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.740 
it to this group over here so this is
the<00:02:23.739> seam<00:02:24.040> if<00:02:24.310> you<00:02:24.430> can<00:02:24.640> see<00:02:24.910> that<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:25.630> I'm

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
the seam if you can see that that I'm

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.100 
the seam if you can see that that I'm
going<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:25.989> so<00:02:26.260> first<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.880> it's<00:02:28.720> kind<00:02:29.020> of

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
going to so first and it's kind of

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.920 
going to so first and it's kind of
awkward<00:02:29.650> when<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:30.760> line<00:02:31.000> it<00:02:31.209> up<00:02:31.360> because<00:02:31.780> of

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
awkward when you line it up because of

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.720 
awkward when you line it up because of
course<00:02:31.959> we're<00:02:32.380> going<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:32.590> flip<00:02:32.890> this<00:02:33.100> right

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
course we're going to flip this right

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.059 
course we're going to flip this right
sides<00:02:34.060> together<00:02:34.739> just<00:02:35.739> like<00:02:35.830> that<00:02:37.860> line<00:02:38.860> up

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
sides together just like that line up

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.930 
sides together just like that line up
the<00:02:39.220> edges<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:40.440> look<00:02:41.440> that<00:02:41.680> makes<00:02:41.980> this<00:02:42.489> row

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
the edges and look that makes this row

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.270 
the edges and look that makes this row
go<00:02:43.330> in<00:02:43.510> this<00:02:43.690> direction<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.560> this<00:02:44.800> group<00:02:45.069> is

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
go in this direction and this group is

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.979 
go in this direction and this group is
over<00:02:45.459> in<00:02:45.670> this<00:02:45.819> direction<00:02:46.030> and<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.599> just<00:02:46.840> feels

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
over in this direction and it just feels

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.140 
over in this direction and it just feels
awkward<00:02:47.349> but<00:02:48.220> that's<00:02:48.430> just<00:02:48.670> what<00:02:48.850> I'm<00:02:49.000> going

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
awkward but that's just what I'm going

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.240 
awkward but that's just what I'm going
to<00:02:49.330> have<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.720> do<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.170> I'm<00:02:50.680> going<00:02:50.860> to<00:02:50.890> start

but if you if you actually look at this

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.680 
but if you if you actually look at this
here<00:03:51.609> let's<00:03:51.850> look<00:03:52.000> at<00:03:52.150> this<00:03:52.299> one

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
here let's look at this one

here let's look at this one
there<00:03:53.260> is<00:03:53.530> your<00:03:53.769> letter<00:03:54.040> Y<00:03:54.400> so<00:03:55.329> it's<00:03:55.540> this

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
there is your letter Y so it's this

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.080 
there is your letter Y so it's this
point<00:03:56.170> right<00:03:56.410> here<00:03:56.799> that<00:03:57.100> people<00:03:57.549> are<00:03:58.060> a

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
point right here that people are a

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.620 
point right here that people are a
little<00:03:58.480> bit<00:03:58.690> shy<00:03:59.049> about<00:03:59.880> so<00:04:00.880> easy<00:04:01.239> I'm<00:04:01.569> going

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
little bit shy about so easy I'm going

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.099 
little bit shy about so easy I'm going
to<00:04:01.810> flip<00:04:02.109> this<00:04:02.140> over<00:04:02.620> this<00:04:03.430> direction<00:04:04.060> now<00:04:04.299> so

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
to flip this over this direction now so

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.809 
to flip this over this direction now so
that<00:04:05.440> these<00:04:05.920> raw<00:04:06.640> edges<00:04:06.970> line<00:04:07.780> up<00:04:07.810> and<00:04:08.819> I'm

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
that these raw edges line up and I'm

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.300 
that these raw edges line up and I'm
going<00:04:09.970> to<00:04:10.030> just<00:04:10.269> do<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.600> same<00:04:10.630> thing

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
going to just do the same thing

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.970 
going to just do the same thing
everything<00:04:12.310> looks<00:04:12.549> awkward<00:04:12.760> again<00:04:13.180> see<00:04:13.980> this

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
everything looks awkward again see this

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.789 
everything looks awkward again see this
hexagon<00:04:15.850> folded<00:04:16.419> in<00:04:16.539> half<00:04:16.750> to<00:04:17.200> allow<00:04:17.500> me<00:04:17.769> to

hexagon folded in half to allow me to

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.640 
hexagon folded in half to allow me to
lay<00:04:18.609> these<00:04:18.850> edges<00:04:19.359> together<00:04:19.539> I'm<00:04:20.410> going<00:04:20.590> to

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
lay these edges together I'm going to

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.129 
lay these edges together I'm going to
take<00:04:20.859> it<00:04:21.010> to<00:04:21.160> the<00:04:21.250> sewing<00:04:21.459> machine<00:04:21.639> and<00:04:22.210> stitch
