00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
know a bare-bones version might just

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.860 
know a bare-bones version might just
forgot<00:00:46.710> like<00:00:46.859> d7<00:00:47.519> something<00:00:48.269> around<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> flat

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
forgot like d7 something around the flat

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:57.919 
forgot like d7 something around the flat
bottom<00:00:49.079> instead<00:00:49.859> of<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:55.969> just<00:00:56.969> played<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.390> or

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.160 
bottom instead of a just played this or
a<00:00:57.960> minor<00:00:58.409> seven<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:59.039> minor<00:00:59.640> seven<00:00:59.999> games<00:01:00.179> just

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
a minor seven a minor seven games just

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.250 
a minor seven a minor seven games just
like<00:01:01.249> I<00:01:02.249> was<00:01:03.030> doing<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.359> still<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.019> F

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
like I was doing that still on the F

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.340 
like I was doing that still on the F
right<00:01:04.940> so<00:01:05.940> it<00:01:06.060> wasn't<00:01:06.240> instead<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.870> the<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> it

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
right so it wasn't instead of the a it

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.310 
right so it wasn't instead of the a it
was<00:01:07.470> still<00:01:07.770> just<00:01:08.040> like<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.820> minor<00:01:09.659> seven<00:01:10.080> right

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
was still just like a minor seven right

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.800 
was still just like a minor seven right
same<00:01:10.590> thing<00:01:10.620> this<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.370> like<00:01:11.520> yeah

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.709 

so<00:01:15.810> that's<00:01:16.020> instead<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.530> d7<00:01:17.570> they're<00:01:18.570> not

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:18.719 
so that's instead of d7 they're not

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:35.970 
so that's instead of d7 they're not
probably<00:01:18.990> as<00:01:19.110> G<00:01:19.320> minor<00:01:19.560> stuff<00:01:19.950> yeah

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.550 

there's<00:01:36.980> that<00:01:37.160> flat<00:01:37.610> instead<00:01:38.200> that's<00:01:39.200> it

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
there's that flat instead that's it

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.960 
there's that flat instead that's it
instead<00:01:40.160> of<00:01:40.310> D<00:01:40.550> minor<00:01:40.790> 7<00:01:41.060> flat<00:01:41.210> 5<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:43.670> fact

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
instead of D minor 7 flat 5 the fact

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.390 
instead of D minor 7 flat 5 the fact
that<00:01:44.060> if<00:01:44.210> you<00:01:44.330> bring<00:01:44.479> over<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.840> base<00:01:45.400> you've

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
that if you bring over the base you've

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:55.170 
that if you bring over the base you've
got<00:01:50.890> that<00:01:51.890> Corgi<00:01:52.430> is<00:01:52.460> is<00:01:52.970> D<00:01:53.510> minor<00:01:53.720> 7

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
got that Corgi is is D minor 7

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:07.430 
got that Corgi is is D minor 7
Yeah<00:01:55.870> right<00:01:56.020> okay<00:01:56.380> I<00:01:56.680> see<00:01:56.980> that

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:24.190 

more<00:02:08.440> then<00:02:08.979> what<00:02:09.130> is<00:02:09.220> it<00:02:09.340> -<00:02:09.369> after<00:02:09.640> see

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:35.690 

so<00:02:24.740> that's<00:02:24.920> all<00:02:25.099> fairly<00:02:25.520> normal<00:02:25.849> right<00:02:26.150> there

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.740 

you<00:02:36.700> know<00:02:36.790> what<00:02:36.880> I<00:02:36.940> think<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.210> does<00:02:37.240> there<00:02:37.600> it's

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
you know what I think it does there it's

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:59.360 
you know what I think it does there it's
one<00:02:37.900> of<00:02:37.990> those<00:02:38.610> seven<00:02:53.040> on<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.160> end<00:02:54.310> itself

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.540 

approaching<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.460> court<00:03:01.260> Jasman<00:03:02.550> his

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
approaching the court Jasman his

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:53.260 
approaching the court Jasman his
approach

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.500 

I<00:03:53.300> would<00:03:53.780> say<00:03:53.960> 95%<00:03:54.650> of<00:03:55.130> the<00:03:55.250> extra<00:03:55.550> force<00:03:55.940> on

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
I would say 95% of the extra force on

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.170 
I would say 95% of the extra force on
them<00:03:56.930> better<00:03:57.680> just<00:03:57.920> extra<00:03:58.400> cords<00:03:58.790> or<00:03:58.970> to<00:03:59.030> say

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
them better just extra cords or to say

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.330 
them better just extra cords or to say
well<00:03:59.420> he's<00:03:59.990> retained<00:04:00.440> with<00:04:00.620> normal<00:04:01.010> parts<00:04:01.220> you

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
well he's retained with normal parts you

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.430 
well he's retained with normal parts you
seem<00:04:01.520> to<00:04:01.670> have<00:04:02.120> a<00:04:02.270> difficulty<00:04:02.870> would<00:04:03.320> be

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
seem to have a difficulty would be

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.880 
seem to have a difficulty would be
approachable<00:04:04.120> and<00:04:05.120> of<00:04:05.360> those<00:04:05.570> maybe<00:04:05.900> 95%<00:04:06.530> of

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
approachable and of those maybe 95% of

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.980 
approachable and of those maybe 95% of
those<00:04:07.040> would<00:04:07.250> be<00:04:07.720> going<00:04:10.660> this<00:04:11.660> is<00:04:11.780> a<00:04:11.840> good

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
those would be going this is a good

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.170 
those would be going this is a good
example<00:04:12.140> we<00:04:12.500> have<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:14.950> same<00:04:15.950> Gino<00:04:16.610> I<00:04:16.820> mean<00:04:17.120> I'm
