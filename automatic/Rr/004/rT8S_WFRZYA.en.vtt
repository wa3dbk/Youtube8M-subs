00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.560
 in the mount one can be found in the 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.090
 situation of having to make a rappel 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.580
 without having the equipment without having a harness 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.640
 manufactured for this purpose 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.670
 specialized 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:19.790
 one can make one can be made 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.580
 harness with material like tubular tape 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.270
 as begged to use it about six meters 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.840
 quite 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.210
 the way this is done 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.840
 stern is that it is quite simple what 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.080
 you need here 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.190
 we measure inta tubular about 6 meters and 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.660
 medium is fine more or less 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.140
 and the way it is done is the 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.519
 next we take of the goal we already have 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.340
 well measured here that is half of the 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:45.990
 tape 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.870
 we travel about 50 centimeters 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.360
 approximately more or less since not 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.010
 we have here we introduce in this part 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.380
 in the pants 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.970
 we passed the tapes in the back 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.630
 and then when we have it when the 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.370
 we went ahead we put them in the 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.590
 loops we had already done when 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.320
 we talk about tapes on one side going to 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.320
 end shorter than the other 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.320
 we climbed 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.329
 what we are going to do from that 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:18.290
 moment is to start spinning the 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:21.550
 simple tape 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.550
 spin the ribbon 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.130
 On the one hand, we're going to finish first 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.579
 the other by in sections that we remember in 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:34.969
 other sides we keep circling 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:38.530
 we have on this side the two ends 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:38.530
 because here is 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.880
 in our waist 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.280
 all those who do not 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.280
 all right 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:13.190
 we press here what we are going to do is 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.920
 drink 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.390
 this is this part of this part of the 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.390
 tape next to the tail 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:32.100
 or the tapes on this side and finally 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:36.120
 Now we can connect it to our 5 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.120
 let's go also we close it 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.690
 It is important 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.690
 the second 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.980
 the weakest part 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.980
 and at this moment we can already 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.720
 meats 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.319
 is a harness that can not stand is a 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.720
 harness that will allow us to do the 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.330
 paper 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.750
 it's not a harness as comfortable as one 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.730
 manufactured by a certified company 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:17.590
 obviously but no more 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.720
 it is not advisable to do it with cord 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.440
 because they are more feel that they are more 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.190
 short and we can hurt ourselves more if 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.930
 Stern the world comfortable enough 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.640
 with us much less accessories 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.700
 shorter more we will tighten this from 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.610
 fact is one inch d 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.239
 of the diameter this harness of none 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.250
 way replaces an approved harness of 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.440
 escalation in fact by a company 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.060
 recognized but as I say for a 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.660
 emergency situation is a harness that 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.660
 it can work
