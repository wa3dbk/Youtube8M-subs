 Hello, the region itself 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.960
 dot com one new monitor he lives or 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.520
 fifty which is interesting truth 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.070
 first of all with the fact that it applies 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.450
 LED backlight as well 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.540
 unusual design 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.520
 coasters and legs that allows you to 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.490
 the convenience of using the monitor 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.520
 not only with the desktop 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.259
 computers it agony 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.859
 we had a monitor with a diagonal of 21 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.100
 the declination of May 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.360
 today 50 still reaches the capital earlier than 18 s

 half and 23 inches 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.060
 they are all equipped with inexpensive drunk 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.840
 matrixes aspect ratio 16 9 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.620
 and 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.500
 reaction time is 50 cubic meters 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.300
 object positioning 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.060
 the monitor say its connectors are only 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.920
 movements by dealers although taking into account 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.649
 permissions to receive and 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.610
 could be expected if in winter 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.470
 LED lights 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.540
 use monitoring not only 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.300
 low power consumption but 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.129
 and thin body exactly monitor painted 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.170
 estimates are made one and a half 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.900
 father is at the monitors with a small 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.770
 a secret

 not long ago that particular design 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.430
 as for not only increased 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.670
 this way you can maximize 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.110
 effectively organize your 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.450
 handwriting space using 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.720
 external monitor space for 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.510
 placing the panels withstanding windows or 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.490
 working papers 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.759
 note on the front there is no 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.260
 no signatures for smog plainly 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.310
 the current key assignment is displayed 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.130
 on savings with points 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.500
 relevant government agencies on 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.840
 to companies 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.650
 but as you can see it is very convenient and not 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:45.890
 require to let go and no 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.390
 extra effort 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.310
 for the first time everything is as simple as possible 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.020
 intuitively 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.900
 such an organization of his touch buttons 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.350
 Other than a good design 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.700
 find and you will not name

 hotel industry monitor 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.439
 or just so often more expensive than 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.420
 natural gas analogues 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.790
 but andrew led 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.780
 backlight 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.060
 we liked it 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.050
 original design 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.990
 monitors including the aircraft became extremely 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.959
 unusually full name 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.950
 we can generally recommend zones 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.930
 life is enough shopping we think it
