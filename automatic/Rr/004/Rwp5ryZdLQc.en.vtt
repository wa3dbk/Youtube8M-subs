because you already own curlformers then

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.149 
because you already own curlformers then
make<00:01:00.360> sure<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.839> tune<00:01:01.110> in<00:01:01.379> for<00:01:01.860> the<00:01:01.979> rest

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
hair is freshly washed and I use the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.910

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
conditioner and these are great because

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.050 
conditioner and these are great because
they're<00:01:13.320> infused<00:01:13.770> with<00:01:13.920> African<00:01:14.430> macadamia

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
they're infused with African macadamia

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.000

oil<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.600> they<00:01:15.689> really<00:01:16.110> replenish<00:01:16.590> my<00:01:16.770> hair

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
oil and they really replenish my hair

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.100 
oil and they really replenish my hair
not<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.670> mention<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.240> fact<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.630> they<00:01:18.750> smell

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
not to mention the fact that they smell

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.700 
not to mention the fact that they smell
amazing<00:01:22.730> so<00:01:23.730> the<00:01:24.150> next<00:01:24.360> step<00:01:24.660> in<00:01:24.870> this<00:01:25.380> process

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
amazing so the next step in this process

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.040 
amazing so the next step in this process
is<00:01:26.220> basically<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:26.760> to<00:01:27.120> separate<00:01:27.660> your<00:01:27.810> hair

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
is basically just to separate your hair

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.230 
is basically just to separate your hair
into<00:01:28.080> two<00:01:28.470> sections<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:29.190> I<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.940> do<00:01:30.090> this

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
into two sections and I like to do this

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.270 
into two sections and I like to do this
because<00:01:30.480> each<00:01:30.870> curl<00:01:31.260> former<00:01:31.680> goes<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.220> a

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
because each curl former goes in a

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.280 
because each curl former goes in a
different<00:01:32.670> direction<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.510> I<00:01:33.540> recommend

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
different direction so I recommend

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.050 
different direction so I recommend
putting<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.680> orange<00:01:35.160> ones<00:01:35.400> on<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:35.820> right

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
putting the orange ones on the right

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.540 
putting the orange ones on the right
side<00:01:36.300> of<00:01:36.420> your<00:01:36.450> head<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.980> first<00:01:38.400> thing

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
side of your head so the first thing

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.950 
side of your head so the first thing
that<00:01:38.580> you're<00:01:38.820> going<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.030> do<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.510> put<00:01:39.810> your

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
that you're going to do is put your

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.920 
that you're going to do is put your
giant<00:01:40.590> hook<00:01:40.830> through<00:01:41.550> your<00:01:41.970> curlformer<00:01:42.720> now

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
hair at the root so that it's really

of<00:02:13.290> your<00:02:13.560> section<00:02:14.280> now<00:02:15.090> once<00:02:15.569> you<00:02:15.720> have<00:02:15.900> your

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
of your section now once you have your

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.990 
of your section now once you have your
hook<00:02:16.290> all<00:02:16.470> latched<00:02:16.890> on<00:02:17.190> you're<00:02:17.430> going<00:02:17.549> to<00:02:17.610> push

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
hook all latched on you're going to push

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.390 
hook all latched on you're going to push
your<00:02:18.180> curlformer<00:02:18.930> up<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.560> root<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.250> that

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
your curlformer up to the root of that

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.850 
your curlformer up to the root of that
section<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.240> then<00:02:21.900> all<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.200> have<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.380> do<00:02:22.620> is

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
section and then all you have to do is

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.340 
section and then all you have to do is
pull<00:02:23.250> your<00:02:23.280> hook<00:02:23.730> through<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.360> curlformer<00:02:25.200> so

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
pull your hook through the curlformer so

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.510 
pull your hook through the curlformer so
that<00:02:25.530> all<00:02:25.740> your<00:02:25.980> here

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
that all your here

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.970 
that all your here
goes<00:02:26.910> smoothly<00:02:27.570> through<00:02:28.050> it<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.410> then<00:02:28.830> the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
goes smoothly through it and then the

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.430 
goes smoothly through it and then the
curlformer<00:02:29.610> will<00:02:29.760> curl<00:02:30.120> up<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.570> basically

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
curlformer will curl up and basically

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.910 
curlformer will curl up and basically
give<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.220> spiral<00:02:32.880> curl<00:02:33.230> okay<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.590> know

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
give you that spiral curl okay so I know

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.370 
give you that spiral curl okay so I know
that<00:02:35.310> can<00:02:35.700> be<00:02:35.880> really<00:02:36.180> confusing<00:02:36.390> so<00:02:36.990> let's<00:02:37.230> do

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
that can be really confusing so let's do

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.680 
that can be really confusing so let's do
it<00:02:37.410> again<00:02:37.560> with<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.640> close-up<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.420> first

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
it again with a close-up so the first

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.940 
it again with a close-up so the first
thing<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:39.840> you're<00:02:40.080> going<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.260> do<00:02:40.500> is<00:02:40.740> go

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
thing that you're going to do is go

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.190 
thing that you're going to do is go
ahead<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.190> wet<00:02:41.550> this<00:02:41.730> section<00:02:42.240> I<00:02:42.450> think<00:02:42.750> that

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
ahead and wet this section I think that

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.780 
ahead and wet this section I think that
it's<00:02:43.320> better<00:02:43.590> when<00:02:43.830> this<00:02:43.980> section<00:02:44.340> is<00:02:44.460> wet

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
it's better when this section is wet

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.490 
it's better when this section is wet
because<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.090> just<00:02:45.450> slides<00:02:45.840> right<00:02:46.020> through<00:02:46.230> the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
because it just slides right through the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.650 
because it just slides right through the
curlformer<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.490> then<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.090> applied<00:02:48.450> my

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
curlformer and then I applied my

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.810 
curlformer and then I applied my
moisturizer<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.680> my<00:02:49.800> oil<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:50.550> now<00:02:50.670> I'm<00:02:50.760> just

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
moisturizer and my oil and now I'm just

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.690 
moisturizer and my oil and now I'm just
going<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.090> detangle<00:02:51.600> my<00:02:52.020> section<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.800> then<00:02:53.460> I

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
going to detangle my section and then I

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.300 
going to detangle my section and then I
just<00:02:54.030> got<00:02:54.270> started<00:02:54.570> by<00:02:54.870> separating<00:02:55.710> the<00:02:56.010> first

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
just got started by separating the first

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.540 
just got started by separating the first
piece<00:02:56.610> that<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:56.880> want<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.180> work<00:02:57.330> with<00:02:58.430> so<00:02:59.430> the

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
piece that I want to work with so the

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.710 
piece that I want to work with so the
next<00:02:59.730> thing<00:02:59.880> that<00:02:59.910> you're<00:03:00.120> going<00:03:00.270> to<00:03:00.300> do<00:03:00.540> is

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
next thing that you're going to do is

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.750 
next thing that you're going to do is
just<00:03:00.900> push<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.410> hook<00:03:01.680> through<00:03:02.280> your<00:03:02.520> first

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
just push that hook through your first

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.000 
just push that hook through your first
curlformer<00:03:03.690> making<00:03:04.230> sure<00:03:04.410> that<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.740> cook

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
curlformer making sure that the cook

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.280 
curlformer making sure that the cook
comes<00:03:05.250> out<00:03:05.400> on<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:05.670> other<00:03:05.700> end<00:03:06.210> and<00:03:06.600> then

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
comes out on the other end and then

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.170 
comes out on the other end and then
you're<00:03:07.440> going<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.620> twirl<00:03:08.070> your<00:03:08.310> hair<00:03:08.370> at<00:03:08.820> the

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
you're going to twirl your hair at the

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.550 
you're going to twirl your hair at the
root<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:10.460> then<00:03:11.460> go<00:03:11.880> ahead<00:03:12.210> and<00:03:12.450> attach<00:03:12.870> your

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
root and then go ahead and attach your

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.240 
root and then go ahead and attach your
hook<00:03:14.130> to<00:03:14.490> your<00:03:14.850> first<00:03:15.450> section<00:03:15.990> so<00:03:16.560> then<00:03:16.830> after

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
hook to your first section so then after

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.160 
hook to your first section so then after
you<00:03:17.370> have<00:03:17.550> your<00:03:17.700> hook<00:03:17.940> attached<00:03:18.360> just<00:03:18.840> push

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
you have your hook attached just push

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.500 
you have your hook attached just push
the<00:03:19.410> curlformer<00:03:20.100> up<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.550> root<00:03:20.820> like<00:03:21.210> this

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
the curlformer up to the root like this

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.640 
the curlformer up to the root like this
and<00:03:22.640> then<00:03:23.640> go<00:03:24.030> ahead<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.390> pull<00:03:24.960> the<00:03:25.200> hook<00:03:25.410> all

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
and then go ahead and pull the hook all

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.070 
and then go ahead and pull the hook all
the<00:03:26.160> way<00:03:26.280> through<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.760> curlformer<00:03:27.510> so<00:03:27.900> that

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
the way through the curlformer so that

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.980 
the way through the curlformer so that
your<00:03:28.230> hair<00:03:28.590> gets<00:03:28.950> through<00:03:29.370> I<00:03:29.640> know<00:03:30.510> it<00:03:30.840> can

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
your hair gets through I know it can

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.020 
your hair gets through I know it can
sound<00:03:31.200> a<00:03:31.470> little<00:03:31.950> bit<00:03:32.100> tricky<00:03:32.460> but<00:03:32.670> trust<00:03:32.940> me

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
sound a little bit tricky but trust me

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.540 
sound a little bit tricky but trust me
it's<00:03:33.270> super<00:03:33.780> easy<00:03:33.960> once<00:03:34.770> you<00:03:34.860> get<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.100> hang<00:03:35.430> of

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
it's super easy once you get the hang of

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.580 
it's super easy once you get the hang of
it<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:35.790> you're<00:03:36.090> in<00:03:36.240> the<00:03:36.420> swing<00:03:36.660> of<00:03:36.780> things<00:03:36.840> so

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
it and you're in the swing of things so

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.080 
it and you're in the swing of things so
I'm<00:03:37.680> just<00:03:37.740> going<00:03:37.980> to<00:03:38.010> move<00:03:38.250> on<00:03:38.490> and<00:03:38.700> show<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:38.970> a

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
I'm just going to move on and show you a

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.120 
I'm just going to move on and show you a
couple<00:03:39.240> more<00:03:39.780> times<00:03:39.990> so<00:03:40.290> that<00:03:40.410> you've<00:03:40.620> got<00:03:40.920> it

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
couple more times so that you've got it

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.860 
couple more times so that you've got it
so<00:03:41.580> you're<00:03:41.910> just<00:03:42.030> going<00:03:42.180> to<00:03:42.270> twirl<00:03:42.660> your<00:03:42.810> hair

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
so you're just going to twirl your hair

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.840 
so you're just going to twirl your hair
at<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.260> root<00:03:43.620> this<00:03:43.800> makes<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.190> so<00:03:44.580> much<00:03:44.790> easier

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
at the root this makes it so much easier

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.420 
at the root this makes it so much easier
to<00:03:45.450> get<00:03:45.930> all<00:03:46.140> your<00:03:46.380> hair<00:03:46.620> into<00:03:46.980> that<00:03:47.160> hook

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
to get all your hair into that hook

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.130 
to get all your hair into that hook
because<00:03:47.850> trust<00:03:48.210> me<00:03:48.390> that<00:03:48.660> can<00:03:48.900> be<00:03:49.020> the

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
because trust me that can be the

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.440 
because trust me that can be the
trickiest<00:03:49.530> part<00:03:49.920> and<00:03:50.160> then<00:03:50.970> you're<00:03:51.270> gonna

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
trickiest part and then you're gonna

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.410 
trickiest part and then you're gonna
pull<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.740> curlformer<00:03:53.460> all<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.940> way<00:03:54.060> up<00:03:54.240> to

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
pull the curlformer all the way up to

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.570 
pull the curlformer all the way up to
your<00:03:54.540> root<00:03:54.900> and<00:03:55.110> then<00:03:55.350> hold<00:03:55.770> on<00:03:56.070> to<00:03:56.130> it<00:03:56.550> right

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
your root and then hold on to it right

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.400 
your root and then hold on to it right
there<00:03:57.180> you<00:03:57.600> want<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.870> make<00:03:58.020> sure<00:03:58.050> that<00:03:58.230> you

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
there you want to make sure that you

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.680 
there you want to make sure that you
hold<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:58.920> at<00:03:59.130> your<00:03:59.400> root<00:03:59.700> because<00:04:00.330> if<00:04:00.510> you

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
hold it at your root because if you

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.660 
hold it at your root because if you
don't<00:04:00.960> it<00:04:01.260> will<00:04:01.350> kind<00:04:01.620> of<00:04:01.740> slide<00:04:02.100> down<00:04:02.460> and

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
don't it will kind of slide down and

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.850 
don't it will kind of slide down and
then<00:04:02.790> your<00:04:02.940> root<00:04:03.180> will<00:04:03.390> be<00:04:03.420> super<00:04:04.020> loose<00:04:04.290> so

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
then your root will be super loose so

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.230 
then your root will be super loose so
just<00:04:05.100> pull<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.550> hair<00:04:05.790> through<00:04:05.850> the

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
just pull the hair through the

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.510 
just pull the hair through the
curlformer<00:04:07.020> once<00:04:07.320> you<00:04:07.500> have<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:07.860> all<00:04:08.010> set<00:04:08.340> and

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
curlformer once you have it all set and

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:18.260 
curlformer once you have it all set and
then<00:04:09.120> you<00:04:09.480> have<00:04:09.690> your<00:04:09.870> curlformer<00:04:10.500> set

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.940 

so<00:04:19.270> I'm<00:04:19.360> pretty<00:04:19.570> much<00:04:19.690> done<00:04:20.140> with<00:04:20.170> my<00:04:20.500> entire

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
so I'm pretty much done with my entire

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.640 
so I'm pretty much done with my entire
head<00:04:21.430> and<00:04:21.790> it<00:04:22.150> really<00:04:22.540> honestly<00:04:23.050> was<00:04:23.290> quick

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
head and it really honestly was quick

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.100 
head and it really honestly was quick
I'm<00:04:23.800> just<00:04:24.370> doing<00:04:24.700> my<00:04:24.850> last<00:04:25.120> one<00:04:25.600> I'm<00:04:25.870> going<00:04:26.050> to

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
I'm just doing my last one I'm going to

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.320 
I'm just doing my last one I'm going to
go<00:04:26.260> ahead<00:04:26.380> and<00:04:26.740> throw<00:04:26.980> it<00:04:27.130> at<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.400> root<00:04:27.610> making

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
go ahead and throw it at the root making

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.410 
go ahead and throw it at the root making
it<00:04:28.480> super<00:04:28.750> easy<00:04:29.050> to<00:04:29.320> attach<00:04:29.920> my<00:04:30.220> hook<00:04:30.550> and<00:04:30.730> then

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
it super easy to attach my hook and then

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:43.660 
it super easy to attach my hook and then
I'm<00:04:31.630> just<00:04:31.750> gonna<00:04:31.900> pull<00:04:32.320> that<00:04:32.560> through

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.940 

so<00:04:44.670> my<00:04:44.880> entire<00:04:45.240> curlformer<00:04:46.020> set<00:04:46.260> is<00:04:46.410> finally

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
so my entire curlformer set is finally

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.890 
so my entire curlformer set is finally
done<00:04:47.190> and<00:04:47.220> ready<00:04:47.580> to<00:04:47.640> go<00:04:47.940> and<00:04:48.180> this<00:04:48.600> is<00:04:48.720> what

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
done and ready to go and this is what

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.320 
done and ready to go and this is what
the<00:04:49.020> entire<00:04:49.170> thing<00:04:49.860> looks<00:04:50.220> like<00:04:50.340> I<00:04:50.940> know

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
the entire thing looks like I know

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.150 
the entire thing looks like I know
there's<00:04:51.720> a<00:04:51.780> huge<00:04:52.230> part<00:04:52.500> in<00:04:52.560> the<00:04:52.650> back<00:04:52.920> but<00:04:53.130> you

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.460 
there's a huge part in the back but you
can<00:04:53.430> go<00:04:53.610> ahead<00:04:53.700> and<00:04:54.030> get<00:04:54.600> rid<00:04:54.810> of<00:04:54.840> that<00:04:55.110> when<00:04:55.320> we

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
can go ahead and get rid of that when we

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.560 
can go ahead and get rid of that when we
fluff<00:04:55.770> it<00:04:55.950> out<00:04:56.070> so<00:04:56.430> natural<00:04:57.060> eighty-five

just going to go ahead and take these
out<00:05:16.140> and<00:05:16.350> all<00:05:16.530> you<00:05:16.680> have<00:05:16.830> to<00:05:16.860> do<00:05:17.130> to<00:05:17.250> do<00:05:17.430> that<00:05:17.460> is

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
out and all you have to do to do that is

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.090 
out and all you have to do to do that is
stretch<00:05:18.330> out<00:05:18.540> the<00:05:18.690> curlformer<00:05:19.410> and<00:05:19.620> then

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
stretch out the curlformer and then

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.460 
stretch out the curlformer and then
pinch<00:05:20.580> at<00:05:20.880> the<00:05:20.940> root<00:05:21.390> making<00:05:21.810> a<00:05:21.900> little<00:05:22.080> hole

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
pinch at the root making a little hole

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.220 
pinch at the root making a little hole
so<00:05:22.770> it's<00:05:22.950> easy<00:05:23.220> to<00:05:23.520> slide<00:05:23.910> your<00:05:24.150> hair<00:05:24.390> out<00:05:24.420> so

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
more times just stretch out the

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.010 
more times just stretch out the
curlformer<00:05:28.980> and<00:05:29.190> then<00:05:29.730> pinch<00:05:30.180> at<00:05:30.480> the<00:05:30.540> root

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
curlformer and then pinch at the root

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.380 
curlformer and then pinch at the root
making<00:05:31.470> it<00:05:31.620> easier<00:05:32.010> to<00:05:32.430> open<00:05:32.460> so<00:05:33.090> that<00:05:33.120> you're

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
making it easier to open so that you're

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:57.510 
making it easier to open so that you're
here<00:05:33.630> can<00:05:33.840> slide<00:05:34.290> out

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.960 

taking<00:05:58.300> of<00:05:58.630> you

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.820 

so<00:06:02.970> now<00:06:03.150> that<00:06:03.210> I<00:06:03.420> have<00:06:03.660> all<00:06:03.810> my<00:06:03.900> curlformers

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
so now that I have all my curlformers

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.920 
so now that I have all my curlformers
out<00:06:05.100> this<00:06:05.400> is<00:06:05.610> what<00:06:05.880> the<00:06:06.030> whole<00:06:06.270> set<00:06:06.660> looks

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
out this is what the whole set looks

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.230 
out this is what the whole set looks
like<00:06:07.170> now<00:06:07.680> some<00:06:08.070> people<00:06:08.250> might<00:06:08.640> like<00:06:08.880> to<00:06:08.910> wear

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
like now some people might like to wear

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.750 
like now some people might like to wear
it<00:06:09.360> like<00:06:09.570> this<00:06:09.780> but<00:06:10.110> I<00:06:10.320> do<00:06:10.380> not<00:06:10.920> like<00:06:11.250> this<00:06:11.460> look

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
it like this but I do not like this look

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.020 
it like this but I do not like this look
on<00:06:11.970> its<00:06:12.210> own<00:06:12.450> so<00:06:13.020> I<00:06:13.050> went<00:06:13.830> ahead<00:06:13.950> and<00:06:14.370> separated

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
on its own so I went ahead and separated

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.270 
on its own so I went ahead and separated
half<00:06:15.390> of<00:06:15.600> my<00:06:15.780> hair<00:06:16.170> and<00:06:16.410> this<00:06:16.740> is<00:06:16.800> what<00:06:17.010> it

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
half of my hair and this is what it

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.510

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.010 
all you have to do is take this section
and<00:06:29.400> basically<00:06:29.820> just<00:06:30.090> pull<00:06:30.360> it<00:06:30.480> apart<00:06:30.540> where

and basically just pull it apart where

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.440 
and basically just pull it apart where
it<00:06:31.140> naturally<00:06:31.590> separate<00:06:32.100> and<00:06:32.310> then<00:06:33.030> you<00:06:33.270> can

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.450 
it naturally separate and then you can
