00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
the filters are generally used when you

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.770 
the filters are generally used when you
want<00:00:40.010> to<00:00:40.070> affect<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:40.820> whole<00:00:41.090> of<00:00:41.420> an<00:00:41.540> image

although you can mask them you can apply

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.020 
although you can mask them you can apply
them<00:00:43.790> to<00:00:43.850> specific<00:00:44.750> parts<00:00:45.160> but<00:00:46.160> the<00:00:46.310> tools<00:00:46.670> are

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030

have the blur tool you also have the
smudge<00:01:47.719> tool<00:01:47.749> I<00:01:48.319> probably<00:01:48.619> won't<00:01:48.979> get<00:01:49.219> to<00:01:49.399> use

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:49.609

the<00:01:49.850> smudge<00:01:50.090> tool<00:01:50.420> in<00:01:50.600> this<00:01:50.749> course<00:01:51.079> but<00:01:51.829> it's

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
the smudge tool in this course but it's

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.340 
the smudge tool in this course but it's
a<00:01:52.429> bit<00:01:52.639> like<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.969> effect<00:01:53.329> of<00:01:53.539> dragging<00:01:54.079> your

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.550 
let me just make my background copy and
on<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.250> in<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.550> usual<00:02:08.729> way<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:10.080> way<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.319> a

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
on that in the usual way the way that a

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.150 
on that in the usual way the way that a
blow<00:02:10.950> works<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:12.180> blend<00:02:12.510> pixels<00:02:13.349> and<00:02:14.040> when

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
blow works is to blend pixels and when

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.430 
blow works is to blend pixels and when
you're<00:02:14.280> using<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:15.060> blur<00:02:15.420> tool<00:02:15.780> there<00:02:16.140> are<00:02:16.319> a

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
you're using the blur tool there are a

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.490 
you're using the blur tool there are a
number<00:02:16.770> of<00:02:17.430> blur<00:02:18.180> modes<00:02:18.599> that<00:02:18.989> you<00:02:19.050> can<00:02:19.230> choose

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
number of blur modes that you can choose

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.640 
number of blur modes that you can choose
from<00:02:20.130> now<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.150> don't<00:02:21.360> really<00:02:21.750> have<00:02:21.900> time<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.500> go

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
from now I don't really have time to go

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.559 
from now I don't really have time to go
through<00:02:22.700> showing<00:02:23.700> you<00:02:23.819> each<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.000> these<00:02:24.300> I'm

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
through showing you each of these I'm

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.440 
through showing you each of these I'm
going<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:24.870> use<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.319> normal<00:02:25.590> mode<00:02:26.069> but<00:02:26.970> some<00:02:27.330> of

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
going to use the normal mode but some of

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.210 
going to use the normal mode but some of
them<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.750> names<00:02:27.959> virtually<00:02:28.590> tell<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:29.010> what

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
them the names virtually tell you what

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.860 
them the names virtually tell you what
the<00:02:29.340> principle<00:02:29.819> is<00:02:29.970> in<00:02:30.270> terms<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:30.810> the

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
the principle is in terms of the

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.660 
the principle is in terms of the
blurring<00:02:31.170> how<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.620> mixes<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.220> pixels

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
blurring how it mixes the pixels

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.240 
blurring how it mixes the pixels
together<00:02:32.989> some<00:02:33.989> do<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.260> by<00:02:34.410> darkening<00:02:34.860> some<00:02:35.130> do

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
together some do it by darkening some do

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
each of those when you're blurring I'm

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.729 
each of those when you're blurring I'm
going<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.450> stick<00:02:42.690> with<00:02:42.720> normal<00:02:43.230> at<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.410> moment

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
going to stick with normal at the moment

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.070 
going to stick with normal at the moment
I'm<00:02:43.920> also<00:02:44.459> going<00:02:44.819> to<00:02:44.940> stick<00:02:45.360> with<00:02:45.390> using<00:02:45.959> the

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
I'm also going to stick with using the

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.460 
I'm also going to stick with using the
default<00:02:46.590> brush<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.940> brush<00:02:48.180> size<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:49.140> the

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
default brush the brush size and the

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.640 
default brush the brush size and the
strength<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.700> blur<00:02:50.940> are<00:02:51.510> values<00:02:52.440> that<00:02:52.530> are

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
strength of the blur are values that are

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.080 
strength of the blur are values that are
picked<00:02:52.830> up<00:02:52.950> from<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.250> last<00:02:53.430> time<00:02:53.730> they<00:02:54.030> were

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
picked up from the last time they were

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.390 
picked up from the last time they were
used<00:02:54.600> and<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:55.290> course<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.650> can<00:02:55.830> reset<00:02:56.250> them

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
used and of course I can reset them

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.720 
used and of course I can reset them
accordingly<00:02:57.090> I'm<00:02:57.959> going<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.830> have<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.519> size

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
accordingly I'm going to have the size

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.120 
accordingly I'm going to have the size
well<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.269> think<00:03:00.360> I'll<00:03:00.630> have<00:03:00.780> it<00:03:00.930> at<00:03:01.140> 50<00:03:01.620> pixels

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
well I think I'll have it at 50 pixels

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.190 
well I think I'll have it at 50 pixels
and<00:03:02.760> I'm<00:03:02.880> going<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.060> start<00:03:03.510> with<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:03.870> sort<00:03:04.140> of

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
and I'm going to start with a sort of

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.330 
and I'm going to start with a sort of
medium<00:03:04.769> strength<00:03:05.250> around<00:03:05.670> 50<00:03:06.269> as<00:03:06.420> well<00:03:06.750> and

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
medium strength around 50 as well and

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.370 
medium strength around 50 as well and
then<00:03:08.340> we'll<00:03:08.580> see<00:03:09.000> how<00:03:09.299> that<00:03:09.569> goes<00:03:09.840> I<00:03:10.140> probably

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
then we'll see how that goes I probably

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.289 
then we'll see how that goes I probably
need<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.680> higher<00:03:11.010> strength<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:11.790> demonstrate

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
need a higher strength to demonstrate

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.930 
need a higher strength to demonstrate
this<00:03:12.480> quickly<00:03:12.980> sometimes<00:03:13.980> if<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:14.549> only<00:03:14.700> want

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
this quickly sometimes if you only want

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.780 
this quickly sometimes if you only want
a<00:03:15.060> fairly<00:03:15.329> slight<00:03:15.840> blur<00:03:16.350> effect<00:03:16.799> you<00:03:17.340> need<00:03:17.549> to

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
a fairly slight blur effect you need to

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.069 
a fairly slight blur effect you need to
make<00:03:17.940> sure<00:03:17.970> you<00:03:18.359> don't<00:03:18.510> have<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.840> strength

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
make sure you don't have the strength

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.770 
make sure you don't have the strength
set<00:03:19.530> too<00:03:19.769> high<00:03:20.070> so<00:03:21.060> there<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.329> settings<00:03:21.660> I'm

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
set too high so there the settings I'm

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.599 
set too high so there the settings I'm
going<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:22.049> start<00:03:22.380> with<00:03:22.650> what<00:03:23.190> I'd<00:03:23.280> like<00:03:23.430> you<00:03:23.579> to

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
going to start with what I'd like you to

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.240 
going to start with what I'd like you to
do<00:03:24.000> is<00:03:24.329> to<00:03:24.720> look<00:03:24.959> at<00:03:25.200> that<00:03:25.410> left<00:03:25.799> bit<00:03:26.100> of

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
do is to look at that left bit of

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.460 
do is to look at that left bit of
doorframe<00:03:26.940> there<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.329> wooden<00:03:27.750> part<00:03:28.140> there

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
doorframe there the wooden part there

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.080 
doorframe there the wooden part there
and<00:03:28.709> say<00:03:29.100> compare<00:03:29.430> it<00:03:29.489> with<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.640> rest<00:03:29.850> of<00:03:30.000> the

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
and say compare it with the rest of the

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.430 
and say compare it with the rest of the
wooden<00:03:30.420> door<00:03:30.600> frame<00:03:30.840> because<00:03:31.140> I'm<00:03:31.260> going<00:03:31.380> to

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
wooden door frame because I'm going to

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.460 
wooden door frame because I'm going to
blur<00:03:32.010> that<00:03:32.340> age<00:03:32.549> to<00:03:32.850> begin<00:03:33.000> with<00:03:33.359> and<00:03:33.510> all<00:03:34.140> I<00:03:34.200> do

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
blur that age to begin with and all I do

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.280 
blur that age to begin with and all I do
to<00:03:34.650> blur<00:03:35.100> it<00:03:35.130> is<00:03:35.519> to<00:03:35.880> just<00:03:36.150> brush<00:03:36.660> over<00:03:36.930> it

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
to blur it is to just brush over it

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.520 
to blur it is to just brush over it
really<00:03:37.530> and<00:03:37.829> already<00:03:38.730> you<00:03:39.090> can<00:03:39.299> see<00:03:39.720> that<00:03:40.410> are

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.840 
top here by the side one side of his
head<00:03:56.010> I'm<00:03:56.190> going<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:57.299> blur<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.980> bits<00:03:59.250> of<00:03:59.459> the

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
head I'm going to blur the bits of the

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.000 
head I'm going to blur the bits of the
sort<00:04:00.060> of<00:04:00.120> white<00:04:00.390> creamy<00:04:00.900> color<00:04:01.319> door<00:04:01.650> frame

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
sort of white creamy color door frame

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.629 
sort of white creamy color door frame
there<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:02.549> you<00:04:03.540> can<00:04:03.720> see<00:04:04.430> what<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.609> effect

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
there and you can see what the effect

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:08.349 
there and you can see what the effect
there<00:04:06.329> is<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:07.019> blue<00:04:07.170> is<00:04:07.410> with<00:04:07.799> the<00:04:07.920> blurring

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
there is the blue is with the blurring

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:11.809 
there is the blue is with the blurring
particularly<00:04:09.359> compared<00:04:10.170> to<00:04:10.489> what's<00:04:11.489> on<00:04:11.670> the

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
particularly compared to what's on the

other side of the door frame there now

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:16.520 
other side of the door frame there now
obviously<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:15.480> settings<00:04:15.900> you<00:04:16.080> need<00:04:16.229> for<00:04:16.500> a

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
obviously the settings you need for a

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.159 
obviously the settings you need for a
particular<00:04:16.890> blur<00:04:17.400> are<00:04:17.669> entirely<00:04:18.239> up<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.659> your

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
particular blur are entirely up to your

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.810 
particular blur are entirely up to your
requirements<00:04:19.799> and<00:04:19.979> the<00:04:20.400> image<00:04:20.609> you're

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
requirements and the image you're

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.620 
requirements and the image you're
working<00:04:21.239> on

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
working on

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.390 
working on
I'm<00:04:21.989> gonna<00:04:22.170> do<00:04:22.320> a<00:04:22.350> little<00:04:22.590> bit<00:04:22.740> more<00:04:22.770> blurring

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
I'm gonna do a little bit more blurring

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.340 
I'm gonna do a little bit more blurring
on<00:04:23.580> this<00:04:23.850> so<00:04:24.240> join<00:04:24.600> me<00:04:24.720> again<00:04:24.930> in<00:04:24.960> just<00:04:25.170> a

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
on this so join me again in just a

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.930 
on this so join me again in just a
moment

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
moment

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.700 
moment
okay<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:27.240> blur<00:04:27.510> effect<00:04:27.540> in<00:04:28.140> the<00:04:28.230> background<00:04:28.590> I

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
okay the blur effect in the background I

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.010 
okay the blur effect in the background I
think<00:04:28.740> I've<00:04:29.010> taken<00:04:29.220> far<00:04:29.640> enough<00:04:29.940> blurring<00:04:30.840> is

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
think I've taken far enough blurring is

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.380 
think I've taken far enough blurring is
something<00:04:31.470> that<00:04:31.590> it's<00:04:31.710> quite<00:04:31.920> easy<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.390> overdo

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
something that it's quite easy to overdo

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.210 
something that it's quite easy to overdo
and<00:04:33.660> often<00:04:33.990> you<00:04:34.080> only<00:04:34.230> need<00:04:34.530> a<00:04:34.710> relatively

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
and often you only need a relatively

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.300 
and often you only need a relatively
small<00:04:35.700> amount<00:04:35.910> in<00:04:36.720> order<00:04:37.230> to<00:04:37.500> just<00:04:37.890> make<00:04:38.100> sure

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
small amount in order to just make sure

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.790 
small amount in order to just make sure
the<00:04:38.460> focus<00:04:38.940> of<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.390> image<00:04:39.720> is<00:04:39.960> the<00:04:40.320> subject

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
the focus of the image is the subject

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
the focus of the image is the subject
which<00:04:40.950> in<00:04:41.190> this<00:04:41.490> case<00:04:41.730> is<00:04:42.000> this<00:04:42.840> man's<00:04:43.200> head

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
which in this case is this man's head

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.550 
which in this case is this man's head
now<00:04:44.820> let's<00:04:45.090> look<00:04:45.210> at<00:04:45.360> sharpening<00:04:45.990> sharpening

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
now let's look at sharpening sharpening

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.050 
now let's look at sharpening sharpening
again<00:04:46.860> is<00:04:47.010> something<00:04:47.250> that<00:04:47.610> is<00:04:47.790> easily

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
again is something that is easily

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.870 
again is something that is easily
overdone<00:04:48.900> but<00:04:49.470> if<00:04:49.590> you<00:04:49.740> really<00:04:50.130> want<00:04:50.370> to<00:04:50.670> bring

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
overdone but if you really want to bring

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.820 
overdone but if you really want to bring
attention<00:04:51.030> to<00:04:51.510> something<00:04:51.750> you<00:04:52.110> can<00:04:52.380> sharpen

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
attention to something you can sharpen

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.310 
attention to something you can sharpen
it<00:04:53.160> maybe<00:04:53.730> it's<00:04:53.940> very<00:04:54.150> slightly<00:04:54.630> out<00:04:54.900> of<00:04:54.930> focus

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
it maybe it's very slightly out of focus

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.350 
it maybe it's very slightly out of focus
and<00:04:56.010> in<00:04:56.490> that<00:04:56.640> case<00:04:56.880> a<00:04:56.910> little<00:04:57.180> bit<00:04:57.300> of

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
and in that case a little bit of

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.390 
and in that case a little bit of
sharpening<00:04:57.660> may<00:04:58.470> just<00:04:58.770> help<00:04:58.890> to<00:04:59.070> bring<00:04:59.250> it

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
sharpening may just help to bring it

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.730 
sharpening may just help to bring it
back<00:04:59.550> in<00:04:59.760> again<00:04:59.850> but<00:05:00.270> again<00:05:00.360> it's<00:05:01.050> to<00:05:01.320> be<00:05:01.440> used

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
back in again but again it's to be used

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.650 
back in again but again it's to be used
cautiously<00:05:02.130> so<00:05:02.700> let's<00:05:03.060> switch<00:05:03.330> to<00:05:03.360> the

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
cautiously so let's switch to the

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.630 
cautiously so let's switch to the
sharpen<00:05:04.170> tool<00:05:04.230> we've<00:05:05.010> got<00:05:05.160> pretty<00:05:05.310> much<00:05:05.490> all

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
sharpen tool we've got pretty much all

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.540 
sharpen tool we've got pretty much all
of<00:05:05.700> the<00:05:05.880> same<00:05:05.910> options<00:05:06.500> you<00:05:07.500> have<00:05:07.770> a<00:05:07.800> protect

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
of the same options you have a protect

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.680 
of the same options you have a protect
detail<00:05:09.210> option<00:05:09.750> here<00:05:10.140> which<00:05:10.680> minimizes

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
detail option here which minimizes

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.990 
detail option here which minimizes
pixelation<00:05:12.690> while<00:05:13.320> protecting<00:05:13.770> a<00:05:14.160> detail<00:05:14.610> so

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
pixelation while protecting a detail so

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.570 
pixelation while protecting a detail so
what<00:05:15.510> this<00:05:15.660> does<00:05:15.900> is<00:05:16.110> just<00:05:16.140> to<00:05:16.440> make<00:05:16.620> sure<00:05:16.650> that

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
what this does is just to make sure that

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.670 
what this does is just to make sure that
as<00:05:17.820> it's<00:05:18.090> sharpening<00:05:18.810> that<00:05:19.140> it<00:05:19.260> doesn't

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
as it's sharpening that it doesn't

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.850 
as it's sharpening that it doesn't
actually<00:05:19.890> start<00:05:20.550> to<00:05:20.790> break<00:05:21.180> up<00:05:21.470> into<00:05:22.470> lots<00:05:22.710> of

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
actually start to break up into lots of

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.000 
actually start to break up into lots of
little<00:05:22.920> pixels<00:05:23.730> on<00:05:24.120> the<00:05:24.270> image<00:05:24.600> so<00:05:25.530> again<00:05:25.890> I'm

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
little pixels on the image so again I'm

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.590 
little pixels on the image so again I'm
going<00:05:26.130> to<00:05:26.190> brush<00:05:26.400> over<00:05:26.640> I'm<00:05:27.060> going<00:05:27.240> to<00:05:27.300> use<00:05:27.570> a

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
going to brush over I'm going to use a

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.230 
going to brush over I'm going to use a
medium<00:05:28.500> kind<00:05:28.830> of<00:05:29.070> strength<00:05:29.400> at<00:05:29.670> the<00:05:29.820> moment

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
medium kind of strength at the moment

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.290 
medium kind of strength at the moment
and<00:05:31.010> slightly<00:05:32.010> smaller<00:05:32.430> brush<00:05:32.760> I<00:05:32.940> think<00:05:33.180> than

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
and slightly smaller brush I think than

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.480 
and slightly smaller brush I think than
the<00:05:33.330> one<00:05:33.480> I<00:05:33.510> used<00:05:33.600> before<00:05:34.070> because<00:05:35.070> I<00:05:35.100> got<00:05:35.430> to

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
the one I used before because I got to

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.100 
the one I used before because I got to
be<00:05:35.550> a<00:05:35.580> little<00:05:35.730> bit<00:05:35.880> more<00:05:36.060> more<00:05:36.300> careful<00:05:36.810> going

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
be a little bit more more careful going

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.950 
be a little bit more more careful going
over<00:05:37.500> his<00:05:37.680> face<00:05:38.010> let's<00:05:38.760> go<00:05:39.030> in<00:05:39.300> the<00:05:39.510> general

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
over his face let's go in the general

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.180 
over his face let's go in the general
area<00:05:40.320> of<00:05:40.920> the<00:05:41.040> eyes<00:05:41.580> to<00:05:42.120> begin<00:05:42.600> with<00:05:42.870> and<00:05:43.190> just

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
area of the eyes to begin with and just

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.230 
area of the eyes to begin with and just
watch<00:05:44.460> what<00:05:44.490> happens<00:05:45.270> as<00:05:45.540> I<00:05:45.870> bring<00:05:46.110> out<00:05:46.320> the

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
watch what happens as I bring out the

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.260 
watch what happens as I bring out the
detail<00:05:48.240> in<00:05:48.420> his<00:05:48.540> eyes<00:05:48.720> that<00:05:49.110> is<00:05:49.260> definitely

detail in his eyes that is definitely

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.800 
detail in his eyes that is definitely
overdone<00:05:51.650> but<00:05:52.650> you<00:05:52.800> get<00:05:52.950> the<00:05:53.070> general<00:05:53.310> idea

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
overdone but you get the general idea

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.260 
overdone but you get the general idea
now<00:05:54.810> there's<00:05:55.050> one<00:05:55.320> other<00:05:55.790> checkbox<00:05:56.790> down<00:05:57.030> here

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
now there's one other checkbox down here

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.060 
now there's one other checkbox down here
that<00:05:57.390> you<00:05:57.450> will<00:05:57.600> have<00:05:57.720> seen<00:05:57.930> several<00:05:58.230> times<00:05:58.410> I

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
that you will have seen several times I

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.000 
that you will have seen several times I
may<00:06:00.030> even<00:06:00.120> mention<00:06:00.630> it<00:06:00.720> very<00:06:00.930> briefly<00:06:01.260> near

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
may even mention it very briefly near

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.130 
may even mention it very briefly near
the<00:06:02.100> beginning<00:06:02.250> of<00:06:02.610> the<00:06:02.730> course<00:06:03.000> but<00:06:03.690> now<00:06:03.990> that

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140 
the beginning of the course but now that

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.320 
the beginning of the course but now that
you<00:06:04.230> know<00:06:04.380> about<00:06:04.410> layers<00:06:04.950> let<00:06:05.520> me<00:06:05.610> just<00:06:06.060> point

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
you know about layers let me just point

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.830 
you know about layers let me just point
out<00:06:06.600> sample<00:06:07.530> all<00:06:07.710> layers<00:06:07.770> if<00:06:08.640> you're<00:06:09.600> working

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
out sample all layers if you're working

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.990 
out sample all layers if you're working
on<00:06:10.080> a<00:06:10.140> layer<00:06:10.470> doing<00:06:10.920> an<00:06:11.070> exercise<00:06:11.640> like<00:06:11.970> this

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 
on a layer doing an exercise like this

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.660 
on a layer doing an exercise like this
one<00:06:12.570> it's<00:06:12.990> absolutely<00:06:13.440> fine<00:06:13.680> the<00:06:14.280> effect

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:14.670 
one it's absolutely fine the effect

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.580 
one it's absolutely fine the effect
you're<00:06:14.970> applying<00:06:15.330> is<00:06:15.540> only<00:06:15.810> being<00:06:16.140> applied<00:06:16.320> to

you're applying is only being applied to

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.780 
you're applying is only being applied to
that<00:06:16.980> layer<00:06:17.340> if<00:06:18.030> you<00:06:18.930> click<00:06:19.500> on<00:06:19.530> sample<00:06:20.280> all

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.790 
that layer if you click on sample all

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.150 
that layer if you click on sample all
layers<00:06:20.820> and<00:06:21.570> do<00:06:21.810> something<00:06:22.200> like<00:06:22.320> this<00:06:22.590> the

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160 
layers and do something like this the

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.820 
layers and do something like this the
same<00:06:23.490> thing<00:06:23.880> is<00:06:24.150> being<00:06:24.420> done<00:06:24.540> to<00:06:24.900> all<00:06:25.080> of<00:06:25.530> the

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
same thing is being done to all of the

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.190 
same thing is being done to all of the
layers<00:06:26.040> in<00:06:26.370> your<00:06:26.430> image<00:06:27.000> so<00:06:27.300> depending<00:06:28.110> on

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
layers in your image so depending on

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.080 
layers in your image so depending on
what<00:06:28.380> you're<00:06:28.560> doing<00:06:28.590> give<00:06:29.490> some<00:06:29.729> careful

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
what you're doing give some careful

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.570 
what you're doing give some careful
thought<00:06:30.360> to<00:06:31.260> whether<00:06:31.410> you<00:06:31.620> need<00:06:31.890> to<00:06:32.190> do<00:06:32.400> this

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
thought to whether you need to do this

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.210 
thought to whether you need to do this
on<00:06:32.820> just<00:06:33.090> one<00:06:33.390> layer<00:06:33.660> or<00:06:33.930> to<00:06:34.500> all<00:06:34.710> of<00:06:34.950> them

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220 
on just one layer or to all of them

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.940 
on just one layer or to all of them
very<00:06:35.880> often<00:06:36.360> it<00:06:36.570> will<00:06:36.600> only<00:06:36.900> be<00:06:37.350> to<00:06:37.770> the

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:37.950 
very often it will only be to the

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.590 
very often it will only be to the
particular<00:06:38.250> layer<00:06:38.670> that<00:06:38.880> you're<00:06:39.060> working<00:06:39.240> on
