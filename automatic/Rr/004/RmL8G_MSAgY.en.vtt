00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.410
 hello friends my name is Sasha 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.470
 dragon and today we will find out how 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.140
 uses audio system 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.750
 the pioneer company created the audio system all 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.230
 especially for dancers that is for us 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.360
 with you 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.950
 therefore, apart from the excellent sanday 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.619
 space design is still a bunch 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.390
 interesting features but about everything 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.640
 order 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.920
 I'll start with a review and power options 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.720
 40 watts this is quite enough 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.150
 to pump a small room where we are 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.060
 we train the whole team and use 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.460
 for normal start-up performances housing 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.720
 dustproof moisture protected and that means that 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.670
 the system is not afraid of the rain is not the beach 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.890
 can easily connect a portable microphone 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.500
 and it will facilitate the introduction of open lesson 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.070
 or some party is also easy 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.900
 any player does not have a flash drive 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.470
 systems have 4 megabytes of their own 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.080
 of memory 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.869
 it can be used as a docking station 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.970
 for iphone or ipod 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:10.119
 can work here as from a network and 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.530
 battery powered 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.040
 now go to the electronic heart 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.079
 system or rather its program part 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.940
 first of all we need to download 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:22.360

 how many rounds will we have 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.849
 their duration and style which we will 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.170
 dance 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:21.140
 Moreover, ten seconds before the end 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:26.090
 the audio system itself tells the dancer what 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.800
 it's time to wrap up, for example, let us 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:33.860
 there will be two exits 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:38.300
 watt whether every 1 genre will be hip-hop 2 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:42.069
 tank each time out 40 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.069

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.370
 when we are not ready to make it full 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.440
 strength we take just reduce the speed of the 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.450
 than at this speed and then when already 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.480
