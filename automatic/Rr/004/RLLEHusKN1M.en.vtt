00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
We are currently getting ready for the victory party after Game 3

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.800
We need to win this game if we ever want to have a game on Friday

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.520
Any second now we will found the results after the 4th quarter

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.580
The news will come from

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.780
From Coach Topex at the bench and from the announcers.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.240
Any second now, I could finally smell victory.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.480
Uh oh

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.040
I received the text.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.180
Sir, (Muted words)

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.400
The final score is (we're so dead)

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.500
I'll do it.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.440
57-55, we lost by 2 points

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.300
Beda won back-to-back

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.360
What did he say?! Is this true?

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.560
I lost my bet

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.760
This can not happen! No!

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.120
All those who didn't help in yesterday's training

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.160
Or whatsoever, leave this room.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.820
Looks like there's a bomb that's about to explode

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.920
Do you have ear plugs?

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.100
None...

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.240
Here we go (There won't be any censorship from here)

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.460
What the f*ck happened?!

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.480
How did we lose to those f*ggots

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.880
You imbeciles

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.080
What kind of coaches are you?

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.100
We didn't even have single win this season

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.260
What kind of staff are you?!

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.080
You're all idiots!

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.140
I just wasted my money on this game

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.440
I thought we were going to have a party

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.180
In the end, I'll end up in a Mcdonald's diner, f*ck

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.280
They all did their best

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.720
Was that the best? We didn't even fill the entire Araneta Stadium

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.940
They just won out of luck

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.800
They didn't have imports

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.600
And you still think that's luck?!

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.620
Idiots!

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.640
You have that stupid 'Triple Threat' thing

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.600
You dared to imitate Miami heat

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.380
Well, you imitated their loss, God Damn it!

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.400
And you take pride for not having a single decent, rebound

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.200
And the other guy swam in the court like an dumbass

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.560
You all ways say "Foul Them!"

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.820
And yet, they can't even get a decent free throw shot

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.940
And there were a lot of free shots

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.500
Now I know where the stupidity of Abueva and the rest of the players came from

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.580
Don't you know the meaning of "Fair play"?

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.180
You teach the players a lot of stupid things

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.440
You can't even teach them the basics?

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.900
F*ck!

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.940
Imbeciles

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.660
Useless imbeciles!

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.840
What face will I show in front of the press con?!

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.620
What answers will I be able to give them?

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.720
We don't know anything but foul play.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.620
Our triple threat can't shoot a single 1-point shot

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.020
I will look like a complete idiot!

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.700
Don't worry, there's always next season

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.100
Next time, I won't bet on our team.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.260
If Abueva and the other players won't change their style

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.740
I won't your meetings anymore

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.620
What will we do?

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.100
Your own your own

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.440
Next time, you all won't be the staff of team A

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.580
(Goodbye Benefits)

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.720
I will new, more decent coaches

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.020
That way, we can have a single win.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.720
Don't expect I'll copy the Heat again after this

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.680
Get out of my sight
