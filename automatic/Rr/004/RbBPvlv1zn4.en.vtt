know maybe this high speeds just like an

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.749 
know maybe this high speeds just like an
extra<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.250> not<00:01:17.430> something<00:01:17.729> that's

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
extra and it's not something that's

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.399 
extra and it's not something that's
really<00:01:18.060> mandatory<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.720> actually<00:01:18.990> perform<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
really mandatory to actually perform the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.950 
really mandatory to actually perform the
heist<00:01:19.590> now<00:01:20.490> following<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.270> first<00:01:21.570> line<00:01:21.810> it

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
heist now following that first line it

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.450 
heist now following that first line it
gets<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.170> little<00:01:22.320> bit<00:01:22.500> interesting<00:01:22.920> because<00:01:23.070> we

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
gets a little bit interesting because we

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.980 
gets a little bit interesting because we
start<00:01:23.790> seeing<00:01:24.090> some<00:01:24.420> information<00:01:24.930> about

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
start seeing some information about

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.710 
start seeing some information about
heist<00:01:25.409> earnings<00:01:26.130> we<00:01:26.700> get<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.119> minimum<00:01:27.420> total

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
heist earnings we get the minimum total

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.960 
heist earnings we get the minimum total
cash<00:01:28.080> take<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.710> then<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.130> maximum<00:01:29.790> total

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
cash take and then the maximum total

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.700 
cash take and then the maximum total
cash<00:01:30.240> takes<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.840> appears<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.229> be<00:01:31.470> that

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
cash takes so it appears to be that

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.740 
cash takes so it appears to be that
every<00:01:32.460> time<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.790> perform<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.270> highest<00:01:33.630> no

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
every time you perform the highest no

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.030 
every time you perform the highest no
matter<00:01:33.900> what<00:01:34.140> there's<00:01:34.290> going<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.680> be<00:01:34.710> a

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
matter what there's going to be a

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.090 
matter what there's going to be a
minimum<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.729> maximum<00:01:39.680> guessing<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.890> it's

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
minimum and a maximum guessing that it's

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.350 
minimum and a maximum guessing that it's
gonna<00:01:41.189> be<00:01:41.280> something<00:01:41.490> where<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.790> go<00:01:41.939> inside

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
gonna be something where you go inside

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.179 
gonna be something where you go inside
you<00:01:42.869> break<00:01:43.170> into<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.590> bank<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.040> try<00:01:44.159> to

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
you break into the bank and you try to

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.429 
you break into the bank and you try to
get<00:01:44.369> as<00:01:44.490> much<00:01:44.670> money<00:01:44.909> as<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.119> can<00:01:45.390> but<00:01:46.020> say<00:01:46.409> you

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
get as much money as you can but say you

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.020 
get as much money as you can but say you
get<00:01:46.710> no<00:01:46.890> money<00:01:47.100> well<00:01:47.399> there's<00:01:47.579> always<00:01:47.820> that

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
get no money well there's always that

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.359 
get no money well there's always that
minimum<00:01:48.420> there<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.770> really<00:01:50.070> can't<00:01:50.280> get

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
minimum there and you really can't get

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.649 
minimum there and you really can't get
all<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.850> money<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.329> know<00:01:51.420> there's<00:01:51.570> probably

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
all the money you know there's probably

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.240 
all the money you know there's probably
gonna<00:01:51.899> be<00:01:51.990> like<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.350> i<00:01:52.680> guess<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.920> can<00:01:53.040> say<00:01:53.220> a

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
gonna be like a i guess you can say a

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.950 
gonna be like a i guess you can say a
maximum<00:01:53.939> amount<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.210> can<00:01:54.329> actually<00:01:54.630> go<00:01:54.840> out

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
maximum amount you can actually go out

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.139 
maximum amount you can actually go out
on<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.259> bank<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:55.740> I'm<00:01:56.579> sure<00:01:56.969> they're<00:01:57.090> gonna

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
on the bank so I'm sure they're gonna

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.580 
on the bank so I'm sure they're gonna
have<00:01:57.329> like<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> standard<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.380> must

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
have like a standard that you must

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.469 
have like a standard that you must
actually<00:01:58.920> stick<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.490> when<00:01:59.880> you<00:01:59.969> perform<00:02:00.299> the

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
actually stick to when you perform the

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.300 
actually stick to when you perform the
heist<00:02:00.689> after<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.829> gets<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:02.009> little<00:02:02.130> bit

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
heist after that it gets a little bit

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.740 
heist after that it gets a little bit
confusing<00:02:02.700> because<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.119> starts<00:02:03.360> talking

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
confusing because it starts talking

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.230 
confusing because it starts talking
about<00:02:03.810> these<00:02:04.170> RP<00:02:04.740> time<00:02:05.100> periods<00:02:05.640> after<00:02:05.820> you

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
about these RP time periods after you

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.700 
about these RP time periods after you
fails<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.810> guys<00:02:06.930> can<00:02:07.079> see<00:02:07.110> for<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.409> couple

way<00:02:12.010> down<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.430> six<00:02:12.730> I'm<00:02:13.000> not<00:02:13.450> entirely<00:02:13.780> sure

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
way down to six I'm not entirely sure

what<00:02:14.290> this<00:02:14.440> exactly<00:02:15.040> means<00:02:15.280> but<00:02:15.490> seeing<00:02:15.790> that

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
what this exactly means but seeing that

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.540 
what this exactly means but seeing that
has<00:02:16.090> RP<00:02:16.630> I<00:02:16.870> mean<00:02:17.050> we<00:02:17.290> were<00:02:17.319> bound<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.250> get<00:02:18.370> RP

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
has RP I mean we were bound to get RP

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.430 
has RP I mean we were bound to get RP
for<00:02:18.970> performing<00:02:19.450> heist<00:02:19.660> but<00:02:20.140> I'm<00:02:20.230> gonna<00:02:20.350> be

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
for performing heist but I'm gonna be

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.050 
for performing heist but I'm gonna be
guessing<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:20.890> if<00:02:21.010> you<00:02:21.130> do<00:02:21.310> fail<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:21.760> still

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
guessing that if you do fail you still

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.820 
guessing that if you do fail you still
have<00:02:22.209> a<00:02:22.240> set<00:02:22.510> amount<00:02:22.600> of<00:02:22.750> RP<00:02:23.110> depending<00:02:23.560> on<00:02:23.650> how

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
have a set amount of RP depending on how

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.280 
have a set amount of RP depending on how
long<00:02:24.069> you've<00:02:24.310> actually<00:02:24.520> lasted<00:02:25.209> in<00:02:25.390> time<00:02:25.959> so

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
long you've actually lasted in time so

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.650 
long you've actually lasted in time so
of<00:02:26.350> course<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.860> time<00:02:27.430> period<00:02:27.760> one<00:02:28.120> is<00:02:28.300> for<00:02:28.450> 30

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
of course a time period one is for 30

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.449 
of course a time period one is for 30
seconds<00:02:29.080> time<00:02:29.410> period<00:02:29.770> teased<00:02:29.920> for<00:02:30.160> making<00:02:30.400> a

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
seconds time period teased for making a

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.550 
seconds time period teased for making a
minute<00:02:30.790> you<00:02:31.360> know<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:31.690> so<00:02:31.900> forth<00:02:32.230> so<00:02:32.470> the

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
minute you know and so forth so the

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.199 
minute you know and so forth so the
longer<00:02:32.740> you<00:02:32.980> are<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.400> higher<00:02:33.550> your<00:02:33.790> period

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
longer you are the higher your period

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.600 
longer you are the higher your period
the<00:02:34.360> more<00:02:34.540> RP<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:35.080> get<00:02:35.320> that's<00:02:35.980> just<00:02:36.190> my<00:02:36.580> guess

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
the more RP you get that's just my guess

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.580 
the more RP you get that's just my guess
I<00:02:37.090> could<00:02:37.330> be<00:02:37.480> entirely<00:02:37.810> wrong<00:02:38.140> but<00:02:38.320> I<00:02:38.350> think<00:02:38.380> it

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
I could be entirely wrong but I think it

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.050 
I could be entirely wrong but I think it
only<00:02:38.650> makes<00:02:38.770> sense<00:02:39.100> for<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.400> longer<00:02:39.730> you<00:02:39.850> last

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
only makes sense for the longer you last

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.940 
only makes sense for the longer you last
on<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.420> mission<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.750> war<00:02:40.959> RP<00:02:41.200> you<00:02:41.350> get<00:02:41.530> even

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
on the mission the war RP you get even

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.130 
on the mission the war RP you get even
if<00:02:42.100> you<00:02:42.220> do<00:02:42.400> fail<00:02:42.819> if<00:02:43.090> you<00:02:43.660> make<00:02:43.840> your<00:02:44.020> way

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
if you do fail if you make your way

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.540 
if you do fail if you make your way
towards<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:44.560> bottom<00:02:44.830> of<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.130> source<00:02:45.340> code

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
towards the bottom of the source code

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.340 
towards the bottom of the source code
you<00:02:45.670> can<00:02:45.760> actually<00:02:45.970> see<00:02:46.180> where<00:02:46.570> it<00:02:46.660> says<00:02:46.870> RP

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
you can actually see where it says RP

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.890 
you can actually see where it says RP
high<00:02:47.530> sculpt<00:02:48.010> metal<00:02:48.340> RP<00:02:48.730> multiplier<00:02:49.390> followed

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
high sculpt metal RP multiplier followed

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.170 
high sculpt metal RP multiplier followed
by<00:02:50.050> a<00:02:50.080> silver<00:02:50.650> medal<00:02:50.830> a<00:02:51.160> bronze<00:02:51.459> medal<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:52.030> all

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
by a silver medal a bronze medal and all

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.690 
by a silver medal a bronze medal and all
those<00:02:52.450> have<00:02:52.840> multipliers<00:02:53.620> as<00:02:53.890> well<00:02:54.070> so<00:02:54.640> it

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
those have multipliers as well so it

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.740 
those have multipliers as well so it
appears<00:02:54.760> that<00:02:55.060> we<00:02:55.269> may<00:02:55.480> be<00:02:55.540> getting

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
appears that we may be getting

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.810 
appears that we may be getting
leaderboards<00:02:56.440> just<00:02:56.800> made<00:02:57.040> for<00:02:57.280> these<00:02:57.489> grand

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
leaderboards just made for these grand

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.460 
leaderboards just made for these grand
theft<00:02:58.030> auto<00:02:58.269> heist<00:02:58.690> of<00:02:58.989> course<00:02:59.260> being

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
theft auto heist of course being

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.920 
theft auto heist of course being

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
separated into bronze time silver time

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.199 
separated into bronze time silver time
and<00:03:02.170> gold<00:03:02.350> time<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:02.950> of<00:03:03.519> course<00:03:03.730> those<00:03:04.000> are

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
and gold time and of course those are

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.970 
and gold time and of course those are
Pee<00:03:04.450> multipliers<00:03:05.019> say<00:03:05.380> you<00:03:05.440> finish<00:03:05.800> really

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
Pee multipliers say you finish really

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.100 
Pee multipliers say you finish really
quick<00:03:06.070> you<00:03:06.430> get<00:03:06.580> a<00:03:06.610> gold<00:03:06.790> medal<00:03:07.150> you<00:03:07.630> get<00:03:07.870> a

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
quick you get a gold medal you get a

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.830 
quick you get a gold medal you get a
hierarchy<00:03:09.070> multiplier<00:03:09.610> so<00:03:10.030> that's<00:03:10.540> pretty

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
hierarchy multiplier so that's pretty

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.970 
hierarchy multiplier so that's pretty
cool<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.290> gives<00:03:11.440> you<00:03:11.560> a<00:03:11.590> reason<00:03:11.830> to

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
cool and it gives you a reason to

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.430 
cool and it gives you a reason to
actually<00:03:12.459> try<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:12.700> commit<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.390> crime<00:03:13.780> as<00:03:14.050> fast

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
actually try to commit the crime as fast

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.440 
actually try to commit the crime as fast
as<00:03:14.709> possible<00:03:15.010> of<00:03:15.670> course<00:03:15.730> underneath<00:03:16.239> that

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
as possible of course underneath that

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.630 
as possible of course underneath that
you<00:03:16.600> got<00:03:16.750> expenses<00:03:17.350> highest<00:03:17.829> cost<00:03:18.130> percentage

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
you got expenses highest cost percentage

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.520 
you got expenses highest cost percentage
so<00:03:18.940> I'm<00:03:19.239> guessing<00:03:19.570> if<00:03:19.840> your<00:03:19.959> vehicle<00:03:20.170> gets

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
so I'm guessing if your vehicle gets

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.020 
so I'm guessing if your vehicle gets
destroyed<00:03:20.950> or<00:03:21.160> somebody<00:03:21.489> loses<00:03:21.760> their<00:03:22.000> life

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
destroyed or somebody loses their life

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.430 
destroyed or somebody loses their life
is<00:03:22.450> there<00:03:22.570> an<00:03:22.660> amount<00:03:22.750> of<00:03:22.870> times<00:03:23.049> you<00:03:23.320> have

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
is there an amount of times you have

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.140 
is there an amount of times you have
your<00:03:23.620> expenses<00:03:24.250> to<00:03:24.700> perform<00:03:25.000> you're<00:03:25.090> the

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
your expenses to perform you're the

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.460 
your expenses to perform you're the
highest<00:03:25.299> which<00:03:25.540> is<00:03:25.600> kind<00:03:25.810> of<00:03:25.870> a<00:03:25.930> drawback<00:03:26.320> but

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
highest which is kind of a drawback but

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.380 
highest which is kind of a drawback but
it's<00:03:26.620> kind<00:03:26.799> of<00:03:26.860> more<00:03:26.980> realistic<00:03:27.250> so<00:03:27.700> that's

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
it's kind of more realistic so that's

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.660 
it's kind of more realistic so that's
basically<00:03:28.570> what<00:03:28.989> we<00:03:29.079> got<00:03:29.290> from<00:03:29.620> Fond<00:03:30.040> nwt<00:03:30.489> you
