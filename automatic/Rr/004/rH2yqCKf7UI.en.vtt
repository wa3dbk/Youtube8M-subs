let<00:04:49.060> the<00:04:49.150> Stearman<00:04:49.540> get<00:04:49.750> out<00:04:49.870> array<00:04:50.139> as<00:04:51.040> I<00:04:51.100> say

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
let the Stearman get out array as I say

the<00:04:52.000> Newport<00:04:52.389> has<00:04:52.540> a<00:04:52.570> sequencer<00:04:53.260> switch<00:04:53.580> which

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
the Newport has a sequencer switch which

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.520 
the Newport has a sequencer switch which
cuts<00:04:54.880> the<00:04:55.030> ignition<00:04:55.449> to<00:04:55.690> various<00:04:56.080> cylinders

cuts the ignition to various cylinders

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.030 
cuts the ignition to various cylinders
which<00:04:57.340> is<00:04:57.520> why<00:04:57.729> you<00:04:58.180> hear<00:04:58.419> that<00:04:58.600> noise<00:04:59.040> sounds

00:05:26.179 --> 00:05:26.189 
yeah as I said it went down to each

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:28.070 
yeah as I said it went down to each
cylinder<00:05:26.399> a<00:05:26.639> full<00:05:26.969> dimension<00:05:27.509> by<00:05:28.050> a
