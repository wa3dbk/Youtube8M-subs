so<00:02:57.820> hive<00:02:58.270> is<00:02:58.630> kinda<00:02:59.170> like<00:02:59.320> chess<00:02:59.830> with<00:03:00.280> insects

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
so hive is kinda like chess with insects

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.570 
so hive is kinda like chess with insects
it's<00:03:01.600> a<00:03:01.870> great<00:03:02.080> game<00:03:02.350> I<00:03:02.530> like<00:03:02.950> playing<00:03:03.160> it<00:03:03.459> an

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
it's a great game I like playing it an

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.060 
it's a great game I like playing it an
awful<00:03:03.940> lot<00:03:04.090> a<00:03:04.360> big<00:03:04.959> pro<00:03:05.200> for<00:03:05.410> this<00:03:05.530> game<00:03:05.709> is<00:03:05.890> the

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
awful lot a big pro for this game is the

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.979 
awful lot a big pro for this game is the
fact<00:03:06.100> that<00:03:06.340> like<00:03:06.580> chess<00:03:06.910> all<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.390> pieces<00:03:07.630> have

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
fact that like chess all the pieces have

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.470 
fact that like chess all the pieces have
different<00:03:08.500> movement<00:03:08.920> rules<00:03:09.220> so<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:10.000> strategy

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
different movement rules so the strategy

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.810 
different movement rules so the strategy
is<00:03:10.510> very<00:03:10.780> complex<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:11.709> what<00:03:12.070> you<00:03:12.250> do<00:03:12.519> and

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
is very complex and what you do and

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.430 
is very complex and what you do and
where<00:03:13.030> you<00:03:13.180> move<00:03:13.420> is<00:03:13.630> gonna<00:03:13.720> depend<00:03:14.110> on<00:03:14.320> the

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
where you move is gonna depend on the

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.930 
where you move is gonna depend on the
spaces<00:03:14.860> that<00:03:14.890> are<00:03:15.070> opening<00:03:15.400> up<00:03:15.519> and<00:03:15.760> the

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
spaces that are opening up and the

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.460 
spaces that are opening up and the
insects<00:03:16.330> and<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.540> pieces<00:03:16.780> that<00:03:17.049> you<00:03:17.230> have

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
insects and the pieces that you have

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.220 
insects and the pieces that you have
available<00:03:17.709> it's<00:03:18.670> it's<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:19.090> really<00:03:19.420> intelligent
