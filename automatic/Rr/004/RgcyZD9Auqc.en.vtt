00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.529
 hello very good everyone welcome to me 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:09.270
 canal I am jordi moreno this time 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:12.490
 I bring you a small tutorial very short 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.050
 Well, to know how to clean the 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.460
 screen of our smartphone 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.460
 our tablet and so on 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.160
 good are we are going to use things that 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.650
 surely you have at home if not 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.259
 you can acquire exist 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.570
 logically professional products that 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.430
 they serve for this but well I use 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.740
 these things and I am doing very well - 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:38.720
 recommended and nothing started now 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.540
 first, first of all 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.270
 good if someone in your house 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.340
 glasses or wear glasses it is possible that 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.350
 have glasses cleaning products 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.700
 think that what you clean in 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.280
 our glasses something that helps us 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.470
 see they can clean the screen of a 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.440
 device that serves to see I do not know I know 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.820
 he explained then 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.949
 possibly you will have some wipes 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.860
 some spray you can use everything 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.770
 highly recommended wipes in addition if 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.500
 You wear glasses you can wear with 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.380
 you and you can use it in 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.710
 any time anywhere like that 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.329
 how good this is for series for 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.530
 cleaning and then for drying so that 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.439
 It is very good so you can use 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.719
 Chamois are also cleaning glasses 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.759
 I do not see wearing glasses are those of my 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:31.500
 sunglasses but for example for 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.810
 a tablet we could use this one 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.880
 it's bigger than it 's glasses and then 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.409
 One is what I got when I bought a 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.750
 screen protector 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.399
 you can use it are hair materials 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.679
 different but good they serve for what 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.329
 same or maybe for a smartphone is going 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:48.780
 better because it 's smaller and it's more 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.299
 manageable is more portable weighs less is 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.640
 I recommend that I am not or we do not have 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.110
 the glasses covers me this instead 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.659
 to have a loose because I have it in a 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.700
 airtight bag so that 9 enters dust 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.439
 nothing 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.390
 without more we started the tutorial we will open 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:09.979
 the envelope that is hermetically sealed 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.979
 It usually has an easy open 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.430
 let's extract the cleaning wipe 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.280
 if we can 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.950
 this we can archive it in the 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.770
 paper bin 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.720
 and good it gives off a pretty good smell 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.150
 the truth 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.060
 It is recommended that you do not have alcohol 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.260
 because if they could not scratch the screen 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.030
 we would start then it does not matter we go to 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.580
 start for example with our tablet 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.940
 is full of traces we can put it 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.769
 more this well then only when 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.709
 really dirty you do not have to 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:53.470
 stumble is to say that the wipes 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.230
 They are a bit dry 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.260
 but good to something do you see something has 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.180
 cleaned up we could even clean the 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.710
 back would be recommended 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.000
 clean the back because now 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.700
 I'm putting my whole hand to the 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.640
 part of the front is messing 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.920
 well in circular motions 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.100
 also by the sides and we want 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:20.750
 especially the cameras 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:23.300
 and well we clean the screen just like 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.580
 I like a little bit the wipes and 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.870
 Well, we could use the same 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.280
 for a smartphone because it's in relation 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.160
 to a tablet the screen is usually 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.320
 small and we can take advantage of it 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.060
 wipe we can also clean the 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.980
 back according to the cloths that 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.970
 started it is always commented by the part 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.310
 from the back side the chrome-plated button 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.760
 the xperia which is also bright for 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.760
 that shine 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.980
 we will clean everything that is part of 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.370
 front and proceed to drying well 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:01.360
 let's take it then the little chamois 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.460
 for the mobile smartphone 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.340
 the back of the back so good to have the 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.390
 hand is already dry 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:13.519
 has been very good and we can take the 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.519
 large suede to clean the tablet 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.340
 and good the truth that as it was like 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.530
 there is a big difference 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.530
 see you in a next video bye bye
