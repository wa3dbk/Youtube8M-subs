00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.310 
fun times on the game yeah also I made a
little<00:03:53.670> action<00:03:54.060> that<00:03:54.269> has<00:03:54.420> minus<00:03:54.810> 15<00:03:55.170> bullets

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
little action that has minus 15 bullets

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.099 
little action that has minus 15 bullets
and<00:03:56.120> basically<00:03:57.120> what<00:03:57.359> it<00:03:57.480> does<00:03:57.690> is<00:03:57.840> when<00:03:57.989> you

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
and basically what it does is when you

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.830 
and basically what it does is when you
use<00:03:58.290> it<00:03:58.530> crashes<00:03:59.070> those<00:03:59.250> any<00:04:00.090> game<00:04:00.359> doesn't

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
use it crashes those any game doesn't

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.840 
use it crashes those any game doesn't
matter<00:04:00.989> private<00:04:01.560> matches<00:04:01.920> if<00:04:02.340> I<00:04:02.459> don't<00:04:02.700> hate

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
matter private matches if I don't hate

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.670 
matter private matches if I don't hate
doesn't<00:04:03.180> matter<00:04:03.570> if<00:04:03.660> I<00:04:03.810> pick<00:04:04.049> that<00:04:04.200> gun<00:04:04.470> I

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
doesn't matter if I pick that gun I

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.490 
doesn't matter if I pick that gun I
click<00:04:05.040> on<00:04:05.160> begin<00:04:05.310> game<00:04:05.810> house<00:04:06.810> migration<00:04:07.380> will

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
click on begin game house migration will

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.590 
click on begin game house migration will
come<00:04:07.739> immediately<00:04:08.060> basically<00:04:09.060> what<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.390> gun

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
come immediately basically what the gun

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.720 
come immediately basically what the gun
does<00:04:09.810> it<00:04:10.019> crashes<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.530> game<00:04:10.579> because<00:04:11.579> the

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
does it crashes the game because the

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.000 
does it crashes the game because the
host<00:04:11.880> has<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.269> download<00:04:12.750> what<00:04:13.109> you<00:04:13.260> upload<00:04:13.739> I

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
host has to download what you upload I

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.599 
host has to download what you upload I
don't<00:04:14.280> know<00:04:14.340> exactly<00:04:14.459> ever<00:04:15.000> works<00:04:16.099> it<00:04:17.099> it

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
don't know exactly ever works it it

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.479 
don't know exactly ever works it it
loads<00:04:18.599> the<00:04:18.720> gun<00:04:18.959> for<00:04:19.320> for<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:19.709> host<00:04:19.890> at<00:04:20.130> first

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
loads the gun for for the host at first

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.029 
loads the gun for for the host at first
and<00:04:20.810> that's<00:04:21.810> why<00:04:21.989> his<00:04:22.169> being<00:04:22.380> crashes<00:04:23.270> so<00:04:25.039> yeah

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
and that's why his being crashes so yeah

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:27.890 
and that's why his being crashes so yeah
you<00:04:26.400> know<00:04:26.490> I<00:04:26.520> like<00:04:26.789> to<00:04:26.820> call<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.510> gun<00:04:27.659> code

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
you know I like to call the gun code

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.140 
you know I like to call the gun code
five<00:04:28.140> because<00:04:28.620> I<00:04:29.159> had<00:04:29.550> it<00:04:29.729> in<00:04:29.820> the<00:04:29.940> fifth

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
five because I had it in the fifth

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.870 
five because I had it in the fifth
loadout<00:04:30.570> so<00:04:31.020> whenever<00:04:31.409> it<00:04:31.950> was<00:04:32.280> there's<00:04:32.789> a

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
loadout so whenever it was there's a

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.000 
loadout so whenever it was there's a
bass<00:04:33.090> host<00:04:33.360> or<00:04:33.780> it<00:04:34.169> was<00:04:34.380> about<00:04:34.620> hose<00:04:34.830> or

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
bass host or it was about hose or

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.870 
bass host or it was about hose or
whatever<00:04:35.310> I<00:04:35.580> could<00:04:36.479> have<00:04:36.690> used<00:04:37.430> code<00:04:38.430> five<00:04:38.669> you

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
whatever I could have used code five you

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.790 
whatever I could have used code five you
know<00:04:39.060> I<00:04:39.270> could<00:04:39.659> make<00:04:39.840> hoseman<00:04:40.440> Grayson's

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
know I could make hoseman Grayson's

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.610 
know I could make hoseman Grayson's
whenever<00:04:41.070> I<00:04:41.190> want<00:04:41.430> if<00:04:41.640> at<00:04:41.820> a<00:04:41.849> clan<00:04:42.180> that<00:04:42.620> we

what I mean business bitch I'll take

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.050 
what I mean business bitch I'll take
code<00:04:47.970> five<00:04:48.240> you<00:04:48.450> know<00:04:48.570> and<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:49.169> game<00:04:49.349> is<00:04:49.530> over

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
code five you know and the game is over

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.730 
code five you know and the game is over
they<00:04:51.060> have<00:04:51.180> one<00:04:51.360> player<00:04:51.570> less<00:04:51.870> as<00:04:52.229> those<00:04:52.470> in

don't<00:04:58.950> know<00:04:59.039> I<00:04:59.070> just<00:04:59.190> spectator<00:04:59.820> and<00:05:00.060> then

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
don't know I just spectator and then

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.279 
don't know I just spectator and then
make<00:05:00.300> those<00:05:00.479> quit<00:05:01.520> yeah<00:05:02.520> I'm<00:05:03.360> just<00:05:03.900> saying

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
make those quit yeah I'm just saying

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.380 
make those quit yeah I'm just saying
things<00:05:04.650> you<00:05:04.800> know<00:05:05.010> but<00:05:05.310> it<00:05:05.640> is<00:05:05.789> reality<00:05:06.210> right

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
this out well I didn't discover it

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.430 
this out well I didn't discover it
somebody<00:05:12.570> else's<00:05:12.780> go<00:05:12.960> over<00:05:13.080> there<00:05:13.229> but<00:05:13.380> I'm
