00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
draw into her crease just like this the

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.380 
draw into her crease just like this the
same<00:00:29.220> thing<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.699> did<00:00:29.820> when<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.060> did<00:00:30.300> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
same thing that I did when I did the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.240 
same thing that I did when I did the
natural<00:00:30.570> look<00:00:30.929> I'm<00:00:31.140> just<00:00:31.199> going<00:00:31.679> deeper<00:00:32.099> than

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
natural look I'm just going deeper than

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.910 
natural look I'm just going deeper than
I<00:00:32.340> was<00:00:32.489> before<00:00:32.899> drawing<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.110> crease<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.890> a

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
I was before drawing this crease in is a

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.580 
I was before drawing this crease in is a
great<00:00:35.309> way<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.579> cheat<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.329> crease<00:00:36.630> if<00:00:36.989> you're

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
great way to cheat a crease if you're

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.380 
great way to cheat a crease if you're
Asian<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:38.100> sometimes<00:00:38.550> don't<00:00:38.790> have<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.090> crease

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
Asian you sometimes don't have a crease

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.690 
Asian you sometimes don't have a crease
and<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:40.170> by<00:00:40.350> drawing<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.250> creates<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
and so by drawing it in it creates the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.819 
and so by drawing it in it creates the
illusion<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.210> actually<00:00:42.420> have<00:00:42.809> one<00:00:43.050> and

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
illusion that you actually have one and

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.139 
illusion that you actually have one and
then<00:00:43.980> I'm<00:00:44.160> gonna<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.520> go<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.820> other<00:00:44.940> side

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
then I'm gonna just go to the other side

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.660 
then I'm gonna just go to the other side
and<00:00:45.420> do<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.539> same<00:00:45.600> thing<00:00:46.129> now<00:00:47.129> taking<00:00:47.579> a

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
and do the same thing now taking a

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.299 
and do the same thing now taking a
lighter<00:00:47.910> color<00:00:48.770> I'm<00:00:49.770> going<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.160> just

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
lighter color I'm going to just

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.330 
lighter color I'm going to just
highlight<00:00:51.199> right<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> center<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.829> her<00:00:53.129> lid

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
highlight right in the center of her lid

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.970 
highlight right in the center of her lid
just<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.239> give<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> little<00:00:54.480> more<00:00:54.980> contrast

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
just to give a little more contrast

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.260 
just to give a little more contrast
between<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.460> light<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.850> dark<00:00:57.059> color

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
between the light and the dark color

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.090 
between the light and the dark color
then<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.109> punch<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.440> up<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:58.710> night<00:00:58.829> I'm<00:00:58.949> gonna
