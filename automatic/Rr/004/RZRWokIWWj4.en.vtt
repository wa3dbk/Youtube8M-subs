little keeper section is there to

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:54.730 
little keeper section is there to
actually<00:01:53.600> hold<00:01:53.719> the<00:01:53.810> plastic<00:01:54.200> onto<00:01:54.380> that<00:01:54.530> hook

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
actually hold the plastic onto that hook

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.590 
actually hold the plastic onto that hook
so<00:01:55.310> when<00:01:55.549> it<00:01:55.670> when<00:01:55.880> it<00:01:55.909> cops<00:01:56.179> a<00:01:56.270> little<00:01:56.420> bit<00:01:56.509> of

doesn't fall off now very big part of
your<00:02:01.189> success<00:02:01.429> will<00:02:01.729> often<00:02:02.030> be<00:02:02.060> dictated<00:02:02.569> by

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
your success will often be dictated by

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.849 
your success will often be dictated by
how<00:02:02.659> well<00:02:02.869> you<00:02:03.049> put<00:02:03.229> that<00:02:03.350> plastic<00:02:03.530> on<00:02:03.829> the

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:03.859 
how well you put that plastic on the

how well you put that plastic on the
hook<00:02:04.069> what<00:02:04.639> we<00:02:04.729> want<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:04.939> do<00:02:05.149> is<00:02:05.569> get<00:02:05.929> it<00:02:06.079> to<00:02:06.200> the

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
hook what we want to do is get it to the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:07.749 
hook what we want to do is get it to the
point<00:02:06.469> where<00:02:06.709> that<00:02:06.889> plastic<00:02:07.279> is<00:02:07.369> sitting<00:02:07.609> nice

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
point where that plastic is sitting nice

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.669 
point where that plastic is sitting nice
and<00:02:07.789> straight<00:02:08.300> whichever<00:02:08.990> way<00:02:09.170> we<00:02:09.289> look<00:02:09.440> at<00:02:09.590> it

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
and straight whichever way we look at it

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.740 
and straight whichever way we look at it
and<00:02:09.800> by<00:02:10.190> that's<00:02:10.399> what<00:02:11.180> you'll<00:02:11.330> do<00:02:11.540> by<00:02:11.690> getting

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
and by that's what you'll do by getting

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.030 
and by that's what you'll do by getting
that<00:02:11.990> nice<00:02:12.140> and<00:02:12.350> straight<00:02:12.560> is<00:02:12.680> making<00:02:12.950> the

that nice and straight is making the
swim<00:02:13.310> exactly<00:02:13.819> like<00:02:13.970> it's<00:02:14.150> designed<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.600> good

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
swim exactly like it's designed to good

swim exactly like it's designed to good
place<00:02:15.470> to<00:02:15.590> start<00:02:15.860> is<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.220> lie<00:02:16.640> your<00:02:17.030> jig<00:02:17.599> head

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
place to start is to lie your jig head

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.420 
place to start is to lie your jig head
on<00:02:17.900> top<00:02:18.080> of<00:02:18.140> your<00:02:18.319> soft<00:02:18.500> plastic<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.010> work<00:02:19.159> out

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
on top of your soft plastic and work out

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.399 
on top of your soft plastic and work out
where<00:02:20.299> that<00:02:20.480> hook<00:02:20.659> point<00:02:20.840> needs<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.200> come<00:02:21.319> out

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
where that hook point needs to come out

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:22.610 
where that hook point needs to come out
of<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.590> plastic<00:02:21.799> so<00:02:22.129> that<00:02:22.250> it<00:02:22.340> will

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
of the plastic so that it will

of the plastic so that it will
I straight<00:02:23.010> so<00:02:23.549> having<00:02:23.700> done<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.390> can

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
I straight so having done that I can

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.050 
I straight so having done that I can
establish<00:02:24.930> where<00:02:25.470> my<00:02:26.190> hook<00:02:26.370> needs<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.819> breach

establish where my hook needs to breach

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.990 
establish where my hook needs to breach
the<00:02:27.239> soft<00:02:27.480> plastic<00:02:27.870> on<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.470> rig<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:28.709> right

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
the soft plastic on a rig it right

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.149 
the soft plastic on a rig it right
through<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.959> face<00:02:31.170> of<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.440> plastic<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.069> I'm

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
through the face of the plastic and I'm

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.890 
through the face of the plastic and I'm
going<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.370> run<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:32.700> down<00:02:32.909> nice<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:33.269> straight<00:02:33.870> a

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
going to run it down nice and straight a

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.330 
going to run it down nice and straight a
little<00:02:34.140> bit<00:02:34.260> like<00:02:34.379> threading<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.799> worm<00:02:34.980> on<00:02:35.159> to<00:02:35.280> a

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
little bit like threading a worm on to a
