unfortunately not how artifacts like
them<00:02:48.180> works<00:02:48.450> but<00:02:49.400> it<00:02:50.400> is<00:02:50.579> so<00:02:50.849> something<00:02:51.269> cool

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
them works but it is so something cool

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.740 
them works but it is so something cool
that<00:02:51.840> I<00:02:52.170> wish<00:02:52.530> would<00:02:52.769> have<00:02:52.920> been<00:02:53.069> usable<00:02:53.790> also

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
that I wish would have been usable also

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.420 
that I wish would have been usable also
we<00:02:54.900> can<00:02:54.930> note<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.409> if<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.709> use<00:02:55.739> artifacts

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
we can note that if you use artifacts

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.099 
we can note that if you use artifacts
sanctum<00:02:56.879> and<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.480> special<00:02:57.810> some<00:02:57.930> in<00:02:58.019> an

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.199 
sanctum and you special some in an
artifact<00:02:58.560> costas<00:02:59.159> with<00:02:59.549> it<00:02:59.730> I<00:02:59.849> think<00:03:00.060> that's

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
artifact costas with it I think that's

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.250 
artifact costas with it I think that's
how<00:03:00.299> you<00:03:00.329> pronounce<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.810> it's<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.109> yellow

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
how you pronounce it it's the yellow

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.020 
how you pronounce it it's the yellow
dude<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:02.310> one<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.519> allows<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:02.819> to<00:03:02.909> draw

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
dude the one that allows you to draw

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.759 
dude the one that allows you to draw
cards<00:03:03.389> you<00:03:03.629> I<00:03:03.659> think<00:03:03.959> you<00:03:04.230> will<00:03:04.349> only<00:03:04.530> be

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
cards you I think you will only be

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.619 
cards you I think you will only be
drawing<00:03:05.099> one<00:03:05.370> card<00:03:05.730> because<00:03:06.090> your<00:03:06.269> whole<00:03:06.450> back

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
drawing one card because your whole back

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.180 
drawing one card because your whole back
row<00:03:06.810> just<00:03:06.989> kind<00:03:07.170> of<00:03:07.200> gets<00:03:07.349> up<00:03:07.470> actually<00:03:08.099> it

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
row just kind of gets up actually it

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.369 
row just kind of gets up actually it
would<00:03:08.280> be<00:03:08.400> special<00:03:08.609> drawing<00:03:09.209> too<00:03:09.540> because<00:03:10.200> if

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
would be special drawing too because if

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.250 
would be special drawing too because if
you<00:03:10.500> go<00:03:10.940> special<00:03:11.940> well<00:03:12.269> let<00:03:12.840> me<00:03:12.930> think<00:03:12.959> how<00:03:13.200> you

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
you go special well let me think how you

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.990 
you go special well let me think how you
would<00:03:13.319> chain<00:03:13.620> this<00:03:13.799> you<00:03:13.889> would<00:03:14.040> chain<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.519> by

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
would chain this you would chain it by

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.199 
would chain this you would chain it by
going<00:03:15.180> artifact<00:03:15.870> sanctum<00:03:16.560> this<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.699> then

going artifact sanctum this and then

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.000 
going artifact sanctum this and then

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
which is still actually pretty good

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.720 
which is still actually pretty good
considering<00:03:22.980> you're<00:03:23.190> going<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.370> be<00:03:23.430> netting

gets<00:03:51.540> better<00:03:51.750> than<00:03:51.900> this<00:03:51.959> having<00:03:52.859> an

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
gets better than this having an

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.009 
gets better than this having an

back it up to completely replace one of

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:06.649 
back it up to completely replace one of
probably<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:05.069> most<00:04:05.340> necessary<00:04:05.760> cards<00:04:06.510> and

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
probably the most necessary cards and

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.899

any artifact based deck and form a big

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.149 
any artifact based deck and form a big
all<00:04:09.060> attack<00:04:09.329> I<00:04:09.629> think<00:04:10.530> it's<00:04:10.650> just<00:04:10.739> something

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
all attack I think it's just something

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.369 
all attack I think it's just something
that<00:04:11.190> artifacts<00:04:11.699> really<00:04:12.120> needed<00:04:12.449> but

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
that artifacts really needed but

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:14.629 
that artifacts really needed but
something<00:04:13.709> that<00:04:13.739> artifacts<00:04:14.190> really<00:04:14.459> need

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
something that artifacts really need

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.479 
something that artifacts really need
more<00:04:14.879> is<00:04:15.409> artifact<00:04:16.409> morale<00:04:16.739> attack<00:04:16.979> back<00:04:17.220> and

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
more is artifact morale attack back and

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.009 
more is artifact morale attack back and
that's<00:04:17.579> kind<00:04:17.909> of<00:04:17.970> unfortunate<00:04:18.269> rest<00:04:18.720> in<00:04:18.840> peace
