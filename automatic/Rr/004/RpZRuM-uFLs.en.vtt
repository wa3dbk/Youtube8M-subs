was a confederate flag in there too
somewhere<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:01.799> it<00:03:02.519> was<00:03:02.640> perfectly

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
somewhere and it was perfectly

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.449 
somewhere and it was perfectly
appropriate<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.170> perfectly<00:03:04.560> funny<00:03:04.920> right

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
appropriate and perfectly funny right

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.809 
appropriate and perfectly funny right
because<00:03:06.360> it's<00:03:06.540> mocking<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.920> stupidity<00:03:08.400> of

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
because it's mocking the stupidity of

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.350 
because it's mocking the stupidity of
racism<00:03:09.890> so<00:03:10.890> is<00:03:11.250> there<00:03:11.489> an<00:03:11.610> effective<00:03:12.090> way<00:03:12.299> to

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
racism so is there an effective way to

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.809 
racism so is there an effective way to
do<00:03:13.290> satire<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.799> course<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.400> actually<00:03:14.579> think

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
do satire of course and I actually think

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.850 
do satire of course and I actually think
this<00:03:14.970> falls<00:03:15.209> perfectly<00:03:15.480> within<00:03:15.900> that<00:03:16.200> if<00:03:16.500> you

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
this falls perfectly within that if you

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.979 
this falls perfectly within that if you
do<00:03:17.099> some<00:03:17.340> sort<00:03:17.489> of<00:03:17.610> team-building<00:03:18.510> exercise

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989

where the black kids are Will Smith and
Martin<00:03:22.769> Lawrence<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.310> then<00:03:23.400> they<00:03:23.549> end<00:03:23.730> up<00:03:23.880> you

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
Martin Lawrence and then they end up you

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.809

totally<00:03:42.750> disingenuous<00:03:43.049> it's<00:03:43.620> like<00:03:43.769> saying

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
totally disingenuous it's like saying

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.280 
totally disingenuous it's like saying
that<00:03:44.370> if<00:03:44.609> I<00:03:45.030> do<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.299> story<00:03:45.720> about<00:03:46.019> somebody

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
that if I do a story about somebody

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.080

using<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.829> n-word<00:03:47.040> and<00:03:47.400> then<00:03:47.549> I<00:03:47.639> use<00:03:47.910> the

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
using the n-word and then I use the

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.479 
using the n-word and then I use the
n-word<00:03:48.269> as<00:03:48.690> that<00:03:49.139> person<00:03:49.680> and<00:03:49.799> then<00:03:49.889> I<00:03:49.920> mock<00:03:50.280> it

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
n-word as that person and then I mock it

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.370 
n-word as that person and then I mock it
right<00:03:50.730> it's<00:03:51.329> like<00:03:51.480> saying<00:03:51.720> that<00:03:51.810> I'm<00:03:52.049> equally

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
right it's like saying that I'm equally

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.520 
right it's like saying that I'm equally
as<00:03:52.500> wrong<00:03:52.950> as<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.510> southern

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
as wrong as the southern
