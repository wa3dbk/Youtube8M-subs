00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.750
 while we are here in 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.900
 Dominica in the world keeps turning the 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.279
 news happen that's why we 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.640
 we go and travel in our sight 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.640
 world 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.940
 we go immediately to Korea 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:38.640
 north because the pyongyang regime 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.739
 he launched his fourth missile in two days at 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.430
 yesterday remember that we 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.140
 we talked about all the problems 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.080
 and the war drums that were 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.330
 rumbling in that region of the world 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.090
 between Saturday and Sunday they launched four 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.489
 missiles towards the sea of ​​japan there 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.530
 we have an example of the ability to 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.140
 the different missiles that they possess 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.900
 but they were short-range missiles and 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.489
 South Korea is taking a 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.369
 so cautious to avoid any 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.700
 kind of problems because certainly not 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.290
 was harmed because even the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.440
 missiles that were thrown into the sea ​​are 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.759
 natural or normal test and missiles 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.160
 they were diverted very far from the coasts 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:25.140
 South Koreans but it should be noted that 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.660
 they just did this exercise 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.050
 military this past weekend that no 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.390
 they had done so far 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.570
 I hope it does not occur to you to start 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:39.740
 again with the little game to pyongyang 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.380
 Well, Kim Jong-un from there, we're going to 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.000
 croatia you will not go that you will not believe what 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.880
 what is being done in croatia the news 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.580
 and scientists are training bees 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.510
 as mine detectors are 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.750
 using the smell of these of these 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:00.140
 insects to determine where there are mines 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.210
 that there are different decades 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.080
 military conflicts that has affected be 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.330
 a Croatian 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.550
 they say they certainly feel that the 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.510
 training is helping you and that you 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.240
 will allow not to lose human lives in 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.390
 the search for these mines to be able 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.120
 clean entire regions that have to 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.690
 have been killed by the war I hope 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.410
 can buy a couple of beehives for 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.370
 drop them in nicaragua honduras and the 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.920
 savior 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.240
 there are many colombia creating 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.070
 colombia problems also 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.050
 unfortunately and over all the 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.260
 civilian population that is affecting 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.360
 in those countries like that it's don giuseppe de 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.310

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.920
 images 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:59.080
 and that's a US Airways plane that 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.620
 landed with the belly 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.420
 did not have landing gear flew 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.970
 He flew over the Newark airport on 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.980
 book airport and again for space 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.980
 of a work trying to lower its wheels 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.140
 because it was belly that landed on the 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.650
 airstrip 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.270
 it was from belly that landed I did not have the 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.110
 landing gear none none of 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.450
 the wheels was 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.900
 was being used at those times not 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:32.740
 they could and there's the incredible image 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.500
 of 31 people inside that plane and 13 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.160
 of the crew all resulted 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.010
 unharmed 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.310
 there were no problems of any kind 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.170
 human loss neither injuries and 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.470
 even people were taken out of 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.120
 plane after it stopped completely it was 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.070
 they took to the terminal there is the 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.660
 pilot copilot and that stewardess 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.560
 plane luckily was not a 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.770
 turboprop as they call them 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.270
 Americans but it was a feat was 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.030
 amazing to see those but if you 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.670
 fixed that they threw the foam to 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.410
 immediately if it seems that you 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.740
 conditioned the track with foam 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:15.650
 so that precisely friction 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.510
 avoid the fire even though we saw some 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.850
 flare and the tiber has been mounted 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.400
 there has had foam that would have been valid 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.930
 it's worth it but what I was going to tell him 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.060
 they took the passengers to the terminal 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.330
 They gave him their bags and went to 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.159
 his house 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.720

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:36.270

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.349

 a meteor crashing against the 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.990
 moon and the meteor basically caused 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.280
 an explosion 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:07.060
 in the territory of the mole in the 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:09.760
 lunar surface there is one of the 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.340
 of the observatories that they used to 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.220
 follow the meteorite and to follow the 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:18.130
 true explosion that a beauty 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:20.650
 very very unusual natural that could be 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:23.169
 have seen even without using a 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.730
 telescope only at a glance if 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.889
 it was a very dark night where you 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:30.520
