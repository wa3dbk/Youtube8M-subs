00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
know about it it's been Tudor the

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:31.340

remakes<00:01:25.290> from<00:01:26.060> Anton<00:01:27.060> Johnson<00:01:28.640> look<00:01:30.350> this

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
remakes from Anton Johnson look this

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.130 
remakes from Anton Johnson look this
sounds<00:01:31.680> super<00:01:32.130> weird<00:01:32.310> because<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.450> guess<00:01:33.960> it's

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
sounds super weird because I guess it's

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:42.520 
sounds super weird because I guess it's
a<00:01:34.200> guy<00:01:34.439> singing<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.100> background

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.900 

you<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:43.710> hear<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.070> voice<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.550> different
