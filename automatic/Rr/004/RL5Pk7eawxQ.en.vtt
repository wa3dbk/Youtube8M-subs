00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 Hello dear friends in the hands of 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.240
 me a piece of plastic window sill 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.550
 out of it I will make a hull for my 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.240
 new powerbank she lithium-ion 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.889
 battery powered 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.889
 see what came of it 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.480
 so from this trim I made this 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.820
 here's a box with open ends inside 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.860
 all jumpers cut outside 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.320
 also cut all polished fine 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.960
 sandpaper and of course the basis of powerbank 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.790
 these are two lithium-ion cells of three 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.320
 four thousand milliamps an hour each 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.180
 I will not say for sure about from 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.550
 chinese portable bachelorette party 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.220
 element initially did not have controllers 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.140
 protection I set and the course of the dead 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.420
 batteries this little handkerchief 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.850
 worth just 1 dollar and in china with and 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.520
 b as you understand it serves to 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.609
 charging the lithium batteries themselves with 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.129
 one side of her mini yusb is his 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.420
 I prefer for my devices and with 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.039
 the other side to be fed 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.440
 accumulator battery 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:10.050
 the second fee is also worth 1 dollar she 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.810
 serves to increase the voltage i.e. 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.090
 it's a boost converter and he 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.660
 pulse voltage increases 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.210
 37 volt battery give successful 5 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.360
 volts that we use to charge 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.009
 of our gadgets, the ends of the case, I decided 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.860
 close your favorite red 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.190
 a plastic hole in advance 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.110
 they beat for me and for the user or to 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.420
 springs for big yusbi shorter still 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.880
 thought to bring out the LED which 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.399
 signals the end of charging 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.080
 powerbank itself and everything inside is pretty 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.349
 plumped on 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.599
 quietly well that was fixed by me 

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:50.250
 hot glue as they say in the best 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:52.830
 the tradition of the mursu novel 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.149
 on the back of the nozzle less 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.610
 look beautiful 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.950
 I donâ€™t really like such a montage on 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.530
 hot glue but I have another way 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.530
 something never occurred so all 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.390
 so here on the collective farm turned out but 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.580
 glad that this will not be seen when 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.740
 power pack will be assembled and literally 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.870
 last moment before sticking them i 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.240
 I thought to put the switch on 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.130
 power supply which disables boost 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.660
 the converter and on battery and how 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.660
 It turned out not in vain did 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.140
 but if you notice this red plastic 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.390
 I have already used my previous one 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.430
 portable banks which can 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.850
 name only in quotes unfortunately but 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.820
 however, its capacity is 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.650
 cheap battery 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:30.060
 certainly inspires versus lithium 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.130
 which is not worth its price but 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.080
 rejoice in the small weight of the resulting 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.540
 bank cook enough to charge my 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.850
 iphone 5 is for you to understand and a half 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.250
 thousand milliamps an hour is enough for about 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.570
 two times charge is not enough but not worth it 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.580
 forget that the batteries are still 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.100
 posed well and as for weight 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.290
 device it is 240 2 grams 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.970
 about the same weighs only 10 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.830
 thousand 400 milliamps I have it also 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.810
 there is a new, I like everything told 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.459
 thank you for watching subscribe 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.459
 on the channel all bye
