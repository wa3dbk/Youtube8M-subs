00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
here both for glue and a k work really

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.560 
here both for glue and a k work really
nicely<00:00:17.010> with<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.310> science<00:00:17.760> so<00:00:18.270> if<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.420> want

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
nicely with the science so if you want

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.650 
nicely with the science so if you want
to<00:00:18.630> go<00:00:18.779> undercover<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.680> not<00:00:20.490> get<00:00:20.670> shown<00:00:21.270> up<00:00:21.449> as

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
a red dot on the map then this gun is

however<00:01:34.020> there's<00:01:34.229> also<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.770> open<00:01:35.250> beta<00:01:35.400> which

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
however there's also the open beta which

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.910 
however there's also the open beta which
applies<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.030> all<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.600> us<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.049> open<00:01:37.560> beta<00:01:37.710> that

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
applies to all of us the open beta that

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.179 
applies to all of us the open beta that
was<00:01:38.009> available<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.490> believe<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.939> world<00:01:39.329> at<00:01:39.479> war

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
was available I believe to world at war

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.440 
was available I believe to world at war
didn't<00:01:41.189> happen<00:01:41.490> for<00:01:41.520> modern<00:01:41.880> warfare<00:01:42.030> 2

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
didn't happen for modern warfare 2

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.289 
didn't happen for modern warfare 2
didn't<00:01:42.869> happen<00:01:43.140> for<00:01:43.170> black<00:01:43.470> ops<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.180> this<00:01:45.180> is

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
didn't happen for black ops and this is

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.800 
didn't happen for black ops and this is
basically<00:01:45.509> why<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.860> beta<00:01:47.430> process<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.420> used

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
basically why the beta process is used

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.469 
basically why the beta process is used
to<00:01:49.049> get<00:01:49.170> information<00:01:49.409> back<00:01:49.920> from<00:01:49.950> everyone<00:01:50.670> to

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
to get information back from everyone to

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.999 
to get information back from everyone to

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
through him no they've got enough time

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.750 
through him no they've got enough time
to<00:04:10.470> go<00:04:10.590> ahead<00:04:10.709> and<00:04:10.920> do<00:04:11.070> something<00:04:11.489> like<00:04:11.610> this

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
to go ahead and do something like this

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.370 
to go ahead and do something like this
which<00:04:11.970> does<00:04:12.239> take<00:04:12.450> a<00:04:12.480> lot<00:04:12.630> of<00:04:12.750> time<00:04:12.959> and<00:04:13.140> effort

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
which does take a lot of time and effort

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.890 
which does take a lot of time and effort
to<00:04:13.470> put<00:04:13.650> together<00:04:13.970> so<00:04:14.970> for<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.209> moment<00:04:15.600> there
