thought<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.520> would<00:00:38.579> make<00:00:38.730> sense<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.180> do<00:00:39.300> this

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450

order<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:34.799> make<00:03:35.010> now<00:03:35.639> the<00:03:35.669> first<00:03:36.150> few<00:03:36.569> all<00:03:36.870> of

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
order to make now the first few all of

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.750 
order to make now the first few all of
them<00:03:37.109> at<00:03:37.199> the<00:03:37.260> moment<00:03:37.379> are<00:03:37.769> unlimited<00:03:38.340> use

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
them at the moment are unlimited use

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.300 
them at the moment are unlimited use
however<00:03:39.150> in<00:03:39.510> future<00:03:39.810> updates<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.319> original

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
however in future updates the original

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.039 
however in future updates the original
the<00:03:41.519> low<00:03:41.730> standard<00:03:42.329> few<00:03:42.569> I<00:03:42.599> believe<00:03:42.900> which<00:03:43.019> is

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
the low standard few I believe which is

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.670 
the low standard few I believe which is
wood<00:03:43.910> stone<00:03:44.910> and<00:03:44.940> gold<00:03:45.299> won't<00:03:45.750> be<00:03:45.959> but<00:03:46.470> the

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
wood stone and gold won't be but the

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.140 
wood stone and gold won't be but the
rest<00:03:46.859> will<00:03:47.069> be<00:03:47.129> because<00:03:47.549> there<00:03:47.790> I<00:03:47.879> mean<00:03:48.060> the

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
rest will be because there I mean the

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.309 
rest will be because there I mean the
higher<00:03:48.299> ones<00:03:48.540> are<00:03:48.660> gonna<00:03:48.750> be<00:03:48.870> harder<00:03:49.079> to<00:03:49.109> get

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
higher ones are gonna be harder to get

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.830 
higher ones are gonna be harder to get
essentially<00:03:49.769> you<00:03:49.889> need<00:03:50.099> blocks<00:03:51.000> of<00:03:51.269> stuff<00:03:51.540> so

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
essentially you need blocks of stuff so

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.300 
essentially you need blocks of stuff so
you<00:03:51.900> know<00:03:51.989> if<00:03:52.319> you<00:03:52.530> wanna<00:03:52.680> make<00:03:52.829> done<00:03:53.010> one<00:03:53.190> you

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
you know if you wanna make done one you

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.369 
you know if you wanna make done one you
need<00:03:53.489> blocks<00:03:54.359> of<00:03:54.569> diamond<00:03:54.959> -<00:03:55.079> which<00:03:55.169> means

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
need blocks of diamond - which means

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:58.089 
need blocks of diamond - which means
nine<00:03:55.709> diamonds<00:03:56.010> to<00:03:56.849> make<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:57.000> block<00:03:57.269> of<00:03:57.419> diamond

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
nine diamonds to make a block of diamond

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.009 
nine diamonds to make a block of diamond
but<00:03:59.099> the<00:03:59.370> only<00:03:59.549> the<00:03:59.760> small<00:04:00.239> ones<00:04:00.389> are<00:04:00.569> nice<00:04:00.780> and

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
but the only the small ones are nice and

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.780 
but the only the small ones are nice and
simple<00:04:01.319> all<00:04:01.470> you<00:04:01.620> need<00:04:01.650> is<00:04:02.010> either<00:04:02.220> straight

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
wood or just straight off blocks of

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.869 
wood or just straight off blocks of
stone<00:04:06.239> in<00:04:07.169> order<00:04:07.379> to<00:04:07.470> make<00:04:07.620> these<00:04:07.769> and<00:04:08.760> there

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
stone in order to make these and there

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.909 
stone in order to make these and there
you<00:04:08.940> go<00:04:09.060> so<00:04:09.449> you<00:04:09.479> need<00:04:09.629> a<00:04:09.659> 3x3<00:04:10.199> of<00:04:10.349> stone<00:04:10.590> bricks

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
you go so you need a 3x3 of stone bricks

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.699 
you go so you need a 3x3 of stone bricks
and<00:04:11.310> a<00:04:12.239> stick<00:04:12.540> in<00:04:12.840> order<00:04:12.959> to<00:04:13.139> make<00:04:13.260> a<00:04:13.440> stone

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
and a stick in order to make a stone

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.110 
and a stick in order to make a stone
show<00:04:13.979> backs<00:04:14.129> now<00:04:14.310> I<00:04:14.340> believe<00:04:14.579> this<00:04:14.729> does<00:04:14.909> work

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
show backs now I believe this does work

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.120 
show backs now I believe this does work
with<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.840> you<00:04:16.380> just<00:04:16.560> need<00:04:16.680> to<00:04:16.769> straight<00:04:17.010> off
