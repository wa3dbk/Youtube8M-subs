Logitech<00:03:18.230> 5.1<00:03:19.510> 530<00:03:20.510> now<00:03:21.170> they<00:03:21.560> actually

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
Logitech 5.1 530 now they actually

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.590 
Logitech 5.1 530 now they actually
really<00:03:22.160> good<00:03:22.430> speakers<00:03:22.790> also<00:03:22.970> add<00:03:23.299> an<00:03:23.450> add<00:03:23.569> a

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
really good speakers also add an add a

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.520 
really good speakers also add an add a
cheaper<00:03:24.170> price<00:03:24.380> but<00:03:25.750> they're<00:03:26.750> not<00:03:26.959> digital

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
cheaper price but they're not digital

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.800 
cheaper price but they're not digital
where<00:03:28.430> these<00:03:28.850> are<00:03:29.090> digital<00:03:29.510> which<00:03:29.630> has

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
where these are digital which has

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.809 
where these are digital which has
doubled<00:03:30.170> over<00:03:30.620> surround<00:03:31.040> sound<00:03:31.340> and<00:03:31.519> it's

doubled over surround sound and it's
also<00:03:31.940> THX<00:03:32.780> certified<00:03:33.319> so<00:03:34.329> that's<00:03:35.329> probably<00:03:35.600> a

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
also THX certified so that's probably a

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.599 
also THX certified so that's probably a
little<00:03:36.170> bit<00:03:36.440> different<00:03:36.859> then<00:03:37.010> obviously<00:03:37.430> get

little bit different then obviously get

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.660 
little bit different then obviously get

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.310 
it up and how the what Scalia could say
the<00:04:46.070> ample<00:04:46.910> that<00:04:47.060> decoder<00:04:47.419> but<00:04:47.810> then<00:04:48.020> I<00:04:48.050> think

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
the ample that decoder but then I think

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.810 
the ample that decoder but then I think
that's<00:04:48.530> what<00:04:48.680> the<00:04:48.949> proper<00:04:49.250> name<00:04:49.370> for<00:04:49.400> the

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
that's what the proper name for the

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.700 
that's what the proper name for the
decoder<00:04:50.060> how<00:04:50.330> it<00:04:50.449> works<00:04:50.660> how<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:50.960> subs<00:04:51.259> works

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
decoder how it works how the subs works

everything in the exact positions where

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.620 
everything in the exact positions where
they're<00:04:58.490> supposed<00:04:58.759> to<00:04:58.880> be<00:04:58.940> and<00:04:59.210> make<00:04:59.449> a<00:04:59.479> little

they're supposed to be and make a little

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.480 
they're supposed to be and make a little
bit<00:04:59.780> more<00:04:59.900> matter<00:05:00.139> and<00:05:00.860> they<00:05:00.949> might<00:05:01.099> dual<00:05:01.250> rule

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
bit more matter and they might dual rule

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.060 
bit more matter and they might dual rule
or<00:05:01.849> something<00:05:02.180> I<00:05:02.360> like<00:05:02.659> to<00:05:02.750> think<00:05:02.990> um<00:05:03.259> you<00:05:03.949> know

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
or something I like to think um you know

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.980 
or something I like to think um you know
the<00:05:04.430> things<00:05:04.880> called<00:05:05.030> the<00:05:05.150> big<00:05:05.330> picture<00:05:05.690> people

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
the things called the big picture people

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.810 
the things called the big picture people
you<00:05:06.080> might<00:05:06.259> have<00:05:06.470> um<00:05:06.680> they're<00:05:07.400> in<00:05:07.699> Australia

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
you might have um they're in Australia

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.330 
you might have um they're in Australia
so<00:05:08.389> they<00:05:08.599> set<00:05:08.810> up<00:05:08.840> you<00:05:09.080> know<00:05:09.169> projectors<00:05:09.710> in

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
so they set up you know projectors in

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.610 
so they set up you know projectors in
basically<00:05:11.240> home<00:05:11.419> theater<00:05:11.780> systems<00:05:12.139> and<00:05:12.349> I

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
basically home theater systems and I

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.200 
basically home theater systems and I
went<00:05:12.830> everywhere<00:05:13.370> to<00:05:13.550> find<00:05:13.580> out<00:05:14.090> because

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
went everywhere to find out because

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.210 
went everywhere to find out because
obviously<00:05:14.479> I'm<00:05:14.720> using<00:05:14.900> a<00:05:15.080> Mac<00:05:15.409> and<00:05:15.590> I<00:05:15.949> can't

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
obviously I'm using a Mac and I can't

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.640 
obviously I'm using a Mac and I can't
plug<00:05:16.490> in<00:05:16.669> my<00:05:16.909> optical<00:05:17.449> cable<00:05:17.840> into<00:05:18.110> my<00:05:18.199> max<00:05:18.530> I

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
plug in my optical cable into my max I

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.890 
plug in my optical cable into my max I
have<00:05:18.740> to<00:05:18.770> get<00:05:18.949> a<00:05:18.979> 3.5<00:05:19.490> I<00:05:20.030> think<00:05:20.690> score<00:05:20.870> a

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
have to get a 3.5 I think score a

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.830 
have to get a 3.5 I think score a
