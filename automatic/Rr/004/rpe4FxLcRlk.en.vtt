00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:14.620
 finally in the store is the xbox kinect or legs without getting there 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:17.169
 comes to pass but just with your body 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:20.169
 I'm going to time 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.329
 the basis of an xbox kinect is a very large competition with three different ones 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.060
 sensors there are some other infrared bankrupt bank 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.220
 and put a considerably larger all that the site does is it scans your body 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.950
 this is possible because otherwise you can use your feet to explain why and with that the game 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.120
 control the xbox kinect closures on the x box 3 6 4 in the second room 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.380
 in addition, it is important that this does not make the switch the cut and also not too low 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.420
 the consequences then bear 60 centimeters 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.740
 of course also need some space in the room but that also means important 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.240
 and which is also very important for the performance of the light when there is 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.240
 direct sunlight shed on the kinect that didn't work properly 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.710
 properly setting the kinect takes a while, in the beginning you need a number 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.700
 take positions and stand with your hands like this 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.520
 but when you're done with that, the kinect recognizes you as your for 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.770
 sensor will stand 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.530
 how well it works does not depend on the church itself, but that varies per 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.810
 game that about 15 a game is more fun and responds faster than 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.840
 the others because with some there is still something for delay 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.479
 we are now fifteen games to be 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.479
 sure when 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.680
 who can do the icc spokesperson can do very well wmd theft 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.920
 literally creating for television 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.240
 for example, a virtual driving hands to make these kinds of movements 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.710
 very nice 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.730
 less fun is making it work until voice recognition starts working 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.380
 that was not yet and that will probably only be available in 2011 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.359
 conclusion of an xbox kinect it works very nice of course 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:09.609
 this area and he has asked time to get tickets for 150 euros 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:11.999
 possible set for example money 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:16.029
 if comparing it not and then again and the sony reader is the blood then 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:18.329
 It really is an extra dimension you have a good idea 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.169
 I probably do not have any control, but Jan drives into the forest 

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:23.239
 do what you want 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.310
 but pay attention to the light per game that depends on how well it works and how 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.780
 nice it is
