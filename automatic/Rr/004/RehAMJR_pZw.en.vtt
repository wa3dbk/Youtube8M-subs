going to want to walk into that barrier

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.600 
going to want to walk into that barrier
facing<00:01:14.409> the<00:01:14.500> wall<00:01:14.680> and<00:01:14.890> then<00:01:15.010> double<00:01:15.400> jump

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
facing the wall and then double jump

once<00:01:20.020> you're<00:01:20.140> on<00:01:20.170> top<00:01:20.350> of<00:01:20.440> the<00:01:20.500> map<00:01:20.619> you<00:01:20.740> can<00:01:20.830> do

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
once you're on top of the map you can do

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.560 
once you're on top of the map you can do
pretty<00:01:21.130> much<00:01:21.250> anything<00:01:21.909> you<00:01:22.150> want<00:01:22.330> you<00:01:22.390> can

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
pretty much anything you want you can

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.090 
pretty much anything you want you can
get<00:01:22.690> out<00:01:22.869> of<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.080> map<00:01:23.200> get<00:01:23.440> under<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:23.770> map<00:01:23.799> or

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
get out of the map get under the map or

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.680 
get out of the map get under the map or
just<00:01:24.340> shoot<00:01:24.400> at<00:01:24.640> people<00:01:24.790> down<00:01:25.090> below<00:01:25.240> there's

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
just shoot at people down below there's

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.390 
just shoot at people down below there's
just<00:01:25.960> so<00:01:26.260> much<00:01:26.440> you<00:01:26.500> can<00:01:26.680> do<00:01:26.890> in<00:01:26.920> this<00:01:27.100> glitch

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
just so much you can do in this glitch

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.580 
just so much you can do in this glitch
now<00:01:28.210> if<00:01:28.330> you<00:01:28.420> want<00:01:28.570> to<00:01:28.630> get<00:01:28.750> out<00:01:28.930> and<00:01:29.170> under<00:01:29.470> the

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
now if you want to get out and under the

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.570 
now if you want to get out and under the
map<00:01:29.770> you're<00:01:29.979> going<00:01:30.100> to<00:01:30.159> want<00:01:30.250> to<00:01:30.310> make<00:01:30.460> your

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
map you're going to want to make your

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.280 
map you're going to want to make your
way<00:01:30.729> to<00:01:30.790> the<00:01:30.970> right<00:01:31.270> of<00:01:31.510> the<00:01:31.540> bridge<00:01:31.900> and<00:01:32.110> then

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
way to the right of the bridge and then

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.170 
way to the right of the bridge and then
find<00:01:32.590> this<00:01:32.680> invisible<00:01:33.220> barrier<00:01:33.640> here<00:01:33.880> to<00:01:34.060> your

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
find this invisible barrier here to your

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.850 
find this invisible barrier here to your
left<00:01:34.210> so<00:01:34.510> just<00:01:34.720> jump<00:01:34.960> on<00:01:35.020> top<00:01:35.200> of<00:01:35.380> that<00:01:35.439> barrier

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
left so just jump on top of that barrier

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.310 
left so just jump on top of that barrier
and<00:01:36.040> then<00:01:36.369> jump<00:01:36.820> forward<00:01:37.299> and<00:01:37.450> slam<00:01:37.900> against

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
and then jump forward and slam against

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.170 
and then jump forward and slam against
the<00:01:38.409> wall<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.740> get<00:01:38.890> on<00:01:38.979> yet<00:01:39.250> another<00:01:39.460> invisible

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
the wall to get on yet another invisible

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.940 
the wall to get on yet another invisible
barrier<00:01:40.750> now<00:01:40.930> from<00:01:41.200> here<00:01:41.229> you're<00:01:41.619> gonna<00:01:41.740> want

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
barrier now from here you're gonna want

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.830 
barrier now from here you're gonna want
to<00:01:42.010> do<00:01:42.070> a<00:01:42.100> diagonal<00:01:42.369> boost<00:01:42.939> onto<00:01:43.390> this<00:01:43.510> ramp

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
to do a diagonal boost onto this ramp

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.960 
to do a diagonal boost onto this ramp
right<00:01:44.080> here<00:01:44.110> and<00:01:44.500> from<00:01:44.979> here<00:01:45.040> you<00:01:45.369> are<00:01:45.640> fully

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
right here and from here you are fully

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.520 
right here and from here you are fully
out<00:01:46.150> of<00:01:46.299> the<00:01:46.360> map<00:01:46.479> that<00:01:46.630> is<00:01:46.780> all<00:01:47.020> you<00:01:47.200> need<00:01:47.229> to

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
out of the map that is all you need to

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.010 
out of the map that is all you need to
do<00:01:47.710> that<00:01:47.740> is<00:01:48.070> the<00:01:48.159> hardest<00:01:48.430> part<00:01:48.610> by<00:01:48.970> far<00:01:49.270> but

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
do that is the hardest part by far but

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.600 
do that is the hardest part by far but
if<00:01:50.140> you<00:01:50.229> want<00:01:50.380> to<00:01:50.409> get<00:01:50.590> even<00:01:50.619> farther<00:01:51.250> out<00:01:51.520> of

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
if you want to get even farther out of

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.010 
if you want to get even farther out of
the<00:01:51.700> map<00:01:51.790> you're<00:01:52.030> just<00:01:52.180> gonna<00:01:52.270> need<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.630> boost

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
the map you're just gonna need the boost

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.770 
the map you're just gonna need the boost
jump<00:01:53.500> then<00:01:53.860> boost<00:01:54.130> again<00:01:54.460> and<00:01:54.700> slam<00:01:55.150> onto<00:01:55.450> the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
jump then boost again and slam onto the

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.330 
jump then boost again and slam onto the
bridge<00:01:56.020> right<00:01:56.170> here<00:01:56.470> and<00:01:56.650> then<00:01:56.950> you<00:01:57.040> can<00:01:57.159> run

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
bridge right here and then you can run

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.070 
bridge right here and then you can run
all<00:01:57.369> the<00:01:57.729> way<00:01:57.759> along<00:01:57.939> the<00:01:58.180> water<00:01:58.659> in<00:01:58.990> the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
all the way along the water in the

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.870 
all the way along the water in the
outside<00:01:59.560> of<00:01:59.680> the<00:01:59.740> map<00:01:59.860> and<00:02:00.100> just<00:02:00.369> explore<00:02:00.729> as

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
outside of the map and just explore as

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.030 
outside of the map and just explore as
much<00:02:00.909> as<00:02:01.329> you<00:02:01.450> want<00:02:01.659> now<00:02:02.560> if<00:02:02.650> you<00:02:02.740> want<00:02:02.890> to<00:02:02.950> get

much as you want now if you want to get

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.590 
much as you want now if you want to get
under<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.400> map<00:02:03.430> instead<00:02:03.939> of<00:02:04.090> jumping<00:02:04.360> onto

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
under the map instead of jumping onto

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.819 
under the map instead of jumping onto
the<00:02:04.780> bridge<00:02:04.960> you're<00:02:05.140> going<00:02:05.259> to<00:02:05.320> instead<00:02:05.619> want

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
the bridge you're going to instead want

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:07.620 
the bridge you're going to instead want
to<00:02:05.890> run<00:02:06.070> all<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.460> way<00:02:06.490> up<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:06.880> ramp<00:02:07.090> until<00:02:07.509> you

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
to run all the way up the ramp until you

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.660 
to run all the way up the ramp until you
fall<00:02:07.990> through<00:02:08.019> right<00:02:08.769> here<00:02:08.799> now<00:02:09.310> once<00:02:09.549> you're
