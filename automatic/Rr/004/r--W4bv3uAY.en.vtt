00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.550 
oh I tackled him that was good I tackled
him<00:04:13.640> so<00:04:13.880> hard<00:04:14.060> that<00:04:14.180> I<00:04:14.300> need<00:04:14.510> to<00:04:14.660> revive<00:04:15.050> myself

I<00:04:15.740> honestly<00:04:16.160> think<00:04:16.340> that<00:04:16.430> that<00:04:16.609> character

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
I honestly think that that character

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.000 
I honestly think that that character
just<00:04:17.630> might<00:04:17.840> not<00:04:18.290> know<00:04:18.500> how<00:04:18.620> to<00:04:18.680> play<00:04:18.859> this

just might not know how to play this
game<00:04:19.250> and<00:04:19.459> I<00:04:19.549> think<00:04:19.609> that's<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.120> vibe<00:04:20.269> that

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
game and I think that's the vibe that

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:21.940 
game and I think that's the vibe that
I'm<00:04:20.570> getting<00:04:20.600> what<00:04:21.019> an<00:04:21.140> idiot<00:04:21.410> right<00:04:21.680> because
