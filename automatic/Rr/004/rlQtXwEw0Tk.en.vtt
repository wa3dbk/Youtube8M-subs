00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.379
 let's finish with the last row 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.330
 of the blanket for this we are going to do in 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.540
 the first point 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.870
 let's pass our thread 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.300
 and we started with a half point 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.770
 a chain and a half point do not 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.200
 work with paper and you're lying down 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.360
 because it is already blanket has so much 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.570
 termination that you do not miss is nothing 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.849
 very loaded we raise two chains and in 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.869
 the same point where we start 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.870
 two whole 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.560
 one 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.560
 and 2 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:43.579
 in the chain 11 make half a point 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:47.440
 and we follow two chains 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.440
 two whole points 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.540
 and in the chain we make half a point 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.649
 we started again two chains two 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.649
 whole points 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:07.220
 and in the chain we are going to continue 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.280
 well until you get to the corner in the 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.400
 corner see you 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.400
 here if we see already we arrived at the little corner 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.730
 then I do in the previous one to the 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.870
 corner I make half point two chains and 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.430
 two whole 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.820
 here we are right in the corner I'm going to 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.409
 I'll do the half point 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.350
 the last the woven points 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:34.200
 I make my two chains in that same 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.580
 space I will make my two whole 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.270
 one 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.270
 and 2 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.890
 the next half point I'm going to do 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.680
 to the center 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.510
 from the corner I raise again two 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.040
 chains 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.110
 a whole 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.340
 and two integers 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.990
 ok up there we're good we run everything 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.550
 the next half point I'm going to do 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:07.930
 here in the first whole point 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:10.869
 half point 1 2 chains and in the same 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.710
 site let's do the 2 whole 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.710
 one 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.190
 and 2 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.530
 ok and the next one we already do it in the 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.810
 chain where it belongs to us 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.310
 we continue knitting and I am going to teach you 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.310
 how is our corner 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.120
 Beijing is easy to do 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:39.550
 in the corner they were just 1 and I do not know 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.550
 see neither very eaten nor very enlarged
