and<00:01:54.470> mounted<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.649> on/off<00:01:56.159> switch<00:01:56.460> which<00:01:56.729> kind

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
and mounted the on/off switch which kind

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.010 
and mounted the on/off switch which kind
of<00:01:57.000> makes<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.299> pain<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.630> butt<00:01:57.840> because

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
you can't really get to your electronics

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.690 
you can't really get to your electronics
cuz<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.420> on<00:02:00.840> these<00:02:01.049> faxes<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.649> has<00:02:01.829> these<00:02:02.159> this

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
cuz it on these faxes it has these this

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.270 
cuz it on these faxes it has these this
a<00:02:02.729> dust<00:02:03.570> cover<00:02:03.780> which<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.799> kind<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.100> like<00:02:05.250> it

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.059 
a dust cover which I kind of like it
because<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.750> know<00:02:06.869> it's<00:02:07.530> kind<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.740> innovative

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
because you know it's kind of innovative

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.249 
because you know it's kind of innovative

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
in itself because you don't completely

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.930 
in itself because you don't completely
dust<00:02:10.649> out<00:02:10.830> your<00:02:11.009> electronics<00:02:11.670> when<00:02:11.819> you're

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
dust out your electronics when you're

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.670 
dust out your electronics when you're
running<00:02:12.090> so

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
running so

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.559 
running so
you<00:02:13.189> know<00:02:13.280> it<00:02:13.549> don't<00:02:13.670> Lee<00:02:13.819> takes<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.120> few<00:02:14.269> screws

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
you know it don't Lee takes a few screws

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.569 
you know it don't Lee takes a few screws
to<00:02:14.750> get<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.109> it<00:02:15.230> anyway<00:02:15.530> it's<00:02:15.680> not<00:02:15.829> too<00:02:16.069> bad<00:02:16.280> and

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
to get to it anyway it's not too bad and

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:19.709 
to get to it anyway it's not too bad and
it's<00:02:17.150> got<00:02:17.329> a<00:02:17.359> high-tech<00:02:18.170> serve<00:02:18.349> row<00:02:18.500> in<00:02:18.650> there

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:19.719 
it's got a high-tech serve row in there

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:22.899 
it's got a high-tech serve row in there
no<00:02:20.719> controller<00:02:21.200> for<00:02:21.469> it<00:02:21.590> at<00:02:21.709> all<00:02:21.829> the<00:02:22.730> only

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
no controller for it at all the only

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.490 
no controller for it at all the only
thing<00:02:23.090> that<00:02:23.239> I<00:02:23.269> really<00:02:23.420> couldn't<00:02:23.810> remedy<00:02:24.349> is

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
thing that I really couldn't remedy is

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.050 
thing that I really couldn't remedy is
the<00:02:24.709> fact<00:02:24.950> that<00:02:25.069> the<00:02:25.250> front<00:02:25.489> tires<00:02:25.579> actually

the fact that the front tires actually
came<00:02:26.209> out<00:02:26.329> really<00:02:26.480> good<00:02:26.599> the<00:02:26.900> rubber<00:02:27.109> on<00:02:27.290> it

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
came out really good the rubber on it

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.800 
came out really good the rubber on it
these<00:02:28.040> are<00:02:28.159> original<00:02:28.549> tires<00:02:28.700> rubber<00:02:29.689> is

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
these are original tires rubber is

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.330 
these are original tires rubber is
really<00:02:29.989> good<00:02:30.139> in<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.260> Front's<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.650> back<00:02:30.829> and

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
really good in the Front's the back and

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.860 
really good in the Front's the back and
there<00:02:31.670> they're<00:02:31.909> kind<00:02:32.120> of<00:02:32.180> hardened<00:02:32.480> I<00:02:32.599> mean<00:02:32.750> I

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
there they're kind of hardened I mean I

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.599 
there they're kind of hardened I mean I
treated<00:02:33.170> him<00:02:33.319> with<00:02:33.409> silicone<00:02:33.799> many<00:02:34.099> times<00:02:34.400> to

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609 
treated him with silicone many times to

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.550 
treated him with silicone many times to
get<00:02:34.730> them<00:02:34.879> as<00:02:35.480> good<00:02:35.689> as<00:02:35.780> they<00:02:35.870> are<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.260> you

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
get them as good as they are and you

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.559 
get them as good as they are and you
know<00:02:36.590> there's<00:02:36.920> no<00:02:37.129> cracks<00:02:38.000> or<00:02:38.180> anything<00:02:38.239> in

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
fox wasn't even something that was

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.670 
fox wasn't even something that was
talked<00:02:53.060> about<00:02:53.209> if<00:02:54.139> you<00:02:54.260> don't<00:02:54.439> know<00:02:54.530> what<00:02:54.590> I

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
re-release and my phone keeps on going

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.610 
re-release and my phone keeps on going
off<00:02:58.010> my<00:02:58.219> apologies<00:02:58.669> it's<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.780> re-release<00:03:00.349> of

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
off my apologies it's the re-release of

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.159 
off my apologies it's the re-release of
the<00:03:01.370> Fox<00:03:01.790> its<00:03:02.180> kind<00:03:02.419> of<00:03:02.480> essentially<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.019> same

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:03.169 
the Fox its kind of essentially the same

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:07.659 
the Fox its kind of essentially the same
thing<00:03:04.209> with<00:03:05.209> a<00:03:05.239> few<00:03:05.780> small<00:03:06.500> upgrades<00:03:07.400> that

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:07.669 
thing with a few small upgrades that

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:09.909 
thing with a few small upgrades that
like<00:03:08.120> I<00:03:08.239> think<00:03:08.450> it<00:03:08.510> has<00:03:08.569> dog<00:03:08.810> bones<00:03:09.049> is<00:03:09.319> on<00:03:09.469> all

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:09.919 
like I think it has dog bones is on all

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:14.229 
like I think it has dog bones is on all
the<00:03:09.980> difference<00:03:10.489> but<00:03:12.430> yeah<00:03:13.430> which<00:03:13.909> makes<00:03:14.150> it

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
the difference but yeah which makes it

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.729 
the difference but yeah which makes it
cool<00:03:14.480> because<00:03:14.629> now<00:03:15.290> you're<00:03:15.439> going<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.620> be<00:03:15.709> able

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
cool because now you're going to be able

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.339 
cool because now you're going to be able
to<00:03:15.919> get<00:03:16.069> parts<00:03:17.030> for<00:03:17.569> the<00:03:17.720> Fox<00:03:17.959> where<00:03:18.260> you

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
to get parts for the Fox where you

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.619 
to get parts for the Fox where you
haven't<00:03:18.799> been<00:03:18.859> able<00:03:18.979> to<00:03:19.069> get<00:03:19.190> them<00:03:19.370> for<00:03:19.970> 20

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629 
haven't been able to get them for 20

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.399 
haven't been able to get them for 20
years<00:03:20.900> so<00:03:21.489> you<00:03:22.489> know<00:03:22.519> that<00:03:23.329> makes<00:03:23.540> it<00:03:23.750> kind<00:03:24.349> of

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:24.409 
years so you know that makes it kind of

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:26.199 
years so you know that makes it kind of
to<00:03:24.680> me<00:03:24.859> it<00:03:25.159> makes<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.459> value<00:03:25.760> go<00:03:25.879> up<00:03:26.060> because

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
to me it makes the value go up because

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.640 
to me it makes the value go up because
you<00:03:26.690> don't<00:03:26.840> have<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:26.989> worry<00:03:27.229> about<00:03:27.319> it<00:03:27.530> if<00:03:27.590> you

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
you don't have to worry about it if you

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.729 
you don't have to worry about it if you
ever<00:03:27.829> run<00:03:28.129> this<00:03:28.449> you<00:03:29.449> know<00:03:29.599> you<00:03:29.870> don't<00:03:30.019> have<00:03:30.409> to

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
ever run this you know you don't have to

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:31.839 
ever run this you know you don't have to
worry<00:03:30.889> about<00:03:30.949> if<00:03:31.099> you<00:03:31.189> break<00:03:31.340> apart<00:03:31.669> it's

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
worry about if you break apart it's

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.789 
worry about if you break apart it's
almost<00:03:32.060> impossible<00:03:32.359> to<00:03:32.629> find<00:03:32.930> that's<00:03:33.560> kind<00:03:33.769> of

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
almost impossible to find that's kind of

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.119
