00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.479
 football

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:46.149

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.269
 to always have a nice smile like 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.960
 that of soccer for example dai 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:09.910
 show him and this tooth where he is 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.680
 'd end fell first is good 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.160
 just what I need for the first one 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.580
 lesson 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.760
 here guys this is a tooth but 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:22.060
 let's look more closely 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.170
 here you see the dante is composed of 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.950
 two parts 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.050
 above is the crown and below the root 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.410
 this pink part is the gum instead 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.540
 it serves to protect the root but 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.870
 you know what's inside a tooth 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.850
 now we show you here is the 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:44.040
 partner the outer coating of the tooth 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.390
 it's called nail polish is very strong and shiny 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.659
 just below the enamel we find the 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.730
 dentine is less hard than enamel e 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.120
 protects this pink part that is called 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:58.180
 pulp you know how the vitamin pulp is made 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.570
 yes yes the flesh is soft and fragile 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.159
 sensitive but it is very important because 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.350
 contains the blood that circulates in 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.289
 small arteries and veins and brings to life the 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.629
 feels inside the pulp we also find 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.959
 many small nerves that serve to 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.829
 make us feel the cold and the heat 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.870
 ache 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:18.909
 just like it happened to soccer first 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.079
 when the door in his face ended 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:26.109
 memories soccer i believe them that pain 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:28.870
 never heard the teeth through the nerves 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:31.420
 all together they form the teeth that 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.909
 it is divided into upper teeth ie 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.389
 the upper one and lower teeth 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:40.510
 that is the bottom one the boys have 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:42.999
 about ten teeth in 8 and 10 at the bottom 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.739
 the teeth of adults are more 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:48.219
 large tapeworm in total 32 in the next 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.290
 lesson 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:52.599
 we'll explain why you guys fall 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.329
 the teeth and why the adults have 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:58.150
 larger and more numerous teeth but in the meantime 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.980
 I recommend you remember to wash me 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:05.639
 teeth and to understand the door e 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.639
 on the use of color
