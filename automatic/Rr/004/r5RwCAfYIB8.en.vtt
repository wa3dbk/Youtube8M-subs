alright skyscraper looks pretty good
looks<00:01:26.630> like<00:01:26.750> about<00:01:26.840> five<00:01:27.170> and<00:01:27.350> a<00:01:27.409> quarter<00:01:27.590> of

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
looks like about five and a quarter of

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.960 
looks like about five and a quarter of
the<00:01:27.830> wheels<00:01:28.010> it's<00:01:28.220> a<00:01:28.310> serious<00:01:28.670> amount<00:01:28.850> of

alright so we just got the car off the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.070 
alright so we just got the car off the
dyno<00:01:35.060> and<00:01:35.240> of<00:01:35.450> course<00:01:35.630> we're<00:01:35.750> going<00:01:35.869> to<00:01:35.930> take<00:01:36.020> a

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
dyno and of course we're going to take a

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.230 
dyno and of course we're going to take a
look<00:01:36.229> at<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:36.409> system<00:01:36.590> design<00:01:37.090> part<00:01:38.090> of<00:01:38.149> the

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
look at the system design part of the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.940 
look at the system design part of the
exhaust<00:01:38.509> design<00:01:38.840> is<00:01:38.930> obviously<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:39.290> tube<00:01:39.530> we

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
exhaust design is obviously the tube we

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.580 
exhaust design is obviously the tube we
went<00:01:40.070> with<00:01:40.250> a<00:01:40.280> three-inch<00:01:40.670> system<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:42.170> x-pipe

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
went with a three-inch system the x-pipe

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.859 
went with a three-inch system the x-pipe
and<00:01:42.920> of<00:01:43.280> course<00:01:43.310> some<00:01:43.729> of<00:01:43.790> our<00:01:44.030> five<00:01:44.659> by<00:01:44.840> eight

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
and of course some of our five by eight

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.020 
and of course some of our five by eight
straight<00:01:45.350> through<00:01:45.530> mufflers<00:01:46.030> the

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
straight through mufflers the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.090 
straight through mufflers the
combination<00:01:47.600> of<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.960> old<00:01:48.440> components<00:01:48.979> gave

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
combination of the old components gave

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.350 
combination of the old components gave
us<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.340> sound<00:01:49.550> we<00:01:49.700> wanted<00:01:49.940> but<00:01:50.090> more

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
us the sound we wanted but more

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.669 
us the sound we wanted but more
importantly<00:01:50.780> it<00:01:51.050> gave<00:01:51.229> us<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.410> overall

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
importantly it gave us the overall

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:53.830 
importantly it gave us the overall
performance<00:01:52.000> in<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:53.090> actual<00:01:53.270> placement<00:01:53.570> one

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
performance in the actual placement one

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.910 
performance in the actual placement one
of<00:01:53.929> the<00:01:53.990> things<00:01:54.140> you<00:01:54.259> can<00:01:54.380> notice<00:01:54.560> here<00:01:54.679> and

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
of the things you can notice here and

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.080 
of the things you can notice here and
this<00:01:54.979> is<00:01:55.039> something<00:01:55.369> you<00:01:55.429> can<00:01:55.550> see<00:01:55.580> after

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
this is something you can see after

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.969 
this is something you can see after

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
be allowed to sound right so we went

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.800 
be allowed to sound right so we went
with<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.730> big<00:02:41.880> stuff<00:02:42.090> here<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.480> make<00:02:42.600> sure<00:02:42.720> we

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
with the big stuff here to make sure we

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.970 
with the big stuff here to make sure we

could deliver all that power and that

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:54.410 
could deliver all that power and that
sound<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.340> need
