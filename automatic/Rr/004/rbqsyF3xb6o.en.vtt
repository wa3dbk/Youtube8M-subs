00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.259
 good day because this time I 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:07.299
 I would like to present to you a 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:11.289
 pretty pretty alternative 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:15.609
 interesting that it helps us to tie 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:19.060
 our model with the use of ipad to 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:22.390
 through an application for decision 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.300
 specific notes this application will 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.759
 call evernote and I like to introduce them 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:32.579
 because it's a bit of an application 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:35.460
 different from the others in the sense of 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.129
 Well, let's say it's not just 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.390
 in the note-taking part with many 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.940
 others 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.670
 even in applications that already brings 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.950
 by default of the ipad as is the one of the pad 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.920
 note taking notes this 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.530
 application in specific evernote has 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.110
 also the peculiarity that not 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:00.540
 it's just an application that serves 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.150
 for the ipad but 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:07.180
 It can be used by other tablets 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:10.090
 and even allows it to be used by 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.920
 in browsers in that sense I do not know 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.550
 if you know this term of way 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.210
 out in the ground device then the 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.210
 application 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.490
 evernote can be used in one in a 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.200
 endless platforms and in endless 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.690
 images even through the 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.850
 computer can perform a 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.070
 first 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.909
 before moving on to how it can be tied 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.130
 already directly with the model in the idea 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:40.330
 of pedagogical practices in the 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.090
 6 cornell or 6r system for the taking of 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.799
 notes of 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.619
 of the practices that institutions 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.960
 want to show you this page 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:53.880
 specifically if you enter the people 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.189
 here and like to see them is already written a 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.960
 justification for the use of evernote and its 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.539
 advantages to collect evaluate and 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.850
 analyze the information a very article 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.310
 interesting that you allow them to see 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.959
 the possibilities that evernote has in 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.549
 Compared to other types of 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:15.390
 applications that allow us taking 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:18.239
 notes and in this same article comes 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.299
 here some tutorials that allow them 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.940
 see the possibilities of seeing it not 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.010
 specific I tell you for all 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.620
 those who are coordinators that I 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.860
 For example, he used this application to 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.829
 do all my newspaper takes of 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.990
 field when I visit schools and other 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:41.440
 then here for example 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.880
 the good week I already know when Thursday 20 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.990
 September and two weeks ago 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.569
 I was at school, know that there 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.749
 monterrey 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:55.260
 I had the opportunity to see to participate 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:58.290
 in a mystical talk with my 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.909
 suggestion and good in it he talked 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.099
 about the year of faith and all of that and 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:04.920
 here I can eat my notes and if you 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.439
 account the notes here I added a 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.920
 photography and absolutely nothing happens 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:12.599
 I can be taking writing and I can 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.700
 take a photograph directly from the 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.129
 goal of the iphone or any tablet and 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.290
 they are incorporated has many things 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.689
 interesting that I will not vote in this 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.549
 chance but I'm going to make two videos 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:26.400
 to explain specifically this 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:29.099
 evernote one of them is the possibility 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:34.349
 that if you take a picture 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:36.480
 about something that is let's say let's say 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:40.019
 not printed if for example you will 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.520
 take pictures of this book not in 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.680
 specific 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:50.010
 and what it is going to allow to do is that it is going to 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.680
 read each of the characters and if 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.300
 you click on york the room is what 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.400
 put as a search after a while 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.770
 will allow you to also look for 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.200
 good images the next text 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.940
 printed on the images as well as that 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.160
 has many other functionalities are 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.470
 very useful as for example also the 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.720
 possibility that I can share 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.120
 my notes and then you can 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.490
 ask for example to your students that 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.709
 the notes that you are taking from your class 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.020
 they are shared directly with 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.000
 teachers for you as a teacher and you 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:24.480
 you can go there seeing for example as the 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.640
 student is building his notes not in 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.770
 Real time you can be monitoring 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.430
 the student's progress you do not need 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.030
 ask him 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.740
 the notebook to be able to monitor it 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.870
 the file that I sent him but you 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.710
 you can access at the time you want 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:45.610
 this is a first let's say shows how 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.620
 to be able to cause interest in 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.410
 this interesting application and the 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.080
 next time specifically I'll talk 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.200
 of its use and its link directly with 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.790
 the method that we have for the 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.790
 take notes thank you very much
