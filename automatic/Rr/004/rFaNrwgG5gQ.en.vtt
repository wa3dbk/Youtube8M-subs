but<00:01:03.030> with<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.680> now<00:01:05.869> we<00:01:06.869> basically<00:01:07.770> might<00:01:08.159> if

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
but with this now we basically might if

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.880 
but with this now we basically might if
it<00:01:09.119> if<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.960> deal<00:01:10.110> with<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> show<00:01:10.590> as<00:01:10.740> well

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
it if it's to deal with the show as well

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.609 
it if it's to deal with the show as well
then<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.369> do<00:01:11.549> know<00:01:11.729> who<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.180> because<00:01:13.110> Ronin

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
then we do know who it is because Ronin

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.780 
then we do know who it is because Ronin
is<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.130> set<00:01:14.630> but<00:01:15.830> if<00:01:16.830> he's<00:01:17.009> gonna<00:01:17.159> set<00:01:17.520> I'm

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
is in a set but if he's gonna set I'm

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.090 
is in a set but if he's gonna set I'm
having<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.299> feeling<00:01:18.509> he<00:01:19.409> will<00:01:19.530> be<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.830> show

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
having a feeling he will be in the show

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.420 
having a feeling he will be in the show
um<00:01:21.080> I'm<00:01:22.080> almost<00:01:22.259> positive<00:01:22.530> he's<00:01:22.979> gonna<00:01:23.189> end<00:01:23.369> up

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
um I'm almost positive he's gonna end up

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.719 
um I'm almost positive he's gonna end up
in<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> show<00:01:24.140> because<00:01:25.140> he's<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.189> set<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.610> I

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
in the show because he's in a set and I

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.039 
in the show because he's in a set and I
don't<00:01:26.880> think<00:01:27.030> they<00:01:27.119> would<00:01:27.270> put<00:01:27.450> him<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.750> set

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
don't think they would put him in a set

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.819 
don't think they would put him in a set
without<00:01:29.009> him<00:01:29.280> being<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.759> show<00:01:30.259> so<00:01:31.259> Ronin

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
without him being in the show so Ronin

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.550 
without him being in the show so Ronin
looks<00:01:32.009> like<00:01:32.189> he<00:01:32.369> might<00:01:32.579> be<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.990> show<00:01:34.350> as

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
looks like he might be in the show as

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.710 
looks like he might be in the show as
well<00:01:35.960> so<00:01:37.070> in<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.369> game<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.790> said<00:01:39.030> Ronin<00:01:39.540> was

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
well so in the game it said Ronin was

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.240 
well so in the game it said Ronin was
the<00:01:39.840> one<00:01:39.990> who<00:01:40.110> brought<00:01:40.490> Zane<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:42.060> Chen<00:01:43.070> so<00:01:44.070> that

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
the one who brought Zane to Chen so that

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.249 
the one who brought Zane to Chen so that
means<00:01:44.430> he<00:01:44.520> also<00:01:44.640> brought<00:01:45.000> pixel<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.630> Chen<00:01:45.869> and

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259

fighting ghosts in this set so it's a
very<00:03:27.599> very<00:03:27.900> confusing<00:03:28.410> thing<00:03:29.419> maybe<00:03:30.419> there

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
very very confusing thing maybe there

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:31.939 
very very confusing thing maybe there
would<00:03:30.720> be<00:03:30.750> some<00:03:30.870> more<00:03:31.109> explanations

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:31.949 
would be some more explanations

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:33.530 
would be some more explanations

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
beginning in the next season

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.710 
beginning in the next season

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
maybe somehow he turns good or he turns

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.119 
maybe somehow he turns good or he turns
good<00:03:36.959> in<00:03:37.019> the<00:03:37.109> game<00:03:37.379> I<00:03:37.410> don't<00:03:37.859> know<00:03:38.129> yet<00:03:38.449> but
