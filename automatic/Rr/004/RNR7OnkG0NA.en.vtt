00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
kind of hard to show that I experienced

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.120 
kind of hard to show that I experienced
is<00:01:06.360> let's<00:01:06.840> say<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.140> finish<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> mission<00:01:07.860> you

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
is let's say you finish a mission you

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.950 
is let's say you finish a mission you
park<00:01:08.340> your<00:01:08.430> car<00:01:08.610> at<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.240> time<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.720> car<00:01:09.869> will

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
park your car at the time the car will

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.539 
park your car at the time the car will
still<00:01:10.080> be<00:01:10.200> moving<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.680> it'll<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:11.040> stop<00:01:11.310> and

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
still be moving and it'll just stop and

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.510 
still be moving and it'll just stop and
in<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.470> path<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.740> other<00:01:13.860> vehicles<00:01:14.310> in

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
in the path of the other vehicles in

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.240 
in the path of the other vehicles in
which<00:01:14.760> case<00:01:15.030> they<00:01:15.840> stop<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.920> only<00:01:17.040> way<00:01:17.189> to

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
which case they stop and the only way to

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.249 
which case they stop and the only way to
fix<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:18.030> if<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.330> Ram<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.840> with<00:01:18.960> another

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
fix that is if you Ram it with another

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.170 
fix that is if you Ram it with another
vehicle<00:01:19.790> because<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.820> don't<00:01:21.060> have<00:01:21.119> control

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
vehicle because you don't have control

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.789 
vehicle because you don't have control
over<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.630> vehicle<00:01:22.020> anymore<00:01:22.259> all<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.619> best

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
over that vehicle anymore all the best

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.710 
over that vehicle anymore all the best
you<00:01:22.920> can<00:01:23.070> do<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.220> Ram<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.850> other<00:01:23.970> vehicle<00:01:24.420> so

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
you can do is Ram the other vehicle so

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.810 
you can do is Ram the other vehicle so
there's<00:01:24.869> another<00:01:25.020> invisible<00:01:25.430> the<00:01:26.430> floating

all<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.509> upgrades<00:02:06.399> it's<00:02:07.399> still<00:02:07.759> you<00:02:08.239> have<00:02:08.420> to

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
all the upgrades it's still you have to

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.029 
all the upgrades it's still you have to
do<00:02:08.660> it<00:02:08.780> manually<00:02:09.110> even<00:02:09.679> with<00:02:09.830> all<00:02:09.950> the

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
do it manually even with all the

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.400 
do it manually even with all the
upgrades<00:02:10.160> which<00:02:12.040> kind<00:02:13.040> of<00:02:13.220> is<00:02:13.580> uh<00:02:14.410> stick

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
upgrades which kind of is uh stick

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.740 
upgrades which kind of is uh stick
because<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.670> point<00:02:16.910> of<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.150> upgrades<00:02:17.510> was<00:02:17.660> I

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
because the point of the upgrades was I

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.970 
because the point of the upgrades was I
wouldn't<00:02:17.959> have<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.170> do<00:02:18.530> for<00:02:18.739> that<00:02:18.830> one

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
wouldn't have to do for that one

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.900 
wouldn't have to do for that one
and<00:02:19.069> I<00:02:19.130> only<00:02:19.250> have<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.430> worry<00:02:19.549> about<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.760> other

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
and I only have to worry about the other

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.930 
and I only have to worry about the other
ones<00:02:20.560> but<00:02:21.560> because<00:02:21.860> of<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.099> because<00:02:22.610> because

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
ones but because of the because because

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.580 
ones but because of the because because
it's<00:02:23.450> a<00:02:23.510> cargo<00:02:23.870> plane<00:02:23.989> it<00:02:24.230> needs<00:02:24.410> a<00:02:24.500> special

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
it's a cargo plane it needs a special

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.199 
it's a cargo plane it needs a special
cargo<00:02:25.040> thing<00:02:25.599> which<00:02:26.830> well<00:02:27.830> it<00:02:28.130> doesn't<00:02:28.580> work

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
cargo thing which well it doesn't work

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.289 
cargo thing which well it doesn't work
because<00:02:30.170> or<00:02:30.620> it's<00:02:30.769> not<00:02:30.950> automatic<00:02:31.489> because

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
because or it's not automatic because

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:33.430 
because or it's not automatic because
you<00:02:32.420> have<00:02:32.510> to<00:02:32.599> do<00:02:32.690> it<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.079> strategy

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
you have to do it so the strategy

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.360 
you have to do it so the strategy
doesn't<00:02:33.590> work<00:02:33.829> and<00:02:34.930> it<00:02:35.930> actually<00:02:36.230> like<00:02:37.069> what<00:02:37.250> I

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
doesn't work and it actually like what I

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.190 
doesn't work and it actually like what I
said<00:02:37.640> before<00:02:37.760> they<00:02:38.360> things<00:02:38.599> need<00:02:38.780> like<00:02:38.930> a<00:02:38.959> mini

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
said before they things need like a mini

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.800 
said before they things need like a mini
game<00:02:39.440> or<00:02:39.620> whatever<00:02:39.940> that<00:02:40.940> one<00:02:41.209> actually<00:02:41.630> has

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
game or whatever that one actually has

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.550 
game or whatever that one actually has
it<00:02:42.049> just<00:02:42.799> that<00:02:43.310> one<00:02:43.989> it's<00:02:44.989> not<00:02:45.140> really<00:02:45.350> a<00:02:45.380> mini

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
it just that one it's not really a mini

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.440 
it just that one it's not really a mini
game<00:02:45.709> it's<00:02:45.890> just<00:02:45.980> lining<00:02:46.310> it<00:02:46.340> up<00:02:46.459> in<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:47.060> very

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
game it's just lining it up in a very

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.610 
game it's just lining it up in a very
specific<00:02:47.750> manner<00:02:48.170> that's<00:02:48.500> all<00:02:48.680> that<00:02:48.829> it<00:02:48.950> needs

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.959 

but<00:02:55.620> as<00:02:55.739> you<00:02:55.860> see<00:02:56.040> there's<00:02:56.280> some<00:02:56.459> floating

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:56.969 
but as you see there's some floating

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:59.030 
but as you see there's some floating
vehicles<00:02:57.390> here<00:02:57.599> that's<00:02:58.409> the<00:02:58.650> one<00:02:58.769> that<00:02:58.950> would

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
vehicles here that's the one that would

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.729 
vehicles here that's the one that would
normally<00:02:59.159> be<00:02:59.430> used<00:02:59.579> for<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.620> thing<00:03:01.620> I'm

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
normally be used for the thing I'm

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:08.750 
normally be used for the thing I'm
talking<00:03:01.920> about<00:03:02.340> trust<00:03:02.939> me<00:03:04.700> trust<00:03:05.700> me<00:03:07.760> right

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
talking about trust me trust me right

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.390 
talking about trust me trust me right
now<00:03:08.909> everything<00:03:09.329> is<00:03:09.420> mostly<00:03:09.959> automatic<00:03:10.620> you

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
now everything is mostly automatic you

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.440 
now everything is mostly automatic you
know<00:03:11.519> I<00:03:11.549> still<00:03:11.939> do<00:03:12.269> something<00:03:13.879> yeah<00:03:14.879> I<00:03:15.000> kind<00:03:15.390> of

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
know I still do something yeah I kind of

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.339 
know I still do something yeah I kind of
suck<00:03:15.689> sometimes

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
suck sometimes

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.949 
suck sometimes
you<00:03:16.409> see<00:03:16.739> what<00:03:16.859> they're<00:03:16.950> doing<00:03:17.599> they<00:03:18.599> drive<00:03:18.810> at

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
you see what they're doing they drive at

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.670 
you see what they're doing they drive at
a<00:03:19.019> snail's<00:03:19.260> pace<00:03:21.019> absolute<00:03:22.019> snail's<00:03:22.290> pace<00:03:22.379> and

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
a snail's pace absolute snail's pace and

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.569 
a snail's pace absolute snail's pace and
I'm<00:03:22.769> assuming<00:03:22.950> if<00:03:23.189> you<00:03:23.250> get<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.370> higher<00:03:23.549> level

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
I'm assuming if you get a higher level

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.270 
I'm assuming if you get a higher level
they<00:03:23.969> dry<00:03:24.150> faster<00:03:24.319> that<00:03:25.319> makes<00:03:25.560> absolutely<00:03:25.769> no

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
they dry faster that makes absolutely no

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.849 
they dry faster that makes absolutely no
sense<00:03:26.780> because<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:28.109> have<00:03:28.139> a<00:03:28.319> more<00:03:28.530> competent

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
sense because you have a more competent

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.099 
sense because you have a more competent
worker<00:03:29.250> it'll<00:03:30.030> just<00:03:30.209> go<00:03:30.299> speeding<00:03:30.720> around<00:03:30.959> the

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
worker it'll just go speeding around the

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.199 
worker it'll just go speeding around the
 airport<00:03:31.920> they<00:03:32.370> do<00:03:32.430> their<00:03:32.730> job<00:03:33.000> better

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
 airport they do their job better

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.789 
 airport they do their job better
like<00:03:33.689> instead<00:03:33.930> of<00:03:34.019> taking<00:03:34.319> ten<00:03:34.470> minutes<00:03:34.500> to

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
like instead of taking ten minutes to

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.770 
like instead of taking ten minutes to
clean<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.069> plane<00:03:35.280> they<00:03:35.489> take<00:03:35.669> five<00:03:35.939> it's<00:03:36.569> not

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
clean the plane they take five it's not

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.379 
clean the plane they take five it's not
that<00:03:36.930> take<00:03:37.139> some<00:03:37.459> less<00:03:38.459> time<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:38.879> get<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.269> the

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
that take some less time to get to the

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:40.610 
that take some less time to get to the
plane<00:03:39.599> because<00:03:39.870> they're<00:03:40.139> eating

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
plane because they're eating

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.379 
plane because they're eating
everywhere<00:03:41.129> I<00:03:41.400> mean<00:03:41.669> just<00:03:41.819> because<00:03:42.090> if<00:03:42.209> a<00:03:42.269> new

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
everywhere I mean just because if a new

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.240 
everywhere I mean just because if a new
worker<00:03:42.689> doesn't<00:03:42.840> mean<00:03:43.019> they<00:03:43.109> drive<00:03:43.439> it<00:03:43.680> one

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
worker doesn't mean they drive it one

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.809 
worker doesn't mean they drive it one
mile<00:03:44.519> per<00:03:44.549> hour<00:03:45.019> you<00:03:46.019> know<00:03:46.400> makes<00:03:47.400> no<00:03:47.579> sense

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
mile per hour you know makes no sense

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.759 
mile per hour you know makes no sense
and<00:03:48.120> here<00:03:48.389> this<00:03:49.049> guy<00:03:49.200> he's<00:03:49.409> supposed<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.650> go

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
and here this guy he's supposed to go

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.309 
and here this guy he's supposed to go
there<00:03:49.919> and<00:03:50.639> it's<00:03:51.389> like<00:03:51.480> where<00:03:51.659> is<00:03:51.750> he<00:03:51.840> going<00:03:51.989> oh

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
there and it's like where is he going oh

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.589 
there and it's like where is he going oh
now<00:03:53.159> he's<00:03:53.370> turning<00:03:53.669> it's<00:03:54.030> just<00:03:54.269> like<00:03:54.389> there

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
now he's turning it's just like there

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.520 
now he's turning it's just like there
pathfinding<00:03:55.530> is<00:03:55.680> so<00:03:55.950> ugly

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
pathfinding is so ugly

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.500 
pathfinding is so ugly
this<00:03:58.530> guy's<00:03:58.739> like<00:03:59.639> taking<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.030> widest

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
this guy's like taking the widest

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:08.450 
this guy's like taking the widest
 turn<00:04:01.079> ever

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:14.040 

and<00:04:09.460> sometimes<00:04:10.270> the<00:04:10.390> vehicles<00:04:10.720> get<00:04:10.840> stuck<00:04:13.050> and

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
and sometimes the vehicles get stuck and

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.780 
and sometimes the vehicles get stuck and
the<00:04:14.350> only<00:04:14.470> fix<00:04:14.770> event<00:04:15.040> is<00:04:15.130> hit<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.400> restart

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
the only fix event is hit and restart

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.500
