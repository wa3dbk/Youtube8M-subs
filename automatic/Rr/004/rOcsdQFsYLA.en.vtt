getting married with that case I thought

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.030 
getting married with that case I thought
that's<00:02:52.930> kind<00:02:53.019> of<00:02:53.200> where<00:02:53.350> I<00:02:53.380> noticed<00:02:53.799> that<00:02:53.950> it

much I love watermelons I needed to do
something<00:03:10.019> watermelon<00:03:11.019> e<00:03:11.140> so<00:03:11.860> I<00:03:12.190> saw<00:03:12.400> this<00:03:12.549> one

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.699 
something watermelon e so I saw this one
and<00:03:13.150> I<00:03:13.600> ordered<00:03:13.959> that<00:03:14.080> one<00:03:14.290> because<00:03:14.410> I<00:03:14.530> thought

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
and I ordered that one because I thought

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.020 
and I ordered that one because I thought
that<00:03:14.799> looked<00:03:14.920> really<00:03:15.160> cool<00:03:15.370> and<00:03:15.610> then<00:03:15.940> the

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
that looked really cool and then the

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.400 
that looked really cool and then the
last<00:03:16.150> one<00:03:16.330> is<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.600> one<00:03:16.750> that's<00:03:16.870> actually<00:03:17.230> on

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
last one is the one that's actually on

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.259 
last one is the one that's actually on
my<00:03:17.440> phone<00:03:17.859> and<00:03:17.890> this<00:03:18.190> is<00:03:18.459> from<00:03:18.820> a<00:03:19.000> different

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
my phone and this is from a different

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.960 
my phone and this is from a different
collection<00:03:19.690> that<00:03:20.620> they've<00:03:20.799> got<00:03:21.070> on<00:03:21.310> case<00:03:21.609> tify

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
collection that they've got on case tify

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.380 
collection that they've got on case tify
so<00:03:22.480> this<00:03:22.840> one<00:03:23.370> is<00:03:24.370> part<00:03:24.700> of<00:03:24.790> their<00:03:25.060> I<00:03:25.090> think

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
so this one is part of their I think

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.449 
so this one is part of their I think
that's<00:03:25.570> called<00:03:25.810> meta<00:03:26.290> luxe<00:03:26.680> or<00:03:26.920> something<00:03:27.310> and

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
that's called meta luxe or something and

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.699 
that's called meta luxe or something and
you<00:03:27.910> can<00:03:28.090> have<00:03:28.299> a<00:03:28.540> different<00:03:28.989> metal<00:03:29.470> part

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
you can have a different metal part

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.560 
you can have a different metal part
around<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.459> camera<00:03:30.850> so<00:03:31.060> I've<00:03:31.180> got<00:03:31.359> a<00:03:31.390> rose

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
around the camera so I've got a rose

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.199 
around the camera so I've got a rose
gold<00:03:31.870> one<00:03:32.049> you<00:03:32.170> can<00:03:32.290> get<00:03:32.440> a<00:03:32.470> silver<00:03:32.980> one

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
gold one you can get a silver one

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.190 
gold one you can get a silver one
there's<00:03:34.209> three<00:03:34.480> different<00:03:34.570> choices<00:03:34.840> you<00:03:35.109> can

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
there's three different choices you can

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.229 
there's three different choices you can
have<00:03:35.380> and<00:03:35.650> then<00:03:36.040> basically<00:03:36.190> it's<00:03:36.760> just<00:03:36.880> got

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
have and then basically it's just got

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.569 
have and then basically it's just got
more<00:03:37.420> of<00:03:37.480> a<00:03:37.780> border<00:03:38.350> all<00:03:38.769> around<00:03:38.829> the<00:03:39.459> edge

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
more of a border all around the edge

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.819 
more of a border all around the edge
compared<00:03:40.510> to<00:03:40.570> these<00:03:40.870> so<00:03:41.320> this<00:03:41.470> one's<00:03:41.650> a<00:03:41.709> bit

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
compared to these so this one's a bit

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.110 
compared to these so this one's a bit
more<00:03:41.980> reinforce<00:03:42.579> and<00:03:42.730> has<00:03:42.880> a<00:03:42.910> bit<00:03:43.090> more

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
more reinforce and has a bit more

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.330 
more reinforce and has a bit more
protection<00:03:43.420> just<00:03:44.380> around<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.739> edging<00:03:45.070> here

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
protection just around the edging here

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.580 
protection just around the edging here
and<00:03:45.640> then<00:03:46.060> it's<00:03:46.329> a<00:03:46.540> marble<00:03:47.019> effect<00:03:47.079> because

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
and then it's a marble effect because

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.680 
and then it's a marble effect because
I'm<00:03:47.829> just<00:03:48.130> obsessed<00:03:48.489> with<00:03:48.850> marvel<00:03:49.359> at<00:03:49.570> the
