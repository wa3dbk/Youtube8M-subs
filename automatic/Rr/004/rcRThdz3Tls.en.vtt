00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.350 
nice and cushy um has some good faces
here<00:01:53.270> along<00:01:54.079> the<00:01:54.229> bottom<00:01:54.439> and<00:01:55.090> it's<00:01:56.090> it's

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
here along the bottom and it's it's

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.169 
here along the bottom and it's it's
pretty<00:01:56.959> pretty<00:01:57.829> low<00:01:58.099> which<00:01:58.729> would<00:01:58.909> be<00:01:59.060> I<00:01:59.090> think

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
pretty pretty low which would be I think

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.080 
pretty pretty low which would be I think
ideal<00:01:59.869> for<00:02:00.170> maybe<00:02:00.319> like<00:02:00.439> some<00:02:00.859> USD<00:02:01.369> or<00:02:01.520> ms<00:02:01.819> used

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
ideal for maybe like some USD or ms used

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.240 
ideal for maybe like some USD or ms used
to<00:02:02.209> kind<00:02:02.420> of<00:02:02.479> round<00:02:02.629> about<00:02:03.109> on<00:02:03.379> it<00:02:03.560> probably

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
to kind of round about on it probably

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.709 
to kind of round about on it probably
get<00:02:04.340> their<00:02:04.489> own<00:02:04.579> SD<00:02:04.969> on<00:02:05.090> here<00:02:05.270> too<00:02:05.450> we<00:02:05.599> go

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
get their own SD on here too we go

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.599 
get their own SD on here too we go
hallowed<00:02:06.049> be<00:02:06.170> he<00:02:06.590> or<00:02:06.649> she<00:02:06.709> will<00:02:06.890> probably<00:02:07.159> be

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609 
hallowed be he or she will probably be

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:10.719 
hallowed be he or she will probably be
the<00:02:07.729> only<00:02:07.789> one<00:02:08.179> that<00:02:08.209> will<00:02:08.509> be<00:02:08.629> on<00:02:08.750> this<00:02:09.700> so<00:02:10.700> I

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
the only one that will be on this so I

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.970 
the only one that will be on this so I
thought<00:02:10.879> this<00:02:11.030> was<00:02:11.209> really<00:02:11.599> really<00:02:11.840> nice<00:02:12.109> if

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
thought this was really really nice if

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.280 
thought this was really really nice if

right here are the water fresh crows and

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.940 
right here are the water fresh crows and
just<00:04:46.580> a<00:04:46.670> go<00:04:46.850> round<00:04:47.060> of<00:04:47.240> Nicholas<00:04:47.720> she<00:04:48.680> was<00:04:48.770> like

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
just a go round of Nicholas she was like

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.540 
just a go round of Nicholas she was like
a<00:04:49.010> wire<00:04:49.340> for<00:04:49.730> this<00:04:49.880> one<00:04:50.150> so<00:04:51.430> it's<00:04:52.430> got

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
a wire for this one so it's got

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.460 
a wire for this one so it's got
stiffness<00:04:53.150> to<00:04:53.450> it<00:04:53.570> so<00:04:53.720> that<00:04:53.750> way<00:04:53.990> you<00:04:54.050> can<00:04:54.320> go

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
stiffness to it so that way you can go

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:55.810 
stiffness to it so that way you can go
ahead<00:04:54.560> and<00:04:54.680> use<00:04:54.890> it<00:04:55.040> up<00:04:55.160> I'm<00:04:55.340> assuming<00:04:55.730> the

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
ahead and use it up I'm assuming the

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.580 
ahead and use it up I'm assuming the
second<00:04:56.120> sugar<00:04:56.480> which<00:04:57.170> I<00:04:57.260> think<00:04:57.440> would<00:04:57.530> look

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
second sugar which I think would look

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.000 
second sugar which I think would look
really<00:04:57.980> nice<00:04:58.220> I<00:04:58.750> think<00:04:59.750> this<00:05:00.200> would<00:05:00.560> be<00:05:00.740> more

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
really nice I think this would be more

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.060 
really nice I think this would be more
