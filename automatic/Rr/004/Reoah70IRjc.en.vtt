I love the wheel it just looks so
amazing<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:35.310> also<00:02:36.150> like<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.780> performance<00:02:37.500> tip

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
amazing I also like the performance tip

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.039 
amazing I also like the performance tip
and<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:37.980> spin<00:02:38.280> track<00:02:38.610> it's<00:02:38.880> kind<00:02:39.060> of<00:02:39.090> like<00:02:39.269> the

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
and the spin track it's kind of like the

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.809 
and the spin track it's kind of like the
spin<00:02:40.290> track<00:02:40.470> is<00:02:40.590> kind<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:41.100> like<00:02:41.250> down<00:02:41.430> force

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
spin track is kind of like down force

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.400 
spin track is kind of like down force
but<00:02:42.090> kind<00:02:42.959> of<00:02:43.080> not<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:44.510> bottom<00:02:45.510> the

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
but kind of not the bottom the

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.170 
but kind of not the bottom the
performance<00:02:46.920> tip<00:02:47.100> it's<00:02:47.280> kind<00:02:47.489> of<00:02:47.519> loose<00:02:47.760> which

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
performance tip it's kind of loose which

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.920 
performance tip it's kind of loose which
is<00:02:48.360> I'm<00:02:48.690> guessing<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.530> gives<00:02:49.739> it<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:50.630> good<00:02:51.630> spin

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930
