because<00:00:15.750> in<00:00:16.529> some<00:00:17.310> sense<00:00:17.550> most<00:00:18.029> winning

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
because in some sense most winning

double<00:00:22.170> attacks<00:00:22.640> think<00:00:23.640> about<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.000> way

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
double attacks think about it this way

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.630 
double attacks think about it this way
if<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.480> make<00:00:24.689> one<00:00:24.720> threat<00:00:25.350> at<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.619> time<00:00:25.949> you

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
if I make one threat at a time you

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.550 
if I make one threat at a time you
should<00:00:26.849> usually<00:00:27.119> be<00:00:27.390> able<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.869> discern<00:00:28.260> what

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
should usually be able to discern what

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.800 
should usually be able to discern what
I'm<00:00:28.650> trying<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.070> do<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.519> then<00:00:30.029> defend<00:00:30.420> against

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
I'm trying to do and then defend against

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.620 
I'm trying to do and then defend against
it<00:00:30.929> but<00:00:31.830> if<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:32.040> make<00:00:32.250> two<00:00:32.550> attacks<00:00:32.940> at<00:00:33.180> once<00:00:33.390> or

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
it but if I make two attacks at once or

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.110 
it but if I make two attacks at once or
let's<00:00:34.469> say<00:00:34.590> three<00:00:34.920> attacks<00:00:35.280> at<00:00:35.489> once<00:00:35.730> which<00:00:36.090> is

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
let's say three attacks at once which is

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.209 
let's say three attacks at once which is
harder<00:00:36.840> but<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.050> triple<00:00:37.469> threat<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.829> some<00:00:37.980> kind

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
harder but a triple threat of some kind

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.180 
harder but a triple threat of some kind
it<00:00:38.640> becomes<00:00:39.570> increasingly<00:00:40.170> unlikely<00:00:40.710> that

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
it becomes increasingly unlikely that

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.000 
it becomes increasingly unlikely that
you<00:00:41.309> have<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> move<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.180> actually<00:00:42.860> deals<00:00:43.860> with

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
you have a move that actually deals with

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.510 
you have a move that actually deals with
both<00:00:44.430> threats<00:00:44.789> right<00:00:45.739> anyway<00:00:46.739> let's<00:00:47.219> not<00:00:47.309> get

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
both threats right anyway let's not get

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.010 
both threats right anyway let's not get
ahead<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.730> ourselves<00:00:47.850> let's<00:00:48.420> define<00:00:48.840> the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
ahead of ourselves let's define the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.479 
ahead of ourselves let's define the
double<00:00:49.320> attack<00:00:49.530> let's<00:00:49.829> make<00:00:50.010> sure<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.370> you

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
double attack let's make sure that you

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.060 
double attack let's make sure that you
know<00:00:50.670> what<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.620> see<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:52.739> my<00:00:52.860> position

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
know what it is so see on my position

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.330 
know what it is so see on my position
here<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:55.050> position<00:00:55.289> if<00:00:55.649> white<00:00:55.890> plays<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
here in this position if white plays the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.310 
here in this position if white plays the
move<00:00:56.520> e5<00:00:57.410> that<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:59.219> double<00:01:00.120> attack<00:01:00.449> there's

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
move e5 that is a double attack there's

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.319 
move e5 that is a double attack there's
a<00:01:01.410> threat<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.949> take<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.280> pawn<00:01:02.489> or<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:03.000> take<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
a threat to take the pawn or to take the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.230 
a threat to take the pawn or to take the
knight<00:01:03.510> now<00:01:03.890> this<00:01:04.890> isn't<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.400> winning<00:01:05.939> double

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
knight now this isn't a winning double

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.240 
knight now this isn't a winning double
attack<00:01:06.479> but<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> double<00:01:07.500> attack<00:01:07.590> it's

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
attack but it is a double attack it's

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.980 
attack but it is a double attack it's
not<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.490> double<00:01:08.909> attack<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.510> wins<00:01:09.659> because

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
not a double attack that wins because

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.840 
not a double attack that wins because
you<00:01:10.200> know<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.439> threat<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.830> trade<00:01:11.100> pawns<00:01:11.400> isn't

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
you know the threat to trade pawns isn't

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.060 
you know the threat to trade pawns isn't
really<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.090> threat<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.560> black<00:01:13.799> cares

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
really a threat that the black cares

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.039 
really a threat that the black cares
about<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.119> an<00:01:15.330> example<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.840> move

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
about but this is an example of a move

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.330 
about but this is an example of a move
that<00:01:16.320> attacks<00:01:16.619> two<00:01:16.830> things<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.280> that's

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
that attacks two things and that's

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.100 
that attacks two things and that's
classic<00:01:17.909> for<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> double<00:01:18.360> attack<00:01:18.600> now<00:01:18.869> let<00:01:19.020> me

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
classic for a double attack now let me

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.950 
classic for a double attack now let me
quickly<00:01:19.549> show<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.580> what<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:21.150> not<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> double

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
quickly show you what is not a double

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.670 
quickly show you what is not a double
attack<00:01:23.000> this<00:01:24.000> famous

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
attack this famous

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.899 
attack this famous
bad<00:01:25.680> opening<00:01:26.570> white<00:01:27.770> threatens<00:01:28.770> f7<00:01:29.520> with<00:01:29.670> two

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
bad opening white threatens f7 with two

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.990 
bad opening white threatens f7 with two
pieces<00:01:30.530> right<00:01:31.530> which<00:01:31.740> would<00:01:31.950> be<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.369> form<00:01:32.820> of

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
pieces right which would be a form of

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.319 
pieces right which would be a form of
checkmate<00:01:33.990> scholars<00:01:34.710> made<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:36.000> not<00:01:36.299> a

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
checkmate scholars made this is not a

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.940 
checkmate scholars made this is not a
double<00:01:36.689> attack<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.530> two<00:01:37.740> pieces

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
double attack this is two pieces

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.950 
double attack this is two pieces
attacking<00:01:38.610> one<00:01:38.820> thing<00:01:39.150> but<00:01:39.299> there's<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.540> single

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
attacking one thing but there's a single

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.740 
attacking one thing but there's a single
threat<00:01:40.460> so<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.850> not<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> double<00:01:42.360> attack

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
threat so this is not a double attack

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.660 
threat so this is not a double attack
this<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> coordination<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.399> pieces

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
this is a coordination of the pieces

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.910 
this is a coordination of the pieces
coordinating<00:01:45.509> pieces<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.049> great<00:01:46.350> but<00:01:46.740> it's

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
coordinating pieces is great but it's

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.289 
coordinating pieces is great but it's
not<00:01:47.070> necessarily<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.640> double<00:01:47.909> attack<00:01:48.090> there's

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
not necessarily a double attack there's

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.289 
not necessarily a double attack there's
one<00:01:48.479> threat<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.960> black<00:01:49.200> stops<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.770> easily<00:01:50.299> by

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
one threat and black stops it easily by

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.270 
one threat and black stops it easily by
chasing<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.780> Queen<00:01:52.020> back<00:01:52.170> blocking<00:01:53.159> her

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
chasing the Queen back blocking her

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.870 
chasing the Queen back blocking her
attack<00:01:53.840> okay<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.500> now<00:01:55.680> let<00:01:55.950> us<00:01:55.979> see<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.549> double

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
attack okay so now let us see the double

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.560 
attack okay so now let us see the double
attack<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.509> action<00:01:59.180> I'm<00:02:00.180> going<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.390> show<00:02:00.509> you

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570

attacks<00:04:01.750> one<00:04:02.500> of<00:04:02.590> them<00:04:02.680> is<00:04:02.799> to<00:04:02.919> capture<00:04:03.159> the

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
attacks one of them is to capture the

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.430 
attacks one of them is to capture the
attacking<00:04:03.879> piece<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.269> other<00:04:04.389> is<00:04:04.569> to<00:04:04.780> move<00:04:04.989> one

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
attacking piece the other is to move one

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.780 
attacking piece the other is to move one
of<00:04:05.560> your<00:04:05.680> pieces<00:04:05.859> where<00:04:06.220> it<00:04:06.310> makes<00:04:06.459> a<00:04:06.609> really

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
of your pieces where it makes a really

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.969 
of your pieces where it makes a really
big<00:04:06.940> threat<00:04:07.299> for<00:04:07.840> example<00:04:08.319> if<00:04:08.470> this<00:04:08.620> bishop

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:08.979 
big threat for example if this bishop

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:10.409 
big threat for example if this bishop
could<00:04:09.159> come<00:04:09.340> here<00:04:09.639> and<00:04:09.790> this<00:04:10.000> were<00:04:10.150> a<00:04:10.180> big

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
could come here and this were a big

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.930 
could come here and this were a big
threat<00:04:10.780> then<00:04:11.739> that<00:04:12.040> might<00:04:12.280> save<00:04:12.579> the<00:04:12.760> two

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
threat then that might save the two

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.309 
threat then that might save the two
white<00:04:13.150> pieces<00:04:13.419> from<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:13.840> double<00:04:14.109> attack

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
white pieces from the double attack

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.809 
white pieces from the double attack
because<00:04:14.739> if<00:04:14.859> black<00:04:15.040> takes<00:04:15.250> white<00:04:15.370> knight

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
because if black takes white knight

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.420 
because if black takes white knight
white<00:04:16.150> can<00:04:16.299> take<00:04:16.449> the<00:04:16.570> pawn<00:04:16.750> on<00:04:16.870> g7<00:04:16.900> but<00:04:17.620> here

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
white can take the pawn on g7 but here

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.830 
white can take the pawn on g7 but here
the<00:04:18.579> bishop<00:04:18.820> doesn't<00:04:19.120> really<00:04:19.299> have<00:04:19.539> any<00:04:19.690> good

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
the bishop doesn't really have any good

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.409 
the bishop doesn't really have any good
threat<00:04:20.169> to<00:04:20.320> go<00:04:20.440> make<00:04:20.650> because<00:04:21.159> this<00:04:22.029> knight<00:04:22.270> is

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
threat to go make because this knight is

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.700 
threat to go make because this knight is
defended<00:04:24.029> okay

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
defended okay

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.800 
defended okay
so<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:26.190> only<00:04:26.340> way<00:04:26.520> here<00:04:26.850> for<00:04:27.030> white<00:04:27.210> try<00:04:27.660> and

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
so the only way here for white try and

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.450 
so the only way here for white try and
pulling<00:04:28.229> the<00:04:28.320> game<00:04:28.500> is<00:04:28.650> to<00:04:28.740> capture<00:04:29.039> the<00:04:29.160> pawn

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
pulling the game is to capture the pawn

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.850 
pulling the game is to capture the pawn
with<00:04:29.490> the<00:04:29.729> bishop<00:04:30.030> now<00:04:30.600> black<00:04:30.870> makes<00:04:31.139> a<00:04:31.289> second

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
with the bishop now black makes a second

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.040 
with the bishop now black makes a second
double<00:04:32.039> attack<00:04:32.930> Queen<00:04:33.930> a5<00:04:34.259> check<00:04:35.900> attacks<00:04:36.900> the

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
double attack Queen a5 check attacks the

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.640 
double attack Queen a5 check attacks the
King<00:04:37.289> and<00:04:37.590> attacks<00:04:38.009> the<00:04:38.220> bishop<00:04:38.520> and<00:04:39.650> white

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
King and attacks the bishop and white

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.680 
King and attacks the bishop and white
could<00:04:41.039> defend<00:04:41.430> this<00:04:41.669> if<00:04:41.910> his<00:04:42.030> knight<00:04:42.270> weren't

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
could defend this if his knight weren't

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.420 
could defend this if his knight weren't
in<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:43.020> way<00:04:43.139> on<00:04:43.289> d4<00:04:43.740> and<00:04:43.919> he<00:04:44.039> could<00:04:44.220> play<00:04:44.370> his

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
in the way on d4 and he could play his

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.260 
in the way on d4 and he could play his
Bishop<00:04:44.970> to<00:04:45.470> c3<00:04:46.470> that<00:04:47.160> would<00:04:47.400> block<00:04:47.789> the<00:04:48.030> check

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
Bishop to c3 that would block the check

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.120 
Bishop to c3 that would block the check
on<00:04:48.419> the<00:04:48.539> King<00:04:48.750> and<00:04:49.020> save<00:04:49.229> the<00:04:49.380> bishop<00:04:49.680> but<00:04:49.860> here

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
on the King and save the bishop but here

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.370 
on the King and save the bishop but here
he<00:04:50.280> can't<00:04:50.639> the<00:04:51.300> best<00:04:51.509> way<00:04:51.690> I<00:04:51.720> can<00:04:51.930> do<00:04:52.050> is<00:04:52.199> to

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
he can't the best way I can do is to

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.469 
he can't the best way I can do is to
block<00:04:52.590> the<00:04:52.650> check<00:04:53.039> on<00:04:53.190> his<00:04:53.340> King<00:04:53.639> and<00:04:53.880> black

block the check on his King and black

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.900 
block the check on his King and black
captures<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:55.080> bishop<00:04:55.410> and<00:04:55.620> black<00:04:56.100> should<00:04:56.759> go

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
captures the bishop and black should go

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.529 
captures the bishop and black should go
on<00:04:57.060> to<00:04:57.720> win<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:57.990> game<00:04:58.169> pretty<00:04:58.800> easily<00:04:59.099> so<00:04:59.940> you

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
on to win the game pretty easily so you

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:04.460 
on to win the game pretty easily so you
see<00:05:00.750> here<00:05:01.199> a<00:05:01.340> double<00:05:02.479> attack<00:05:03.479> twice<00:05:04.020> in<00:05:04.199> a<00:05:04.289> row

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
see here a double attack twice in a row

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.740 
see here a double attack twice in a row
this<00:05:05.039> is<00:05:05.220> why<00:05:05.370> a<00:05:05.400> lot<00:05:05.729> of<00:05:05.759> chess<00:05:06.120> tactics<00:05:06.330> are

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.779 
this is why a lot of chess tactics are
built<00:05:07.050> on<00:05:07.349> the<00:05:07.530> double<00:05:07.830> attack<00:05:08.099> it's<00:05:08.430> the<00:05:08.580> most

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789
