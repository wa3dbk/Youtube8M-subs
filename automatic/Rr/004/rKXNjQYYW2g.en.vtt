to take with a good care of it so i can

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.580 
to take with a good care of it so i can
last<00:04:03.940> you<00:04:04.569> know<00:04:04.599> whenever<00:04:04.870> i<00:04:05.079> want<00:04:05.319> to<00:04:05.379> put<00:04:05.500> it

last you know whenever i want to put it
in<00:04:05.739> um<00:04:06.549> i<00:04:08.760> think<00:04:10.110> that<00:04:11.110> if<00:04:11.470> you<00:04:11.799> do<00:04:12.190> get<00:04:12.940> this

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
in um i think that if you do get this

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.199 
in um i think that if you do get this
hair<00:04:13.569> it<00:04:13.870> would<00:04:14.620> be<00:04:14.709> best<00:04:14.980> not<00:04:15.489> to<00:04:15.790> put<00:04:16.000> any

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
hair it would be best not to put any

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.150 
hair it would be best not to put any
product<00:04:16.720> in<00:04:16.840> it<00:04:16.959> right<00:04:17.109> away<00:04:17.229> because<00:04:17.560> it's

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
product in it right away because it's

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.159 
product in it right away because it's
not<00:04:18.489> it<00:04:18.699> does<00:04:18.910> not<00:04:18.940> need<00:04:19.329> it<00:04:19.539> for<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:19.959> curl

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
not it does not need it for the curl

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.060 
not it does not need it for the curl
pattern<00:04:20.530> like<00:04:21.090> product<00:04:22.090> just<00:04:22.270> makes<00:04:22.570> it<00:04:23.070> kind

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
pattern like product just makes it kind

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.450 
pattern like product just makes it kind
of<00:04:24.479> dry<00:04:25.479> and<00:04:26.020> that's<00:04:26.889> not<00:04:27.070> what<00:04:27.190> you<00:04:27.280> want
