amazing<00:01:28.619> guns<00:01:29.310> but<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.700> don't<00:01:29.970> know<00:01:30.060> what

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
amazing guns but I don't know what

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.270 
amazing guns but I don't know what
happened<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:31.049> sound<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.470> just<00:01:31.680> not<00:01:31.829> working<00:01:32.040> I

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
happened the sound is just not working I

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.249 
happened the sound is just not working I
think<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.790> because<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.150> didn't<00:01:33.689> add<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.869> no

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
think it's because I didn't add the no

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.890 
think it's because I didn't add the no

guess<00:05:08.950> this<00:05:09.160> should<00:05:09.190> I<00:05:09.700> don't<00:05:10.150> know<00:05:10.240> if<00:05:10.330> this

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
guess this should I don't know if this

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
guess this should I don't know if this
is<00:05:10.480> like<00:05:10.600> the<00:05:10.780> first<00:05:10.930> one<00:05:11.170> that<00:05:11.290> should<00:05:11.440> be

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
is like the first one that should be

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.830 
is like the first one that should be
open<00:05:11.770> up<00:05:11.890> for<00:05:11.980> you<00:05:12.070> guys<00:05:12.130> but<00:05:12.520> you<00:05:12.790> guys<00:05:13.690> should

tester so I play his map and oh by the

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.390 
tester so I play his map and oh by the
way<00:05:58.750> this<00:05:58.960> is<00:05:59.080> a<00:05:59.110> cool<00:05:59.350> interesting<00:05:59.860> a<00:06:00.010> vision

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
way this is a cool interesting a vision

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.760 
way this is a cool interesting a vision
that<00:06:00.430> I<00:06:00.640> might<00:06:00.880> think<00:06:01.180> of<00:06:01.300> adding<00:06:01.630> in<00:06:01.810> I<00:06:02.020> don't

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
that I might think of adding in I don't

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.110 
that I might think of adding in I don't
know<00:06:02.860> what<00:06:03.190> do<00:06:03.250> you<00:06:03.340> guys<00:06:03.400> think<00:06:03.460> about<00:06:03.820> this

it's like a more cartoony version of the

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.640 
it's like a more cartoony version of the

contrast it I guess our you know
increased<00:06:18.520> contrast<00:06:19.000> on<00:06:19.180> it<00:06:19.360> I'm<00:06:20.080> not<00:06:20.200> going

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.350 
increased contrast on it I'm not going

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.420 
increased contrast on it I'm not going
to<00:06:20.410> do<00:06:20.500> that

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
to do that

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.100 
to do that
invert<00:06:21.730> looks<00:06:21.940> badass<00:06:22.240> but<00:06:22.660> I'm<00:06:22.780> not<00:06:22.930> going<00:06:23.050> to
