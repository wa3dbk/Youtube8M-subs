rate engine we were very happy because
our<00:00:47.610> workflow<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.629> same<00:00:48.870> as<00:00:49.110> before<00:00:49.399> but

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
our workflow is the same as before but

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.779 
our workflow is the same as before but
the<00:00:50.789> opportunity<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.870> render<00:00:52.469> faster<00:00:53.340> times

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
the opportunity to render faster times

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.119 
the opportunity to render faster times
in<00:00:54.059> better<00:00:54.239> times<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.930> with<00:00:55.050> higher<00:00:55.500> quality

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
in better times and with higher quality

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.340 
in better times and with higher quality
without<00:00:56.250> leaving<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.239> main<00:00:57.420> application<00:00:58.140> I

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
without leaving the main application I

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.670 
without leaving the main application I
think<00:00:58.890> it's<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.600> maximum<00:01:00.600> we<00:01:00.960> can<00:01:01.199> have<00:01:01.500> it

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
think it's the maximum we can have it

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.450 
think it's the maximum we can have it
now<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.489> dedicate<00:01:03.090> almost<00:01:03.870> home<00:01:04.799> life<00:01:05.159> in

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
now I dedicate almost home life in

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.820 
now I dedicate almost home life in
rendering<00:01:05.939> every<00:01:06.330> day<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:07.320> as<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.650> can

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830

imagine I array just change my my way of
working<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.270> doing<00:01:12.720> renderings<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:14.250> speed

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520

that we I would like to state because
almost<00:01:20.670> every<00:01:21.150> card<00:01:21.479> it's<00:01:21.840> almost<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:23.009> power

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
almost every card it's almost the power

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.300 
almost every card it's almost the power
