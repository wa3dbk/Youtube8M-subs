00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.980
 after on the first two matches in 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.980
 taken 4 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.550
 so here it was an important match 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.550
 to regain confidence 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:01:06.260
 defensively but we work on 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:01:08.500
 works to improve I continue 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.500
 take care 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.579
 naf naf look very early I take care of 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.579
 my team and my opponent of the day 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.090
 what interests me in here 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:38.329
 today today we did a 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:39.860
 match against today what was 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.689
 important to investigate won against najran 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.979
 and then after that we are in the process of 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.000
 progress in the work 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.000
 progress in the results 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.360
 Do not forget that you can see them 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:02.229
 arrived yat a fortnight ago 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:08.899
 that's where he's been hurt since 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:11.629
 for a month and a half adil this is where 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.150
 so there is a bunch of khadr art that know 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.690
 not but kader he stayed four months 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.230
 with an injury 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.790
 so here we go and the matches will allow 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:25.430
 the adjustment to each player's 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:27.670
 progressing to become better can not 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.670
 miracles 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.569
 the star and fighters 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.790
 on what 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:59.400
 he said 6-0 at pascha skis janin is 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.240
 weak we think he said there with a 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.760
 level jacket to finish but first we 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.420
 we finally so I saw the players so 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.420
 played at their level 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.990
 so that's because we played our 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:24.720
 level so we did we did that that 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:28.160
 najran has been in trouble and the most 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.160
 it's hard to keep going
