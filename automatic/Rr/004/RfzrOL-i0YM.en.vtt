00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.549 

they<00:00:14.180> draw<00:00:14.420> the<00:00:14.480> viewers<00:00:14.840> attention<00:00:15.170> because

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:15.559 
they draw the viewers attention because

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.130 
they draw the viewers attention because
it's<00:00:15.709> just<00:00:15.920> very<00:00:16.180> very<00:00:17.180> stark<00:00:17.630> it<00:00:17.869> almost

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
it's just very very stark it almost

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.260 
it's just very very stark it almost
forms<00:00:18.529> a<00:00:18.619> line<00:00:18.920> is<00:00:19.250> what<00:00:19.430> it<00:00:19.520> does<00:00:19.730> and<00:00:20.060> by

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
forms a line is what it does and by

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.500 
forms a line is what it does and by
forming<00:00:20.690> a<00:00:20.780> line<00:00:21.370> it<00:00:22.370> immediately<00:00:22.820> grabs<00:00:23.270> the

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
forming a line it immediately grabs the

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.290 
forming a line it immediately grabs the
viewers<00:00:23.780> attention<00:00:23.930> now<00:00:24.470> the<00:00:25.010> opposite<00:00:25.610> of<00:00:25.880> a

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
viewers attention now the opposite of a

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.540 
viewers attention now the opposite of a
hard-edged<00:00:26.810> is<00:00:27.080> what<00:00:27.680> I<00:00:27.710> would<00:00:27.890> call<00:00:28.010> a<00:00:28.220> soft

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
hard-edged is what I would call a soft

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.810 
hard-edged is what I would call a soft
edge<00:00:28.930> now<00:00:29.930> a<00:00:29.960> soft<00:00:30.320> edge<00:00:30.590> is<00:00:30.830> just<00:00:31.520> like<00:00:31.700> it

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
edge now a soft edge is just like it

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.150 
edge now a soft edge is just like it
implies<00:00:32.149> it's<00:00:32.450> very<00:00:32.660> soft<00:00:33.050> it's<00:00:33.379> a<00:00:33.440> transition

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
implies it's very soft it's a transition

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.880 
implies it's very soft it's a transition
a<00:00:34.309> soft<00:00:34.940> edge<00:00:35.210> would<00:00:35.390> be<00:00:35.449> something<00:00:35.839> like<00:00:36.019> this

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
a soft edge would be something like this

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.959 
a soft edge would be something like this
where<00:00:37.789> you<00:00:37.909> get<00:00:38.149> oh<00:00:38.800> right<00:00:39.800> in<00:00:39.920> here<00:00:40.249> between

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
where you get oh right in here between

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.119 
where you get oh right in here between
this<00:00:41.179> value<00:00:41.659> this<00:00:41.809> light<00:00:42.050> value<00:00:42.469> and<00:00:42.679> this

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
this value this light value and this

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.759 
this value this light value and this
dark<00:00:43.399> value<00:00:43.789> underneath<00:00:44.210> the<00:00:44.620> underneath<00:00:45.620> the

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
dark value underneath the underneath the

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:47.380 
dark value underneath the underneath the
lips<00:00:45.980> here<00:00:46.159> you<00:00:46.219> see<00:00:46.399> that<00:00:46.550> transition<00:00:47.179> right

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
lips here you see that transition right

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.149 
lips here you see that transition right
in<00:00:47.569> there<00:00:47.780> between<00:00:47.989> the<00:00:48.319> light<00:00:48.530> and<00:00:48.559> the<00:00:48.890> dark

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:49.159 
in there between the light and the dark

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:52.719 
in there between the light and the dark
it's<00:00:49.850> very<00:00:50.359> soft<00:00:50.769> now<00:00:51.769> soft<00:00:52.100> edges<00:00:52.519> can<00:00:52.699> be

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:52.729 
it's very soft now soft edges can be

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:55.479 
it's very soft now soft edges can be
used<00:00:53.089> to<00:00:53.390> downplay<00:00:54.109> certain<00:00:54.859> areas<00:00:55.219> in<00:00:55.399> your

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
used to downplay certain areas in your

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.639 
used to downplay certain areas in your
painting<00:00:55.940> they<00:00:56.239> can<00:00:56.420> be<00:00:56.539> used<00:00:56.749> to<00:00:56.870> to

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
painting they can be used to to

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.099 
painting they can be used to to
de-emphasize<00:00:58.550> things<00:00:59.030> things<00:00:59.690> that<00:00:59.839> you<00:00:59.929> want

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
de-emphasize things things that you want

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:01.660 
de-emphasize things things that you want
to<00:01:00.170> sort<00:01:00.379> of<00:01:00.469> downplay<00:01:00.710> a<00:01:01.039> little<00:01:01.339> bit<00:01:01.460> and

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
to sort of downplay a little bit and

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.299 
to sort of downplay a little bit and
soft<00:01:02.510> edges<00:01:02.960> actually<00:01:03.199> come<00:01:03.620> into<00:01:03.859> play<00:01:04.100> when

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
soft edges actually come into play when

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.150 
soft edges actually come into play when
you<00:01:04.400> get<00:01:04.580> very<00:01:04.909> close<00:01:05.030> value<00:01:05.750> relationships

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
you get very close value relationships

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.350 
you get very close value relationships
I'll<00:01:07.160> give<00:01:07.340> you<00:01:07.430> another<00:01:07.610> example<00:01:07.700> when<00:01:08.300> you

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
I'll give you another example when you

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.300 
I'll give you another example when you
get<00:01:08.480> up<00:01:08.570> in<00:01:08.720> into<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:09.620> head<00:01:09.830> here<00:01:10.010> say<00:01:10.190> the

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
get up in into the head here say the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.820 
get up in into the head here say the
cheeks<00:01:10.640> see<00:01:11.630> these<00:01:11.780> cheeks<00:01:12.140> how<00:01:12.410> the<00:01:12.470> this

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
cheeks see these cheeks how the this

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.850 
cheeks see these cheeks how the this
pinkish<00:01:13.490> color<00:01:13.760> in<00:01:13.910> the<00:01:14.000> cheek<00:01:14.240> as<00:01:14.650> it<00:01:15.650> comes

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
pinkish color in the cheek as it comes

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.470 
pinkish color in the cheek as it comes
around<00:01:16.010> and<00:01:16.340> starts<00:01:16.520> to<00:01:16.640> churn<00:01:16.940> and<00:01:17.240> it<00:01:17.330> goes

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
around and starts to churn and it goes

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.350 
around and starts to churn and it goes
towards<00:01:17.870> more<00:01:18.560> of<00:01:18.650> the<00:01:18.740> jawline<00:01:19.250> you<00:01:20.060> see<00:01:20.240> the

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
towards more of the jawline you see the

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.750 
towards more of the jawline you see the
transition<00:01:21.050> between<00:01:21.230> this<00:01:21.650> color<00:01:21.920> this

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
transition between this color this

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.900 
transition between this color this
pinkish<00:01:23.180> color<00:01:23.450> in<00:01:23.570> this<00:01:23.660> yellow<00:01:23.960> color<00:01:24.910> do

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
pinkish color in this yellow color do

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.310 
pinkish color in this yellow color do
you<00:01:26.000> see<00:01:26.210> an<00:01:26.330> edge<00:01:26.510> in<00:01:26.720> there<00:01:26.870> not<00:01:27.080> really

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
you see an edge in there not really

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.790 
you see an edge in there not really
because<00:01:27.680> it's<00:01:28.070> a<00:01:28.190> very<00:01:28.610> close<00:01:29.150> value

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
because it's a very close value

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.630 
because it's a very close value
relationship<00:01:30.800> they're<00:01:30.950> very<00:01:31.130> close<00:01:31.430> in<00:01:31.610> value

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
relationship they're very close in value

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.240 
relationship they're very close in value
so<00:01:32.180> when<00:01:32.300> they're<00:01:32.420> close<00:01:32.690> in<00:01:32.720> value<00:01:33.320> you<00:01:33.560> sort

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
so when they're close in value you sort

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.760 
so when they're close in value you sort
of<00:01:34.310> lose<00:01:34.550> the<00:01:34.850> edge<00:01:35.000> altogether<00:01:35.870> so<00:01:36.590> that's

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
of lose the edge altogether so that's

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.820 
of lose the edge altogether so that's
another<00:01:37.040> example<00:01:37.220> of<00:01:37.700> a<00:01:37.790> soft<00:01:38.060> edge<00:01:38.330> in<00:01:38.540> there

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
another example of a soft edge in there

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.990 
another example of a soft edge in there
now<00:01:39.830> we<00:01:39.890> also<00:01:40.130> have<00:01:40.370> different<00:01:40.580> types<00:01:40.880> of

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
now we also have different types of

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.440 
now we also have different types of
edges<00:01:41.150> as<00:01:41.480> an<00:01:41.780> edge<00:01:41.930> called<00:01:42.170> a<00:01:42.260> broken<00:01:42.710> edge<00:01:42.890> a

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
edges as an edge called a broken edge a

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.580 
edges as an edge called a broken edge a
broken<00:01:44.450> edge<00:01:44.570> would<00:01:44.750> be<00:01:44.870> something<00:01:45.110> like<00:01:45.410> this

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
broken edge would be something like this

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.530 
broken edge would be something like this
right<00:01:45.800> up<00:01:46.040> here<00:01:46.250> in<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.400> hair<00:01:46.640> here<00:01:46.970> you<00:01:47.330> see

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
right up here in the hair here you see

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.960 
right up here in the hair here you see
how<00:01:47.660> it's<00:01:47.840> not<00:01:48.020> really<00:01:48.440> a<00:01:48.620> hard<00:01:48.950> edge<00:01:49.160> and<00:01:49.520> it's

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
how it's not really a hard edge and it's

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.610 
how it's not really a hard edge and it's
not<00:01:50.090> quite<00:01:50.390> a<00:01:50.420> soft<00:01:50.780> edge<00:01:51.080> but<00:01:51.350> you<00:01:51.440> get<00:01:51.590> all

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
not quite a soft edge but you get all

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.250 
not quite a soft edge but you get all
these<00:01:51.830> broken<00:01:52.190> pieces<00:01:52.580> in<00:01:53.390> there<00:01:53.570> that's

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
these broken pieces in there that's

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.710 
these broken pieces in there that's
referred<00:01:54.740> to<00:01:54.860> as<00:01:54.950> a<00:01:54.980> broken<00:01:55.340> edge<00:01:55.640> same<00:01:56.450> thing

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
referred to as a broken edge same thing

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.530 
referred to as a broken edge same thing
with<00:01:56.870> this<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:58.430> flicks<00:01:58.820> of<00:01:58.970> this<00:01:59.120> hair<00:01:59.390> up

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
with this the flicks of this hair up

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.060 
with this the flicks of this hair up
here<00:01:59.750> those<00:01:59.930> are<00:02:00.080> those<00:02:00.560> are<00:02:00.740> what<00:02:00.860> I<00:02:00.890> would

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
here those are those are what I would

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.530 
here those are those are what I would
consider<00:02:01.190> broken<00:02:01.850> edges<00:02:02.030> they're<00:02:02.360> not

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
consider broken edges they're not

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.330 
consider broken edges they're not
completely<00:02:03.409> solid<00:02:03.800> and<00:02:04.070> they're<00:02:04.220> not

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
completely solid and they're not

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.149 
completely solid and they're not
completely<00:02:04.880> soft<00:02:05.230> not<00:02:06.230> totally<00:02:06.620> hard<00:02:06.860> not

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
completely soft not totally hard not

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.710 
completely soft not totally hard not
totally<00:02:07.490> soft<00:02:07.760> so<00:02:08.030> they're<00:02:08.179> broken<00:02:08.420> edges

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
totally soft so they're broken edges

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.950 
totally soft so they're broken edges
same<00:02:09.080> thing<00:02:09.319> down<00:02:09.530> here<00:02:09.890> in<00:02:10.480> this<00:02:11.480> shoulder

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
same thing down here in this shoulder

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.559 
same thing down here in this shoulder
here<00:02:12.290> that's<00:02:13.160> a<00:02:13.310> broken<00:02:13.580> edge<00:02:13.940> that's<00:02:14.180> that's

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
here that's a broken edge that's that's

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.390 
here that's a broken edge that's that's
what<00:02:14.720> I<00:02:14.750> would<00:02:14.900> consider<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.319> broken<00:02:15.890> edge

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
what I would consider a broken edge

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.720 
what I would consider a broken edge
and<00:02:16.730> then<00:02:17.629> there's<00:02:17.930> an<00:02:18.260> implied<00:02:19.099> edge<00:02:19.459> I'm

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
and then there's an implied edge I'm

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.300 
and then there's an implied edge I'm
trying<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.030> find<00:02:20.299> it<00:02:20.870> find<00:02:21.290> an<00:02:21.500> implied<00:02:21.920> edge

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
trying to find it find an implied edge

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.600 
trying to find it find an implied edge
that's<00:02:22.879> an<00:02:23.060> edge<00:02:23.239> that<00:02:23.480> doesn't<00:02:23.900> really<00:02:24.610> exist

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
that's an edge that doesn't really exist

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.690 
that's an edge that doesn't really exist
but<00:02:26.330> your<00:02:26.510> eyes<00:02:26.659> sort<00:02:27.019> of<00:02:27.140> fills<00:02:27.379> it<00:02:27.560> in<00:02:27.739> give

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
but your eyes sort of fills it in give

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.979 
but your eyes sort of fills it in give
you<00:02:28.790> an<00:02:28.879> example<00:02:29.330> this<00:02:29.420> is<00:02:29.599> sort<00:02:29.810> of<00:02:29.870> an

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
you an example this is sort of an

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.500 
you an example this is sort of an
example<00:02:30.080> here<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:31.459> way<00:02:31.610> that<00:02:31.640> this<00:02:31.940> eye<00:02:32.180> comes

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
example here the way that this eye comes

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.690 
example here the way that this eye comes
in<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.780> back<00:02:32.959> here<00:02:33.290> see<00:02:33.950> how<00:02:34.040> close<00:02:34.459> these

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
in the back here see how close these

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.630 
in the back here see how close these
values<00:02:35.180> are<00:02:35.420> you<00:02:36.049> don't<00:02:36.230> really<00:02:36.440> see<00:02:36.890> an<00:02:37.220> edge

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
values are you don't really see an edge

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.210 
values are you don't really see an edge
there<00:02:38.090> you<00:02:38.989> don't<00:02:39.140> really<00:02:39.260> see<00:02:39.680> an<00:02:39.920> edge

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
there you don't really see an edge

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.039 
there you don't really see an edge
between<00:02:40.489> the<00:02:40.790> transition<00:02:41.450> between<00:02:41.780> this

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
between the transition between this

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.839 
between the transition between this
value<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.530> that<00:02:42.739> slightly<00:02:43.099> lighter<00:02:43.370> value<00:02:43.760> in

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
value and that slightly lighter value in

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.369 
value and that slightly lighter value in
the<00:02:43.940> corner<00:02:44.209> of<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.360> eye<00:02:44.390> but<00:02:45.200> when<00:02:45.290> you

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
the corner of the eye but when you

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:46.930 
the corner of the eye but when you
squint<00:02:45.680> down<00:02:45.890> or<00:02:46.040> when<00:02:46.159> you<00:02:46.220> step<00:02:46.489> back<00:02:46.700> and

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
squint down or when you step back and

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.180 
squint down or when you step back and
look<00:02:47.000> at<00:02:47.329> this<00:02:47.540> painting<00:02:47.810> your<00:02:48.500> eyes<00:02:48.709> sort<00:02:49.099> of

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
look at this painting your eyes sort of

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.280 
look at this painting your eyes sort of
fills<00:02:49.459> that<00:02:49.670> shape<00:02:50.090> in<00:02:50.390> and<00:02:50.690> that's<00:02:51.109> what<00:02:51.230> I

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
fills that shape in and that's what I

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.069 
fills that shape in and that's what I
would<00:02:51.379> call<00:02:51.680> an<00:02:51.950> implied<00:02:52.310> edge<00:02:52.780> but<00:02:53.780> anyhow

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
would call an implied edge but anyhow

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.599 
would call an implied edge but anyhow
with<00:02:54.260> all<00:02:54.440> those<00:02:54.560> different<00:02:54.980> types<00:02:55.160> of<00:02:55.340> edges

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
with all those different types of edges

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.280 
with all those different types of edges
there's<00:02:55.910> even<00:02:56.150> edges<00:02:56.629> in<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.810> background

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
there's even edges in the background

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.349 
there's even edges in the background
here<00:02:57.500> there's<00:02:57.680> broken<00:02:58.069> edges<00:02:58.220> there's<00:02:59.209> all

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
here there's broken edges there's all

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:00.910 
here there's broken edges there's all
there's<00:02:59.510> hard<00:02:59.840> edges<00:03:00.230> there's<00:03:00.410> all<00:03:00.530> sorts<00:03:00.859> of

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
there's hard edges there's all sorts of

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.530 
there's hard edges there's all sorts of
edges<00:03:01.340> that<00:03:01.370> go<00:03:01.489> on<00:03:01.730> in<00:03:01.819> the<00:03:01.909> background<00:03:02.120> as

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
edges that go on in the background as

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.720 
edges that go on in the background as
well<00:03:02.750> today<00:03:03.200> I<00:03:03.470> want<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:03.739> give<00:03:03.829> you<00:03:03.950> an<00:03:04.159> example

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
well today I want to give you an example

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.280 
well today I want to give you an example
a<00:03:05.150> little<00:03:06.079> demonstration<00:03:06.859> I<00:03:07.069> have<00:03:08.030> up<00:03:08.420> here<00:03:08.720> on

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
a little demonstration I have up here on

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.599 
a little demonstration I have up here on
my<00:03:10.069> easel<00:03:10.810> just<00:03:11.810> a<00:03:11.900> picture<00:03:12.109> of<00:03:12.290> a<00:03:12.500> statue<00:03:13.280> of<00:03:13.489> a

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
my easel just a picture of a statue of a

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.789 
my easel just a picture of a statue of a
little<00:03:13.849> rabbit<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.420> basically<00:03:15.230> I<00:03:15.349> just<00:03:15.620> want

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
little rabbit and basically I just want

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.220 
little rabbit and basically I just want
to<00:03:15.920> paint<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:16.849> rabbit<00:03:17.269> just<00:03:17.720> to<00:03:17.810> give<00:03:17.989> you<00:03:18.109> an

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
to paint the rabbit just to give you an

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.559 
to paint the rabbit just to give you an
idea<00:03:18.319> as<00:03:18.769> far<00:03:18.829> as<00:03:19.069> the<00:03:19.250> variety<00:03:19.760> of<00:03:19.790> edges<00:03:20.419> that

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
idea as far as the variety of edges that

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.420 
idea as far as the variety of edges that
you<00:03:20.630> can<00:03:20.959> use<00:03:21.200> in<00:03:21.380> your<00:03:21.410> painting<00:03:21.919> same<00:03:22.160> thing

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
you can use in your painting same thing

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.360 
you can use in your painting same thing
over<00:03:22.549> here<00:03:22.880> I<00:03:23.230> get<00:03:24.230> a<00:03:24.260> soft<00:03:24.620> edge<00:03:24.919> right<00:03:25.220> in

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
over here I get a soft edge right in

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:37.890 
over here I get a soft edge right in
here<00:03:25.669> by<00:03:25.819> just<00:03:26.290> using<00:03:27.290> my<00:03:27.590> fingers

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:49.360 

okay<00:03:38.900> it's<00:03:39.319> a<00:03:39.410> soft<00:03:39.860> edge<00:03:45.819> let's<00:03:46.819> try<00:03:48.370> another

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
okay it's a soft edge let's try another

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.910 
okay it's a soft edge let's try another
transition<00:03:50.209> it's<00:03:50.720> almost<00:03:51.230> a<00:03:51.410> softer<00:03:51.890> edge

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
transition it's almost a softer edge

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.840 
transition it's almost a softer edge
here<00:03:52.370> but<00:03:52.550> not<00:03:52.700> not<00:03:53.090> quite<00:03:53.450> as<00:03:53.570> much<00:03:54.580> just<00:03:55.580> like

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
here but not not quite as much just like

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:56.500 
here but not not quite as much just like
that

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
that

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.710 
that
a<00:04:00.400> lot<00:04:01.400> of<00:04:01.489> these<00:04:01.550> soft<00:04:01.880> edges<00:04:02.239> I<00:04:02.330> can<00:04:02.480> get<00:04:02.630> with

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
a lot of these soft edges I can get with

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:15.790 
a lot of these soft edges I can get with
my<00:04:02.750> finger

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.640 

can<00:04:16.400> I<00:04:16.640> can't<00:04:17.420> do<00:04:17.600> it<00:04:17.690> too<00:04:17.870> many<00:04:18.050> times<00:04:18.350> though

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
can I can't do it too many times though

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:19.990 
can I can't do it too many times though
we're<00:04:18.830> also<00:04:18.920> going<00:04:19.130> to<00:04:19.190> remove<00:04:19.400> too<00:04:19.970> much

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
we're also going to remove too much

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.220 
we're also going to remove too much
paint<00:04:20.950> but<00:04:21.950> I<00:04:22.010> can<00:04:22.160> do<00:04:22.250> it<00:04:22.340> a<00:04:22.370> couple<00:04:22.550> of<00:04:22.790> times

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
paint but I can do it a couple of times

00:04:23.230 --> 00:05:07.420 
paint but I can do it a couple of times
same<00:04:24.230> thing<00:04:24.410> on<00:04:24.500> the<00:04:24.590> back<00:04:24.800> here

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.530 

okay

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:43.680 

book<00:05:13.540> needs<00:05:13.810> to<00:05:13.990> come<00:05:14.170> up

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.780 

okay<00:05:44.690> I'm<00:05:44.840> going<00:05:44.930> to<00:05:44.990> put<00:05:45.140> a<00:05:45.200> very<00:05:45.440> light<00:05:48.790> value

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
okay I'm going to put a very light value

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.550 
okay I'm going to put a very light value
right<00:05:50.600> here

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.830 

that's<00:05:54.560> my<00:05:54.710> lightest<00:05:55.070> value<00:05:55.520> and<00:05:55.700> then<00:05:55.840> can

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
that's my lightest value and then can

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:09.010 
that's my lightest value and then can
work<00:05:57.020> few<00:05:57.380> edges<00:05:57.680> in<00:05:57.800> there<00:05:57.980> I<00:06:07.870> don't<00:06:08.870> want

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
work few edges in there I don't want

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.160 
work few edges in there I don't want
this<00:06:09.140> value<00:06:09.530> to<00:06:09.620> be<00:06:09.910> totally<00:06:10.910> white<00:06:11.210> so<00:06:12.080> I'm

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.170 
this value to be totally white so I'm

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.750 
this value to be totally white so I'm
going<00:06:12.320> to<00:06:12.350> knock<00:06:12.560> it<00:06:12.590> down<00:06:12.770> just<00:06:13.370> a<00:06:13.460> little<00:06:13.490> bit

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
going to knock it down just a little bit

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.440 
going to knock it down just a little bit
with<00:06:14.560> just<00:06:15.560> a<00:06:15.680> little<00:06:15.830> bit<00:06:16.040> of<00:06:16.130> that<00:06:16.250> color<00:06:16.490> but

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:17.450 
with just a little bit of that color but

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:24.130 
with just a little bit of that color but
it'll<00:06:17.660> still<00:06:17.930> appear<00:06:18.380> very<00:06:19.270> very<00:06:20.270> light<00:06:23.140> in

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.140 
it'll still appear very very light in

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:34.790 
it'll still appear very very light in
comparison<00:06:24.290> to<00:06:24.800> what's<00:06:25.040> there

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.950 

when<00:06:35.800> I<00:06:35.830> did<00:06:36.070> this<00:06:36.490> as<00:06:37.030> I<00:06:37.210> pull<00:06:37.240> this<00:06:37.660> across

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
when I did this as I pull this across

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.900 
when I did this as I pull this across
sort<00:06:38.410> of<00:06:38.470> in<00:06:38.590> one<00:06:38.860> motion<00:06:39.130> kind<00:06:39.639> of<00:06:39.729> just

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:39.910 
sort of in one motion kind of just

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.490 
sort of in one motion kind of just
pulled<00:06:40.210> across<00:06:40.479> you<00:06:40.900> can<00:06:41.050> see<00:06:41.290> right<00:06:41.440> here

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.500 
pulled across you can see right here

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.860 
pulled across you can see right here
I've<00:06:41.860> actually<00:06:42.100> ended<00:06:42.490> up<00:06:42.610> with<00:06:42.790> a<00:06:42.870> broken

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
I've actually ended up with a broken

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.200 
I've actually ended up with a broken
edge<00:06:44.260> more<00:06:44.530> of<00:06:44.620> a<00:06:44.680> broken<00:06:45.100> edge<00:06:45.250> that<00:06:45.760> happens

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.210 
edge more of a broken edge that happens

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.700 
edge more of a broken edge that happens
and<00:06:46.570> usually<00:06:47.350> you<00:06:47.440> can<00:06:47.590> get<00:06:47.770> broken<00:06:48.490> edges

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:49.710 
and usually you can get broken edges

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.340 
and usually you can get broken edges
more<00:06:50.710> so<00:06:50.979> with<00:06:51.250> working<00:06:52.090> over<00:06:52.330> dry<00:06:52.600> paint<00:06:53.020> in

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:53.350 
more so with working over dry paint in

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:54.750 
more so with working over dry paint in
other<00:06:53.470> words<00:06:53.650> if<00:06:53.800> you've<00:06:53.949> painted<00:06:54.220> something

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:54.760 
other words if you've painted something

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.080 
other words if you've painted something
that's<00:06:55.479> already<00:06:55.810> dry<00:06:56.139> and<00:06:56.860> then<00:06:57.520> you<00:06:57.550> go<00:06:57.880> back

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
that's already dry and then you go back

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.320 
that's already dry and then you go back
and<00:06:58.270> rework<00:06:58.630> over<00:06:58.990> top<00:06:59.229> of<00:06:59.260> that<00:07:00.150> you<00:07:01.150> usually

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.330 
and rework over top of that you usually

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:02.909 
and rework over top of that you usually
end<00:07:01.600> up<00:07:01.690> with<00:07:01.750> a<00:07:01.870> broken<00:07:02.080> edge<00:07:02.470> because<00:07:02.770> it's

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:02.919 
end up with a broken edge because it's

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:08.159 
end up with a broken edge because it's
not<00:07:03.100> a<00:07:03.270> fluid<00:07:06.210> surface<00:07:07.210> to<00:07:07.539> work<00:07:07.720> in<00:07:07.870> like<00:07:08.020> it

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:08.169 
not a fluid surface to work in like it

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:10.919 
not a fluid surface to work in like it
is<00:07:08.289> with<00:07:08.410> wet<00:07:08.680> paint
