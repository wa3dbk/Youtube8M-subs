00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.589
 you have a stamp that is broken as 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.589
 this one I 'm going to teach you how to compose 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.570
 hello friends then welcome to a pain 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.939
 with year we have taken advantage of an armchair of 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.860
 mini skin with a black that broke us 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.300
 in a move they made two solitos and 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.250
 out there you're filling them out 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.660
 what we are going to do is patch it to 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.779
 that does not keep coming out and so that 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.189
 see pretty we need a piece of 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.080
 auto line of free of color other 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.079
 armchair is what can get any 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.690
 shop for graphic arts scissors 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.019
 a coin to make a few circles and 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.019
 pencil 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.600
 let's mark the two circuits for 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.670
 know them what we are going to what is 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.480
 what is going to be our 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.480
 on the shore 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.730
 and we will make two triangles that 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.010
 my mother wants 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.610
 put the triangles on the sides 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.610
 to give 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.130
 this is how it is left 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.130
 to be able to cut it 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.090
 with the vinyl and since we stick it to 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.090
 armchair 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.130
 in the keep going 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.930
 well that's how the pieces were left 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.670
 and then not working with moles that 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.950
 they are like decals before we go to 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:01.369
 detach and place in these little eyes 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.430
 there in those rolls they'll see how I'm going 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.140
 to place the circles in the holes and 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.000
 these strips of the rectangle that here 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.300
 call on each side so you can 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.110
 as an armchair design 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.110
 what we are going to do 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.900
 they even gave me as it is no longer seen and what 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.590
 better than 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.590
 not to follow 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.040
 everyone 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.040
 sir closely before putting you 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.489
 the color already saw 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.420
 and they covered their eyes and this we will 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.040
 put the triangle 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.500
 since we put the two circles it 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.580
 install 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.580
 we are the triangle 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.120
 design 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:27.549
 and we're going to put it on both sides 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.549
 whoever sees it does not feel 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.830
 in the sofa 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.629
 nothing 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.290
 and that's what I love working with 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.209
 vinyls with power and blair 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.170
 that we can patch will be like 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.170
 part of the half 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.049
 good friends with everything 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.459
 thank you very much to the next the video 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.459
 little finger up 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.230
 Thank you
