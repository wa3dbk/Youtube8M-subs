00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.910
 each of us had more than once 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.280
 drill the walls in the house 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.590
 but not many thought that the wall is 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.750
 not only brick or drywall 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.210
 the partition out can be met 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.529
 many pitfalls such as 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.750
 electrical wiring 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.870
 metal fittings or wooden 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.180
 overlap in addition system avoid damage 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.950
 expensive tool and unpredictable 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.680
 damage to metal 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:35.239
 pipes and or wires live you 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.739
 this small device will also help 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.350
 it can be used to determine 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.450
 wooden walls walls given 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.140
 the device has sound and visual 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.579
 indications 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.489
 as well as sensitivity adjustment 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.540
 to more accurately determine the selected 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.550
 your material 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.809
 Now we will demonstrate it in 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.840
 action turn on the device when turned on 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.969
 top right we see the glow 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.059
 red indicator that will allow us not 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.399
 forget that the device is on let's translate 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.359
 switch to the desired search mode 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:10.020
 wood metal or tension now we 

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:12.689
 will seek 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.119
 hidden wiring set up 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.639
 sensitivity further we will press the case 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.329
 detector flat surface to 

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:22.259
 surface area 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:25.399
 felt pads will not allow 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.619
 scratch paint or your favorite wallpaper 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:31.069
 moving the unit searched the hidden 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.069
 wiring 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:47.890
 and so we see that under the wooden 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.289
 surface 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.750
 some cable or wire is hidden 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.539
 with this small device we 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.860
 identified hidden wiring and 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.280
 warned themselves against irreversible 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.280
 of the consequences
