to pair with our lighter wines that

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
looks really good that looks so good I

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.330 
looks really good that looks so good I
don't<00:02:52.530> know<00:02:52.590> when<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:52.709> kind<00:02:52.920> of<00:02:52.950> do<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:53.190> looks

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
don't know when I kind of do it it looks

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.089 
don't know when I kind of do it it looks
so<00:02:53.400> nice<00:02:53.610> um<00:02:54.239> what<00:02:54.810> is<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.079> reason<00:02:55.530> for<00:02:55.769> going

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
so nice um what is the reason for going

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.670 
so nice um what is the reason for going
lighter<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:57.299> darker<00:02:57.329> with<00:02:57.840> wines<00:02:58.049> so<00:02:58.349> starting

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
lighter to darker with wines so starting

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.509 
lighter to darker with wines so starting
with<00:02:58.769> these<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.069> going<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.340> heavier

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
with these and going to the heavier

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.250 
with these and going to the heavier
wines<00:02:59.670> is<00:02:59.819> it<00:02:59.940> because<00:03:00.209> if<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.900> start<00:03:01.170> with

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
wines is it because if you start with

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.750 
wines is it because if you start with
these<00:03:01.380> it'll<00:03:01.590> be<00:03:01.680> hard<00:03:01.860> to<00:03:01.920> get<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.130> taste<00:03:02.579> of

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
these it'll be hard to get the taste of

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.670 
these it'll be hard to get the taste of
those<00:03:02.940> I<00:03:03.120> don't<00:03:03.269> I'm<00:03:03.480> gonna<00:03:03.599> try<00:03:03.780> now<00:03:03.959> pretty

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
those I don't I'm gonna try now pretty

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.170 
those I don't I'm gonna try now pretty

with your lightest wines - you're
heavier<00:03:09.360> wines<00:03:09.569> because<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.890> taste<00:03:11.250> and

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
heavier wines because the the taste and

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.729 
heavier wines because the the taste and
the<00:03:11.549> flavor<00:03:11.610> in<00:03:12.299> a<00:03:12.420> big<00:03:12.660> bold<00:03:13.049> wine

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
the flavor in a big bold wine

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:14.750 
the flavor in a big bold wine
you're<00:03:13.980> not<00:03:14.130> going<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.370> taste<00:03:14.519> that

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
you're not going to taste that

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.520 
you're not going to taste that
Chardonnay<00:03:15.030> that<00:03:15.360> you<00:03:15.480> have<00:03:15.660> after<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:16.049> red<00:03:16.319> so

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
Chardonnay that you have after a red so

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.750 
Chardonnay that you have after a red so
you<00:03:16.590> want<00:03:16.769> to<00:03:16.829> start<00:03:17.069> with<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.220> white<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.610> work

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
you want to start with a white and work

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.370 
you want to start with a white and work
your<00:03:17.910> way<00:03:18.030> down<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.359> line<00:03:18.510> makes<00:03:18.959> sense<00:03:19.049> and

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
your way down the line makes sense and

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.050
