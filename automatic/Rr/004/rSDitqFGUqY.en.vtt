do any work on it from last year so it's
pretty<00:00:31.260> beat-up<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.920> rough<00:00:32.160> but<00:00:32.640> it's<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.719> real

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
pretty beat-up and rough but it's a real

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.870 
pretty beat-up and rough but it's a real
weird<00:00:34.260> layout<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.920> pits<00:00:35.160> are<00:00:35.309> up<00:00:35.430> at<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.640> top

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
weird layout the pits are up at the top

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.160 
weird layout the pits are up at the top
and<00:00:35.910> then<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.510> go<00:00:36.630> over<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.809> another

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
and then you have to go over to another

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.740 
and then you have to go over to another
hill<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.680> get<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.969> lift<00:00:38.969> up<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.360> do<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.600> down

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
hill to get the lift up to do the down

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.869 
hill to get the lift up to do the down

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
also it's all spread out a lot so the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.250 
also it's all spread out a lot so the
atmosphere<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.329> not<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.629> good<00:00:42.780> at<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.020> rate

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
atmosphere is not that good at this rate

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.480 
Maxwell wrong you didn't feel that good
at<00:04:32.900> a<00:04:32.930> couple<00:04:33.620> of<00:04:33.680> moments<00:04:33.830> when<00:04:34.160> I<00:04:34.190> was<00:04:34.310> just

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
at a couple of moments when I was just

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.980 
at a couple of moments when I was just
stalling<00:04:34.759> and<00:04:35.240> getting<00:04:35.419> a<00:04:35.449> little<00:04:35.569> bit<00:04:35.690> laying

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
stalling and getting a little bit laying

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.990 
stalling and getting a little bit laying
not<00:04:36.740> really<00:04:36.979> carrying<00:04:37.310> this<00:04:37.460> lead<00:04:37.639> the<00:04:37.789> best

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
not really carrying this lead the best

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.180 
not really carrying this lead the best
so<00:04:38.210> I<00:04:38.270> just<00:04:38.509> thought<00:04:38.690> I<00:04:39.020> didn't<00:04:39.889> think<00:04:40.039> I<00:04:40.099> was

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
so I just thought I didn't think I was

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.710
