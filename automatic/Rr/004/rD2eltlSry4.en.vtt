your comment yes I would like to dismiss
but<00:02:05.369> that's<00:02:05.549> basically<00:02:06.020> it<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.350> mean<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.710> works

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
but that's basically it I mean it works

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.999 
but that's basically it I mean it works
just<00:02:08.399> like<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.789> would<00:02:08.879> expect<00:02:08.970> any<00:02:10.009> Facebook

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
just like you would expect any Facebook

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.190 
just like you would expect any Facebook
app<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.370> work<00:02:11.550> one<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.480> neat<00:02:12.660> things<00:02:12.959> is

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
app to work one of the neat things is

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.650 
app to work one of the neat things is
they<00:02:13.410> do

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
they do

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.910 
they do
have<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.950> built-in<00:02:15.310> new<00:02:16.300> sizes<00:02:16.810> for<00:02:17.350> snap<00:02:17.590> use

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
have the built-in new sizes for snap use

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.990 
have the built-in new sizes for snap use
all<00:02:18.130> right<00:02:18.250> here<00:02:18.400> you<00:02:18.490> can<00:02:18.640> see<00:02:18.670> this<00:02:18.850> is<00:02:18.970> a

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
all right here you can see this is a

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.630 
all right here you can see this is a
50/50<00:02:19.750> view<00:02:20.050> you<00:02:20.980> can<00:02:21.100> go<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.250> little<00:02:21.400> bit

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
50/50 view you can go a little bit

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.460 
50/50 view you can go a little bit
smaller<00:02:21.910> than<00:02:22.090> that<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.630> then<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.840> adjusts<00:02:23.350> it

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
smaller than that and then it adjusts it

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.590 
smaller than that and then it adjusts it
where<00:02:24.100> now<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.370> kind<00:02:24.580> of<00:02:24.610> acts<00:02:24.820> as<00:02:25.000> a<00:02:25.030> phone<00:02:25.330> app

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
where now it kind of acts as a phone app

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.490 
where now it kind of acts as a phone app
and<00:02:25.870> that<00:02:26.080> has<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.310> slide-out<00:02:27.310> sidebar<00:02:28.060> here

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
and that has a slide-out sidebar here

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.730 
and that has a slide-out sidebar here
but<00:02:29.500> then<00:02:29.620> you<00:02:29.710> can<00:02:29.890> also<00:02:30.010> you<00:02:30.220> know<00:02:31.260> go<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.320> the

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
but then you can also you know go to the

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.450 
but then you can also you know go to the
size<00:02:32.980> as<00:02:33.220> well<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:34.770> you<00:02:35.770> can<00:02:35.920> go<00:02:36.070> all<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.280> way

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
size as well and you can go all the way

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.120 
size as well and you can go all the way
to<00:02:36.640> about<00:02:36.940> three-fourths<00:02:37.720> of<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.930> screen<00:02:38.290> but

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
to about three-fourths of the screen but

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.670 
to about three-fourths of the screen but
you<00:02:39.220> can't<00:02:39.550> make<00:02:39.850> it<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.300> ultra<00:02:41.020> tiny<00:02:41.290> size

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
you can't make it the ultra tiny size

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.550 
you can't make it the ultra tiny size
like<00:02:42.570> Internet<00:02:43.570> Explorer<00:02:43.840> was<00:02:44.140> right<00:02:44.350> there

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
like Internet Explorer was right there

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
this is as small as you can get but

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.750
