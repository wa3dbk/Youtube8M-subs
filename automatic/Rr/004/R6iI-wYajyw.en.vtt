00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
fuel that goes through this bolt so

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.310 
fuel that goes through this bolt so
whenever<00:04:50.790> you<00:04:50.970> hear<00:04:51.060> banjo<00:04:51.510> bolt<00:04:51.750> that<00:04:52.020> is<00:04:52.050> a

whenever you hear banjo bolt that is a
bolt<00:04:52.620> which<00:04:53.070> something<00:04:53.670> goes<00:04:54.030> through<00:04:54.330> so<00:04:54.720> you

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
bolt which something goes through so you

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.390 
bolt which something goes through so you
see<00:04:55.170> fuel<00:04:55.440> enters<00:04:55.620> in<00:04:55.830> there<00:04:55.950> and<00:04:56.100> then<00:04:56.220> comes

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
see fuel enters in there and then comes

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.520 
see fuel enters in there and then comes
outside<00:04:56.550> right<00:04:56.940> there<00:04:57.090> into<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.930> line<00:04:58.110> the

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
outside right there into the line the

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.990 
outside right there into the line the
banjo<00:04:58.980> bolt<00:04:59.430> receiving<00:05:00.090> line<00:05:00.470> there<00:05:01.470> you<00:05:01.590> go

and you can see there's a bolt right
there<00:05:09.810> let's<00:05:10.230> see<00:05:10.350> if<00:05:10.410> I<00:05:10.470> can<00:05:10.590> get<00:05:10.710> a<00:05:10.740> nice

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
there let's see if I can get a nice

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.270 
there let's see if I can get a nice
close-up<00:05:11.280> moment<00:05:11.820> a<00:05:12.440> bolt<00:05:13.440> right<00:05:13.680> there<00:05:14.040> and

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
close-up moment a bolt right there and

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.070 
close-up moment a bolt right there and
then<00:05:14.850> there's<00:05:15.090> another<00:05:15.420> one<00:05:15.690> on<00:05:15.840> the<00:05:15.990> other

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
then there's another one on the other

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.900 
then there's another one on the other
side<00:05:16.200> that<00:05:16.470> I<00:05:16.530> showed<00:05:16.710> you<00:05:16.800> earlier<00:05:17.190> when<00:05:17.880> I

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
side that I showed you earlier when I

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.340 
side that I showed you earlier when I
went<00:05:18.180> to<00:05:18.240> put<00:05:18.419> everything<00:05:18.600> back<00:05:18.780> together<00:05:18.960> I

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
went to put everything back together I

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.110 
went to put everything back together I
took<00:05:19.919> that<00:05:20.100> off<00:05:20.160> and<00:05:20.580> then<00:05:20.730> took<00:05:20.880> the<00:05:20.940> whole

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
took that off and then took the whole

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.450 
took that off and then took the whole
bracket<00:05:21.480> off<00:05:21.600> because<00:05:22.440> I<00:05:22.620> had<00:05:22.860> a<00:05:22.890> problem

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
bracket off because I had a problem

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.850 
bracket off because I had a problem
getting<00:05:23.730> the<00:05:24.000> the<00:05:24.780> line<00:05:24.990> in<00:05:25.260> on<00:05:25.410> the<00:05:25.530> bottom<00:05:25.800> of

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
getting the the line in on the bottom of

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.460 
getting the the line in on the bottom of
that<00:05:26.010> thing<00:05:26.280> right<00:05:26.400> there<00:05:26.669> so<00:05:26.940> um<00:05:27.600> you<00:05:28.290> may

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
that thing right there so um you may

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.250 
that thing right there so um you may
have<00:05:28.710> to<00:05:28.860> take<00:05:29.040> that<00:05:29.760> bolt<00:05:30.030> off<00:05:30.180> as<00:05:30.390> well<00:05:30.720> um

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
have to take that bolt off as well um

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.220 
have to take that bolt off as well um
and<00:05:31.950> hook<00:05:32.610> the<00:05:32.790> line<00:05:32.970> up<00:05:33.210> with<00:05:33.660> the<00:05:33.840> bracket

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
and hook the line up with the bracket

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.720 
and hook the line up with the bracket
off<00:05:34.350> and<00:05:34.530> then<00:05:34.650> once<00:05:35.160> you<00:05:35.280> get<00:05:35.370> the<00:05:35.460> bottom

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
off and then once you get the bottom

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.090 
off and then once you get the bottom
line<00:05:35.910> hooked<00:05:36.150> up<00:05:36.300> to<00:05:36.450> the<00:05:36.570> filter<00:05:36.919> then<00:05:37.919> you

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
line hooked up to the filter then you

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.710 
line hooked up to the filter then you
can<00:05:38.280> put<00:05:38.490> the<00:05:38.580> bracket<00:05:38.970> on<00:05:39.090> around<00:05:39.510> that

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
can put the bracket on around that

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.080 
can put the bracket on around that
because<00:05:39.960> you<00:05:40.800> bend<00:05:41.040> your<00:05:41.190> fuel<00:05:41.460> line<00:05:41.520> up<00:05:41.880> and

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
because you bend your fuel line up and

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.659 
because you bend your fuel line up and
then<00:05:42.210> um<00:05:42.740> it's<00:05:43.740> just<00:05:44.070> hard<00:05:44.250> putting<00:05:44.520> things

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
then um it's just hard putting things

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:46.460 
then um it's just hard putting things
back<00:05:44.760> together<00:05:45.000> you<00:05:45.419> can<00:05:45.720> do<00:05:45.930> it<00:05:46.050> with<00:05:46.200> keeping

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
back together you can do it with keeping

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.720 
back together you can do it with keeping
that<00:05:46.620> boom<00:05:46.770> on<00:05:46.919> I've<00:05:47.040> done<00:05:47.250> like<00:05:47.490> that<00:05:47.669> before

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
that boom on I've done like that before

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.090 
that boom on I've done like that before
on<00:05:48.090> other<00:05:48.210> cars<00:05:48.450> it's<00:05:48.630> just<00:05:48.810> easier<00:05:49.169> if<00:05:49.410> you

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
on other cars it's just easier if you

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.320 
on other cars it's just easier if you
take<00:05:50.280> the<00:05:50.400> bracket<00:05:50.700> off<00:05:50.790> and<00:05:50.940> then<00:05:51.030> put<00:05:51.240> the

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
take the bracket off and then put the

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.350 
take the bracket off and then put the
bracket<00:05:51.660> back<00:05:51.780> on<00:05:51.810> around<00:05:52.169> it<00:05:52.380> so<00:05:52.620> that<00:05:53.430> sums

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
bracket back on around it so that sums

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.870 
bracket back on around it so that sums
