okay<00:00:03.520> well<00:00:03.879> I've<00:00:04.000> cycled<00:00:04.240> goldenseal<00:00:04.810> starts

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:05.229 
okay well I've cycled goldenseal starts

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:06.839 
okay well I've cycled goldenseal starts
from<00:00:05.350> a<00:00:05.439> shining<00:00:05.680> a<00:00:05.830> little<00:00:06.040> round<00:00:06.250> black<00:00:06.519> seed

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:06.849 
from a shining a little round black seed

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:09.810 
from a shining a little round black seed
and<00:00:07.230> I've<00:00:08.230> seen<00:00:08.530> wild<00:00:08.830> goldenseal<00:00:09.309> numerous

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:09.820 
and I've seen wild goldenseal numerous

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.369 
and I've seen wild goldenseal numerous
times<00:00:10.120> over<00:00:10.330> the<00:00:10.540> years<00:00:10.719> and<00:00:11.019> it's<00:00:11.169> very

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:11.379 
times over the years and it's very

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:12.869 
times over the years and it's very
difficult<00:00:11.799> to<00:00:11.980> find<00:00:12.190> a<00:00:12.280> seedling<00:00:12.730> in<00:00:12.820> the

it's a clonal plan it'll send out

black seed which in the wild would fall

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.079 
black seed which in the wild would fall
off<00:00:26.500> the<00:00:26.650> plant<00:00:26.920> and<00:00:27.189> if<00:00:27.339> it's<00:00:27.490> lucky<00:00:27.699> it'll

the goldenseal true leaf on it as you

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.740 
the goldenseal true leaf on it as you
can<00:00:50.829> see<00:00:51.010> that's<00:00:51.160> got<00:00:51.370> a<00:00:51.399> tap<00:00:51.699> root<00:00:52.000> that's<00:00:52.270> a

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
can see that's got a tap root that's a

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.170 
can see that's got a tap root that's a
fiber<00:00:53.050> root<00:00:53.320> probably<00:00:53.800> 2<00:00:54.340> or<00:00:54.460> 3<00:00:54.640> inches<00:00:54.940> long

and<00:00:55.480> it's<00:00:55.570> got<00:00:55.870> a<00:00:55.930> good<00:00:56.140> start<00:00:56.469> on<00:00:56.590> life<00:00:56.890> and

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
and it's got a good start on life and

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.130 
and it's got a good start on life and
then<00:00:57.879> the<00:00:57.969> second<00:00:58.359> year<00:00:58.510> it<00:00:58.629> gets<00:00:58.750> the<00:00:58.930> true

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
then the second year it gets the true

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.959 
then the second year it gets the true
leaf<00:00:59.379> which<00:00:59.680> is<00:00:59.710> similar<00:01:00.190> looking<00:01:00.399> to<00:01:00.550> a<00:01:00.579> maple
