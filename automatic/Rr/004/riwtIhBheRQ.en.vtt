here but the different the different
pieces<00:03:07.219> of<00:03:07.340> this<00:03:07.579> is<00:03:07.879> this

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
pieces of this is this

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.330 
pieces of this is this
the<00:03:09.770> a<00:03:09.800> here<00:03:10.310> stands<00:03:10.700> for<00:03:10.840> link<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.770> a<00:03:12.980> and

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
the a here stands for link and the a and

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.580 
the a here stands for link and the a and
then<00:03:13.520> this<00:03:13.730> hovered<00:03:14.090> right<00:03:14.270> here<00:03:14.510> stands<00:03:15.440> for

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
then this hovered right here stands for

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.580 
then this hovered right here stands for
when<00:03:16.520> it's<00:03:16.700> hovered<00:03:17.030> over<00:03:17.330> so<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.380> hover

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
when it's hovered over so the hover

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.720 
when it's hovered over so the hover
would<00:03:18.800> be<00:03:18.950> in<00:03:19.130> this<00:03:19.280> case<00:03:19.520> this<00:03:20.480> light<00:03:20.990> green

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.870 

okay<00:03:26.500> so<00:03:27.500> this<00:03:27.650> this<00:03:27.920> LIRR<00:03:28.340> here

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
okay so this this LIRR here

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.840 
okay so this this LIRR here
the<00:03:29.360> it's<00:03:30.110> a<00:03:30.200> list<00:03:30.410> item<00:03:30.620> I'm<00:03:31.400> telling<00:03:31.730> it<00:03:31.820> to

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
the it's a list item I'm telling it to

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.390 
the it's a list item I'm telling it to
float<00:03:32.180> left<00:03:32.540> to<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.530> left<00:03:33.680> page<00:03:34.010> over<00:03:34.370> here

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
float left to the left page over here

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.040 
float left to the left page over here
and<00:03:35.650> then<00:03:36.940> this<00:03:37.940> right<00:03:38.150> here<00:03:38.210> positions<00:03:38.870> the

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
and then this right here positions the

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.490 
and then this right here positions the
actual<00:03:39.440> links<00:03:40.330> so<00:03:41.330> you<00:03:41.390> open<00:03:41.840> up<00:03:41.900> your<00:03:42.050> sidebar

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
actual links so you open up your sidebar

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.290 
actual links so you open up your sidebar
and<00:03:42.740> then<00:03:42.860> we're<00:03:42.980> gonna<00:03:43.070> create<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.490> class

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.910 

outside<00:03:49.900> so<00:03:50.900> now<00:03:51.020> you<00:03:51.080> click<00:03:51.260> on<00:03:51.440> that<00:03:51.560> and<00:03:51.770> it

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
outside so now you click on that and it

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.810 
outside so now you click on that and it
looks<00:03:52.010> beautiful<00:03:53.530> so<00:03:54.530> basically<00:03:54.920> we<00:03:55.490> go<00:03:55.640> back

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
looks beautiful so basically we go back

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.220 
looks beautiful so basically we go back
to<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.060> main<00:03:56.210> CSS<00:03:56.750> here<00:03:57.050> and<00:03:58.060> we<00:03:59.060> look<00:03:59.900> at<00:04:00.110> this

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
to the main CSS here and we look at this

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.520 
to the main CSS here and we look at this
over<00:04:00.620> and<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:02.000> position<00:04:02.450> right<00:04:02.630> here<00:04:02.690> this<00:04:03.350> is

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
over and the position right here this is

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.490 
over and the position right here this is
where<00:04:03.710> it's<00:04:03.860> positioning<00:04:04.460> so<00:04:05.090> my<00:04:05.660> my<00:04:06.020> position

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
where it's positioning so my my position

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.310 
where it's positioning so my my position
is<00:04:06.650> relative<00:04:07.070> to<00:04:07.100> the<00:04:07.310> page<00:04:07.750> so<00:04:08.750> I<00:04:08.780> go<00:04:09.020> back<00:04:09.140> to

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
is relative to the page so I go back to

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.210 
is relative to the page so I go back to
here<00:04:09.910> this<00:04:10.910> is<00:04:11.270> the<00:04:11.840> horizontal<00:04:12.230> so<00:04:13.070> it'd<00:04:13.160> be

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
here this is the horizontal so it'd be

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.860 
here this is the horizontal so it'd be
relative<00:04:13.760> up<00:04:13.970> here<00:04:14.209> if<00:04:14.390> you<00:04:14.420> had<00:04:14.660> something

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
relative up here if you had something

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.720 
relative up here if you had something
else<00:04:15.050> on<00:04:15.230> the<00:04:15.320> page<00:04:15.500> it<00:04:15.830> would<00:04:15.950> it<00:04:16.340> would<00:04:16.459> stay

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
else on the page it would it would stay

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.849 
else on the page it would it would stay
right<00:04:17.000> there<00:04:17.290> different<00:04:18.290> tutorials<00:04:18.739> will

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
right there different tutorials will

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.340 
right there different tutorials will
show<00:04:19.010> you<00:04:19.100> how<00:04:19.190> to<00:04:19.280> do<00:04:19.400> that

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
show you how to do that

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.640 
show you how to do that
so<00:04:21.830> if<00:04:21.890> we<00:04:21.980> go<00:04:22.100> back<00:04:22.130> to<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.610> HTML<00:04:23.410> the<00:04:24.410> top

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
so if we go back to the HTML the top

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.730 
so if we go back to the HTML the top
this<00:04:25.070> shows<00:04:25.340> how<00:04:25.760> much<00:04:25.820> space<00:04:26.390> you<00:04:26.840> want<00:04:26.990> and

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
this shows how much space you want and

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.950 
this shows how much space you want and
the<00:04:28.130> top<00:04:28.340> for<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.360> roulette<00:04:29.630> for<00:04:29.750> the

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
the top for the roulette for the

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.560 
the top for the roulette for the
relative<00:04:30.410> and<00:04:30.919> the<00:04:31.460> left<00:04:31.790> that<00:04:32.150> these<00:04:32.330> are<00:04:32.480> all

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
relative and the left that these are all

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.270 
relative and the left that these are all
these<00:04:32.960> are<00:04:33.020> all<00:04:33.200> relative<00:04:33.680> links<00:04:33.980> here<00:04:34.130> the

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
these are all relative links here the

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.580 
these are all relative links here the
positioning<00:04:34.790> so<00:04:35.419> the<00:04:35.510> top<00:04:35.690> would<00:04:35.870> be<00:04:35.990> 0<00:04:36.230> left

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
positioning so the top would be 0 left

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.830 
positioning so the top would be 0 left

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
10 so that's kind of like a margin but

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.860 
10 so that's kind of like a margin but
it<00:04:38.990> doesn't<00:04:39.710> stay<00:04:39.860> margin<00:04:40.370> inside<00:04:41.150> the<00:04:41.330> the

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
it doesn't stay margin inside the the

it doesn't stay margin inside the the

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
page it stays on a rather than within

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.620 
page it stays on a rather than within
its<00:04:44.840> own<00:04:44.930> area<00:04:45.430> so<00:04:46.430> then<00:04:46.640> the<00:04:46.790> margin<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.240> top

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
its own area so then the margin the top

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.460 
its own area so then the margin the top
and<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.050> left<00:04:48.550> would<00:04:49.550> be<00:04:49.730> 0<00:04:50.080> he<00:04:51.080> can<00:04:51.260> change

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
you want the float right here this tells

you want the float right here this tells
at<00:05:21.320> with<00:05:21.530> west<00:05:21.800> side<00:05:22.010> of<00:05:22.160> the<00:05:22.220> page

to<00:05:22.940> float<00:05:23.180> to<00:05:23.560> so<00:05:24.560> if<00:05:24.920> you<00:05:25.130> go<00:05:25.310> float<00:05:27.550> right<00:05:30.910> it

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
to float to so if you go float right it

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.670 
to float to so if you go float right it
would<00:05:32.030> change<00:05:32.210> to<00:05:32.330> the<00:05:32.540> right<00:05:32.660> side<00:05:32.900> vice

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
would change to the right side vice

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.150 
would change to the right side vice
versa<00:05:34.190> you<00:05:34.340> can<00:05:34.430> make<00:05:34.760> it<00:05:35.680> left<00:05:36.680> or<00:05:36.950> right

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
versa you can make it left or right

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.390

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
link is going to be so I could change

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.740 
link is going to be so I could change
the<00:05:46.940> width<00:05:47.150> that<00:05:47.710> depends<00:05:48.710> on<00:05:48.800> what<00:05:48.950> you<00:05:49.070> want
