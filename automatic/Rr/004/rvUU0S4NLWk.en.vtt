00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.450

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:50.329

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:59.930

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:59.930
 paste now begin to rotate and 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:12.299

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:15.500

 the original length of the regional in 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.420
 Basically no matter what you click, I will insert 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.950
 for example twins 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.960

 Of course a little bit here sticks out wire well 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:51.020
