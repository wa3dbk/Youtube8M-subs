00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.640 

but<00:00:12.510> you<00:00:12.690> might<00:00:12.840> see<00:00:13.049> what<00:00:13.349> I've<00:00:13.440> done<00:00:13.590> here

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
but you might see what I've done here

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.680 
but you might see what I've done here
I've<00:00:14.309> taken<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.790> wire<00:00:15.000> in<00:00:15.240> from<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.510> back

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
I've taken the wire in from the back

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.870 
I've taken the wire in from the back
through<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.529> hole<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:16.710> just<00:00:16.980> twist<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.400> over

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
through the hole and just twist it over

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.920 
through the hole and just twist it over
so<00:00:18.360> it's<00:00:18.480> just<00:00:18.630> secure<00:00:19.020> their<00:00:20.570> through<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.750> I

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
so it's just secure their through that I

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.720 
so it's just secure their through that I
layer<00:00:22.200> now<00:00:22.500> here<00:00:22.710> we<00:00:22.800> go<00:00:22.919> again<00:00:23.040> one<00:00:23.790> time<00:00:25.730> take

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
layer now here we go again one time take

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.420 
layer now here we go again one time take
it<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.840> we<00:00:28.019> rest<00:00:28.350> it<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:30.859> here<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.070> just<00:00:32.279> get

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
it in so we rest it on here to just get

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.009 
it in so we rest it on here to just get
it<00:00:32.550> up<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.669> temperatures<00:00:33.239> with<00:00:33.449> just<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.780> tip

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:34.019 
it up to temperatures with just the tip

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:40.160 
it up to temperatures with just the tip
just<00:00:37.879> the<00:00:38.879> tip<00:00:38.940> just<00:00:39.360> let<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.870> get<00:00:39.989> to

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
just the tip just let it get to

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.430 
just the tip just let it get to
temperature<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.420> then<00:00:42.420> we<00:00:42.540> run<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.020> solder

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
temperature and then we run the solder

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:55.590 
temperature and then we run the solder
onto<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.129> tip<00:00:45.559> it's<00:00:46.559> not<00:00:46.710> quite<00:00:47.040> there<00:00:47.430> yet

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.250 

we<00:00:56.230> will<00:00:56.440> go

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.340 

there<00:01:00.890> we<00:01:00.980> go

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
there we go

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.259 
there we go
I'll<00:01:02.980> just<00:01:03.219> try

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
I'll just try

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.359 
I'll just try
as<00:01:05.930> you<00:01:06.049> get<00:01:06.229> in<00:01:06.380> sometimes<00:01:06.770> there's<00:01:06.950> no<00:01:07.039> flux

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
as you get in sometimes there's no flux

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.779 
as you get in sometimes there's no flux
in<00:01:07.549> that<00:01:07.670> first<00:01:07.909> bit<00:01:08.229> so<00:01:10.299> there<00:01:11.299> we<00:01:11.600> go<00:01:12.789> let's

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:13.789 
in that first bit so there we go let's

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:15.669 
in that first bit so there we go let's
put<00:01:14.000> it<00:01:14.090> out<00:01:14.179> a<00:01:14.210> little<00:01:14.450> bit<00:01:14.570> just<00:01:15.320> try<00:01:15.439> to<00:01:15.530> get

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:15.679 
put it out a little bit just try to get

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:18.789 
put it out a little bit just try to get
it<00:01:15.829> to<00:01:15.979> run<00:01:16.299> and<00:01:17.299> the<00:01:17.390> rest<00:01:17.630> of<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:17.960> terminal

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
it to run and the rest of the terminal

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.800 
it to run and the rest of the terminal
there<00:01:21.189> so<00:01:22.189> let's<00:01:22.789> go<00:01:22.909> now<00:01:23.270> what's<00:01:23.479> happening

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
there so let's go now what's happening

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.590 
there so let's go now what's happening
this<00:01:23.960> tit<00:01:24.200> bits<00:01:24.409> going<00:01:24.560> to<00:01:24.619> be<00:01:24.740> hot<00:01:25.390> that's<00:01:26.390> not

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
this tit bits going to be hot that's not

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.809 
this tit bits going to be hot that's not
too<00:01:26.750> bad<00:01:26.780> right<00:01:27.140> now<00:01:28.039> let's<00:01:28.219> focus<00:01:28.459> even

00:01:28.809 --> 00:01:28.819 
too bad right now let's focus even

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:31.539 
too bad right now let's focus even
closer<00:01:29.179> now<00:01:29.770> because<00:01:30.770> I<00:01:30.890> want<00:01:30.920> you<00:01:31.159> to<00:01:31.250> have<00:01:31.520> a

real good it's wonderful thing about
this<00:01:34.429> look<00:01:34.610> I'm<00:01:34.819> using<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.179> webcam<00:01:35.360> because

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
this look I'm using the webcam because

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.649 
this look I'm using the webcam because
of<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.259> focus<00:01:36.709> and<00:01:37.119> right<00:01:38.119> now<00:01:38.329> what<00:01:38.539> you<00:01:38.630> can

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
of the focus and right now what you can

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.910 
of the focus and right now what you can
see<00:01:39.880> this<00:01:40.880> one<00:01:41.149> is<00:01:41.929> a<00:01:41.989> nice<00:01:42.170> blob<00:01:42.560> of<00:01:42.590> solder

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
see this one is a nice blob of solder

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:52.870 
see this one is a nice blob of solder
that's<00:01:43.819> holding<00:01:44.299> that<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:45.520> nice<00:01:46.520> blob

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.510 

these<00:01:53.479> camera<00:01:53.869> men<00:01:54.020> and<00:01:54.290> their<00:01:54.740> money<00:01:54.920> not

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
these camera men and their money not

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.480 
these camera men and their money not
that<00:01:55.640> easy<00:01:56.649> but<00:01:57.649> basically<00:01:57.860> you<00:01:58.070> can<00:01:58.189> see<00:01:58.340> well

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
that easy but basically you can see well

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.850 
that easy but basically you can see well
I'm<00:01:58.610> what<00:01:59.000> I've<00:01:59.149> done<00:01:59.270> there<00:01:59.560> okay<00:02:00.560> I'll<00:02:00.680> turn

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
I'm what I've done there okay I'll turn

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.289 
I'm what I've done there okay I'll turn
the<00:02:00.950> camera<00:02:01.220> off<00:02:01.280> now<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:01.759> we're<00:02:01.909> put<00:02:02.119> it<00:02:02.210> all

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
the camera off now and we're put it all

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:09.339 
the camera off now and we're put it all
together<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:02.720> see<00:02:03.350> where<00:02:03.500> we<00:02:03.590> go<00:02:07.959> so<00:02:08.959> we've

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
together and see where we go so we've

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.339 
together and see where we go so we've
ended<00:02:09.619> up<00:02:09.769> with<00:02:09.979> a<00:02:10.429> jet<00:02:11.269> plug<00:02:11.569> that's<00:02:11.989> attached

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
ended up with a jet plug that's attached

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.180 
ended up with a jet plug that's attached
by<00:02:13.310> 2<00:02:13.910> y's<00:02:14.180> onto<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.660> two<00:02:14.840> terminals<00:02:15.190> we've

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
by 2 y's onto the two terminals we've

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.040 
by 2 y's onto the two terminals we've
got<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.430> sleeve<00:02:16.760> that<00:02:17.000> pushes<00:02:17.330> up<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.870> end

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
got a sleeve that pushes up to the end

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.630 
got a sleeve that pushes up to the end
there<00:02:18.489> and<00:02:19.489> we've<00:02:19.730> got<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.030> back<00:02:20.800> cover<00:02:21.800> this

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
there and we've got the back cover this

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.820 
there and we've got the back cover this
is<00:02:22.790> always<00:02:23.120> going<00:02:23.239> to<00:02:23.300> be<00:02:23.360> awkward<00:02:23.680> you'll<00:02:24.680> got

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
is always going to be awkward you'll got

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.030 
is always going to be awkward you'll got
the<00:02:24.920> front<00:02:25.160> bet<00:02:25.340> you<00:02:25.519> remember<00:02:25.819> this<00:02:25.940> that

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
the front bet you remember this that

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.710 
the front bet you remember this that
slots<00:02:28.040> on<00:02:28.750> maybe<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.870> bit<00:02:30.049> fiddly<00:02:30.319> but<00:02:31.569> let's<00:02:32.569> go

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
slots on maybe a bit fiddly but let's go

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.610 
slots on maybe a bit fiddly but let's go
a<00:02:32.750> bit<00:02:32.930> closer<00:02:33.730> I'll<00:02:34.730> show<00:02:34.910> you<00:02:35.620> rubbish

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
a bit closer I'll show you rubbish

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.370 
a bit closer I'll show you rubbish
around<00:02:36.890> like<00:02:37.040> this<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:40.420> won't<00:02:41.420> stop<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.080> camera

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
around like this I won't stop the camera

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.339 
around like this I won't stop the camera
let's<00:02:42.560> just<00:02:44.319> come<00:02:45.319> down<00:02:45.530> here<00:02:45.739> again<00:02:47.170> there<00:02:48.170> we

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
let's just come down here again there we

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.380 
let's just come down here again there we
go<00:02:48.549> all<00:02:49.549> right<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:51.170> let's<00:02:51.349> start<00:02:51.620> again<00:02:52.390> let

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
go all right so let's start again let

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.699 
go all right so let's start again let
them<00:02:53.510> find<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.780> camera<00:02:53.930> we've<00:02:54.319> got<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.560> bat

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
them find the camera we've got the bat

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:03.340 
them find the camera we've got the bat
bit<00:02:54.920> we've<00:02:55.130> got<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.340> sheath<00:02:55.579> with<00:02:56.569> the<00:02:56.660> plug

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.030 

push<00:03:04.350> that<00:03:04.560> on<00:03:05.750> be<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.780> bit<00:03:06.930> fiddly<00:03:07.200> but<00:03:07.950> you

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
push that on be a bit fiddly but you

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.380 
push that on be a bit fiddly but you
don't<00:03:08.220> really<00:03:08.340> want<00:03:08.520> to<00:03:08.550> force<00:03:08.790> anything<00:03:08.940> at

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
don't really want to force anything at

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.980 
don't really want to force anything at
this<00:03:09.510> stage<00:03:09.750> because<00:03:11.450> you<00:03:12.450> know<00:03:12.600> there's<00:03:12.840> only

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
this stage because you know there's only

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.860 
this stage because you know there's only
two<00:03:13.200> wires<00:03:13.440> on<00:03:13.710> that<00:03:13.890> C<00:03:14.640> so<00:03:15.000> we<00:03:15.120> push<00:03:15.330> that<00:03:15.540> that

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
two wires on that C so we push that that

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.170 
two wires on that C so we push that that
comes<00:03:16.140> through<00:03:16.980> right<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.180> end<00:03:20.000> this<00:03:21.000> is

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
comes through right to the end this is

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.040 
comes through right to the end this is
force<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:22.620> sleeve<00:03:23.360> to<00:03:24.360> push<00:03:24.570> it<00:03:24.720> into<00:03:24.870> the

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
force the sleeve to push it into the

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.810 
force the sleeve to push it into the
wire<00:03:25.200> that<00:03:25.500> will<00:03:25.650> hold<00:03:25.860> it<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:26.250> then<00:03:26.280> by<00:03:26.490> doing

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
wire that will hold it and then by doing

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:37.840 
wire that will hold it and then by doing
this<00:03:26.940> up<00:03:28.520> again<00:03:29.520> it<00:03:29.820> will<00:03:30.060> grip<00:03:30.780> onto<00:03:31.020> the<00:03:31.260> wire

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.580 

so<00:03:38.850> we'll<00:03:39.060> go<00:03:39.209> a<00:03:39.240> little<00:03:39.420> bit<00:03:39.630> right<00:03:40.230> up<00:03:40.410> too

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
so we'll go a little bit right up too

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:52.300 
so we'll go a little bit right up too
tight<00:03:44.090> move<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.239> camera<00:03:45.450> back<00:03:45.660> again

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.589 

what<00:03:52.910> great<00:03:53.180> can<00:03:53.420> will<00:03:53.569> work<00:03:55.360> more<00:03:56.360> great

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
what great can will work more great

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:57.699 
what great can will work more great
camera<00:03:56.930> work<00:03:56.959> I<00:03:57.200> don't<00:03:57.290> think<00:03:57.500> I'm<00:03:57.560> gonna<00:03:57.650> win

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
camera work I don't think I'm gonna win

helped<00:03:59.989> it<00:04:00.860> was<00:04:01.040> very<00:04:01.160> basic<00:04:01.849> you<00:04:02.300> know

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
helped it was very basic you know

helped it was very basic you know
quarter<00:04:03.500> inch<00:04:03.650> jack<00:04:03.709> plug<00:04:04.569> you<00:04:05.569> know<00:04:05.690> there's

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
quarter inch jack plug you know there's

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.170 
quarter inch jack plug you know there's
obviously<00:04:06.950> ways<00:04:07.160> that<00:04:07.400> you<00:04:07.430> perhaps<00:04:07.790> some<00:04:08.150> of

obviously ways that you perhaps some of

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.910 
obviously ways that you perhaps some of
you<00:04:08.270> guys<00:04:08.480> do<00:04:08.780> it<00:04:08.930> different<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.590> this<00:04:09.680> there's

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
you guys do it different to this there's

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.520 
you guys do it different to this there's
different<00:04:10.190> parts<00:04:10.370> of<00:04:10.430> jack<00:04:10.640> plug<00:04:10.849> but<00:04:11.530> yeah

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
different parts of jack plug but yeah

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.559 
different parts of jack plug but yeah
it's<00:04:12.739> the<00:04:12.830> basics<00:04:13.310> that<00:04:13.580> will<00:04:14.180> get<00:04:14.330> you<00:04:14.420> out<00:04:14.540> of

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
it's the basics that will get you out of
