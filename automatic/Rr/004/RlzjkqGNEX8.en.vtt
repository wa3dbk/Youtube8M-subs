00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.670
 at the request of the board of directors of 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.610
 parana club with jose at the head and 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.749
 fontana who is the vice president 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.219
 they asked for advice we made a 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:17.050
 survey of what was the field of 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:19.119
 football and we installed a unique system in 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.449
 the province that would watering say in 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:25.119
 holy faith also since this works 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.099
 with a system of people who do not 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.109
 They are hydraulic but they are electric 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.419
 that is us here on the club court 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:35.590
 for Latin the ability to choose to open 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:37.480
 of a sprinkler to water a single part 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.500
 of the half court court court 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.360
 complete with the possibility of throwing 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.340
 an approximate 56 millimeters of rain 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.890
 in half an hour in the whole field I play the 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.710
 main characteristic is because he what 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.680
 commands a computer that is in the 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.670
 part of boards 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.340
 where the canchero can directly 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.660
 set up a practitioner three months of 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.030
 irrigation automatically and in case of 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.510
 let it be known, for example, that the club stops 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.280
 Play as a visitor does not even need 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.619
 visit the court but the river 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.000
 automatically works only you can 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.560
 schedule with three months with the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.210
 periodicity and the schedules that are 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.250
 indicates exactly it even has the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.900
 possibility the same canchero if there 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.210
 area of the court where it gives more shade 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.160
 which are adding 2 millimeters in a 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.200
 side and gave a millimeter in some 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.780
 another sector of the bone field that 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.070
 It also allows to sectorize that when 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.210
 how much is the amount of water that 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.610
 has in each sector 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.899
 exactly exactly taking advantage 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.850
 when we did the survey in the 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.600
 facilities we saw that there was 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.990
 a loose electrical installation in the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.720
 sense of possibility to annex in the 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.390
 future other facilities 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.190
 taking advantage of the ditching we did to 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.910
 put 80 cm pvc pipe 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.940
 where the water flow goes we introduced 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:03.510
 another additional pipe with guide cables 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.600
 so that tomorrow the club can 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:10.290
 draw from any of the points of the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.550
 electric voltage court this order the 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.100
 this river that we do not 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.720
 we touch the game field but a 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.150
 irrigation by the long distance person who 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.280
 we throw is 35 meters of water and I do not know 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.530
 how many people have the court 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.530
 in total he has 10 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.470
 lateral and reinforced with two sleds 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.840
 central and the design of the form of 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.910
 carry out this irrigation in the 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.920
 number of people who participated had 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.050
 a lot to see local businesses as well 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.790
 also sanitary works of the province 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.140
 that was giving the ratings and one 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.390
 of the data to keep in mind about 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.980
 all taking into account the need for 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.140
 water that you have in the city for 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.440
 water problems is that this was done to 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.959
 through an excavation and a well 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.740
 own that feeds the tanks for 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.590
 be able to carry out this risk 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.710
 in this in this endeavor that is the 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.290
 first thing we do to this one in this 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:08.280
 scale with the advice we collaborated 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.900
 of the rudder people who had this 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.600
 knowledge what is irrigation in parks 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.250
 and then we put together a team and we 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.050
 we went to sanÃ¡ buenos aires to this 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.750
 we did it from parana companies with the 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.190
 advice and inspection of 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.290
 province in the part of hours before the 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.300
 press that collaborated very well 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.870
 impressing the works and with what 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:32.640
 equipment what kind of equipment brand 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.690
 blue rain and then valve and it is estimated 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.250
 of security that we get in the 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.549
 local market that we represent 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.830
 for example from the signature flight that 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:44.329
 we take advantage of placing it in the system 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.950
 I think they have not been used because 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:50.010
 they require more infrastructure in what 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:55.930
 to installations requires a good laying 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:59.230
 electrical requires this 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.000
 there are factories like the fly one that is already 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.920
 in the country manufacturing so everything 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.769
 what is valve and relief component 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.140
 They are imported by manufactured in the country 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:11.040
 and what if the sprinklers are 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.719
 imported are the same as those used in 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.479
 cruzeiro in brazil and west of 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:17.459
 england and parana half recognized in 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.690
 the whole province between rivers 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.789
 mainly by working with the 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.400
 water with water pumps and throughout 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:27.490
 the part of sewers that exist in each 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.770
 one of the municipalities of the province 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.690
 our strong is to solve the 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.639
 problems the water historically in what 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.870
 which is sewage issues with station 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.960
 pumping we are very well known in the 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.849
 province why this and then in ex 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.130
 I love everything that is rain and 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:44.050
 requirement for trust and for 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.009
 know the method of work and 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.809
 seriousness that we have 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.849
 we accept the proposal of jose de 

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:51.800
 study the issue of irrigation and enter 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:53.419
 this new item where there are several 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.249
 institutions that are already interested 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.129
 in which we do survey included in 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:59.300
 court of santa fe is a pretty item 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:01.490
 important that is growing from 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.110
 of the participation of clubs and 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.029
 professionalization requirements 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.849
 courts that previously not even 

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:10.159
 They were close as is, which is what 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:13.669
 to emphasize that it is very important that 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:15.529
 the state participate I do not know if with funds 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:19.249
 but with assistance with collaboration 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:22.249
 be in what materials like pipes 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:24.750
 or because the future is in sports 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:27.480
 let's say the club parana 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.160
 It has grown surely 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.780
 commissions will continue to happen but these 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.640
 they are works that are left and the future is so 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.500
 I only saw when we're watering the 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.090
 illusion of the boys entering that 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.100
 they came running when we're 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.470
 testing the irrigation in the rain and the 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.420
 true that I think a way to support 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.490
 to the education itself of the boys and 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.580
 contain it in sports there are others 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.150
 clubs waiting for this kind of 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.280
 alternatives what is the river 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.550
 traditional yes yes there are several 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:56.610
 to do this survey in several 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:59.820
 we have courts in rosal is the other 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.380
 sescam for nothing something in rafaella and something 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.390
 in cities across the coast of Uruguay 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.000
 Uruguay is also working on the coast 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.650
 we want to become strong in this 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.030
 explain to the people the canchers and 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.340
 start to see how the technicians work 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.650
 Well, when we design irrigation, the ideal 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.810
 was to water the court at one time with 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.450
 all peaks working that does not 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.190
 saves time and is spectacular but not 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.720
 we found that the technicians 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.710
 prefer to water half court in the 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.810
 trainings then there was that 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.240
 modify the system the system is very 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.620
 versatile even the parana club is called 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.040
 module what works every time 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.250
 a part of sprinklers work 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.630
 the ink the 8 module works in only 4 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.270
 foreseeing other future installations 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.460
 is 8-court soccer field was 11 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.780
 The club's irrigation system has been made 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.660
 an investment say providing the 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:47.950
 future 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:51.480
 for more now it is a magazine and there are already 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.480
 kiosks throughout the province
