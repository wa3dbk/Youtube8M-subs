00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello to you again, the game channel 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.240
 Igor is sinking and his leading serious 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.460
 cabstar 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.530
 and today's video I will tell you about 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.410
 one way you are 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.509
 you can soar in the air and so let's 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.160
 let's start for a start you need either 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.310
 get on some high 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.529
 place to find helicopter choices 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.189
 the plane and take off on it as possible 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.859
 higher 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:31.969
 In this case, I climbed a mountain of chiliads 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:34.800
 Here on this elevator and now I 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:37.380
 jumped off one of the pillars of this 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.090
 lift I chose this place is not 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.510
 by chance so that you can 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.059
 compare the distance I fly 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.850
 without this soaring this distance 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.239
 which I lie down slept with soaring that's how 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.280
 we see now I jumped off a prop 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.010
 lift and flew pretty 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.949
 slightly distance now I'm you 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.190
 I'll show you how much distance 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.630
 overcome 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.600
 if i jump with hover and so i 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:15.780
 again standing on the edge of this 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:19.110
 props and after that I now jumped 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.640
 down and will soar to 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.750
 execute this glitch 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.009
 or this so-called trick you should 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.930
 after the jump immediately 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:33.900
 slightly forward reject your left stick 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.880
 not quite all the way forward a little and here 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.670
 if you do it right then you 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.979
 it should be such a hover 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.550
 as we see, I do not serve but continue as 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.510
 would fly forward 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.420
 overcomes pretty significant 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.820
 distance as we will see to me now 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.850
 now even be able to fly up 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.160
 directly to the ocean let me tell you 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.760
 tell you again how to do this 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.050
 trick 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.190
 and after the jump you should immediately 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.610
 slightly forward 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:09.960
 press or reject the left stick if you 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.630
 did the trick on the bike 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.900
 when you need to ride in the front 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.180
 the wheel you will understand how it is like this 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.170
 trick to do just a little bit 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:26.540
 forward click this left stick 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.730
 and your character begins to float 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.180
 actually I have it all if you 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.280
 like this glitch and then put 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.820
