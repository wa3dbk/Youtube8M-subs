00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
they just sort of gave us an email and

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.320 
they just sort of gave us an email and
then<00:01:08.960> we<00:01:09.110> created<00:01:09.620> a<00:01:09.800> password<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:10.729> that<00:01:11.210> was

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
then we created a password and that was

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.120 
then we created a password and that was
pretty<00:01:11.510> simple<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:12.410> really<00:01:12.680> cool<00:01:12.860> thing

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
pretty simple the really cool thing

about<00:01:13.220> it<00:01:13.580> is<00:01:13.700> that<00:01:13.850> there's<00:01:14.060> a<00:01:14.150> sort<00:01:14.300> of<00:01:14.479> suite

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
about it is that there's a sort of suite

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.600 
about it is that there's a sort of suite
of<00:01:15.020> applications<00:01:15.170> and<00:01:15.890> you<00:01:15.979> can<00:01:16.130> turn<00:01:16.310> things

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
of applications and you can turn things

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.160 
of applications and you can turn things
on<00:01:16.729> and<00:01:16.790> off<00:01:16.970> depending<00:01:17.540> on<00:01:17.630> whether<00:01:17.810> they<00:01:17.990> fit

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
on and off depending on whether they fit

your<00:01:18.350> institution<00:01:19.070> for<00:01:19.580> example<00:01:20.000> when<00:01:20.150> we

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
your institution for example when we
