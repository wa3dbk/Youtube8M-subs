00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.420

 put a corner like that please bone 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.870

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.110
 jealousy 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.230
 this video is funny to memorize and 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.360
 belts and durán de cuadritos with 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.580
 positive trick that the circle is the 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.220
 blue tennis like that of bullet and I do not know 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.400
 of the uniform world of the conalep is not 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.230
 true because we return ready that color 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.710
 I'm kids, I do not know what color I am 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.350
 I will see what color they are now almost me 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.490
 confinement and that what only good and that 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.890
 thus they agree that the change of 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.769
 colors the color change is weird 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.209
 I am white or white gray I think you do not know no 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.680
 the colors are distinguished 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.680
 attention attention not 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.730
 it can not be wrong I 'll see 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.130
 who wins guys who will who 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.200
 they're going to turn him in here they're going to 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.350
 they were going to him when I said to this I'm going to 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.880
 the blue ones on the right one you 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.790
 then there are some blue look they are almost 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.830
 same blue and continue to believe but it is 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.690
 normal the one that is going to be enclosed is the 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.600
 Gray is going to lock himself up, look, look 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.090
 he will not shut himself up anymore he locked himself in 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:52.900
 They saw how he did it I can not believe it 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:55.180
 I can believe it seriously 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.630
 look they want an apple guys to see 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.460
 I can not have apple trees there 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.100
 I told him that the blue guy was going 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.630
 let's go blue let's go blue to see see 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.600
 Now I 'm going to tell you no longer what 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.500
 closed no no no no already locked in is not 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.380
 what happened to her 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:15.190
 ok as you see they are longer this long the 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:18.400
 sheep is more difficult more easier 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.560
 of crashing and harder to dodge us 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.630
 the truth imagine when they give you the 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.990
 turn if they look and locked themselves only won 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:29.639
 the coffee if you said you were going to coffee 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:31.319
 what good is not true because we come back 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:33.360
 I say that if I'm going to win this game 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:34.830
 because this map created a while ago I won 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.999
 I do not remember but I have to win 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.669
 guys, I have to win this game 

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:40.560
 ok for you to see if I can if it was not 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:42.360
 no way what color am I in there I'm blue it was 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.050
 blue to see to see to see from the 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:49.749
 we locked up perfect so chepo so who 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:53.289
 comes after me comes a box 

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:55.879
 and no no no no no 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:58.069
 I can not believe it happened to the 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:06:01.279
 side guys I did not see I think I also what 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:02.629
 I took or they took it was blue and not 

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:05.960
 it may be I would like to be like that 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:09.580
 phosphorescent look you see more look 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.580
 they kissed cbs 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:15.450
 and circled here he died but know 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.610
 who wins the pink the orange already 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:20.010
 lost is the pink the purple 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:23.340
 white gray coffee brown purple 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:28.500
 new purple is not what colors are are 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:31.640
 almost equal in rosita and that to see how 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.640
 happens is starting 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.960
 they saw guys and nothing happened to them I think 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.120
 that if you hit the one in front of you lose 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.030
 but if the others arrive, but I do not believe 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.600
 that takes a lot of speed of the pink and 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.600
 good does not matter 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:51.510
 How did that 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:54.120
 went around and I'm going to the purple the 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:56.570
 true because you see that you will win you see 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.570
 who will win 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:04.720

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.780
