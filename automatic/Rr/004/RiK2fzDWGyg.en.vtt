00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
and that's all I'm doing here so now

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
and that's all I'm doing here so now
I've<00:03:05.810> got<00:03:06.050> some<00:03:07.930> more<00:03:08.930> purple

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
I've got some more purple

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.570 
I've got some more purple
I<00:03:09.650> want<00:03:10.220> it<00:03:10.310> quite<00:03:10.610> dark<00:03:10.940> I<00:03:12.190> don't<00:03:13.190> want<00:03:13.340> it<00:03:13.430> to

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
I want it quite dark I don't want it to

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.960 
I want it quite dark I don't want it to
be<00:03:13.730> too<00:03:13.970> wet<00:03:14.270> so<00:03:14.860> I<00:03:15.860> might<00:03:16.100> just<00:03:16.130> blot<00:03:16.730> it<00:03:16.910> a

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
be too wet so I might just blot it a

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.760 
be too wet so I might just blot it a
little<00:03:17.209> bit<00:03:17.390> on<00:03:17.570> the<00:03:17.690> blotting<00:03:17.930> paper<00:03:18.290> here

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
little bit on the blotting paper here

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.920 
little bit on the blotting paper here
and<00:03:20.050> in<00:03:21.050> this<00:03:21.230> demonstration<00:03:21.650> I'm<00:03:22.400> just

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
and in this demonstration I'm just

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:30.850 
and in this demonstration I'm just
touching<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:25.220> point<00:03:25.580> of<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:26.120> paintbrush<00:03:29.860> to

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
touching the point of the paintbrush to

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.460 
touching the point of the paintbrush to
the<00:03:30.980> beginning<00:03:31.370> of<00:03:31.610> the<00:03:32.050> sort<00:03:33.050> of<00:03:33.140> the<00:03:33.230> base<00:03:33.440> of

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
the beginning of the sort of the base of

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.760 
the beginning of the sort of the base of
the<00:03:33.739> petal<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:34.459> you'll<00:03:34.970> see<00:03:35.239> the<00:03:36.200> watercolor

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
the petal and you'll see the watercolor

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.390 
the petal and you'll see the watercolor
basically<00:03:37.489> spreads<00:03:37.910> and<00:03:38.270> does<00:03:39.020> the<00:03:39.230> work<00:03:39.470> of

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.729 

actually<00:03:43.400> getting<00:03:44.209> your<00:03:44.390> dark<00:03:44.780> your<00:03:45.260> medium

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
actually getting your dark your medium

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.090 
actually getting your dark your medium
and<00:03:45.920> your<00:03:46.640> light<00:03:47.260> colors<00:03:48.260> in<00:03:48.470> your<00:03:48.560> sweet<00:03:48.860> pea

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
and your light colors in your sweet pea

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.290 
and your light colors in your sweet pea
and<00:03:49.370> that's<00:03:49.880> it<00:03:50.830> you<00:03:51.830> can<00:03:52.070> actually<00:03:52.489> have<00:03:52.970> fun

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
and that's it you can actually have fun

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:02.199 
and that's it you can actually have fun
with<00:03:53.510> this<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:55.270> do<00:03:56.270> some<00:03:57.610> other<00:04:01.150> sort<00:04:02.150> of

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
with this and do some other sort of

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.510 
with this and do some other sort of
variations<00:04:02.900> of<00:04:03.140> purple<00:04:03.620> but<00:04:03.800> basically

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
variations of purple but basically

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.009 
variations of purple but basically
that's<00:04:04.820> the<00:04:06.280> that's<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.520> trick<00:04:07.880> to<00:04:08.180> getting

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
that's the that's the trick to getting

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.590 
that's the that's the trick to getting
your<00:04:09.170> lights<00:04:09.590> and<00:04:09.980> darks<00:04:10.550> and<00:04:10.790> medium<00:04:11.150> purples

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
your lights and darks and medium purples

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.729 
your lights and darks and medium purples
with<00:04:11.810> watercolors<00:04:12.500> and<00:04:12.680> this<00:04:14.200> petal<00:04:15.200> has<00:04:15.440> to

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
with watercolors and this petal has to

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.210 
with watercolors and this petal has to
actually<00:04:16.400> be<00:04:17.060> wet<00:04:17.750> in<00:04:18.169> order<00:04:18.500> for<00:04:18.830> you<00:04:18.919> to<00:04:18.950> drop

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
actually be wet in order for you to drop

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.550 
actually be wet in order for you to drop
color<00:04:19.580> in<00:04:19.850> and<00:04:20.180> for<00:04:20.419> the<00:04:20.510> color<00:04:20.720> to<00:04:20.989> spread<00:04:21.320> so

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
color in and for the color to spread so

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.250 
color in and for the color to spread so
here<00:04:21.770> it<00:04:21.830> is<00:04:21.979> again<00:04:22.600> and<00:04:23.600> this<00:04:23.750> is<00:04:23.900> getting<00:04:24.200> a

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
here it is again and this is getting a

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.860 
here it is again and this is getting a
little<00:04:24.410> bit<00:04:24.680> dry

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
little bit dry

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.860 
little bit dry
so<00:04:26.870> you'll<00:04:27.050> notice<00:04:27.290> that<00:04:27.500> this<00:04:27.950> spread<00:04:28.370> is<00:04:29.180> a

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
so you'll notice that this spread is a

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.970 
so you'll notice that this spread is a
little<00:04:30.320> slower<00:04:31.100> and<00:04:31.550> you<00:04:32.480> get<00:04:32.720> a<00:04:32.750> much<00:04:33.170> sort<00:04:33.890> of

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
little slower and you get a much sort of

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.890 
little slower and you get a much sort of
deeper<00:04:34.490> darker<00:04:35.480> purple<00:04:36.410> at<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:36.980> base<00:04:37.160> of<00:04:37.490> your

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
deeper darker purple at the base of your

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.400 
deeper darker purple at the base of your
sweet<00:04:38.900> pea

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
sweet pea

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:45.910 
sweet pea
and<00:04:41.710> another<00:04:43.000> will<00:04:44.000> do<00:04:44.150> a<00:04:44.180> third<00:04:44.600> one<00:04:44.770> just<00:04:45.770> to

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
and another will do a third one just to

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.730 
and another will do a third one just to
see<00:04:46.130> the<00:04:46.280> difference<00:04:46.730> in<00:04:46.970> what<00:04:47.930> happens<00:04:48.410> when

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
see the difference in what happens when

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.970 
see the difference in what happens when
the<00:04:49.370> pedal<00:04:50.150> is<00:04:50.420> sort<00:04:51.110> of<00:04:51.170> really<00:04:51.530> wet<00:04:51.740> to

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
the pedal is sort of really wet to

00:04:51.980 --> 00:05:00.720 
the pedal is sort of really wet to
medium<00:04:52.340> wet<00:04:52.550> and<00:04:52.760> now<00:04:53.180> this<00:04:53.390> is<00:04:53.600> quite<00:04:53.870> dry<00:04:54.200> and

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.370 

we'll<00:05:01.730> start<00:05:02.030> with<00:05:02.210> dropping<00:05:02.540> some<00:05:02.900> color<00:05:03.110> in

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
we'll start with dropping some color in

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.520 
we'll start with dropping some color in
here<00:05:05.410> and<00:05:07.240> it<00:05:08.240> just<00:05:08.450> sort<00:05:08.570> of<00:05:08.690> pools<00:05:09.020> at<00:05:09.380> the

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
here and it just sort of pools at the

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.880 
here and it just sort of pools at the
base<00:05:09.740> of<00:05:10.540> the<00:05:11.540> sweet<00:05:11.810> pea<00:05:12.020> here<00:05:12.320> so<00:05:12.560> one<00:05:12.710> of<00:05:12.740> the

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
base of the sweet pea here so one of the

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.820 
base of the sweet pea here so one of the
tricks<00:05:13.130> that<00:05:13.430> you<00:05:13.550> can<00:05:13.760> use<00:05:14.380> to<00:05:15.380> spread<00:05:15.620> the

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
tricks that you can use to spread the

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.260 
tricks that you can use to spread the
color<00:05:16.070> when<00:05:16.970> the<00:05:17.810> pedal<00:05:18.110> is<00:05:18.230> a<00:05:18.320> bit<00:05:18.500> drier<00:05:19.430> is

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
color when the pedal is a bit drier is

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:26.890 
color when the pedal is a bit drier is
just<00:05:20.780> tilt<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:25.580> whole<00:05:25.850> piece<00:05:26.180> of<00:05:26.360> watercolor

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
just tilt the whole piece of watercolor

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.210 
just tilt the whole piece of watercolor
paper<00:05:27.020> and<00:05:29.080> it<00:05:30.080> will<00:05:30.200> just<00:05:30.410> follow<00:05:30.680> some<00:05:31.190> of

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
paper and it will just follow some of

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.220 
paper and it will just follow some of
the<00:05:32.290> the<00:05:33.290> wet<00:05:33.530> sections<00:05:34.660> but<00:05:35.660> that's<00:05:35.840> as<00:05:36.020> far

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.230 
the the wet sections but that's as far

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.770 
the the wet sections but that's as far
as<00:05:36.290> it's<00:05:36.560> going<00:05:36.680> to<00:05:36.740> get<00:05:36.950> it's<00:05:37.280> pretty<00:05:38.180> dry<00:05:38.450> so

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
as it's going to get it's pretty dry so

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.020 
as it's going to get it's pretty dry so
it's<00:05:39.350> just<00:05:39.500> going<00:05:39.740> to<00:05:39.800> sit<00:05:40.100> and<00:05:40.730> you<00:05:40.820> get<00:05:41.000> a

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
it's just going to sit and you get a

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.250 
it's just going to sit and you get a
totally<00:05:41.480> different<00:05:41.870> effect<00:05:41.960> that<00:05:42.440> way<00:05:43.870> so<00:05:44.870> I

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
totally different effect that way so I

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.000 
totally different effect that way so I
hope<00:05:45.500> you'll<00:05:45.740> have<00:05:45.800> fun<00:05:45.950> putting<00:05:46.640> some

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
hope you'll have fun putting some

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.670 
hope you'll have fun putting some
watercolor<00:05:49.690> impressions<00:05:50.690> of<00:05:50.960> a<00:05:51.110> sweet<00:05:51.440> pea

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
watercolor impressions of a sweet pea

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.820 
watercolor impressions of a sweet pea
together<00:05:52.130> and<00:05:52.540> I<00:05:53.540> hope<00:05:54.020> you<00:05:54.230> enjoyed<00:05:54.590> this
