00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.379
 so people welcome to 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.690
 next trick main programmed 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:25.109
 tutorial this time again about one 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:28.020
 improved version 3.0 and me 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.769
 has recently the program 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.600
 only works from the computer 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.460
 croft version 1.4 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.200
 so if only if you are normal 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.590
 Ticket klassik plays this 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.440
 program does not work there is there 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.700
 the commands drop quarter and do 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.739
 Sack did not exist yet 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:52.200
 So that the turtle something in a box 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:55.739
 lies and something pulls out only 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.649
 so much on the edge so what does that matter 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.210
 program the program the program yes 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.369
 sure the turtle digs down 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.369
 you also use ladders with yourself 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.889
 can climb down us usually occurs 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.810
 and comes back up loads it all in 

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:21.709
 the crate and I can do it 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.709
 demonstrate in the beginning you have to be great 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:31.570
 i need cabbage m 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:35.500
 The turtle needs a drive 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.580
 and you have to do that to him otherwise 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.220
 could forget that that yourself 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:45.229
 somehow moved then they stand on the 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:48.700
 turn around in the circle and that 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.700
 brings nothing but you have to enter 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.479
 and now the turtle 5040 can take steps 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.700
 went 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:10.459
 at the 3000 kilometers you have to 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.870
 the program download the pace pin code 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.870
 is in the description 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:22.730
 the program paceman is also included 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:26.300
 computer power preinstalled at least 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.270
 because 1.5 already knows with 4 now I know 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:34.610
 I do not know if it's already in there but could 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:38.900
 let's see is the red then the code 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.470
 and then the name of the program 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.340
 wanted to save beer on the quarter 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.019
 that does not matter 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.840
 you can exit their mining or 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:52.430
 allegedly go now times 1 1 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:59.920
 download so finished and now have to 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.920
 we start now wobble into the lot 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.069
 123 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:12.819
 Now many bloggers are asked 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:15.010
 she should educate the hurdle 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.430
 we're going to demonstrate 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.730
 I'm giving away a bit six times 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.590
 The richard lau has space as we go 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:28.260
 so the titles should be below like 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:32.290
 many courses now say two and see 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.450
 then she needs the caps if you 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:40.780
 in guyana is in the wall so if 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:42.599
 Now here for example but then would be 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.290
 The turtle would be here automatically 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:52.260
 Cabinetets hopefully so 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.260
 understandable as suddenly until mo 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.690
 Also, if the titles are here on this 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.200
 This way is fast away 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:08.440
 otherwise they will come again and 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:10.139
 says then you have to follow 123 blocks 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:15.100
 go ahead and put a box here 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:19.150
 Because that's where it's going to be 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:21.100
 zeug finally fool the others 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.320
 condition you see here already everywhere earth 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.940
 keystone I do that the tutorial 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:33.690
 already for the third time now 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:33.690
 either extremely hip or sometimes micro 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:42.610
 but it is ready soon so sees one 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.150
 strip then as you can in the program 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:49.229
 you would have to meditate yourself just 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.229
 a variable change 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.690
 then she comes back and puts that 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.610
 all she has now is all she has 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:03.550
 Alright , this is here and now 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:08.349
 Not so much because we are pumping though 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:11.560
 also height 233 and that's a flat her 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:12.700
 so here it can be except this box 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.020
 needs of his may not be such a crisis 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.800
 also be a crystal test 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:25.140
 and that's where the whole thing is more 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:28.570
 Christel just has more space so that's it 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:31.750
 show if I do not explain now 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:36.010
 I will not run like this 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:39.159
 So the wet program could 31 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:42.520
 you see that's a lot but if you 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:43.289
 want that the deeper gears must be created 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.240
 you here 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:48.240
 They change 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.870
 however, it goes down here as well 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.870
 still sometimes she mentions 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:05.370
 if I pass that will be down here yet 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:12.180
 I'm not that I believe that 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:14.650
 only one time is here again pull 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.840
 But you have to change that too 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:24.729
 do not forget you saw it well 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:26.500
 are just under 200 lines and that is why 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:28.590
 it would be a bit long 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.030
 take all the time to explain if you are 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.770
 I really wanted to print since then 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.990
 now I'm the genetically pushed 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:39.220
 then of course I can do that 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:43.949
 explicit request and now again to 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:46.090
 you should prevent this 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:47.710
 program for any reasons of 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.310
 Pace I can not download 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:56.470
 and I would have to write it down to you 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:58.690
 Do not want to wait 200 and you get 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.909
 an error message is then there 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.669
 mostly two numbers and one after 

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:06.130
 a colon that usually stands 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:08.849
 still after a square cling the 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:12.669
 this number gradually the colon 

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:13.990
 that's the line numbers in the 

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:19.509
 error has occurred 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:21.909
 then he looks the time when 

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:23.979
 For example, she looked at line 20 

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:25.680
 here its 20 this would be this one then 

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:28.630
 Do you have any errors in it? 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:33.340
 that makes this error message the 

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:36.419
 Do not turtle in vain so that's it 

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:40.389
 Do not forget to start review because otherwise 

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:46.810
 she does not work but that 's it 

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:48.610
 actually programmed now by 555 

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:53.139
 in the back, she sees the sixth and there 

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:54.540
 the 70 but the first come to a 

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:56.880
 later point in time 

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.500
 so i'm gonna finish i'm out 

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.040
 hopefully you have fun with that 

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.000
 program 

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.000
 See you
