00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.570
 Ah 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.809
 5 ah 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.190
 Jonah 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.990
 4 2 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:36.500
 The old king of Israel 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:38.579
 One day, God appeared to Yoona. 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:46.470
 He said. 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:49.800
 Jonah , you will go to Nunu's city and the city will be destroyed by iniquity. 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:55.769
 Let them know. 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:58.469
 But Jonah had never heard God's command aboard a large boat from God 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:04.619
 I was going to run away. 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:10.470
 But God knew where Jonah was. 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:13.440
 It caused a big storm of the sea in the sea, so that the ship would be shaken violently. 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.820
 The sea was getting honey 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:21.320
 Suddenly a storm g 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:27.720
 Maybe there is a God once sit wife in labor 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:32.940
 Let's figure out who we are for the storm and figure out the jab. 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:37.230
 So they did a lot, and Jonah was picked. 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:40.530
 Jonah did not tell people the truth. 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:45.870
 Everyone's wrong with me. 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:48.240
 Because I go away disobeyed the word of God, God will punish me 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:55.340
 You are going to do it. 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.340
 Please throw the former into the sea then the sea will become calm 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:03.370
 So they threw Jonah into the sea. 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:09.369
 Then the angry waves were really quiet. 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:11.440
 Suddenly, a large fish appears in Yoona who falls into the sea . 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.490
 I swallowed it. 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:20.740
 This fish uses the fish sent by God . 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:26.530
 Jonah spent three days and nights in the fish belly . 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:28.720
 And regretting that he had escaped from the command of God and forgave God 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.550
 I begged you. 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.980
 The Lord God 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:40.739
 Forgive us our foolishness and give us mercy. 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:45.300
 Write to obey the word of the Lord 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:48.510
 After three days, God heard the prayer of the day, 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:54.569
 You made Jonah 9 in the fish belly . 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:03:00.840
 Jonah ran to the castle of Inu as God commanded and shouted. 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:06.170
 You've said that God should destroy 41 Reason Back 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.170
 Come and repent and come back to God. 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:14.070
 To the people who heard this news , the king said to the people and servants , 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:20.280
 I did it. 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:25.710
 God did not bring disaster when the people of this brain sincerely treasured. 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:31.500
 But Jonah said, " God did not destroy the city of the brain , 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:34.290
 I was so angry at seeing that I was so angry and out of the castle 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:40.349
 I was sitting and resting. 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:46.560
 I protected the vine from the sunlight and made Yoona the shadow. 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:52.280
 Oh, this gum makes the shade. 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.280
 I'm cool now. 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:04:04.120
 But the next day God would eat the worms all over the vine. 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.120
 And then he dumped the gourd and died. 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:13.300
 It's really hot. 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:16.390
 God why Oz was flooded with a vine and blocked my light 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:23.080
 Are you taking the leaves now? 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:25.540
 It would be better for me to die in the hot weather of God . 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.990
 Jonah was angry. 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:33.610
 Then God said , 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:39.700
 Jonah, you did not even do the trick. 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:43.060
 He did not grow up, he just showed up overnight and disappeared overnight 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:48.550
 Make a vine that room one evil 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:52.080
 Even more than 120,000 people are mistaken for accounting the people of the Association for their 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:59.280
 Do not you feel sorry for me? 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:05:01.850
 5 For God, who is clothed with grace, and loving, forgave a foolish servant 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.850
 Please 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:10.870
 These words are Jonah realized his folly to forgive God 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.870
 I did it.
