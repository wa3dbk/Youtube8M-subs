I<00:00:21.189> use<00:00:22.000> my<00:00:22.180> Porter<00:00:22.480> Cable<00:00:22.660> chop<00:00:23.050> saw<00:00:23.320> over<00:00:23.619> here

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
I use my Porter Cable chop saw over here

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.510 
I use my Porter Cable chop saw over here
just<00:00:25.570> see<00:00:25.720> your<00:00:25.840> bracelet<00:00:26.020> chop<00:00:26.380> saw<00:00:26.680> to<00:00:27.310> cope

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
just see your bracelet chop saw to cope

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.420 
just see your bracelet chop saw to cope
the<00:00:27.550> ends<00:00:28.090> I<00:00:28.240> tried<00:00:28.810> using<00:00:29.050> some<00:00:29.430> bi-metal

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
the ends I tried using some bi-metal

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.130 
the ends I tried using some bi-metal
hole<00:00:30.730> saws<00:00:30.970> and<00:00:31.300> that<00:00:31.420> didn't<00:00:31.630> work<00:00:31.779> out<00:00:31.929> too

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
hole saws and that didn't work out too

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.600 
hole saws and that didn't work out too
well<00:00:32.169> in<00:00:32.470> my<00:00:32.559> drill<00:00:32.830> press<00:00:32.860> I<00:00:33.250> just<00:00:33.430> didn't

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
well in my drill press I just didn't

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.829 
well in my drill press I just didn't
have<00:00:33.760> a<00:00:33.790> good<00:00:33.940> enough<00:00:34.150> way<00:00:34.330> to<00:00:34.390> clamp<00:00:34.720> them

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:34.839 
have a good enough way to clamp them

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:37.979 
have a good enough way to clamp them
down<00:00:34.900> so<00:00:35.970> hopefully<00:00:36.970> in<00:00:37.059> near<00:00:37.480> future<00:00:37.750> I'll<00:00:37.960> be

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
down so hopefully in near future I'll be

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.840 
down so hopefully in near future I'll be
getting<00:00:38.500> a<00:00:40.650> tubing<00:00:41.650> notcher<00:00:42.040> a<00:00:42.129> good<00:00:42.400> a<00:00:42.580> good

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
getting a tubing notcher a good a good

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.200 
getting a tubing notcher a good a good
one<00:00:43.920> anyway

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
one anyway

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.170 
one anyway
I've<00:00:46.570> got<00:00:46.750> everything<00:00:46.989> clamped<00:00:47.470> down<00:00:47.500> I<00:00:48.180> did

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
I've got everything clamped down I did

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.700 
I've got everything clamped down I did
this<00:00:49.299> for<00:00:49.479> a<00:00:49.570> couple<00:00:49.600> reasons<00:00:49.989> number<00:00:50.290> one

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
this for a couple reasons number one

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.950 
this for a couple reasons number one
this<00:00:50.890> tube<00:00:51.220> here<00:00:51.489> needs<00:00:52.210> to<00:00:52.330> be<00:00:52.449> perfectly<00:00:52.869> in

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
this tube here needs to be perfectly in

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.039 
this tube here needs to be perfectly in
line<00:00:53.080> with<00:00:53.260> this<00:00:53.559> top<00:00:53.860> rail<00:00:54.190> so<00:00:54.879> that's<00:00:55.839> one

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:56.049 
line with this top rail so that's one

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:58.560 
line with this top rail so that's one
reason<00:00:56.260> the<00:00:56.949> second<00:00:57.369> reason<00:00:57.489> is<00:00:57.879> is<00:00:58.269> this

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
reason the second reason is is this

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.380 
reason the second reason is is this
tubing<00:00:59.080> no<00:00:59.680> matter<00:00:59.890> no<00:01:00.250> matter<00:01:00.489> what<00:01:01.030> because

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
tubing no matter no matter what because

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.149 
tubing no matter no matter what because
it's<00:01:01.869> you<00:01:02.170> know<00:01:02.199> especially<00:01:02.530> because<00:01:02.890> it's<00:01:03.040> so

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159 
it's you know especially because it's so

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:05.670 
it's you know especially because it's so
thin<00:01:03.430> wall<00:01:03.610> it's<00:01:04.449> going<00:01:04.629> to<00:01:04.720> tend<00:01:04.960> band<00:01:05.409> and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
thin wall it's going to tend band and

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.899 
thin wall it's going to tend band and
stuff<00:01:05.950> when<00:01:06.189> you<00:01:06.250> get<00:01:06.369> it<00:01:06.430> from<00:01:06.520> the<00:01:06.670> steel

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
stuff when you get it from the steel

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:08.600 
stuff when you get it from the steel
supplier<00:01:07.299> they've<00:01:07.570> had<00:01:07.750> it<00:01:07.869> sitting<00:01:08.049> on<00:01:08.200> racks

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
supplier they've had it sitting on racks

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.340 
supplier they've had it sitting on racks
when<00:01:09.610> they<00:01:09.700> clamp<00:01:09.939> it<00:01:10.119> down<00:01:10.299> or<00:01:10.600> strap<00:01:11.080> it<00:01:11.229> down

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
when they clamp it down or strap it down

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.840 
when they clamp it down or strap it down
on<00:01:11.500> their<00:01:11.650> trucks<00:01:11.979> you<00:01:12.220> can<00:01:12.340> get<00:01:12.460> into<00:01:12.580> small

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
on their trucks you can get into small

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.820 
on their trucks you can get into small
little<00:01:13.030> bends<00:01:13.479> here<00:01:13.630> and<00:01:13.810> there

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
little bends here and there

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.020 
little bends here and there
so<00:01:15.460> I'm<00:01:15.670> dealing<00:01:16.299> with<00:01:16.330> some<00:01:16.600> of<00:01:16.750> that<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:18.640> the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
so I'm dealing with some of that so the

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.540 
so I'm dealing with some of that so the
goal<00:01:19.240> is<00:01:19.480> to<00:01:19.510> clamp<00:01:19.930> it<00:01:20.080> all<00:01:20.230> flat<00:01:20.500> then<00:01:21.190> get<00:01:21.400> my

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
goal is to clamp it all flat then get my

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.060 
goal is to clamp it all flat then get my
welds<00:01:22.000> on<00:01:22.120> because<00:01:22.480> once<00:01:22.660> I<00:01:22.780> get<00:01:23.380> my<00:01:23.500> tax<00:01:23.830> in

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
welds on because once I get my tax in

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.930 
welds on because once I get my tax in
place<00:01:24.340> then<00:01:25.120> I<00:01:25.150> won't<00:01:25.450> have<00:01:25.630> any<00:01:25.780> issues<00:01:26.020> with

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
place then I won't have any issues with

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.910 
place then I won't have any issues with
something<00:01:27.940> being<00:01:28.150> slightly<00:01:28.510> off<00:01:28.840> and<00:01:29.290> then

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
something being slightly off and then

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.070 
something being slightly off and then
welding<00:01:30.880> it<00:01:31.030> slightly<00:01:31.270> off<00:01:31.570> and<00:01:31.870> then<00:01:31.960> I'm

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
welding it slightly off and then I'm

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.649 
welding it slightly off and then I'm
fighting<00:01:32.440> it<00:01:32.560> rather<00:01:32.830> flatten<00:01:33.460> it<00:01:33.550> out<00:01:33.670> then

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
fighting it rather flatten it out then

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.930 
fighting it rather flatten it out then
weld<00:01:34.960> it<00:01:35.200> so<00:01:35.409> that<00:01:35.620> this<00:01:36.220> way<00:01:36.460> hopefully

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
weld it so that this way hopefully

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.840 
weld it so that this way hopefully
eventually<00:01:37.690> if<00:01:37.810> I<00:01:37.960> keep<00:01:38.010> you<00:01:39.010> know<00:01:39.040> flattening

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
eventually if I keep you know flattening

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.880 
eventually if I keep you know flattening
it<00:01:40.090> out<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.540> adding<00:01:41.290> the<00:01:41.380> metal<00:01:41.650> where<00:01:41.800> it

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
it out and adding the metal where it

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.590 
it out and adding the metal where it
needs<00:01:42.100> to<00:01:42.190> go<00:01:42.280> that<00:01:42.670> it'll<00:01:42.850> it'll<00:01:43.180> keep<00:01:43.450> it

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
needs to go that it'll it'll keep it

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.140 
needs to go that it'll it'll keep it
flat<00:01:43.990> so<00:01:45.990> that's<00:01:46.990> why<00:01:47.140> I<00:01:47.200> have<00:01:47.409> that<00:01:48.030> one<00:01:49.030> thing

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
flat so that's why I have that one thing

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.730 
flat so that's why I have that one thing
I<00:01:49.240> wanted<00:01:49.479> to<00:01:49.540> point<00:01:49.810> out<00:01:50.050> now<00:01:50.080> that<00:01:50.500> I<00:01:50.530> brought

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
I wanted to point out now that I brought

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.680 
I wanted to point out now that I brought
up<00:01:50.800> the<00:01:51.070> fact<00:01:51.220> that<00:01:51.370> the<00:01:51.550> metal<00:01:51.820> is<00:01:51.850> bent<00:01:52.150> when

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
up the fact that the metal is bent when

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.480 
up the fact that the metal is bent when
you<00:01:52.780> put<00:01:52.990> these<00:01:53.110> cross<00:01:53.440> tubes<00:01:53.860> in<00:01:54.130> never

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
you put these cross tubes in never

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.580 
you put these cross tubes in never
assume<00:01:54.909> that<00:01:54.940> those<00:01:55.270> are<00:01:55.450> straight<00:01:55.780> okay<00:01:56.290> like

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
assume that those are straight okay like

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.700 
assume that those are straight okay like
this<00:01:56.770> one<00:01:56.950> here<00:01:57.220> is<00:01:57.310> really<00:01:57.760> bent<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:59.170> have<00:01:59.560> it

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
this one here is really bent I have it

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.560 
this one here is really bent I have it
lined<00:01:59.920> up<00:02:00.100> here<00:02:00.340> on<00:02:00.430> the<00:02:00.520> mark<00:02:00.760> I<00:02:01.000> squared<00:02:01.420> it

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
lined up here on the mark I squared it

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.630 
lined up here on the mark I squared it
up<00:02:01.720> with<00:02:01.870> this<00:02:01.990> outside<00:02:02.470> tube<00:02:02.799> and<00:02:03.400> we're

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
up with this outside tube and we're

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.340 
up with this outside tube and we're
about<00:02:03.729> a<00:02:03.850> quarter<00:02:04.150> of<00:02:04.450> an<00:02:04.570> inch<00:02:04.690> off<00:02:04.990> over

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
about a quarter of an inch off over

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.890 
about a quarter of an inch off over
there<00:02:05.500> now<00:02:06.490> some<00:02:06.880> of<00:02:06.909> these<00:02:07.120> like<00:02:07.479> this<00:02:07.659> one

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
there now some of these like this one

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.440 
there now some of these like this one
here<00:02:08.259> there's<00:02:09.009> a<00:02:09.099> little<00:02:09.369> bit<00:02:09.519> off<00:02:09.759> as<00:02:10.149> well

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
here there's a little bit off as well

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
here there's a little bit off as well
but<00:02:11.230> not<00:02:11.440> nearly<00:02:11.680> as<00:02:11.890> bad<00:02:12.099> as<00:02:12.310> this<00:02:12.489> one<00:02:12.549> so<00:02:13.470> I'm

but not nearly as bad as this one so I'm

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.350 
but not nearly as bad as this one so I'm
going<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.739> tack<00:02:14.980> on<00:02:15.190> this<00:02:15.430> side<00:02:15.670> then<00:02:16.239> I'm

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
going to tack on this side then I'm

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.670

the truck you see I'm using these old
cheapo<00:03:00.030> levels<00:03:01.030> got<00:03:01.989> one<00:03:02.170> on<00:03:02.319> the<00:03:02.410> truck<00:03:03.150> one

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
cheapo levels got one on the truck one

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.580 
cheapo levels got one on the truck one
on<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:04.390> rack<00:03:05.160> on<00:03:06.900> all<00:03:07.900> three<00:03:08.349> of<00:03:08.379> those

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
on the rack on all three of those

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.830 
on the rack on all three of those
locations<00:03:09.099> basically<00:03:10.000> what<00:03:10.150> I'm<00:03:10.269> doing<00:03:10.299> is

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
locations basically what I'm doing is

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.199 
locations basically what I'm doing is
I'm<00:03:11.019> trying<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.349> get<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.730> thing<00:03:12.730> centered

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
I'm trying to get the thing centered

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.740 
I'm trying to get the thing centered
this<00:03:13.480> direction<00:03:15.150> I'm<00:03:16.150> trying<00:03:16.450> to<00:03:16.540> make<00:03:16.720> sure

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
this direction I'm trying to make sure

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.380 
this direction I'm trying to make sure
it's<00:03:17.260> as<00:03:17.379> far<00:03:17.739> back<00:03:18.010> as<00:03:18.280> I<00:03:18.400> want<00:03:18.700> it<00:03:18.909> which<00:03:19.239> is

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
it's as far back as I want it which is

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:27.289 
it's as far back as I want it which is
going<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.569> be<00:03:19.750> right<00:03:19.959> here<00:03:23.700> if<00:03:24.700> you<00:03:24.849> look<00:03:25.030> here

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
going to be right here if you look here

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.610 
going to be right here if you look here
looks<00:03:28.299> like<00:03:28.420> it's<00:03:28.720> pretty<00:03:29.019> much<00:03:29.260> centered

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
looks like it's pretty much centered

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.280 
looks like it's pretty much centered
left<00:03:29.859> to<00:03:30.040> right<00:03:30.250> so<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:33.280> looks<00:03:33.579> like<00:03:34.139> we've<00:03:35.139> got

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
left to right so it looks like we've got

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.879 
left to right so it looks like we've got
a<00:03:35.349> 90<00:03:35.739> degree<00:03:36.540> angle<00:03:37.540> here<00:03:37.569> for<00:03:38.440> this<00:03:38.590> mount

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
a 90 degree angle here for this mount

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:40.979 
a 90 degree angle here for this mount
and<00:03:39.609> that's<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.180> way<00:03:40.299> all<00:03:40.510> four<00:03:40.780> of<00:03:40.810> the

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
and that's the way all four of the

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.470 
and that's the way all four of the
mounts<00:03:41.349> are<00:03:41.500> those<00:03:42.310> are<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.609> original<00:03:42.730> mounts

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
mounts are those are the original mounts

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.930 
mounts are those are the original mounts
that<00:03:43.510> I<00:03:43.630> had<00:03:43.840> from<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:45.340> roof<00:03:45.519> rack<00:03:45.730> that<00:03:45.879> I

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
that I had from the roof rack that I

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.599 
that I had from the roof rack that I
took<00:03:46.000> off<00:03:46.359> of<00:03:46.569> here<00:03:46.780> so<00:03:46.930> that's<00:03:47.889> nine<00:03:48.190> degrees

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
took off of here so that's nine degrees

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.039 
took off of here so that's nine degrees
what<00:03:48.849> I'm<00:03:48.940> thinking<00:03:49.180> about<00:03:49.389> doing<00:03:49.629> is<00:03:49.840> just

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
what I'm thinking about doing is just

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.440 
what I'm thinking about doing is just
taking<00:03:50.410> a<00:03:50.500> piece<00:03:50.950> of<00:03:51.129> plate<00:03:51.370> drilling<00:03:52.329> those

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
taking a piece of plate drilling those

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.640 
taking a piece of plate drilling those
holes<00:03:53.639> bolting<00:03:54.639> it<00:03:54.760> down<00:03:54.900> then<00:03:55.900> taking<00:03:56.319> the<00:03:56.440> 1

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
holes bolting it down then taking the 1

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.170 
holes bolting it down then taking the 1
inch<00:03:56.919> tube

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
inch tube

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.920 
inch tube
90<00:03:59.109> degree<00:03:59.440> cut<00:03:59.879> so<00:04:00.879> it<00:04:00.970> comes<00:04:01.209> up<00:04:01.449> at<00:04:01.599> a<00:04:01.690> 90

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
90 degree cut so it comes up at a 90

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.539 
90 degree cut so it comes up at a 90
degree<00:04:02.079> angle<00:04:02.319> which<00:04:02.889> will<00:04:03.069> bring<00:04:03.280> it<00:04:03.430> out

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
degree angle which will bring it out

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.809 
degree angle which will bring it out
more<00:04:04.510> towards<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:05.019> edge<00:04:05.139> of<00:04:05.379> this<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:05.889> then

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
more towards the edge of this and then

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.089 
more towards the edge of this and then
I've<00:04:06.940> got<00:04:07.150> a<00:04:07.180> fab<00:04:07.480> rep<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:07.900> little<00:04:08.410> floor<00:04:08.799> type

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
I've got a fab rep a little floor type

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.729 
I've got a fab rep a little floor type
mount<00:04:09.400> on<00:04:09.699> the<00:04:09.790> bottom<00:04:10.150> of<00:04:10.269> this<00:04:10.739> bottom

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
mount on the bottom of this bottom

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.159 
mount on the bottom of this bottom
section<00:04:11.949> of<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.310> rack<00:04:12.549> on<00:04:12.879> all<00:04:13.480> four<00:04:13.810> sections

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169 
section of the rack on all four sections

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:17.270 
section of the rack on all four sections
so<00:04:14.680> that<00:04:14.709> it<00:04:15.430> can<00:04:15.669> bolt<00:04:15.940> together<00:04:16.359> up<00:04:16.630> here<00:04:16.959> as

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
so that it can bolt together up here as

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.969 
so that it can bolt together up here as
well<00:04:18.280> as<00:04:18.549> down<00:04:18.579> here<00:04:19.229> the<00:04:20.229> reason<00:04:20.560> why<00:04:20.680> I'm

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
well as down here the reason why I'm

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:22.800 
well as down here the reason why I'm
going<00:04:21.099> to<00:04:21.250> have<00:04:21.430> it<00:04:21.549> bolt<00:04:21.789> it<00:04:21.970> bolt<00:04:22.479> together

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
going to have it bolt it bolt together

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.930 
going to have it bolt it bolt together
there<00:04:23.139> too<00:04:23.440> is<00:04:23.710> because<00:04:24.099> this<00:04:24.370> is<00:04:24.550> only<00:04:24.699> going

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
there too is because this is only going

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.290 
there too is because this is only going
to<00:04:25.000> be<00:04:25.150> maybe<00:04:25.389> about<00:04:25.979> I've<00:04:26.979> got<00:04:27.639> to<00:04:27.849> figure<00:04:27.970> out

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
to be maybe about I've got to figure out

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.939 
to be maybe about I've got to figure out
maybe<00:04:28.510> about<00:04:28.780> three-quarters<00:04:29.530> of<00:04:29.560> an<00:04:29.830> inch

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
maybe about three-quarters of an inch

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.360 
maybe about three-quarters of an inch
off<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.460> highest<00:04:30.639> point<00:04:31.090> of<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:31.300> roof<00:04:31.510> so<00:04:32.370> I

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
off the highest point of the roof so I

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.969 
off the highest point of the roof so I
want<00:04:34.150> to<00:04:34.240> be<00:04:34.360> able<00:04:34.510> to<00:04:34.690> and<00:04:35.289> because<00:04:35.830> there's

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
want to be able to and because there's

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:37.800 
want to be able to and because there's
going<00:04:36.099> to<00:04:36.160> be<00:04:36.220> expanded<00:04:36.820> steel<00:04:37.090> up<00:04:37.330> here<00:04:37.630> and

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
going to be expanded steel up here and

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.709 
going to be expanded steel up here and
it's<00:04:38.620> really<00:04:38.890> really<00:04:39.070> you<00:04:39.880> know<00:04:39.969> small

00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:40.719 
it's really really you know small

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:41.780 
it's really really you know small
expanded<00:04:41.409> steel

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
expanded steel

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.640 
expanded steel
you<00:04:42.120> know<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.720> diamonds<00:04:43.140> are<00:04:43.230> pretty<00:04:43.410> tight

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
you know the diamonds are pretty tight

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.980 
you know the diamonds are pretty tight
so<00:04:44.460> I'm<00:04:44.940> going<00:04:45.090> to<00:04:45.120> need<00:04:45.510> to<00:04:45.630> be<00:04:45.720> able<00:04:45.810> to

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
so I'm going to need to be able to

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.410 
so I'm going to need to be able to
unbolt<00:04:46.350> this<00:04:46.650> thing<00:04:46.980> without<00:04:47.760> messing<00:04:48.210> with

any of the the water silicone seal that
I<00:04:51.390> have<00:04:51.630> here<00:04:51.990> so<00:04:52.500> that<00:04:52.650> I<00:04:52.680> can<00:04:52.860> clean

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
I have here so that I can clean

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.100 
I have here so that I can clean
underneath<00:04:53.610> it<00:04:53.790> or<00:04:53.880> when<00:04:54.030> necessary

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.270 

anyway<00:04:58.110> that's<00:04:58.440> going<00:04:58.590> to<00:04:58.650> take<00:04:58.830> me<00:04:58.980> a<00:04:59.010> little

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
anyway that's going to take me a little

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.580 
anyway that's going to take me a little
bit<00:04:59.400> to<00:04:59.490> figure<00:04:59.670> out<00:04:59.940> so<00:05:00.210> I'm<00:05:00.240> going<00:05:00.480> to<00:05:00.590> stop

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
bit to figure out so I'm going to stop

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.710 
bit to figure out so I'm going to stop
this<00:05:01.800> video<00:05:02.010> after<00:05:02.490> I<00:05:02.550> show<00:05:02.790> you<00:05:02.820> the<00:05:03.120> expanded

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
this video after I show you the expanded

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.550 
this video after I show you the expanded
steel<00:05:06.470> this<00:05:07.470> is<00:05:07.680> the<00:05:07.830> first<00:05:08.130> section<00:05:08.700> of<00:05:08.850> it

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
steel this is the first section of it

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.020 
steel this is the first section of it
I'm<00:05:10.560> running<00:05:11.040> the<00:05:11.160> diamonds<00:05:12.440> this<00:05:13.440> would<00:05:13.650> be

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
I'm running the diamonds this would be

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.700 
I'm running the diamonds this would be
front<00:05:15.030> to<00:05:15.600> back<00:05:15.890> this<00:05:16.890> direction<00:05:18.440> this<00:05:19.440> was

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
front to back this direction this was

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.760 
front to back this direction this was
cut<00:05:20.130> so<00:05:20.490> that<00:05:21.330> it<00:05:21.480> sits<00:05:21.810> on<00:05:22.140> one<00:05:22.320> of<00:05:22.350> the<00:05:22.530> cross

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
cut so that it sits on one of the cross

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.950 
cut so that it sits on one of the cross
members<00:05:23.250> right<00:05:23.460> dead<00:05:23.670> center<00:05:23.700> and<00:05:24.270> then<00:05:24.810> I've

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
members right dead center and then I've

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.620 
members right dead center and then I've
got<00:05:25.140> to<00:05:25.290> graft<00:05:25.530> on<00:05:25.770> another<00:05:26.100> piece<00:05:26.600> that<00:05:27.600> a

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
got to graft on another piece that a

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.810 
got to graft on another piece that a
little<00:05:28.140> finish<00:05:28.440> it<00:05:28.590> out

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
little finish it out

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.040 
little finish it out
I've<00:05:30.390> already<00:05:31.040> notched<00:05:32.040> it<00:05:32.540> for<00:05:33.540> the<00:05:33.630> vertical

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
I've already notched it for the vertical

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.860 
I've already notched it for the vertical
tubes<00:05:34.470> that<00:05:34.770> are<00:05:34.890> going<00:05:34.980> to<00:05:35.040> go<00:05:35.220> in<00:05:35.430> there<00:05:35.870> and

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
tubes that are going to go in there and

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.870 
tubes that are going to go in there and
ground<00:05:37.350> the<00:05:37.680> areas<00:05:38.070> where<00:05:38.310> there's<00:05:38.700> going<00:05:38.820> to

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
ground the areas where there's going to

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.340 
ground the areas where there's going to
be<00:05:38.940> welds<00:05:39.420> clean<00:05:40.040> with<00:05:41.040> a<00:05:41.070> flap<00:05:41.370> disk<00:05:41.700> so<00:05:42.540> now<00:05:43.320> I

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
be welds clean with a flap disk so now I

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.920 
be welds clean with a flap disk so now I
just<00:05:43.530> got<00:05:43.770> to<00:05:43.920> work<00:05:44.220> on<00:05:45.050> the<00:05:46.050> foot<00:05:46.380> design<00:05:46.800> and
