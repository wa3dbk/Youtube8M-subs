00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
thick enough to be

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.140 
thick enough to be
the<00:02:13.140> only<00:02:13.380> possible<00:02:14.220> complaint<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:14.880> when<00:02:15.060> you

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
the only possible complaint is when you

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.270 
the only possible complaint is when you
first<00:02:15.420> get<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.720> box<00:02:15.960> you<00:02:16.200> open<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:16.920> find<00:02:17.160> a

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
bag of pieces and then a lot of the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.000 
bag of pieces and then a lot of the
pieces<00:02:20.190> have<00:02:20.600> slots<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:21.900> holes<00:02:21.960> and<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.830> need

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
pieces have slots and holes and you need

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.460 
pieces have slots and holes and you need
to<00:02:23.160> poke<00:02:23.460> out<00:02:23.670> pieces<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.630> get<00:02:24.810> them<00:02:24.990> ready<00:02:25.230> for

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
to poke out pieces to get them ready for

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.120 
to poke out pieces to get them ready for
use

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
use

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.800 
use
so<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.640> first<00:02:26.880> thing<00:02:27.060> you're<00:02:27.180> doing<00:02:27.210> for<00:02:27.720> at

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
so the first thing you're doing for at

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.830 
so the first thing you're doing for at
least<00:02:27.930> five<00:02:28.260> minutes<00:02:28.470> is<00:02:28.740> poking<00:02:29.160> out<00:02:29.310> holes

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
least five minutes is poking out holes

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.390 
least five minutes is poking out holes
but<00:02:30.840> then<00:02:31.140> again<00:02:31.440> that's<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.430> small<00:02:33.320> complaint

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
but then again that's a small complaint

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.980 
but then again that's a small complaint
overall<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.610> finished<00:02:35.910> product<00:02:36.360> is<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.810> good

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
overall the finished product is a good

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.110 
overall the finished product is a good
one<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.470> what<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.040> like<00:02:38.430> about<00:02:38.460> the<00:02:38.820> beginner

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
one and what I like about the beginner

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.890 
one and what I like about the beginner
pieces<00:02:39.660> are<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.230> beginner<00:02:40.530> puzzles<00:02:41.130> is<00:02:41.340> that

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
pieces are the beginner puzzles is that

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.900 
pieces are the beginner puzzles is that
they<00:02:42.900> don't<00:02:43.050> stay<00:02:43.440> together<00:02:43.680> all<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.400> well<00:02:44.670> I

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
they don't stay together all that well I

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.160 
they don't stay together all that well I
mean<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.210> can<00:02:45.330> see<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.660> they're<00:02:45.810> relatively

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
mean you can see that they're relatively

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.680 
mean you can see that they're relatively
easy<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.740> take<00:02:46.980> apart<00:02:47.370> on<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.180> other<00:02:48.360> hand

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
easy to take apart on the other hand

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.050 
easy to take apart on the other hand
that<00:02:48.900> means<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.590> kids<00:02:50.160> can<00:02:50.490> take<00:02:50.700> them<00:02:50.940> apart

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
that means that kids can take them apart

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.260 
that means that kids can take them apart
and<00:02:51.450> do<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.959> puzzle<00:02:52.350> again<00:02:52.610> my<00:02:53.610> son<00:02:53.910> already

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270

the kids are gonna get multiple uses out
of<00:03:12.600> these<00:03:12.750> puzzles<00:03:13.050> rather<00:03:13.770> than<00:03:14.040> just<00:03:14.280> see<00:03:14.640> it

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
of these puzzles rather than just see it

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.530

as a one-time project and I really enjoy
the<00:03:18.780> fact<00:03:19.019> that<00:03:19.170> they<00:03:19.440> are<00:03:19.850> famous<00:03:20.850> landmarks

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
the fact that they are famous landmarks

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.660 
the fact that they are famous landmarks
there's<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:22.019> educational<00:03:22.739> factor<00:03:23.190> involved

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
there's that educational factor involved

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.580 
there's that educational factor involved
but<00:03:24.060> possible<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.900> other<00:03:25.019> possible

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
but possible the other possible

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.160 
but possible the other possible
complaint<00:03:26.100> in<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.519> fact<00:03:26.790> that<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.600> got<00:03:27.810> these

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
complaint in the fact that I got these

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.550 
complaint in the fact that I got these
three<00:03:29.269> there<00:03:30.269> was<00:03:30.390> a<00:03:30.420> magical<00:03:30.900> choice<00:03:31.080> anyways

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
three there was a magical choice anyways

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.949 
three there was a magical choice anyways
but<00:03:31.769> these<00:03:32.340> three<00:03:32.640> landmarks<00:03:32.940> compared<00:03:33.810> to

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
but these three landmarks compared to

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.720 
but these three landmarks compared to
st.<00:03:34.170> Basil's<00:03:34.530> Cathedral<00:03:34.890> are<00:03:35.370> very

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
st. Basil's Cathedral are very

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.030 
st. Basil's Cathedral are very
monochromatic<00:03:36.570> I<00:03:37.350> mean<00:03:37.590> they<00:03:37.709> don't<00:03:37.800> have

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
monochromatic I mean they don't have

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.590 
monochromatic I mean they don't have
much<00:03:38.220> color<00:03:38.519> they<00:03:38.790> don't<00:03:38.970> have<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:39.300> great

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
much color they don't have that great

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.560 
much color they don't have that great
visual<00:03:40.110> appeal<00:03:40.470> so<00:03:41.280> maybe<00:03:41.610> my<00:03:42.090> son<00:03:42.300> will<00:03:42.450> have

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
visual appeal so maybe my son will have

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.870 
visual appeal so maybe my son will have
to<00:03:42.750> move<00:03:42.959> up<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:43.260> level<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:43.680> difficulty<00:03:44.190> if<00:03:44.640> he

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
to move up the level of difficulty if he

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.729 
to move up the level of difficulty if he
wants<00:03:45.180> something<00:03:45.360> more<00:03:45.810> vibrant<00:03:46.080> you<00:03:46.650> know

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
wants something more vibrant you know

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.490 
wants something more vibrant you know
maybe<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:47.040> castle<00:03:47.670> or<00:03:47.880> a<00:03:47.910> cathedral<00:03:48.540> but<00:03:49.170> in<00:03:49.320> any

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
maybe a castle or a cathedral but in any

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.160 
maybe a castle or a cathedral but in any
case<00:03:49.590> he<00:03:49.769> really<00:03:50.310> enjoyed<00:03:50.640> them<00:03:50.930> they<00:03:51.930> have

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
case he really enjoyed them they have

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.259 
case he really enjoyed them they have
the<00:03:52.410> right<00:03:52.650> level<00:03:52.980> of<00:03:53.070> difficulty<00:03:53.640> enough<00:03:54.150> of

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
the right level of difficulty enough of

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.930 
the right level of difficulty enough of
a<00:03:54.360> challenge<00:03:54.630> some<00:03:55.380> frustration<00:03:56.220> but<00:03:56.760> not

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
a challenge some frustration but not

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.630 
a challenge some frustration but not
enough<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.450> make<00:03:57.600> the<00:03:57.780> child<00:03:58.050> give<00:03:58.290> up<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:59.489> as
