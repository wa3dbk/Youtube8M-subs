00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.280
 speed of movement into the hero 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.929
 to be able to get as low as possible 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.940
 quite simply create a free game 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.430

 I try as hard as possible 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.400
 slow it down 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.109
 you are completely free 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.060

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.340

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.550

 take back and and and and and and goal 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.829
 it's simply the music as much as possible 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.480
 to get low attendance 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.180
 this challenge to very simple 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.670
 Here it makes game or 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.590
 take it to new records again 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.510
 make it automatic and send 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.570
 It's easy on the bottom of the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.250
 description are in address 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.609

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.129
 please send the file which the 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.559
 observation mode has used so the 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.750
 spectator mode because at the moment it is like that 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.049
 that the new record a bit 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.430
 packed since the last patch and 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.560
 Unfortunately, I can not watch it myself 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.560
 I can only look at the files 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.259
 observer mode has been included 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.259
 exactly or you accept this year 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.850
 this challenge over the one over 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.650
 video answer to that means you do 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.990
 a video that's easy 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.939
 high sends me that I look if there 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.640
 Everything is going right and 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.070
 accept is to the incumbent 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.540
 champion that means the team or the 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.040
 group that has managed one 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.299
 champion as low as possible 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.540
 or as strong as possible to 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.149
 sloane and he the nose is low 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.490
 I will distinguish these by 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.460
 I place you in the first 200 third place 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.079
 prove leave and the current record 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.689
 is always at the top of the description 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.189
 be seen 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.159
 just like send me the quasi camel and 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.110
 then write something about you 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.270
 may be in the sense that you say 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.299
 okay to see my sound ebendorf 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.380
 if 1 200 pure pin or my youtube 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.119
 channel and and and 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.860
 So here on this channel, so to speak 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.209
 Advertising is no problem 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.950
 take part 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.959
 that's exactly how it was 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.150
 So there are no conditions trying 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.980
 the possibility to get and send 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.300
 me that the replay resp 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.480
 the file may just be the one below 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.040
 standing address and what I still say 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.519
 I wanted to say thank you 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.200
 the participation in the gold the on vacation 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.650
 will or in itself exactly how 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.880
 This challenge is liquid that is 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.260
 if you want to beat the record can 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.150
 you do that is not a problem and 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.610
 the replays I get so far 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.980
 I was really real at the gold 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.180
 pretty nice and I'll be back soon 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.459
 to give a statement or 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.459
 some of them show where I am still on 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.400
 Am I whether I like that? 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.530
 replay of the best player quasi 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.269
 show because he has a very good tactic 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.790
 used and I do not know if I am 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.290
 it should probably reveal that 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.970
 only the clocks are taken and these 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.099
 I 'm perfected there 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.940
 consider and discuss with me because 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:14.130
 that's a good game for you 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.209
 creative attempts possible rauszukriegen 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.500
 how can I get those 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:23.010
 mobility as low as possible and 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.209
 that 's exactly what you can do 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.940
 but if you want to go down to the 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.680
 to discuss comments on how to 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.840
 because the best way to go about the 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.079
 speed of the opponent too 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:38.840
