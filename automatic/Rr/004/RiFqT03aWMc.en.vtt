00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
changes to design itself unless you

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.720 
changes to design itself unless you
count<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.449> increase<00:00:25.349> in<00:00:25.589> or<00:00:25.859> decrease<00:00:26.519> in

that's the first thing you're going to

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.450 
that's the first thing you're going to
see<00:00:37.079> when<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.350> power<00:00:37.560> up<00:00:37.710> power<00:00:38.040> on<00:00:38.280> these

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
see when you power up power on these

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.270 
see when you power up power on these
smartphones<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.180> both<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.080> them<00:00:40.410> have<00:00:40.470> very

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:42.990 
nice displays both are going to feature

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.800 
nice displays both are going to feature
Super<00:00:43.560> AMOLED<00:00:43.590> display<00:00:44.340> technology<00:00:44.940> so

Super AMOLED display technology so
you're<00:00:45.960> going<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.110> be<00:00:46.380> getting<00:00:46.560> nice<00:00:46.860> vibrant

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
you're going to be getting nice vibrant

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.540 
you're going to be getting nice vibrant
just<00:00:48.240> rich<00:00:48.510> colors<00:00:48.930> in<00:00:49.140> general<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
just rich colors in general and the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.910 
just rich colors in general and the
display<00:00:50.910> size<00:00:51.150> it's<00:00:51.540> actually<00:00:51.840> 5.1<00:00:52.500> inch<00:00:52.680> for

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
display size it's actually 5.1 inch for

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.460 
display size it's actually 5.1 inch for
the<00:00:53.010> galaxy<00:00:53.280> s5<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.940> 4.5<00:00:54.750> inches<00:00:55.110> for<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
the galaxy s5 and 4.5 inches for the

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.960 
the galaxy s5 and 4.5 inches for the
galaxy<00:00:55.920> s5<00:00:56.190> mini<00:00:56.220> and<00:00:57.260> obviously<00:00:58.260> in

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
galaxy s5 mini and obviously in

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.190 
galaxy s5 mini and obviously in
comparison<00:00:59.970> between<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.240> two<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.600> galaxy<00:01:00.930> s5

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
comparison between the two the galaxy s5

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.780 
comparison between the two the galaxy s5
display<00:01:01.560> is<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.770> bit<00:01:01.980> better<00:01:02.160> because<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.580> has<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
display is a bit better because it has a

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.630 
display is a bit better because it has a
higher<00:01:03.030> resolution<00:01:03.300> it's<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.199> 1920<00:01:04.920> x<00:01:05.040> 1080<00:01:05.220> so

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
higher resolution it's a 1920 x 1080 so

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.370 
higher resolution it's a 1920 x 1080 so
it's<00:01:05.759> a<00:01:05.820> full<00:01:06.030> HD<00:01:06.420> Super<00:01:06.720> AMOLED<00:01:06.780> display

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
it's a full HD Super AMOLED display

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.060 
it's a full HD Super AMOLED display
whereas<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> galaxy<00:01:09.000> s5<00:01:09.270> mini<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.929> 1280<00:01:10.920> by

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
whereas a galaxy s5 mini is a 1280 by

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.730 
whereas a galaxy s5 mini is a 1280 by
720<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.820> it's<00:01:11.969> a<00:01:12.060> 720p<00:01:12.659> super<00:01:13.200> out<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.560> display

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
720 so it's a 720p super out on display

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.980 
720 so it's a 720p super out on display
so<00:01:14.700> there<00:01:14.850> are<00:01:14.880> some<00:01:15.119> differences<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.780> terms

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
so there are some differences in terms

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.109 
so there are some differences in terms
of<00:01:16.200> pixel<00:01:16.950> density<00:01:17.340> there<00:01:17.549> as<00:01:17.670> well<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.060> it's

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
of pixel density there as well so it's

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.550 
of pixel density there as well so it's
432<00:01:19.049> PPI<00:01:19.380> for<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.799> s5<00:01:20.189> versus<00:01:21.060> 326<00:01:21.840> PPI<00:01:22.200> for

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
432 PPI for the s5 versus 326 PPI for

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.249 
432 PPI for the s5 versus 326 PPI for
the<00:01:22.649> s5<00:01:23.159> mini<00:01:23.390> in<00:01:24.390> terms<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.810> operating

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
the s5 mini in terms of operating

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.380 
the s5 mini in terms of operating
systems<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.859> can<00:01:25.890> expect<00:01:26.310> android<00:01:26.789> 4.4

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390

mini in this case they're both aren't

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.210 
mini in this case they're both aren't
going<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.090> support<00:03:39.330> LTE<00:03:39.990> networks<00:03:40.800> so<00:03:41.040> that's

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
going to support LTE networks so that's

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.280 
going to support LTE networks so that's
nice<00:03:41.459> and<00:03:41.730> Wi-Fi<00:03:42.510> is<00:03:42.570> going<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.780> be<00:03:42.870> supported

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
nice and Wi-Fi is going to be supported

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.570 
nice and Wi-Fi is going to be supported
and<00:03:43.860> for<00:03:44.400> both<00:03:44.550> devices<00:03:44.850> however<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:45.900> s5

devices along with NFC and they both

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.780 
devices along with NFC and they both
have<00:04:01.260> their<00:04:01.290> 3.5<00:04:02.190> millimeter<00:04:02.430> headphone

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
have their 3.5 millimeter headphone

that's<00:04:06.000> a<00:04:06.180> differentiator<00:04:06.870> between<00:04:06.989> these

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
that's a differentiator between these

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.350 
that's a differentiator between these
two<00:04:07.650> devices<00:04:07.890> are<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.520> battery<00:04:08.850> so<00:04:09.030> it's<00:04:09.150> two

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
two devices are the battery so it's two

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.550 
two devices are the battery so it's two
thousand<00:04:09.750> eight<00:04:09.810> hundred<00:04:09.870> million<00:04:10.380> power

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
thousand eight hundred million power

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.340 
thousand eight hundred million power
battery<00:04:10.650> on<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.640> S<00:04:11.760> 5<00:04:12.000> verse<00:04:12.300> 22<00:04:12.600> thousand<00:04:13.200> one

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.510 
hundred million power battery on the s5
mini<00:04:15.780> so<00:04:16.410> there's<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:16.739> bit<00:04:16.950> of<00:04:17.010> a<00:04:17.160> difference

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
mini so there's a bit of a difference

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.260 
mini so there's a bit of a difference
here<00:04:17.730> but<00:04:18.299> if<00:04:18.840> you<00:04:18.989> factor<00:04:19.350> in<00:04:19.739> just<00:04:20.640> the

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
here but if you factor in just the

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.020 
here but if you factor in just the
display<00:04:21.660> and<00:04:21.959> how<00:04:22.590> much<00:04:22.740> less<00:04:23.070> power<00:04:23.370> it's

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
display and how much less power it's

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.540 
display and how much less power it's
going<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.480> be<00:04:24.630> taking<00:04:25.290> on<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.590> s5<00:04:25.950> mini<00:04:25.980> versus

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
going to be taking on the s5 mini versus

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.960 
going to be taking on the s5 mini versus
the<00:04:26.669> s5<00:04:27.770> along<00:04:28.770> with<00:04:28.979> other<00:04:29.280> things<00:04:29.430> like<00:04:29.820> the

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
the s5 along with other things like the

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.559 
the s5 along with other things like the
clock<00:04:30.180> a<00:04:30.210> clock<00:04:30.630> speed<00:04:30.990> on<00:04:31.229> the<00:04:31.350> processor

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:32.569 
clock a clock speed on the processor

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:34.749 
clock a clock speed on the processor
Ram<00:04:32.809> there's<00:04:33.409> just<00:04:33.529> small<00:04:33.979> things<00:04:34.159> that<00:04:34.399> add

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
Ram there's just small things that add

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.459 
Ram there's just small things that add
together<00:04:35.029> and<00:04:35.569> it<00:04:35.779> definitely<00:04:35.960> makes<00:04:36.229> sense

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:36.469 
together and it definitely makes sense

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:38.919 
together and it definitely makes sense
it's<00:04:36.800> a<00:04:36.949> smaller<00:04:37.249> capacity<00:04:37.490> of<00:04:38.029> course<00:04:38.509> a<00:04:38.689> body

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:38.929 
it's a smaller capacity of course a body

00:04:38.929 --> 00:04:40.659 
it's a smaller capacity of course a body
itself<00:04:39.319> is<00:04:39.559> also<00:04:39.830> smaller<00:04:40.099> so<00:04:40.369> somehow

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
itself is also smaller so somehow

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.629 
itself is also smaller so somehow
samsung<00:04:41.300> had<00:04:41.479> to<00:04:41.719> fit<00:04:42.679> it<00:04:42.800> all<00:04:42.889> in<00:04:43.129> there<00:04:43.369> and

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
samsung had to fit it all in there and

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.459 
samsung had to fit it all in there and
they<00:04:44.149> definitely<00:04:44.300> the<00:04:44.629> battery<00:04:44.990> took<00:04:45.229> a<00:04:45.259> bit

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:45.469 
they definitely the battery took a bit

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:48.549 
they definitely the battery took a bit
of<00:04:45.499> a<00:04:45.679> toll<00:04:45.860> however<00:04:46.580> in<00:04:47.509> the<00:04:47.779> end<00:04:47.809> you<00:04:48.199> should

00:04:48.549 --> 00:04:48.559 
of a toll however in the end you should

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:51.419 
of a toll however in the end you should
expect<00:04:48.889> a<00:04:49.189> similar<00:04:49.429> battery<00:04:49.999> life<00:04:50.149> to<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.479> s5

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:51.429 
expect a similar battery life to the s5

00:04:51.429 --> 00:04:54.449 
expect a similar battery life to the s5
just<00:04:52.429> because<00:04:52.789> of<00:04:52.819> all<00:04:53.089> the<00:04:53.300> reductions<00:04:53.899> and

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:54.459 
just because of all the reductions and

00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:57.699 
just because of all the reductions and
reductions<00:04:55.459> in<00:04:55.610> battery<00:04:55.909> usage<00:04:56.349> in<00:04:57.349> terms<00:04:57.559> of

00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:57.709 
reductions in battery usage in terms of

00:04:57.709 --> 00:05:00.999 
reductions in battery usage in terms of
sensors<00:04:58.129> you<00:04:58.369> are<00:04:58.580> going<00:04:58.879> to<00:04:59.059> be<00:04:59.949> missing<00:05:00.949> a

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:01.009 
sensors you are going to be missing a

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.010 
sensors you are going to be missing a
few<00:05:01.189> sensors<00:05:01.610> or<00:05:01.819> just<00:05:02.059> two<00:05:02.209> sensors<00:05:02.599> from<00:05:02.809> the

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
few sensors or just two sensors from the

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.980 
few sensors or just two sensors from the
s5<00:05:03.409> the<00:05:03.649> barometer<00:05:04.189> and<00:05:04.309> i<00:05:05.209> believe<00:05:05.779> the

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
s5 the barometer and i believe the

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.049 
s5 the barometer and i believe the
gesture<00:05:06.439> sensors<00:05:06.949> are<00:05:07.279> not<00:05:07.550> going<00:05:07.789> to<00:05:07.969> be

00:05:08.049 --> 00:05:08.059 
gesture sensors are not going to be

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:10.179 
gesture sensors are not going to be
available<00:05:08.479> on<00:05:08.569> the<00:05:08.689> s5<00:05:09.080> mini<00:05:09.110> but<00:05:09.830> everything

00:05:10.179 --> 00:05:10.189 
available on the s5 mini but everything

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:12.070 
available on the s5 mini but everything
else<00:05:10.369> is<00:05:10.639> let's<00:05:11.209> talk<00:05:11.300> about<00:05:11.479> dimensions

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
else is let's talk about dimensions

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.199 
else is let's talk about dimensions
colors<00:05:12.619> and<00:05:12.889> then<00:05:12.979> conclude<00:05:13.339> off<00:05:13.580> this<00:05:13.849> video

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:14.209 
colors and then conclude off this video

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:18.579 
colors and then conclude off this video
so<00:05:15.490> the<00:05:16.490> galaxy<00:05:17.330> s5<00:05:17.629> comes<00:05:17.899> in<00:05:18.050> a<00:05:18.139> hundred<00:05:18.529> and

00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:18.589 
so the galaxy s5 comes in a hundred and

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:21.489 
so the galaxy s5 comes in a hundred and
forty<00:05:18.860> two<00:05:19.039> millimeters<00:05:19.580> by<00:05:20.360> seventy<00:05:20.899> 2.5

00:05:21.489 --> 00:05:21.499 
forty two millimeters by seventy 2.5

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:25.149 
forty two millimeters by seventy 2.5
millimeters<00:05:22.099> by<00:05:22.719> 8.1<00:05:23.719> millimeters<00:05:24.319> the

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:25.159 
millimeters by 8.1 millimeters the

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:28.329 
millimeters by 8.1 millimeters the
galaxy<00:05:25.519> s5<00:05:25.849> mini<00:05:25.879> is<00:05:26.499> 131<00:05:27.499> millimeters<00:05:28.159> by

00:05:28.329 --> 00:05:28.339 
galaxy s5 mini is 131 millimeters by

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:30.730 
galaxy s5 mini is 131 millimeters by
sixty<00:05:28.729> four<00:05:28.969> point<00:05:29.240> eight<00:05:29.360> millimeters<00:05:29.869> x<00:05:30.050> 9.1

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
sixty four point eight millimeters x 9.1

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.609 
sixty four point eight millimeters x 9.1
millimeters<00:05:31.399> so<00:05:31.969> overall<00:05:32.300> the<00:05:32.599> galaxy<00:05:32.959> s5<00:05:33.259> is

00:05:33.609 --> 00:05:33.619 
millimeters so overall the galaxy s5 is

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:36.489 
millimeters so overall the galaxy s5 is
taller<00:05:34.339> and<00:05:34.669> it's<00:05:34.909> also<00:05:35.089> wider<00:05:35.479> but<00:05:36.199> it<00:05:36.319> is

00:05:36.489 --> 00:05:36.499 
taller and it's also wider but it is

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:38.980 
taller and it's also wider but it is
also<00:05:36.769> a<00:05:36.979> thinner<00:05:37.519> smartphone<00:05:38.149> than<00:05:38.419> the<00:05:38.569> s5

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
also a thinner smartphone than the s5

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.369 
also a thinner smartphone than the s5
mini<00:05:39.669> so<00:05:40.669> that's<00:05:41.209> something<00:05:41.719> that<00:05:41.869> I<00:05:42.019> point

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:42.379 
mini so that's something that I point

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:44.290 
mini so that's something that I point
out<00:05:42.499> and<00:05:42.830> it's<00:05:43.039> five<00:05:43.369> Ferrell<00:05:43.699> it's<00:05:43.879> by<00:05:44.029> one

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
out and it's five Ferrell it's by one

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.859 
out and it's five Ferrell it's by one
millimeter<00:05:44.749> difference<00:05:45.939> but<00:05:46.939> you<00:05:47.659> will

00:05:47.859 --> 00:05:47.869 
millimeter difference but you will

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:50.170 
millimeter difference but you will
notice<00:05:48.139> that<00:05:48.289> the<00:05:49.069> difference<00:05:49.430> in<00:05:49.610> dimension

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
notice that the difference in dimension

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.670 
notice that the difference in dimension
when<00:05:50.419> you<00:05:50.509> feel<00:05:50.719> both<00:05:50.899> the<00:05:51.050> devices<00:05:51.289> you<00:05:51.649> will

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
when you feel both the devices you will

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.159 
when you feel both the devices you will
feel<00:05:52.189> the<00:05:52.219> difference<00:05:52.399> between<00:05:52.849> the<00:05:53.509> two<00:05:53.689> the

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169 
feel the difference between the two the

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.519 
feel the difference between the two the
galaxy's<00:05:54.589> I've<00:05:54.800> also<00:05:55.039> more<00:05:55.939> heavier<00:05:56.389> at<00:05:56.659> 145

00:05:57.519 --> 00:05:57.529 
galaxy's I've also more heavier at 145

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:01.359 
galaxy's I've also more heavier at 145
grams<00:05:57.860> versus<00:05:58.639> 120<00:05:59.419> grams<00:05:59.599> of<00:05:59.869> the<00:05:59.899> s5<00:06:00.439> mini<00:06:00.469> in

00:06:01.359 --> 00:06:01.369 
grams versus 120 grams of the s5 mini in

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:03.009 
grams versus 120 grams of the s5 mini in
terms<00:06:01.699> of<00:06:01.819> colors<00:06:02.119> they'll<00:06:02.360> be<00:06:02.479> available<00:06:02.569> in

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:03.019 
terms of colors they'll be available in

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:04.899 
terms of colors they'll be available in
exactly<00:06:03.649> the<00:06:03.800> same<00:06:03.860> color<00:06:04.159> options<00:06:04.550> actually

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:04.909 
exactly the same color options actually

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:06.999 
exactly the same color options actually
so<00:06:05.089> black<00:06:05.329> blue<00:06:05.599> gold<00:06:05.899> and<00:06:06.139> white<00:06:06.289> are<00:06:06.589> the

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:07.009 
so black blue gold and white are the

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:08.769 
so black blue gold and white are the
four<00:06:07.249> options<00:06:07.490> you<00:06:07.849> have<00:06:07.909> for<00:06:08.089> these<00:06:08.419> devices

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:08.779 
four options you have for these devices

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:11.079 
four options you have for these devices
and<00:06:09.199> you<00:06:09.619> can<00:06:09.800> wait<00:06:09.949> and<00:06:10.249> find<00:06:10.550> around<00:06:10.819> maybe

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:11.089 
and you can wait and find around maybe

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:12.579 
and you can wait and find around maybe
verizon<00:06:11.419> or<00:06:11.809> something<00:06:12.079> like<00:06:12.199> that<00:06:12.259> a

00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:12.589 
verizon or something like that a

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:14.699 
verizon or something like that a
specific<00:06:13.249> carrier<00:06:13.759> might<00:06:14.119> do<00:06:14.269> a<00:06:14.300> specific

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:14.709 
specific carrier might do a specific

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:17.139 
specific carrier might do a specific
exclusive<00:06:15.709> color<00:06:15.979> so<00:06:16.339> stay<00:06:16.639> tuned<00:06:16.849> for<00:06:16.879> that

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:17.149 
exclusive color so stay tuned for that

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:19.629 
exclusive color so stay tuned for that
and<00:06:17.539> I<00:06:18.319> will<00:06:18.649> cover<00:06:18.860> i'll<00:06:19.069> be<00:06:19.219> covering<00:06:19.369> all

that here are my infinite anyways that's

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.499 
that here are my infinite anyways that's
it<00:06:22.009> for<00:06:22.129> this<00:06:22.219> comparison<00:06:22.669> video<00:06:22.999> between<00:06:23.029> the

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:23.509 
it for this comparison video between the

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:26.980 
it for this comparison video between the
galaxy<00:06:23.959> s5<00:06:24.289> and<00:06:24.589> the<00:06:24.680> galaxy<00:06:25.129> s5<00:06:25.579> mini<00:06:25.990> they

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
galaxy s5 and the galaxy s5 mini they

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.749 
galaxy s5 and the galaxy s5 mini they
are<00:06:27.199> in<00:06:27.409> the<00:06:27.499> same<00:06:27.680> family<00:06:28.159> of<00:06:28.189> smartphones

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759 
are in the same family of smartphones

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:30.100 
are in the same family of smartphones
and<00:06:28.939> you<00:06:28.999> can<00:06:29.119> definitely<00:06:29.419> see<00:06:29.569> that<00:06:29.599> by<00:06:29.930> some

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
and you can definitely see that by some

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.559 
and you can definitely see that by some
of<00:06:30.199> the<00:06:30.289> specs<00:06:30.589> overall<00:06:31.519> the<00:06:31.699> galaxy<00:06:32.029> s5<00:06:32.329> is<00:06:32.360> a

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:32.569 
of the specs overall the galaxy s5 is a

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:34.689 
of the specs overall the galaxy s5 is a
bit<00:06:32.779> of<00:06:32.959> more<00:06:33.649> of<00:06:33.680> a<00:06:33.829> powerful<00:06:34.219> device<00:06:34.459> if<00:06:34.669> you

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:34.699 
bit of more of a powerful device if you

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:35.920 
bit of more of a powerful device if you
have<00:06:34.909> the<00:06:35.029> money<00:06:35.149> I<00:06:35.300> would<00:06:35.509> definitely<00:06:35.659> say

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
have the money I would definitely say

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.119 
have the money I would definitely say
opt<00:06:36.349> for<00:06:36.709> the<00:06:36.740> galaxy<00:06:37.219> s5<00:06:37.789> but<00:06:38.479> I<00:06:39.050> think<00:06:39.740> if<00:06:40.009> you

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:40.129 
opt for the galaxy s5 but I think if you

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:41.949 
opt for the galaxy s5 but I think if you
just<00:06:40.159> want<00:06:40.579> a<00:06:40.699> general<00:06:41.120> smartphone<00:06:41.659> if<00:06:41.839> you're

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:41.959 
just want a general smartphone if you're

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:43.719 
just want a general smartphone if you're
not<00:06:42.139> really<00:06:42.409> into<00:06:42.769> the<00:06:42.889> high<00:06:43.129> performance

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:43.729 
not really into the high performance

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:46.119 
not really into the high performance
standards<00:06:44.240> and<00:06:44.449> maybe<00:06:45.409> the<00:06:45.589> biggest<00:06:45.740> thing<00:06:46.009> is

00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:46.129 
standards and maybe the biggest thing is

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:46.450 
standards and maybe the biggest thing is
if<00:06:46.279> you

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
if you

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.460 
if you
not<00:06:47.060> really<00:06:47.530> so<00:06:48.530> huge<00:06:48.979> about<00:06:49.490> the<00:06:49.729> display

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.470 
not really so huge about the display

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.170 
not really so huge about the display
maybe<00:06:51.470> the<00:06:51.650> galaxy<00:06:51.949> s5<00:06:52.220> mini<00:06:52.250> might<00:06:52.850> be<00:06:53.030> the

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.180 
maybe the galaxy s5 mini might be the

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.939 
maybe the galaxy s5 mini might be the
smartphone<00:06:53.660> for<00:06:53.990> you<00:06:54.229> it<00:06:54.410> doesn't<00:06:54.590> have<00:06:54.800> the

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:54.949 
smartphone for you it doesn't have the

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:57.040 
smartphone for you it doesn't have the
best<00:06:55.099> display<00:06:55.880> on<00:06:56.060> the<00:06:56.120> market<00:06:56.539> especially<00:06:56.750> in

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050 
best display on the market especially in

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.800 
best display on the market especially in
comparison<00:06:57.199> to<00:06:57.560> the<00:06:57.590> galaxy<00:06:58.039> s5<00:06:58.569> but<00:06:59.569> it<00:06:59.660> does

00:06:59.800 --> 00:06:59.810 
comparison to the galaxy s5 but it does

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.770 
comparison to the galaxy s5 but it does
it<00:07:00.319> will<00:07:00.560> be<00:07:00.740> able<00:07:00.830> to<00:07:00.979> do<00:07:01.160> your<00:07:01.340> average<00:07:01.789> tasks

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:02.780 
it will be able to do your average tasks

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.189 
it will be able to do your average tasks
with<00:07:03.259> ease<00:07:03.289> because<00:07:04.009> of<00:07:04.370> its<00:07:04.550> specs<00:07:05.210> just<00:07:05.960> it

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:06.199 
with ease because of its specs just it

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:08.050 
with ease because of its specs just it
won't<00:07:06.440> be<00:07:06.560> able<00:07:06.680> to<00:07:06.830> get<00:07:07.130> that<00:07:07.280> high<00:07:07.580> gaming

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:08.060 
won't be able to get that high gaming

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.170 
won't be able to get that high gaming
performance<00:07:08.270> as<00:07:09.199> you<00:07:09.259> won't<00:07:09.680> s5<00:07:10.190> and<00:07:10.520> some

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:11.180 
performance as you won't s5 and some

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.540 
performance as you won't s5 and some
other<00:07:11.479> stuff<00:07:11.870> so<00:07:12.110> there's<00:07:12.349> over<00:07:13.009> all<00:07:13.160> the

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:13.550 
other stuff so there's over all the

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.659 
other stuff so there's over all the
better<00:07:14.349> overall<00:07:15.349> general<00:07:15.770> smartphone<00:07:16.460> will

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:16.669 
better overall general smartphone will

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:19.900 
better overall general smartphone will
be<00:07:16.789> the<00:07:16.910> s5<00:07:17.270> mini<00:07:18.310> however<00:07:19.310> if<00:07:19.460> you<00:07:19.580> want<00:07:19.820> to

be the s5 mini however if you want to
