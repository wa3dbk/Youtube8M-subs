another Z sphere on top of that neck is
easier<00:01:33.799> that<00:01:33.920> we<00:01:34.009> created<00:01:34.340> so<00:01:34.579> that<00:01:34.729> we<00:01:34.819> can

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
easier that we created so that we can

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.330 
easier that we created so that we can
pull<00:01:35.179> out<00:01:35.389> the<00:01:35.840> torso<00:01:36.349> and<00:01:36.590> then<00:01:36.979> we'll<00:01:37.130> use

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
pull out the torso and then we'll use

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.260 
pull out the torso and then we'll use
move<00:01:37.670> just<00:01:38.029> to<00:01:38.119> pull<00:01:38.299> that<00:01:38.389> straight<00:01:38.719> down<00:01:40.270> we

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
move just to pull that straight down we

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.999 
move just to pull that straight down we
can<00:01:41.420> scale<00:01:41.659> that<00:01:41.840> up<00:01:41.959> at<00:01:42.079> the<00:01:42.139> bottom<00:01:42.349> give<00:01:42.889> the

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
can scale that up at the bottom give the

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.730 
can scale that up at the bottom give the
torso<00:01:43.279> a<00:01:43.520> little<00:01:43.670> bit<00:01:43.939> of<00:01:44.029> thickness<00:01:44.209> and<00:01:44.740> then

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
torso a little bit of thickness and then

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.709 
torso a little bit of thickness and then
we'll<00:01:45.950> draw<00:01:46.159> in<00:01:46.369> another<00:01:46.669> Z<00:01:46.969> sphere<00:01:47.299> kind<00:01:47.659> of

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 
we'll draw in another Z sphere kind of

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:49.989 
we'll draw in another Z sphere kind of
at<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:47.929> base<00:01:48.139> of<00:01:48.349> the<00:01:48.439> neck<00:01:48.619> so<00:01:48.889> at<00:01:49.609> this<00:01:49.729> point

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:49.999 
at the base of the neck so at this point

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:51.730 
at the base of the neck so at this point
Simon's<00:01:50.450> going<00:01:50.569> to<00:01:50.659> create<00:01:50.899> some<00:01:51.109> arms<00:01:51.499> he'll

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
Simon's going to create some arms he'll

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.459 
Simon's going to create some arms he'll
use<00:01:52.009> the<00:01:52.310> z<00:01:52.579> axes<00:01:53.029> for<00:01:53.509> symmetry<00:01:53.810> this<00:01:54.079> time<00:01:54.289> so

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
use the z axes for symmetry this time so

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:56.349 
use the z axes for symmetry this time so
you<00:01:54.560> can<00:01:54.679> get<00:01:54.799> two<00:01:55.009> symmetrical<00:01:55.520> arms<00:01:55.759> you'll

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
you can get two symmetrical arms you'll

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:58.389 
you can get two symmetrical arms you'll
draw<00:01:56.630> in<00:01:56.869> two<00:01:57.169> Z's<00:01:57.409> fears<00:01:57.679> for<00:01:57.889> the<00:01:58.009> shoulders

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
draw in two Z's fears for the shoulders

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.789 
draw in two Z's fears for the shoulders
and<00:01:58.639> then<00:01:59.179> two<00:01:59.539> more<00:01:59.749> for<00:02:00.079> the<00:02:00.109> arms<00:02:00.499> and<00:02:00.679> their

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
and then two more for the arms and their

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.669 
and then two more for the arms and their
knees<00:02:01.009> move<00:02:01.369> to<00:02:01.549> pull<00:02:01.700> those<00:02:01.849> out<00:02:02.649> we<00:02:03.649> can

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
knees move to pull those out we can

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:05.830 
knees move to pull those out we can
adjust<00:02:03.859> the<00:02:04.219> shoulders<00:02:04.609> adjust<00:02:05.179> the<00:02:05.299> arms<00:02:05.630> and

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
adjust the shoulders adjust the arms and

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.749 
adjust the shoulders adjust the arms and
then<00:02:05.959> use<00:02:06.229> draw<00:02:06.529> to<00:02:06.799> draw<00:02:06.950> in<00:02:07.069> another<00:02:07.249> Z

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
then use draw to draw in another Z

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.790 
then use draw to draw in another Z
sphere<00:02:08.060> to<00:02:08.209> create<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.509> elbows

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
sphere to create the elbows

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.070 
sphere to create the elbows
so<00:02:11.490> at<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:11.730> point<00:02:11.940> Simon<00:02:12.420> will<00:02:12.540> open<00:02:12.840> up<00:02:12.960> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
so at this point Simon will open up the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.020 
so at this point Simon will open up the
adaptive<00:02:13.590> skin<00:02:13.860> pulldown<00:02:14.310> in<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.820> tool

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
adaptive skin pulldown in the tool

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.360 
adaptive skin pulldown in the tool
palette<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.600> increase<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.590> density<00:02:16.770> just<00:02:17.250> a

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
palette and increase the density just a

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.250 
palette and increase the density just a
little<00:02:17.580> bit<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.850> give<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.360> preview<00:02:18.960> match<00:02:19.110> a

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
little bit to give the preview match a

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.810 
little bit to give the preview match a
little<00:02:19.620> bit<00:02:19.710> more<00:02:19.890> density<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.430> work<00:02:20.610> with

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
little bit more density to work with

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.450 
little bit more density to work with
he'll<00:02:21.480> also<00:02:21.930> add<00:02:22.140> in<00:02:22.380> additional<00:02:22.950> Z<00:02:23.160> spheres

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
he'll also add in additional Z spheres

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.160 
he'll also add in additional Z spheres
in<00:02:23.640> some<00:02:23.850> areas<00:02:24.240> where<00:02:24.420> he<00:02:24.540> wants<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.870> tighten

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
in some areas where he wants to tighten

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.490 
in some areas where he wants to tighten
up<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.410> mesh<00:02:26.630> adding<00:02:27.630> in<00:02:27.780> additional<00:02:28.320> Z

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
up the mesh adding in additional Z

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.170 
up the mesh adding in additional Z
spheres<00:02:28.770> will<00:02:29.010> make<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.280> mesh<00:02:29.460> conform<00:02:29.910> more

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
spheres will make the mesh conform more

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.760 
spheres will make the mesh conform more
to<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.420> shape<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.690> you<00:02:30.930> see<00:02:30.960> in<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.590> Z

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
to the shape that you see in the Z

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.830 
to the shape that you see in the Z
sphere<00:02:32.010> model<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:32.910> for<00:02:33.090> instance<00:02:33.420> you<00:02:33.570> notice

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
sphere model so for instance you notice

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.020 
sphere model so for instance you notice
the<00:02:33.990> arm<00:02:34.140> area<00:02:34.560> here<00:02:34.890> is<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.280> little<00:02:35.550> bit<00:02:35.670> soft

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
the arm area here is a little bit soft

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.180 
the arm area here is a little bit soft
under<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.510> armpits<00:02:36.930> so<00:02:37.410> what<00:02:37.590> he'll<00:02:37.740> do<00:02:37.920> is

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
under the armpits so what he'll do is

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.560 
under the armpits so what he'll do is
add<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.460> Z<00:02:38.760> sphere<00:02:39.060> in<00:02:39.270> on<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.540> chest<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:41.570> then

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
add a Z sphere in on the chest and then

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.480 
add a Z sphere in on the chest and then
again<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.960> tighten<00:02:43.260> up<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.440> shoulders<00:02:43.890> he'll

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
again to tighten up the shoulders he'll

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.130 
again to tighten up the shoulders he'll
add<00:02:44.700> in<00:02:44.880> two<00:02:45.060> more<00:02:45.180> Z<00:02:45.390> spheres<00:02:45.690> on<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.930> sides

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
add in two more Z spheres on the sides

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.620 
add in two more Z spheres on the sides
there<00:02:46.440> we<00:02:47.400> can<00:02:47.550> then<00:02:47.580> use<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:48.030> Move<00:02:48.270> tool<00:02:48.540> to

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
there we can then use the Move tool to

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.590 
there we can then use the Move tool to
adjust<00:02:49.110> that<00:02:52.670> so<00:02:53.670> now<00:02:53.820> that<00:02:53.880> Simon's<00:02:54.390> done

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
adjust that so now that Simon's done

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.090 
adjust that so now that Simon's done
building<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.170> basic<00:02:55.560> shape<00:02:55.800> of<00:02:56.010> the

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
building the basic shape of the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.310 
building the basic shape of the
character<00:02:56.400> he'll<00:02:57.180> turn<00:02:57.390> off<00:02:57.570> symmetry<00:02:58.110> and

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
character he'll turn off symmetry and

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.260 
character he'll turn off symmetry and
work<00:02:58.590> on<00:02:58.770> one<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.130> arms<00:02:59.460> this<00:02:59.940> is<00:03:00.000> where

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
work on one of the arms this is where

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.700 
work on one of the arms this is where
he's<00:03:00.390> going<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.600> build<00:03:00.870> kind<00:03:01.170> of<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.410> thick

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
he's going to build kind of a thick

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.040 
he's going to build kind of a thick
cloth<00:03:02.100> for<00:03:02.490> the<00:03:02.550> character<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.600> process

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
cloth for the character and the process

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.260 
cloth for the character and the process
is<00:03:04.290> exactly<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.860> same<00:03:04.950> as<00:03:05.490> we've<00:03:05.820> done<00:03:06.060> so<00:03:06.240> far

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
is exactly the same as we've done so far

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.780 
is exactly the same as we've done so far
he'll<00:03:06.750> draw<00:03:06.990> in<00:03:07.110> a<00:03:07.200> few<00:03:07.410> Z's<00:03:07.560> Fears<00:03:07.860> use<00:03:08.610> the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
he'll draw in a few Z's Fears use the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.280 
he'll draw in a few Z's Fears use the
Move<00:03:08.970> tool<00:03:09.240> to<00:03:09.270> kind<00:03:09.600> of<00:03:09.630> pull<00:03:09.870> them<00:03:09.990> out<00:03:10.110> and

adjust<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.950> then<00:03:11.430> preview<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.270> mesh<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.660> kind

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
adjust and then preview the mesh to kind

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.100 
adjust and then preview the mesh to kind
of<00:03:12.900> see<00:03:13.110> how<00:03:13.320> everything's<00:03:13.770> looking<00:03:15.080> do<00:03:16.080> a

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
of see how everything's looking do a

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.020 
of see how everything's looking do a
little<00:03:16.350> bit<00:03:16.500> more<00:03:16.530> adjusting<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.580> adding<00:03:17.910> of

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
little bit more adjusting and adding of

look a little bit more like a claw and

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.260 
look a little bit more like a claw and
you<00:03:25.800> can<00:03:25.950> see<00:03:26.130> when<00:03:26.340> he<00:03:26.400> added<00:03:26.700> in<00:03:26.820> those<00:03:27.000> two

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
you can see when he added in those two

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.880 
you can see when he added in those two
little<00:03:27.480> Z<00:03:27.720> spheres<00:03:28.020> there<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.470> got<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.650> much

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
little Z spheres there you got a much

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.710 
little Z spheres there you got a much
tighter<00:03:29.370> mesh<00:03:29.730> around<00:03:30.240> that<00:03:30.990> intersection<00:03:31.530> a

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
tighter mesh around that intersection a

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.030 
tighter mesh around that intersection a
little<00:03:33.720> bit<00:03:33.810> of<00:03:33.900> scaling<00:03:34.380> to<00:03:34.560> get<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:34.830> size

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
little bit of scaling to get the size

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.530 
little bit of scaling to get the size
that<00:03:35.070> he's<00:03:35.400> looking<00:03:35.700> for<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.150> again<00:03:36.330> a<00:03:36.360> little

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
that he's looking for and again a little

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.890 
that he's looking for and again a little
bit<00:03:36.660> of<00:03:36.750> move<00:03:37.080> to<00:03:37.440> adjust<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:38.430> shape<00:03:38.840> now<00:03:39.840> you

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
bit of move to adjust the shape now you

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.840 
bit of move to adjust the shape now you
might<00:03:40.140> notice<00:03:40.320> that<00:03:40.530> when<00:03:40.890> Simon<00:03:41.370> previews

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
might notice that when Simon previews

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.940 
might notice that when Simon previews
his<00:03:42.030> mesh<00:03:42.300> you<00:03:42.720> see<00:03:42.959> different<00:03:43.440> passions<00:03:43.830> of

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
his mesh you see different passions of

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.920 
his mesh you see different passions of
colors<00:03:44.250> around<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.730> preview<00:03:45.120> mesh<00:03:45.300> and<00:03:45.600> this

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
colors around the preview mesh and this

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.660 
colors around the preview mesh and this
is<00:03:46.050> because<00:03:46.320> he<00:03:46.440> has<00:03:46.560> frame<00:03:46.920> turned<00:03:47.220> on<00:03:47.400> which

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
is because he has frame turned on which

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.310 
is because he has frame turned on which
will<00:03:47.850> show<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.090> different<00:03:48.510> polygroups<00:03:48.930> that

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
will show the different polygroups that

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.760 
will show the different polygroups that
disease<00:03:49.680> fears<00:03:49.950> are<00:03:50.130> creating<00:03:51.290> at<00:03:52.290> this<00:03:52.530> point

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
disease fears are creating at this point

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.440 
disease fears are creating at this point
he'll<00:03:52.920> adjust<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.580> tentacles<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.090> little<00:03:54.330> bit

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
he'll adjust the tentacles a little bit

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.270 
he'll adjust the tentacles a little bit
and<00:03:54.630> you<00:03:55.110> notice<00:03:55.410> that<00:03:55.440> he<00:03:55.620> switches<00:03:55.950> back<00:03:56.220> and

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
and you notice that he switches back and

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.970 
and you notice that he switches back and
forth<00:03:56.640> between<00:03:56.820> preview<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:58.530> Z<00:03:58.709> spheres

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
forth between preview and the Z spheres

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.160 
forth between preview and the Z spheres
just<00:03:59.070> to<00:03:59.370> kind<00:03:59.520> of<00:03:59.550> see<00:03:59.760> how<00:03:59.790> that<00:04:00.420> movement<00:04:00.990> is

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
just to kind of see how that movement is

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.210 
just to kind of see how that movement is
updating<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:01.980> preview<00:04:02.490> mesh

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.890 

don't<00:04:06.850> forget<00:04:07.090> at<00:04:07.240> any<00:04:07.360> point<00:04:07.720> in<00:04:07.810> this

don't forget at any point in this

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.840 
don't forget at any point in this
process<00:04:08.440> you<00:04:08.470> can<00:04:08.770> go<00:04:08.920> back<00:04:09.100> to<00:04:09.130> your<00:04:09.430> adaptive

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
process you can go back to your adaptive

the<00:04:12.100> preview<00:04:12.490> mash<00:04:12.700> this<00:04:13.480> just<00:04:13.720> allows<00:04:13.840> you<00:04:14.140> to

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
the preview mash this just allows you to

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.780 
the preview mash this just allows you to
see<00:04:14.410> your<00:04:14.440> preview<00:04:14.980> mash<00:04:15.220> at<00:04:15.460> different

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
see your preview mash at different

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.640 
see your preview mash at different
resolutions<00:04:16.450> and<00:04:16.690> help<00:04:16.840> you<00:04:16.959> understand<00:04:17.470> the

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
resolutions and help you understand the

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.789 
resolutions and help you understand the
flow<00:04:17.890> of<00:04:17.920> your<00:04:18.160> topology<00:04:18.459> a<00:04:18.730> bit<00:04:18.910> better

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
flow of your topology a bit better

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.350 
flow of your topology a bit better
so<00:04:20.799> here's<00:04:21.040> Simon's<00:04:21.489> going<00:04:21.640> to<00:04:21.760> start<00:04:21.970> working

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
so here's Simon's going to start working

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.090 
so here's Simon's going to start working
on<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.810> other<00:04:22.960> hand<00:04:23.260> and<00:04:23.650> you'll<00:04:23.950> do

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
on the other hand and you'll do

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.440 
on the other hand and you'll do
something<00:04:24.460> a<00:04:24.520> bit<00:04:24.550> different<00:04:24.700> than<00:04:25.120> the<00:04:25.180> claw

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
something a bit different than the claw

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.270 
something a bit different than the claw
you'll<00:04:25.810> actually<00:04:25.990> create<00:04:26.410> a<00:04:26.440> few<00:04:26.680> digits<00:04:27.040> here

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
you'll actually create a few digits here

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.790 
you'll actually create a few digits here
and<00:04:27.430> create<00:04:28.360> kind<00:04:28.510> of<00:04:28.600> a<00:04:28.720> tentacle<00:04:29.260> looking

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
and create kind of a tentacle looking

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.460 
and create kind of a tentacle looking
hand<00:04:30.100> for<00:04:30.490> his<00:04:30.760> character<00:04:31.270> now<00:04:32.020> as<00:04:32.230> you're

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
hand for his character now as you're

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.020 
hand for his character now as you're
working<00:04:32.620> on<00:04:32.860> Z<00:04:33.100> spheres<00:04:33.400> I<00:04:33.550> want<00:04:33.700> you<00:04:33.790> to<00:04:33.880> keep

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
working on Z spheres I want you to keep

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.790 
working on Z spheres I want you to keep
in<00:04:34.180> mind<00:04:34.390> that<00:04:34.570> Z<00:04:34.840> spheres<00:04:35.080> are<00:04:35.260> kind<00:04:35.500> of<00:04:35.590> like

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
in mind that Z spheres are kind of like

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.430 
in mind that Z spheres are kind of like
working<00:04:36.130> on<00:04:36.430> a<00:04:36.910> wire<00:04:37.450> armature<00:04:37.930> that<00:04:38.110> you

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
working on a wire armature that you

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.860 
working on a wire armature that you
would<00:04:38.590> use<00:04:38.800> maybe<00:04:39.160> a<00:04:39.250> clay<00:04:39.640> figure<00:04:39.910> sculpt<00:04:40.690> and

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
would use maybe a clay figure sculpt and

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.870 
would use maybe a clay figure sculpt and
what<00:04:41.560> you<00:04:41.680> want<00:04:41.830> to<00:04:41.920> do<00:04:42.010> is<00:04:42.160> basically<00:04:42.340> create

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
what you want to do is basically create

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.360 
what you want to do is basically create
your<00:04:43.210> base<00:04:43.540> structure<00:04:44.500> you're<00:04:44.920> not<00:04:45.040> trying<00:04:45.310> to

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
your base structure you're not trying to

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.940 
your base structure you're not trying to
create<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.270> exact<00:04:46.720> form<00:04:47.140> in<00:04:47.380> shape<00:04:47.650> at<00:04:47.800> this

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
create the exact form in shape at this

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.680 
create the exact form in shape at this
point<00:04:48.280> that's<00:04:48.520> what<00:04:48.730> we'll<00:04:48.910> use<00:04:49.120> all<00:04:49.360> the<00:04:49.510> more

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
point that's what we'll use all the more

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.720 
point that's what we'll use all the more
advanced<00:04:49.990> sculpting<00:04:50.500> tools<00:04:50.680> inside<00:04:51.100> ZBrush<00:04:51.520> 4

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
advanced sculpting tools inside ZBrush 4

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.180 
advanced sculpting tools inside ZBrush 4
but<00:04:52.240> here<00:04:52.510> we'll<00:04:52.690> use<00:04:52.870> z<00:04:53.350> spheres<00:04:53.650> to<00:04:53.920> quickly

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
but here we'll use z spheres to quickly

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.400 
but here we'll use z spheres to quickly
and<00:04:54.550> cleanly<00:04:54.850> create<00:04:55.510> kind<00:04:55.780> of<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:56.110> shape

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
and cleanly create kind of the shape

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.200 
and cleanly create kind of the shape
that<00:04:56.440> we're<00:04:56.710> going<00:04:56.800> to<00:04:56.890> be<00:04:56.980> sculpting<00:04:57.400> on<00:04:57.550> so

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
that we're going to be sculpting on so

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.610 
that we're going to be sculpting on so
you'll<00:04:58.420> notice<00:04:58.600> that<00:04:58.720> Simon<00:04:59.230> creates<00:04:59.530> a

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
you'll notice that Simon creates a

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.380 
you'll notice that Simon creates a
couple<00:04:59.980> z<00:05:00.130> spheres<00:05:00.460> for<00:05:00.700> the<00:05:00.790> hands<00:05:01.090> and<00:05:01.270> then

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
couple z spheres for the hands and then

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.510 
couple z spheres for the hands and then
you'll<00:05:01.570> add<00:05:01.780> in<00:05:02.020> a<00:05:02.200> few<00:05:02.230> more<00:05:02.740> Z's<00:05:03.010> fears<00:05:03.310> in

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
you'll add in a few more Z's fears in

with move maybe doing a little bit of
