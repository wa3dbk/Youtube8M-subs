00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
progressively less so that's why we want

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.679 
progressively less so that's why we want
to<00:01:26.520> attack<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.090> guy<00:01:27.420> with<00:01:27.570> most<00:01:27.869> health<00:01:29.689> first

range<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.340> archer<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:37.140> we'll<00:01:37.290> just<00:01:37.439> finish

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
range of the archer so we'll just finish

him<00:01:37.860> off<00:01:40.280> okay<00:01:41.450> next<00:01:42.450> one<00:01:42.689> up<00:01:42.840> Warrior<00:01:43.530> bash

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.450

guess I think there's only one way to

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.929 
guess I think there's only one way to
beat<00:01:56.549> these<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:57.060> don't<00:01:57.329> really<00:01:57.540> know

this one's called firestorm so we got a
ton<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.030> fireballs<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:28.550> these<00:02:29.550> are<00:02:29.790> pretty

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
ton of fireballs and these are pretty

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.070 
ton of fireballs and these are pretty
easy<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.320> understand<00:02:32.660> there's<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.720> three<00:02:33.930> by

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080

the<00:04:07.739> wizard<00:04:08.070> dance<00:04:09.980> this<00:04:10.980> one<00:04:11.250> is<00:04:11.640> a<00:04:11.670> little

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
the wizard dance this one is a little

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.870 
the wizard dance this one is a little
tricky<00:04:12.590> so<00:04:13.590> what<00:04:13.860> we're<00:04:14.010> gonna<00:04:14.070> do<00:04:14.370> here<00:04:14.670> is

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
tricky so what we're gonna do here is

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.740 
tricky so what we're gonna do here is
use<00:04:15.090> a<00:04:15.120> scroll<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:15.930> a<00:04:16.410> scroll<00:04:16.709> basically

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
use a scroll and a scroll basically

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.060 
use a scroll and a scroll basically
triples<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:18.810> damage<00:04:19.320> for<00:04:20.070> that<00:04:20.220> move<00:04:22.070> and

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
triples the damage for that move and

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.440 
triples the damage for that move and
we're<00:04:23.460> going<00:04:23.580> to<00:04:23.610> use<00:04:23.760> it<00:04:23.880> on<00:04:23.970> that<00:04:24.120> top<00:04:24.419> guy

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
we're going to use it on that top guy

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.830 
we're going to use it on that top guy
now<00:04:27.230> use<00:04:28.040> the<00:04:28.220> fireball<00:04:28.670> on<00:04:28.910> the<00:04:29.450> remaining

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
now use the fireball on the remaining

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.350 
now use the fireball on the remaining
guys<00:04:30.640> and<00:04:32.500> then<00:04:33.500> we'll<00:04:34.220> finish<00:04:34.460> off<00:04:34.790> with<00:04:34.820> a

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
guys and then we'll finish off with a

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.920 
guys and then we'll finish off with a
scroll<00:04:35.780> through<00:04:36.050> the<00:04:36.170> bottom<00:04:36.470> guys<00:04:40.930> that

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
scroll through the bottom guys that

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.720 
scroll through the bottom guys that
one's<00:04:42.110> actually<00:04:42.260> pretty<00:04:43.220> tough<00:04:43.400> because<00:04:43.580> you

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
one's actually pretty tough because you

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.550 
one's actually pretty tough because you
have<00:04:43.880> to<00:04:44.030> go<00:04:44.180> in<00:04:44.300> that<00:04:44.450> order<00:04:44.690> or<00:04:45.050> it<00:04:45.410> won't

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
have to go in that order or it won't

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:55.530 
have to go in that order or it won't
work<00:04:46.390> and<00:04:48.220> then<00:04:49.220> our<00:04:49.370> last<00:04:49.550> one<00:04:51.040> cluster<00:04:52.040> bomb

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.660 

this<00:04:56.540> one<00:04:56.750> is<00:04:57.020> also<00:04:57.260> a<00:04:57.770> little<00:04:57.830> tricky<00:04:58.460> so<00:05:00.670> what

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
this one is also a little tricky so what

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:10.710 
this one is also a little tricky so what
we're<00:05:01.820> gonna<00:05:01.910> do<00:05:02.240> is<00:05:05.710> bomb<00:05:06.710> this<00:05:06.980> first<00:05:08.800> group

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:21.780 
we're gonna do is bomb this first group
no

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.950 

okay<00:05:22.790> off<00:05:22.910> to<00:05:23.060> edit<00:05:23.270> this<00:05:23.390> but<00:05:23.720> I<00:05:25.900> can't<00:05:26.900> I

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
remember okay this one is tricky so the

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.330 
remember okay this one is tricky so the
way<00:05:34.820> we're<00:05:34.970> going<00:05:35.090> to<00:05:35.150> start<00:05:35.420> this<00:05:35.600> one<00:05:35.660> is

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340
