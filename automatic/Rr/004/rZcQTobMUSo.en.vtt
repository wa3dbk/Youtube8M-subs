00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.039
 little buoys I've put about 3 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.580
 tablespoons of oil in a 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.910
 pan I'm going to sautÃ© a little bit first 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.910
 garlic 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.300
 slightly so that only with a 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.899
 little bit of gold I'll put it right away 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.899
 the onion 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.920
 I already have lightly browned garlic and 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.920
 let's put the balls 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.120
 I'm going to put a little salt like 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.840
 it was always the onion so that 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.840
 do before 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.590
 I have had the onion 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.050
 a couple of minutes and we already have it I'm going to 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.010
 put the bacon, we're going to give it 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.010
 also a little bit 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.920
 I 'm going to raise the fire a little 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.920
 to be done 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.630
 I already have the bacon that I have had 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.980
 cooking for a minute I'm going to 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.980
 put the ham 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.900
 I'm going to put the beans 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.200
 we're going to mix it and I'm going to put a 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.200
 little salt and pepper 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.530
 some little things of these pepper 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.880
 and many because I going down 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.109
 It takes a lot of ham but 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.109
 always in front of prosecutors 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.069
 Well, I've had enough of it 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.319
 for a couple of minutes the beans with 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.560
 all the ingredients and I'm going to put 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:23.640
 like half glass of water 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.980
 if the beans are tender 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.780
 that's why there are different sizes because 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.920
 they were directly from the pod they are not 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.690
 frozen 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.190
 so I'm going to have them here cooking 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.530
 about 15 minutes 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.370
 After that time I will look to see how they are going 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:42.010
 of tender I'll give you a couple more minutes 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.110
 if necessary I'll cook 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.680
 mid fire 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.980
 and covers and so will concentrate all your 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.980
 taste 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.320
 Well it 's been about 15 minutes 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.540
 I have tasted them of salt and of tender 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.700
 13 minutes we were already perfect has 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.130
 raised the fire so that it was consumed 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.300
 the little water that was left and now 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.300
 we have ready to place 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.540
 Well, I have already placed our 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.640
 beans with bacon and ham 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.060
 have been very rich to try them with 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.060
 many
