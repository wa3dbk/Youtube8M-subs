00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:14.250
 pg 18 let me tell you something about the 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.070
 city ​​we both understand that 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.970
 one or the other from survival 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:24.779
 we have always grown old together 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.939
 again she was burned down only 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.669
 to be rebuilt from the ashes 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.499
 she is the scar in the cycle of 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:35.030
 life 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:39.980
 Time passes but she stays 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:45.140
 and stone after stone bones around bone 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.000
 everything goes back to us this time it is 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.800
 different 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.290
 the balance has been postponed 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:57.799
 the wheel has detached itself from the axle 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:02.710
 is blood flow out swell out 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:02.710
 squirt from every artery in this city 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.810
 can be picked up what is good for a 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.200
 empty hand without a sword without a sword 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.200
 arrow 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.090
 there is one of them maybe 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.840
 may be a key that turns 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.520
 in the right lock the right door 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.780
 one of the light in itself as well 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.780
 fears the darkness 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.380
 He will make it
