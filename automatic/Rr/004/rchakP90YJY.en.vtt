this<00:00:05.160> one<00:00:05.339> happens<00:00:05.580> to<00:00:05.609> be<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:05.759> 1997<00:00:06.600> model<00:00:06.930> and

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
this one happens to be a 1997 model and

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.250 
this one happens to be a 1997 model and
we're<00:00:07.890> changing<00:00:08.370> out<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:09.120> power<00:00:09.719> steering

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
we're changing out the power steering

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.430 
we're changing out the power steering
pressure<00:00:10.950> line<00:00:11.280> today<00:00:12.049> first<00:00:13.049> thing<00:00:13.170> we<00:00:13.259> need

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
pressure line today first thing we need

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.400 
pressure line today first thing we need
to<00:00:13.469> do<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.980> get<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.030> vehicle<00:00:15.450> up<00:00:15.929> in<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.289> air

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
to do is get the vehicle up in the air

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.109 
to do is get the vehicle up in the air
so<00:00:16.650> we<00:00:16.680> can<00:00:16.800> get<00:00:17.010> underneath<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.580> I've<00:00:17.789> got<00:00:18.090> it

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
so we can get underneath it I've got it

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.529 
so we can get underneath it I've got it
on<00:00:18.270> ramps<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.939> next<00:00:20.939> we're<00:00:21.119> going<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.359> be

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
on ramps and next we're going to be

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.340 
on ramps and next we're going to be
taking<00:00:21.930> off<00:00:22.189> the<00:00:23.189> recovery<00:00:24.060> our<00:00:24.420> two<00:00:24.840> coolant

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350

tank<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:26.519> give<00:00:26.670> us<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.880> little<00:00:27.029> extra<00:00:27.210> clearance

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
tank to give us a little extra clearance

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.040 
tank to give us a little extra clearance
to<00:00:28.470> get<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.920> top<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.580> line<00:00:29.789> off<00:00:29.970> okay<00:00:30.929> the

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
to get the top of the line off okay the

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.470 
to get the top of the line off okay the
first<00:00:31.260> thing<00:00:31.500> we're<00:00:31.679> going<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.920> do<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.480> we're

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
first thing we're going to do is we're

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.750 
first thing we're going to do is we're
going<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.630> remove<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:34.710> brace<00:00:35.130> right<00:00:35.399> here

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
going to remove this brace right here

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.479 
going to remove this brace right here
and<00:00:36.450> it's<00:00:36.600> held<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:36.930> by<00:00:37.140> three<00:00:37.680> thirteen

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
and it's held on by three thirteen

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:57.160 
and it's held on by three thirteen
millimeter

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.470 

now<00:00:58.160> after<00:00:58.430> we<00:00:58.520> get<00:00:58.610> that<00:00:58.760> brace<00:00:59.059> out<00:00:59.329> of<00:00:59.390> the

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
now after we get that brace out of the

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.500 
now after we get that brace out of the
way<00:01:00.100> we<00:01:01.100> want<00:01:01.340> to<00:01:01.399> remove<00:01:01.730> the<00:01:02.059> coolant

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
way we want to remove the coolant

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.490 
way we want to remove the coolant
reservoir<00:01:02.840> here<00:01:03.430> look<00:01:04.430> there<00:01:04.909> is<00:01:05.120> a<00:01:05.500> 10

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
reservoir here look there is a 10

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.149 
reservoir here look there is a 10
millimeter<00:01:06.830> add<00:01:07.220> nut<00:01:07.640> right<00:01:07.880> here<00:01:09.130> take<00:01:10.130> that

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
millimeter add nut right here take that

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.180 
millimeter add nut right here take that
out<00:01:10.610> of<00:01:10.729> the<00:01:10.820> way<00:01:11.260> and<00:01:12.260> then<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:12.650> line<00:01:12.920> that

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
out of the way and then the line that

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.749 
out of the way and then the line that
goes<00:01:13.430> through<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:13.820> radiator<00:01:14.180> oh<00:01:15.490> clamp<00:01:16.490> here

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
goes through the radiator oh clamp here

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.600 
goes through the radiator oh clamp here
we<00:01:17.060> can<00:01:17.180> slide<00:01:17.540> that<00:01:17.780> back<00:01:18.250> slide<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.400> hose

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
we can slide that back slide the hose

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.160 
we can slide that back slide the hose
off<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:21.140> now<00:01:21.290> we<00:01:21.350> have<00:01:21.830> two<00:01:22.729> little<00:01:23.600> push<00:01:23.900> pins

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
off and now we have two little push pins

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.149 
off and now we have two little push pins
one<00:01:24.680> is<00:01:24.950> down<00:01:25.580> here<00:01:26.500> way<00:01:27.500> down<00:01:27.710> here<00:01:28.009> on<00:01:28.100> the

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
one is down here way down here on the

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:40.630 
one is down here way down here on the
bottom<00:01:36.940> there's<00:01:37.940> that<00:01:38.300> one<00:01:38.509> and<00:01:38.780> is<00:01:38.990> a<00:01:39.640> smaller

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
bottom there's that one and is a smaller

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.419 
bottom there's that one and is a smaller
one<00:01:40.759> right<00:01:41.119> here<00:01:42.880> that<00:01:43.880> now<00:01:44.479> we<00:01:44.539> can<00:01:45.160> move<00:01:46.160> our

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
one right here that now we can move our

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:53.620 
one right here that now we can move our
cooler<00:01:47.119> take<00:01:51.520> now<00:01:52.520> right<00:01:52.789> here<00:01:53.090> is<00:01:53.300> the

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
cooler take now right here is the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.840 
cooler take now right here is the
pressure<00:01:54.470> line<00:01:54.800> where<00:01:55.009> it<00:01:55.100> connects<00:01:55.460> to<00:01:55.580> the

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
pressure line where it connects to the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.550 
pressure line where it connects to the
pump<00:01:56.179> and<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:58.490> fitting<00:01:59.060> right<00:01:59.300> here<00:01:59.630> is<00:01:59.840> a<00:01:59.869> 16

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
pump and the fitting right here is a 16

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.330 
pump and the fitting right here is a 16
millimeter<00:02:01.960> hex<00:02:02.960> on<00:02:03.229> there<00:02:03.520> so<00:02:04.689> we'll<00:02:05.689> use<00:02:05.869> a

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
millimeter hex on there so we'll use a

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:25.710 
millimeter hex on there so we'll use a
16<00:02:07.509> going<00:02:08.509> to<00:02:08.600> open<00:02:08.810> end<00:02:08.989> wrench

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:45.150 

there<00:02:26.720> will<00:02:26.840> be<00:02:26.900> a<00:02:28.390> ring<00:02:29.390> underneath<00:02:30.020> there

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.990 

okay<00:02:46.160> now<00:02:47.860> you<00:02:48.860> do<00:02:49.130> want<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.370> put<00:02:49.520> a<00:02:49.550> container

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
okay now you do want to put a container

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.510 
okay now you do want to put a container
underneath<00:02:50.930> there<00:02:51.350> to<00:02:51.740> catch<00:02:52.010> some<00:02:52.280> of<00:02:52.430> that

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
underneath there to catch some of that

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.360 
underneath there to catch some of that
fluid<00:02:52.970> that<00:02:53.000> comes<00:02:53.209> out<00:02:56.650> now<00:02:57.650> here<00:02:58.010> is<00:02:58.160> the

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
fluid that comes out now here is the

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.320 
fluid that comes out now here is the
pressure<00:02:59.209> line<00:02:59.739> that<00:03:00.739> goes<00:03:01.310> on<00:03:01.610> to<00:03:02.180> the

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
pressure line that goes on to the

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.090 
pressure line that goes on to the
steering<00:03:02.690> box<00:03:02.900> now<00:03:03.860> what<00:03:04.100> I've<00:03:04.220> done<00:03:04.250> here<00:03:04.870> is

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
steering box now what I've done here is

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.400 
steering box now what I've done here is
you<00:03:07.100> can<00:03:07.250> see<00:03:07.489> I've<00:03:08.030> cut<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.540> line<00:03:08.750> off<00:03:09.050> and

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
you can see I've cut the line off and

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.260 
you can see I've cut the line off and
I'm<00:03:10.340> going<00:03:10.670> to<00:03:10.910> use<00:03:11.870> a<00:03:11.900> 18<00:03:12.970> millimeter<00:03:13.970> deep

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
I'm going to use a 18 millimeter deep

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.160 
I'm going to use a 18 millimeter deep
socket<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:15.020> a<00:03:15.739> ratchet<00:03:15.770> to<00:03:16.870> remove<00:03:17.870> that

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
socket and a ratchet to remove that

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.560 
socket and a ratchet to remove that
reason<00:03:18.650> being<00:03:18.860> is<00:03:19.280> it's<00:03:19.760> very<00:03:19.820> tight<00:03:20.300> down

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
reason being is it's very tight down

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.870 
reason being is it's very tight down
here<00:03:20.630> and<00:03:21.290> if<00:03:21.770> you<00:03:21.830> use<00:03:21.980> an<00:03:22.130> open<00:03:22.459> end<00:03:22.640> wrench

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
here and if you use an open end wrench

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.180 
here and if you use an open end wrench
you're<00:03:23.060> probably<00:03:23.239> round<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.810> corners<00:03:24.800> off<00:03:24.980> on

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
you're probably round the corners off on

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.940 
you're probably round the corners off on
on<00:03:25.580> the<00:03:25.970> fitting<00:03:26.350> so<00:03:27.350> that's<00:03:27.739> what<00:03:27.860> we're

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
on the fitting so that's what we're

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.190 
on the fitting so that's what we're
going<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.100> do<00:03:28.720> okay<00:03:29.720> it's<00:03:29.900> going<00:03:30.049> to<00:03:30.110> be<00:03:30.170> a

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
going to do okay it's going to be a

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.539 
going to do okay it's going to be a
little<00:03:30.350> bit<00:03:30.470> difficult<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:31.010> see<00:03:31.340> what<00:03:31.459> I'm

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
little bit difficult to see what I'm

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:37.000 
little bit difficult to see what I'm
doing<00:03:31.580> here<00:03:32.530> but<00:03:33.530> I've<00:03:33.650> got<00:03:33.830> the<00:03:35.440> ratchet<00:03:36.440> here

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
doing here but I've got the ratchet here

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:16.949 
steering fluid and then of course you'll

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:19.309 
steering fluid and then of course you'll
have<00:07:17.099> to<00:07:17.340> drive<00:07:17.909> it<00:07:18.150> and<00:07:18.300> it<00:07:18.870> will<00:07:19.020> grown

00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 
have to drive it and it will grown

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:21.409 
have to drive it and it will grown
because<00:07:19.500> it'll<00:07:19.770> be<00:07:19.830> air<00:07:20.039> in<00:07:20.159> the<00:07:20.250> system<00:07:20.460> but

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:21.419 
because it'll be air in the system but

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:24.230 
because it'll be air in the system but
once<00:07:21.930> the<00:07:22.169> air<00:07:22.440> has<00:07:22.860> been<00:07:22.889> purged<00:07:23.400> out<00:07:23.610> the

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 
once the air has been purged out the

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.800 
once the air has been purged out the
steering<00:07:24.539> should<00:07:24.870> be<00:07:24.990> back<00:07:25.169> to<00:07:25.319> normal<00:07:26.810> and

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:27.810 
steering should be back to normal and

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.830 
steering should be back to normal and
just<00:07:28.219> replace<00:07:29.219> your<00:07:29.610> coolant<00:07:30.150> reservoir<00:07:30.330> and
