really count if you'll really see the

really count if you'll really see the
difference<00:00:37.219> when<00:00:37.699> you're<00:00:37.820> adjusting<00:00:38.059> from

one<00:00:38.929> level<00:00:39.109> to<00:00:39.260> the<00:00:39.440> next<00:00:39.530> it<00:00:40.429> doesn't<00:00:40.879> have

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
one level to the next it doesn't have

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:42.910 
one level to the next it doesn't have
any<00:00:41.269> internal<00:00:41.960> memory<00:00:42.260> which<00:00:42.440> is<00:00:42.469> a<00:00:42.620> little

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
any internal memory which is a little

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.889 
any internal memory which is a little
bit<00:00:43.100> strange<00:00:43.550> for<00:00:43.730> a<00:00:43.879> camera<00:00:44.210> I<00:00:44.329> mean<00:00:44.539> we<00:00:44.780> do

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
bit strange for a camera I mean we do

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.569 
bit strange for a camera I mean we do
know<00:00:45.050> digital<00:00:45.530> memory<00:00:45.679> on<00:00:45.920> cameras<00:00:46.280> anyway

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
know digital memory on cameras anyway

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.389 
know digital memory on cameras anyway
pretty<00:00:46.909> rubbish<00:00:47.149> but<00:00:47.989> it<00:00:48.589> gives<00:00:48.710> you<00:00:48.859> a<00:00:48.890> 32

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
pretty rubbish but it gives you a 32

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.239 
pretty rubbish but it gives you a 32
megabyte<00:00:49.879> card<00:00:50.870> with<00:00:51.199> it<00:00:51.379> which<00:00:51.890> is<00:00:52.219> pretty

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:52.249 
megabyte card with it which is pretty

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:54.279 
megabyte card with it which is pretty
pointless<00:00:52.999> really<00:00:53.449> because<00:00:53.749> again<00:00:54.140> you're

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
pointless really because again you're

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:55.329 
pointless really because again you're
not<00:00:54.440> going<00:00:54.620> to<00:00:54.679> really<00:00:54.800> be<00:00:54.920> able<00:00:55.010> to<00:00:55.159> capture

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
not going to really be able to capture

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:56.770 
not going to really be able to capture
anything<00:00:55.670> more<00:00:55.909> than<00:00:56.030> like<00:00:56.179> five<00:00:56.210> or<00:00:56.659> six

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
anything more than like five or six

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.389 
anything more than like five or six
textures<00:00:57.289> if<00:00:57.499> you've<00:00:57.649> got<00:00:57.769> the<00:00:57.859> images<00:00:58.219> on<00:00:58.370> a

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
textures if you've got the images on a

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.869 
textures if you've got the images on a
high<00:00:58.609> resolution<00:00:59.379> however<00:01:00.379> it<00:01:00.979> is<00:01:01.159> really

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
high resolution however it is really

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.969 
high resolution however it is really
lovely<00:01:02.149> to<00:01:02.510> use<00:01:02.719> camera<00:01:03.229> the<00:01:03.649> image

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
lovely to use camera the image

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.010 
lovely to use camera the image
stabilisation<00:01:04.670> here<00:01:05.120> really<00:01:05.570> works<00:01:05.750> when<00:01:05.960> you

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
stabilisation here really works when you

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.050 
stabilisation here really works when you
take<00:01:06.200> pictures<00:01:06.590> people<00:01:06.800> it's<00:01:07.130> not<00:01:07.250> blurry<00:01:07.759> the

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
take pictures people it's not blurry the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.910 
take pictures people it's not blurry the
face<00:01:08.329> detection<00:01:08.540> you<00:01:09.020> can<00:01:09.140> turn<00:01:09.320> on<00:01:09.590> and<00:01:09.799> off

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
face detection you can turn on and off

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.920 
face detection you can turn on and off
it<00:01:10.250> gets<00:01:10.670> everything<00:01:10.939> get<00:01:11.210> an<00:01:11.299> amazing<00:01:11.540> focus

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
it gets everything get an amazing focus

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.330 
it gets everything get an amazing focus
and<00:01:12.290> obviously<00:01:12.590> when<00:01:12.770> you're<00:01:12.860> zooming<00:01:13.219> in

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
and obviously when you're zooming in

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.459 
and obviously when you're zooming in
later<00:01:13.549> to<00:01:13.850> crop<00:01:14.149> or<00:01:14.390> like<00:01:14.600> tie<00:01:15.140> to<00:01:15.200> your

later to crop or like tie to your

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:17.679 
later to crop or like tie to your
pictures<00:01:15.829> it's<00:01:16.009> really<00:01:16.369> simple<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:16.820> use<00:01:17.000> there

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
pictures it's really simple to use there

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.770 
pictures it's really simple to use there
are<00:01:17.810> 19<00:01:18.350> modes<00:01:18.740> which<00:01:19.460> little<00:01:20.329> excessive

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
are 19 modes which little excessive

possibly everything from sunset to my
clubs<00:01:23.479> to<00:01:23.750> snow<00:01:24.079> but<00:01:24.979> should<00:01:25.369> you<00:01:25.430> want<00:01:25.700> to

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
that's good with price points around 259

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.529 
that's good with price points around 259
and<00:01:34.579> it<00:01:34.670> would<00:01:34.759> have<00:01:34.850> gone<00:01:34.880> on<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.180> market

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539
