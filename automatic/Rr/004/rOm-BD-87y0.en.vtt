anything<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.890> then<00:00:20.760> move<00:00:21.090> up<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.539> sensitivity<00:00:22.109> so

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
anything I then move up a sensitivity so

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.320 
anything I then move up a sensitivity so
beginning<00:00:23.400> here<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.609> need<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.789> be<00:00:23.850> really

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
beginning here I need to be really

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.910 
beginning here I need to be really
really<00:00:24.630> defensive<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.439> try<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.740> get<00:00:25.830> that

really defensive to try and get that

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.519 
really defensive to try and get that
first<00:00:26.130> kill<00:00:26.840> see<00:00:27.840> if<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:28.019> can<00:00:28.109> get<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.260> guy<00:00:28.410> in

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
first kill see if I can get that guy in

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.779 
first kill see if I can get that guy in

boom<00:00:31.019> that's<00:00:31.619> awesome<00:00:31.859> Snagit<00:00:32.550> sensitivity<00:00:33.180> -

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
boom that's awesome Snagit sensitivity -

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.930 
boom that's awesome Snagit sensitivity -
and<00:00:34.320> it's<00:00:34.530> tough<00:00:34.770> I've<00:00:35.070> given<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.579> few<00:00:35.760> goes

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
and it's tough I've given it a few goes

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.860 
and it's tough I've given it a few goes
and<00:00:36.300> it's<00:00:36.450> tough<00:00:36.719> it's<00:00:36.930> not<00:00:37.170> easy<00:00:37.469> at<00:00:37.680> all<00:00:37.920> oh

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
and it's tough it's not easy at all oh

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.479 
and it's tough it's not easy at all oh
gosh<00:00:39.870> how'd<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.140> get<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.920> only<00:00:41.100> way<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.370> can

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
gosh how'd I get that the only way I can

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.130 
gosh how'd I get that the only way I can
go<00:00:41.670> up<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:41.940> groups<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.570> terms<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:43.020> my

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
go up in groups in terms of my

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.139 
go up in groups in terms of my
sensitivities<00:00:43.770> if<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.980> get<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> double<00:00:44.520> kill<00:00:44.550> or

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
sensitivities if I get a double kill or

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.200 
sensitivities if I get a double kill or
triple<00:00:45.719> kill<00:00:45.930> etc<00:00:46.410> etc<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.250> if<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:47.820> get<00:00:48.030> like<00:00:48.149> a

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
triple kill etc etc so if I get like a

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.330 
triple kill etc etc so if I get like a
group<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.899> guys<00:00:49.079> really<00:00:49.739> really<00:00:49.920> quickly

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
group of guys really really quickly

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.299 
group of guys really really quickly
then<00:00:50.700> then<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.690> can<00:00:51.989> go<00:00:52.110> up<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.920> big<00:00:53.100> batches

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
then then I can go up and in big batches

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.549 
then then I can go up and in big batches
or<00:00:53.730> if<00:00:54.180> my<00:00:54.449> streets<00:00:54.780> get<00:00:55.020> like<00:00:55.110> three<00:00:55.289> people

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
or if my streets get like three people

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.260 
or if my streets get like three people
in<00:00:55.649> one<00:00:55.680> then<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.219> just<00:00:56.430> change<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.789> around<00:00:57.000> so

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
in one then I just change it around so

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.240 
in one then I just change it around so
I'm<00:00:58.109> going<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.320> end<00:00:58.440> up<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.739> really<00:00:59.100> weird

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
I'm going to end up in a really weird

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.779 
I'm going to end up in a really weird
sensitivity<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.239> poor<00:01:00.809> going<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.020> go<00:01:01.109> from

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
sensitivity and poor going to go from

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.359 
sensitivity and poor going to go from
use<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.239> highest<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.140> lowest<00:01:04.170> all<00:01:04.650> in

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
use the highest and the lowest all in

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.920 
use the highest and the lowest all in
the<00:01:05.519> same<00:01:05.700> gun<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.000> have<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.299> reset<00:01:06.630> at<00:01:06.810> each

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
the same gun I have to reset at each

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.399 
the same gun I have to reset at each
time<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.439> spawn<00:01:07.799> just<00:01:08.460> an<00:01:08.549> ongoing<00:01:08.670> thing<00:01:09.409> but

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
time I spawn just an ongoing thing but

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.060 
time I spawn just an ongoing thing but
it<00:01:11.250> really<00:01:11.700> tests<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.170> random<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
it really tests you on the random the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.539 
it really tests you on the random the
random<00:01:14.100> sensitivity<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:16.430> there's<00:01:17.430> another

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
random sensitivity so there's another

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.929 
random sensitivity so there's another
guy<00:01:17.759> here

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
guy here

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:21.910 
guy here
okay<00:01:20.539> there<00:01:20.780> I've<00:01:20.899> got<00:01:20.929> three<00:01:21.289> people<00:01:21.560> in<00:01:21.799> a

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
okay there I've got three people in a

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.130 
okay there I've got three people in a
row<00:01:22.069> so<00:01:22.369> now<00:01:22.579> we've<00:01:22.700> got<00:01:22.789> to<00:01:22.850> change<00:01:23.030> up<00:01:23.869> to

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
row so now we've got to change up to

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.679 
row so now we've got to change up to
seven<00:01:24.729> pretty<00:01:25.729> sure<00:01:25.969> for<00:01:26.179> someone<00:01:26.509> coming

yes thank you so then I gotta got to

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.920 
yes thank you so then I gotta got to
sensitivities<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:40.909> now<00:01:41.030> I<00:01:41.060> can<00:01:41.240> finally<00:01:41.510> cool

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
sensitivities and now I can finally cool

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.870 
sensitivities and now I can finally cool
in<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.200> street<00:01:42.530> which<00:01:42.680> hopefully<00:01:43.040> get<00:01:43.460> me<00:01:43.640> a
