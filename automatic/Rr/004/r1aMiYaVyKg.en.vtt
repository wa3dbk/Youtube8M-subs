 I burned mine like that then 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.020

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:16.020

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:18.330

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.250

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.079
 as meaningless but also as 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.939
 meaningful 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.860
 I live in Germany and not in the 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.840
 Switzerland or Austria but I think 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.380
 Hardest to conclude is that you 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.140
 decision 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.100
