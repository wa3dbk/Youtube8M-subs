00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
in the belt pouch and I do think it

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.260 
in the belt pouch and I do think it
would<00:04:37.110> be<00:04:37.289> an<00:04:37.410> excellent<00:04:37.919> skinning<00:04:38.729> a<00:04:38.819> folding

skinning knife and I also think it would
just<00:04:41.280> be<00:04:41.490> excellent<00:04:42.120> as<00:04:42.300> a<00:04:42.330> folding<00:04:42.900> utility

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
just be excellent as a folding utility

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.279 
just be excellent as a folding utility
knife<00:04:43.770> just<00:04:44.130> around<00:04:44.610> a<00:04:44.819> campsite<00:04:45.180> it<00:04:46.050> could

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
knife just around a campsite it could

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.490 
knife just around a campsite it could
slice<00:04:46.680> cordage<00:04:47.690> maybe<00:04:48.690> even<00:04:48.960> a<00:04:48.990> little<00:04:49.139> food

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
slice cordage maybe even a little food

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.980 
slice cordage maybe even a little food
prep<00:04:49.860> it<00:04:50.069> could<00:04:50.220> do<00:04:50.400> a<00:04:50.430> just<00:04:51.090> light<00:04:51.330> utility

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
prep it could do a just light utility

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.920 
prep it could do a just light utility
and<00:04:52.199> then<00:04:52.710> you<00:04:52.860> would<00:04:52.979> have<00:04:53.130> like<00:04:53.490> a<00:04:53.780> seven<00:04:54.780> or

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
and then you would have like a seven or

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.140 
and then you would have like a seven or
eight<00:04:55.169> inch<00:04:55.410> fixed<00:04:56.250> blade<00:04:56.460> for<00:04:56.729> your<00:04:56.880> heavy

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
eight inch fixed blade for your heavy

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.330 
eight inch fixed blade for your heavy
work<00:04:57.479> so<00:04:57.960> it<00:04:58.080> would<00:04:58.169> be<00:04:58.289> a<00:04:58.320> great<00:04:58.620> complement

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
work so it would be a great complement

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.150 
work so it would be a great complement
to<00:04:59.370> an<00:04:59.580> outdoor<00:04:59.789> fixed<00:05:00.419> blade<00:05:01.130> overall<00:05:02.130> I

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
to an outdoor fixed blade overall I

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.540 
to an outdoor fixed blade overall I
think<00:05:02.340> it's<00:05:02.669> a<00:05:02.789> well-designed<00:05:03.419> knife<00:05:04.550> both

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
think it's a well-designed knife both

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.909 
think it's a well-designed knife both
the<00:05:05.849> the<00:05:05.880> length<00:05:06.539> and<00:05:06.900> the<00:05:07.380> width<00:05:07.620> and

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
the the length and the width and

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.189 
the the length and the width and
thickness<00:05:08.099> of<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:08.699> handle<00:05:08.910> will<00:05:09.539> give<00:05:09.810> you<00:05:09.990> a

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
thickness of the handle will give you a

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.230 
thickness of the handle will give you a
secure<00:05:10.770> grip<00:05:10.949> and<00:05:11.250> the<00:05:11.370> shape<00:05:11.610> of<00:05:11.789> the<00:05:11.910> handle

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
secure grip and the shape of the handle

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.180
