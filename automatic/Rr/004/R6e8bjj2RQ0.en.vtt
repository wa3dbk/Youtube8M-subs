00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
satisfying to make runs any time I

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.440 
satisfying to make runs any time I
haven't<00:01:54.689> really<00:01:54.810> put<00:01:55.079> too<00:01:55.259> much<00:01:55.409> thought<00:01:55.470> into

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
haven't really put too much thought into

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.370 
haven't really put too much thought into
selection<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.719> sort<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:57.960> stuff<00:01:58.020> it's

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
selection and that sort of stuff it's

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.530 
selection and that sort of stuff it's
just<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.680> way<00:01:58.799> but<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.850> way<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.090> sort<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.329> gone

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
just the way but the way it sort of gone

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.969 
just the way but the way it sort of gone

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
got a lot of lot of promising ability

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.710 
got a lot of lot of promising ability
sort<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.680> thing<00:02:07.799> um<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.300> I've<00:02:09.300> actually

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
sort of thing um so I've actually

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.820 
sort of thing um so I've actually
enjoyed<00:02:09.959> saying<00:02:10.500> that

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
enjoyed saying that

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.800 
enjoyed saying that
I've<00:02:10.860> sort<00:02:11.130> of<00:02:11.190> been<00:02:11.370> had<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.480> be<00:02:12.570> quite

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
I've sort of been had to be quite

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.720 
I've sort of been had to be quite
patient<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.160> guess<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.580> probably

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
patient and and I guess that probably

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.100 
patient and and I guess that probably
just<00:02:15.030> makes<00:02:15.210> you<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.390> lil<00:02:15.510> bit<00:02:15.630> hungry<00:02:15.810> or<00:02:16.020> when

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
just makes you a lil bit hungry or when

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.930 
just makes you a lil bit hungry or when
you<00:02:16.200> do<00:02:16.320> go<00:02:16.500> out<00:02:16.650> there<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.010> instead<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.820> maybe

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
you do go out there and instead of maybe

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.150 
you do go out there and instead of maybe
throwing<00:02:18.300> it<00:02:18.450> away<00:02:18.540> for<00:02:18.720> 50<00:02:19.410> or<00:02:19.470> 60<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:19.950> sort

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
throwing it away for 50 or 60 you sort

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.560 
throwing it away for 50 or 60 you sort
of<00:02:20.190> do<00:02:20.370> want<00:02:20.490> to<00:02:20.610> push<00:02:20.760> on<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.120> make<00:02:21.240> it<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.420> big

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
of do want to push on and make it a big

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.240
