offset<00:01:12.490> weight<00:01:12.700> causes<00:01:12.970> the<00:01:13.270> motor<00:01:13.450> to

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
offset weight causes the motor to

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.690 
offset weight causes the motor to
vibrate<00:01:14.050> like<00:01:14.170> crazy<00:01:14.530> this<00:01:14.950> is<00:01:15.190> what's<00:01:15.400> used

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
vibrate like crazy this is what's used

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.219 
vibrate like crazy this is what's used
to<00:01:15.850> give<00:01:15.940> the<00:01:16.060> buzzing<00:01:16.390> signal<00:01:16.720> inside<00:01:16.900> a<00:01:16.960> cell

battery and make the motor spin and
vibrate<00:01:32.710> so<00:01:33.640> that's<00:01:33.790> all<00:01:33.970> we<00:01:34.119> really<00:01:34.149> need<00:01:34.660> to

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
vibrate so that's all we really need to

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.260 
vibrate so that's all we really need to
a<00:01:35.110> little<00:01:35.380> motor<00:01:35.619> going<00:01:35.910> next<00:01:36.910> we're<00:01:37.119> going<00:01:37.210> to

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
a little motor going next we're going to

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.240 
a little motor going next we're going to
add<00:01:37.360> a<00:01:37.420> piece<00:01:37.630> of<00:01:37.780> foam<00:01:38.020> tape<00:01:38.290> to<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.740> top<00:01:38.979> of

add a piece of foam tape to the top of

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.300 
add a piece of foam tape to the top of
the<00:01:39.340> toothbrush<00:01:39.670> head<00:01:40.560> can<00:01:41.560> we<00:01:41.680> mount<00:01:41.979> the

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
the toothbrush head can we mount the

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.749 
the toothbrush head can we mount the
motor<00:01:42.490> on<00:01:42.790> top<00:01:43.690> of<00:01:43.899> the<00:01:43.990> toothbrush<00:01:44.580> so<00:01:45.580> that

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
motor on top of the toothbrush so that

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.820 
motor on top of the toothbrush so that
even<00:01:46.060> when<00:01:46.179> the<00:01:46.270> motor<00:01:46.450> spins<00:01:46.959> this<00:01:47.530> weight

terminals now if you notice I got one

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:01.529 
terminals now if you notice I got one
wire<00:01:59.200> bent<00:01:59.530> down<00:01:59.890> touching<00:02:00.550> the<00:02:00.640> foam<00:02:00.910> the

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
wire bent down touching the foam the

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.150 
wire bent down touching the foam the
others<00:02:01.720> up<00:02:01.899> above<00:02:02.259> and<00:02:02.560> it's<00:02:02.679> going<00:02:02.770> to<00:02:02.830> clamp

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
others up above and it's going to clamp

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.770 
others up above and it's going to clamp
down<00:02:03.310> onto<00:02:03.819> the<00:02:03.910> top<00:02:04.090> of<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.300> battery<00:02:04.479> when

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
down onto the top of the battery when

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.300 
down onto the top of the battery when
it's<00:02:04.899> in<00:02:05.020> there<00:02:05.200> let's<00:02:05.590> see<00:02:05.740> if<00:02:05.830> it<00:02:05.950> works

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
it's in there let's see if it works

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.570 
it's in there let's see if it works
so<00:02:06.910> I've<00:02:06.970> got<00:02:07.119> the<00:02:07.240> battery<00:02:07.569> in<00:02:07.690> there<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.580> so

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
so I've got the battery in there and so

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.980 
so I've got the battery in there and so
the<00:02:09.880> motors<00:02:10.119> going<00:02:10.270> look<00:02:10.479> I've<00:02:10.750> got<00:02:10.899> the

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
the motors going look I've got the

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.280 
the motors going look I've got the
battery<00:02:11.260> stuck<00:02:11.590> down<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.340> foam<00:02:12.550> tape<00:02:13.290> okay

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
battery stuck down to the foam tape okay

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.530 
battery stuck down to the foam tape okay
so<00:02:14.349> you've<00:02:14.620> got<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:15.040> battery<00:02:15.819> hooked<00:02:16.030> up<00:02:16.240> the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
so you've got the battery hooked up the

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.390 
so you've got the battery hooked up the
motors<00:02:16.870> going<00:02:17.020> then<00:02:17.380> more<00:02:17.590> or<00:02:17.709> less<00:02:17.860> just<00:02:17.890> set

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
motors going then more or less just set

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.550 
motors going then more or less just set
it<00:02:18.490> down<00:02:18.900> see<00:02:19.900> what<00:02:19.930> happens

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
it down see what happens

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:41.950 
it down see what happens
the<00:02:21.520> suckers<00:02:21.910> really<00:02:22.330> go

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.850 

you

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.890 

so<00:02:45.370> as<00:02:45.430> you<00:02:45.490> can<00:02:45.580> see<00:02:45.730> this<00:02:45.850> thing<00:02:45.970> really<00:02:46.330> goes

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
so as you can see this thing really goes

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.870 
so as you can see this thing really goes
because<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.440> directionality<00:02:48.220> imparted<00:02:48.850> by

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
because the directionality imparted by

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.210 
because the directionality imparted by
the<00:02:49.030> bristles<00:02:49.600> of<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.870> toothbrush<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:54.040> that's

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
the bristles of the toothbrush so that's

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.000 
the bristles of the toothbrush so that's
it<00:02:54.400> an<00:02:54.610> easy<00:02:54.940> five<00:02:55.390> minutes<00:02:55.960> -<00:02:56.290> thrush<00:02:56.560> robot

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
it an easy five minutes - thrush robot

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.890 
it an easy five minutes - thrush robot
the<00:02:57.220> bristlebot<00:02:57.670> from<00:02:58.060> evil<00:02:58.330> mad<00:02:58.450> scientist
