shut out but he said he was feeling it

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.340 
shut out but he said he was feeling it
so<00:01:15.090> started<00:01:15.810> trying<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:17.720> first<00:01:18.720> few<00:01:18.990> attempts

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
so started trying it first few attempts

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.109 
so started trying it first few attempts
were<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.680> really<00:01:20.040> sketchy<00:01:20.430> money<00:01:20.850> were<00:01:20.939> just

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
were like really sketchy money were just

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.929 
were like really sketchy money were just
jumping<00:01:21.960> down<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.680> switch<00:01:22.920> got<00:01:23.670> pretty

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
jumping down it and switch got pretty

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.789 
jumping down it and switch got pretty
scary<00:01:24.210> when<00:01:24.299> there<00:01:24.600> we<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:24.869> jump<00:01:25.200> was<00:01:25.320> that

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.179 

way<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:29.310> won't<00:01:29.430> really<00:01:29.640> get<00:01:29.880> close<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.799> then<00:01:31.799> I

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
way it won't really get close and then I

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.710 
way it won't really get close and then I
think<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.150> was<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.829> attempt<00:01:34.829> 20<00:01:35.270> he<00:01:36.270> put<00:01:36.479> chip

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
think it was that attempt 20 he put chip

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.530 
think it was that attempt 20 he put chip
in<00:01:36.869> his<00:01:36.930> board<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.860> anyways<00:01:38.220> Dale<00:01:38.670> said<00:01:38.970> after

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540
