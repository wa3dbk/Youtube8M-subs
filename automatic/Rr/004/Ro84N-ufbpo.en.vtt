00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.100 

watching<00:02:06.729> by<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:06.909> lack<00:02:07.150> of<00:02:07.180> action<00:02:07.630> so<00:02:07.840> far

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
watching by the lack of action so far

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.540 
watching by the lack of action so far
maybe<00:02:08.440> not<00:02:08.679> enough

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
maybe not enough

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.250 
maybe not enough
but<00:02:10.850> he<00:02:10.940> does<00:02:11.120> have<00:02:11.300> two<00:02:11.480> assistants<00:02:11.990> at<00:02:12.140> the

fourth<00:02:12.470> official

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.250 

Lampard<00:02:21.120> is<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.360> captain<00:02:21.569> and<00:02:22.140> his

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
Lampard is the captain and his

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.140 

rightly<00:02:43.010> so

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.240 

private<00:02:45.750> conduct<00:02:46.200> not<00:02:46.470> against<00:02:46.769> an<00:02:46.920> opponent

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
private conduct not against an opponent

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.059 
private conduct not against an opponent
but<00:02:48.209> against<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.659> ball<00:02:48.900> boy

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
but against the ball boy

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.539 
but against the ball boy
and<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.879> one<00:02:51.180> rats<00:02:51.689> moment<00:02:52.549> quite

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
and in that one rats moment quite

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.550 
and in that one rats moment quite
probably<00:02:53.939> Chelsea's<00:02:54.659> final<00:02:55.109> hope<00:02:55.290> of

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
probably Chelsea's final hope of

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.329 
probably Chelsea's final hope of
reaching<00:02:55.799> the<00:02:56.010> league<00:02:56.219> cup<00:02:56.459> final<00:02:56.489> poster
