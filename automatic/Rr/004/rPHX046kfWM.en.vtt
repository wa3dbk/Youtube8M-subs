00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.630 
laughs baseball is where it's at it
doesn't<00:00:04.770> get<00:00:04.859> any<00:00:04.980> better<00:00:05.130> than<00:00:05.250> that

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
doesn't get any better than that

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.360 
doesn't get any better than that
and<00:00:06.089> I<00:00:06.299> think<00:00:06.509> that's<00:00:06.690> where<00:00:07.160> you<00:00:08.160> know<00:00:08.250> the

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
and I think that's where you know the

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.890 
and I think that's where you know the
driver<00:00:08.580> comes<00:00:08.820> from<00:00:09.030> it's<00:00:09.420> just<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.660> get<00:00:09.750> back

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
driver comes from it's just to get back

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.999 
driver comes from it's just to get back
to<00:00:10.019> that<00:00:10.110> postseason<00:00:12.200> strength<00:00:13.200> recalled<00:00:13.679> and

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
to that postseason strength recalled and

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.350 
to that postseason strength recalled and
that's<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.280> way<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:14.519> one<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.089> final

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
that's the way this one is the final

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.870 
that's the way this one is the final
score<00:00:15.780> that's<00:00:16.170> five<00:00:16.650> Braves<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.520> the

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.310 
score that's five Braves to the
experience<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:18.539> this<00:00:18.660> team<00:00:18.900> has<00:00:19.020> had<00:00:19.140> the

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
experience that this team has had the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.960 
experience that this team has had the
last<00:00:19.439> two<00:00:19.710> september's<00:00:20.220> playing<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:20.789> tight

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
last two september's playing in tight

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.060 
last two september's playing in tight
races<00:00:21.180> how<00:00:21.630> much<00:00:21.779> can<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.020> help<00:00:22.260> this<00:00:22.859> time

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
races how much can that help this time

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.099 
races how much can that help this time
of<00:00:23.220> year<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:23.460> time<00:00:23.609> around<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:24.150> definitely

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
of year this time around I definitely

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.540 
of year this time around I definitely
think<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.320> can<00:00:25.439> help<00:00:25.560> but<00:00:25.859> when<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.460> have

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
think it can help but when you have

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.450 
think it can help but when you have
experience<00:00:27.119> being<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:27.900> situation<00:00:28.619> it

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
experience being in this situation it

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.560 
experience being in this situation it
definitely<00:00:29.849> takes<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.150> little<00:00:30.269> bit<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
definitely takes a little bit of the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.089 
definitely takes a little bit of the
pressure<00:00:30.750> off<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.289> we<00:00:31.410> just<00:00:31.439> look<00:00:31.679> for<00:00:31.890> double

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
pressure off and we just look for double

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.729 
pressure off and we just look for double

use and the bottom line is what we try

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.200 
use and the bottom line is what we try
to<00:00:34.800> do<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.100> whenever<00:00:35.280> series<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:35.910> talked<00:00:36.120> about
