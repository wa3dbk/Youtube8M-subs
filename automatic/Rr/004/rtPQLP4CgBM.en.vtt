00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
I guess I will get started just to

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.279 
I guess I will get started just to
finish<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.180> up<00:00:42.590> what<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.620> got<00:00:43.860> right<00:00:44.129> here<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:45.289> my

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
finish it up what I got right here is my

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.760 
finish it up what I got right here is my
paintbrushes<00:00:46.860> which<00:00:47.820> I'm<00:00:48.480> using<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:49.289> red

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
paintbrushes which I'm using this red

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.100 
paintbrushes which I'm using this red
cellular<00:00:50.460> phone<00:00:51.530> to<00:00:52.530> grab<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.070> them<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:54.110> if

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
cellular phone to grab on to them and if

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.889 
cellular phone to grab on to them and if
you<00:00:55.829> by<00:00:56.100> then<00:00:56.399> like<00:00:57.270> they<00:00:57.449> might<00:00:57.600> slide

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
you by then like they might slide

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.020 
you by then like they might slide
through<00:00:58.199> but<00:00:58.469> what<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.680> did<00:00:58.980> here<00:00:59.280> was<00:00:59.309> just<00:00:59.640> jam

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
through but what I did here was just jam

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.720 
through but what I did here was just jam
two<00:01:00.390> into<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> same<00:01:01.530> cell<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:01.980> there<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.640> they

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
two into the same cell in there so they

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.280 
two into the same cell in there so they
could<00:01:02.879> hold<00:01:03.059> each<00:01:03.239> other<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.989> worked<00:01:04.170> just

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
could hold each other and it worked just

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.729 
could hold each other and it worked just
fine

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
fine

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.570 
fine
as<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:06.030> can<00:01:06.150> see<00:01:06.560> thicker<00:01:07.560> paintbrushes<00:01:08.130> just

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
as you can see thicker paintbrushes just

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.280 
as you can see thicker paintbrushes just
stick<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.000> there<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.510> they<00:01:09.960> don't<00:01:10.080> really

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
stick in there and they don't really

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.280 
stick in there and they don't really
have<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.530> problem<00:01:11.570> you<00:01:12.570> can<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:12.930> cut<00:01:13.140> them

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
about like looking anywhere special for

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.559 
about like looking anywhere special for
then

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
then

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.110 
then
and<00:02:12.659> I'm<00:02:13.109> using<00:02:13.290> paint<00:02:13.680> so<00:02:14.159> you<00:02:14.790> don't<00:02:14.939> really

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
and I'm using paint so you don't really

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.649 
and I'm using paint so you don't really
have<00:02:15.239> to<00:02:15.480> apply<00:02:15.749> too<00:02:15.810> much<00:02:16.019> pressure<00:02:16.379> on<00:02:17.659> the

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
have to apply too much pressure on the

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.780 
have to apply too much pressure on the
painting<00:02:19.079> and<00:02:19.290> that's<00:02:19.829> good<00:02:20.099> because<00:02:20.280> if<00:02:20.549> your

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
painting and that's good because if your

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.720 
painting and that's good because if your
wrist<00:02:21.420> extension<00:02:21.840> isn't<00:02:22.439> strong<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:23.609> you

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
wrist extension isn't strong that you

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.440 
wrist extension isn't strong that you
still<00:02:24.180> won't<00:02:24.299> have<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.569> problem<00:02:25.019> I<00:02:26.269> guess<00:02:27.269> I<00:02:27.359> was

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
still won't have a problem I guess I was

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.929 
still won't have a problem I guess I was

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
painted these pictures I I did it with

painted these pictures I I did it with
pencil<00:05:31.860> first<00:05:32.280> and<00:05:33.919> so<00:05:34.919> what<00:05:35.580> I<00:05:35.610> did<00:05:35.700> we<00:05:36.030> say

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
pencil first and so what I did we say

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.029 
pencil first and so what I did we say
you<00:05:36.210> can<00:05:36.450> just<00:05:36.570> stick<00:05:36.720> a<00:05:36.930> pencil<00:05:37.289> instead<00:05:37.950> of

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
you can just stick a pencil instead of

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:41.440 
you can just stick a pencil instead of
one<00:05:38.220> of<00:05:38.280> the<00:05:38.340> paintbrushes<00:05:38.760> on<00:05:39.210> the<00:05:40.370> styrofoam

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
one of the paintbrushes on the styrofoam

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.740 
one of the paintbrushes on the styrofoam
tone<00:05:42.450> there<00:05:42.780> there<00:05:43.160> and<00:05:44.389> it<00:05:45.389> would<00:05:45.570> work<00:05:45.720> just

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
tone there there and it would work just

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.659 
tone there there and it would work just
fine<00:05:46.080> I<00:05:46.650> just<00:05:46.860> made<00:05:46.979> like<00:05:47.099> a<00:05:47.130> little<00:05:47.250> outline

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
fine I just made like a little outline

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.790 
fine I just made like a little outline
that<00:05:47.789> I<00:05:47.849> would<00:05:48.030> follow<00:05:48.240> and<00:05:48.750> it<00:05:49.289> helps<00:05:49.590> a<00:05:49.650> lot

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
that I would follow and it helps a lot

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.370 
that I would follow and it helps a lot
and<00:05:50.160> then<00:05:50.310> I<00:05:50.340> did<00:05:50.610> get<00:05:50.820> help<00:05:51.000> with<00:05:51.450> the<00:05:51.630> like

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
and then I did get help with the like

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.960 
and then I did get help with the like
with<00:05:52.560> the<00:05:52.680> Rays<00:05:52.889> so<00:05:53.190> they<00:05:53.310> would<00:05:53.430> all<00:05:53.550> be<00:05:53.580> even

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
with the Rays so they would all be even

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:59.750 
with the Rays so they would all be even
throughout<00:05:54.450> all<00:05:54.690> the<00:05:54.840> pictures<00:05:56.419> and<00:05:57.740> and<00:05:58.760> so

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
throughout all the pictures and and so

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.860 
throughout all the pictures and and so
that<00:05:59.789> would<00:06:00.090> just<00:06:00.240> spread<00:06:00.450> out<00:06:00.510> through<00:06:00.780> all

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
that would just spread out through all

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.150 
that would just spread out through all
the<00:06:00.900> pictures<00:06:01.110> and<00:06:01.320> get<00:06:01.620> bigger<00:06:01.860> and<00:06:02.010> bigger

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160
