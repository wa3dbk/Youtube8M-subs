00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
the crease I'm going to use a slightly

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.619 
the crease I'm going to use a slightly
darker<00:00:58.260> shade<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.739> brown<00:00:58.980> here<00:00:59.550> it's<00:01:00.300> still<00:01:00.510> in

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
darker shade of brown here it's still in

that<00:01:00.660> warm<00:01:01.020> color<00:01:01.289> family<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.100> I'm<00:01:02.579> using<00:01:02.730> a

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
that warm color family and I'm using a

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.729 
that warm color family and I'm using a
blending<00:01:03.510> brush<00:01:03.570> just<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.229> blend<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.680> right

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
blending brush just to blend that right

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.500 
blending brush just to blend that right
into<00:01:05.189> my<00:01:05.280> crease<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.880> I'm<00:01:06.000> kind<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.270> holding

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
into my crease and I'm kind of holding

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.929 
into my crease and I'm kind of holding
my<00:01:07.110> brush<00:01:07.470> at<00:01:07.710> an<00:01:07.890> angle<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:08.820> get

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
my brush at an angle so that I can get

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.090 
my brush at an angle so that I can get
most<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.570> color<00:01:09.750> payoff<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
most of the color payoff on to the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.370 
most of the color payoff on to the
socket<00:01:11.490> bone<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.840> going<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.200> make

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
socket bone and that is going to make

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.499 
socket bone and that is going to make
your<00:01:13.560> eye<00:01:13.590> look<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.250> lot<00:01:14.460> more<00:01:14.580> defined<00:01:15.150> and

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
your eye look a lot more defined and

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.050 
your eye look a lot more defined and
it's<00:01:16.409> really<00:01:16.799> going<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.100> give<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.280> sultry

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
it's really going to give that sultry

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.050 
it's really going to give that sultry
look<00:01:18.570> very<00:01:18.930> reminiscent<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.710> Bardot<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.490> I'm

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.030 
look very reminiscent of Bardot and I'm
also<00:01:21.270> using<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.750> slightly<00:01:22.020> angled<00:01:22.560> brush<00:01:22.770> here

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
also using a slightly angled brush here

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
just to connect that to the outer V like

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:38.440 
just to connect that to the outer V like
the<00:01:25.680> outer<00:01:25.860> part<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.280> my<00:01:26.340> eye

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.390 

and<00:01:39.450> I'm<00:01:39.630> using<00:01:39.870> that<00:01:40.140> same<00:01:40.200> matte<00:01:41.010> brown

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400

elongated cat winged eyeliner so I'm

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.840

going to use a black gel eyeliner to do

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.390 
going to use a black gel eyeliner to do

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
this and this eyeliner is all going to

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.590 
this and this eyeliner is all going to
be<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> lot<00:01:59.730> thicker<00:02:00.030> than<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.450> would<00:02:00.570> normally

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
be a lot thicker than I would normally

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.090 
be a lot thicker than I would normally
do<00:02:01.080> it<00:02:01.230> this<00:02:01.440> is<00:02:01.590> going<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.830> be<00:02:01.890> very

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
do it this is going to be very

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.840 
do it this is going to be very
reminiscent<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.330> 1960s<00:02:04.200> 1950s<00:02:05.100> era<00:02:05.550> this

reminiscent of that 1960s 1950s era this

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.609 
reminiscent of that 1960s 1950s era this
is<00:02:06.030> very<00:02:06.210> typical<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.780> how<00:02:06.990> they<00:02:07.200> wore<00:02:07.440> the

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
is very typical of how they wore the

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.469 
is very typical of how they wore the
eyeliner<00:02:07.950> back<00:02:08.220> then<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:09.090> I'm<00:02:09.179> using<00:02:09.330> an

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
eyeliner back then so I'm using an

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.750 
eyeliner back then so I'm using an
artist<00:02:09.840> brush<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.320> do<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:11.040> just<00:02:11.370> really

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
artist brush to do this and just really

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.810
