00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
almost I think all of their products

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.040 
almost I think all of their products
have<00:00:58.710> four<00:00:58.980> stars<00:00:59.280> or<00:00:59.579> higher<00:00:59.910> in<00:01:00.300> rating

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
have four stars or higher in rating

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.529 
have four stars or higher in rating
which<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.379> crazy<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.879> just<00:01:02.910> been<00:01:03.300> hearing

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.660 
which is crazy and I just been hearing
everyone<00:01:03.989> raving<00:01:04.530> about<00:01:04.619> everything<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.580> that

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
everyone raving about everything in that

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.940 
everyone raving about everything in that
line<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.659> foundation<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.470> other<00:01:07.860> eye

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
line the foundation to the other eye

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.590 
line the foundation to the other eye
there's<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> pen<00:01:08.610> eyeliner<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.360> one

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
there's a pen eyeliner and this this one

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.050 
there's a pen eyeliner and this this one
so<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.290> decided<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.920> try<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.159> one<00:01:11.610> because<00:01:11.640> it

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
so I decided to try this one because it

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.859 
so I decided to try this one because it
also<00:01:12.270> has<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.650> lot<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.460> very<00:01:14.880> positive<00:01:15.330> reviews

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
also has a lot of very positive reviews

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.530 
also has a lot of very positive reviews
on<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.290> has<00:01:16.439> 4.5<00:01:17.130> stars<00:01:17.549> on<00:01:17.790> Sephora<00:01:18.119> calm

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
on it it has 4.5 stars on Sephora calm

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.230 
on it it has 4.5 stars on Sephora calm
so<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.259> decided<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.189> was<00:01:20.369> worth<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.700> try

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
so I decided it was worth a try

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.890 
so I decided it was worth a try
so<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:22.100> $25<00:01:23.100> that's<00:01:23.220> four<00:01:23.580> which<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.900> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
so this is $25 that's four which is the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.870 
so this is $25 that's four which is the
most<00:01:25.049> I've<00:01:25.259> ever<00:01:25.320> paid<00:01:25.470> for<00:01:25.979> an<00:01:26.460> eyeliner

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
twist-off pencil like so I want to see

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.570 
twist-off pencil like so I want to see
actually<00:03:53.410> how<00:03:53.530> much<00:03:53.650> product<00:03:54.070> it<00:03:54.190> comes<00:03:54.310> with

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
actually how much product it comes with

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.640 
actually how much product it comes with
because<00:03:55.180> I<00:03:55.480> didn't<00:03:55.989> do<00:03:56.080> that<00:03:56.110> when<00:03:56.380> I<00:03:56.410> first

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
because I didn't do that when I first

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.030 
because I didn't do that when I first
got<00:03:57.010> it<00:03:57.190> but<00:03:58.090> this<00:03:58.269> is<00:03:58.390> a<00:03:58.480> $25<00:03:59.200> eyeliner<00:03:59.680> so<00:03:59.890> I'm

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
got it but this is a $25 eyeliner so I'm

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.979 
got it but this is a $25 eyeliner so I'm
hoping<00:04:00.459> it<00:04:00.880> at<00:04:01.000> least<00:04:01.209> went<00:04:01.510> half<00:04:01.690> way<00:04:01.870> down

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
hoping it at least went half way down

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.370 
hoping it at least went half way down
because<00:04:02.290> most<00:04:02.500> Islanders<00:04:03.100> only<00:04:03.670> go<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:05.170> tiny

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
because most Islanders only go the tiny

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.289 
because most Islanders only go the tiny
bit<00:04:05.530> still<00:04:05.950> going<00:04:08.850> okay<00:04:09.850> I<00:04:09.880> don't<00:04:10.000> want<00:04:10.239> to

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
bit still going okay I don't want to

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.720 
bit still going okay I don't want to
break<00:04:10.420> it<00:04:10.630> but<00:04:10.900> it<00:04:11.380> has<00:04:11.860> a<00:04:11.890> lot<00:04:12.160> of<00:04:12.250> product<00:04:12.610> in

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
to be waterproof but my eyeliner

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.230 
to be waterproof but my eyeliner
definitely<00:06:07.199> was<00:06:07.380> it<00:06:07.560> stayed<00:06:07.800> on<00:06:07.830> no<00:06:08.729> smudges
