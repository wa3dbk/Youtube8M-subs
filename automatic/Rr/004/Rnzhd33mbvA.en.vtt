00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
parameters and set the mesh resolution

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.170

because<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:41.940> work<00:00:42.090> with<00:00:42.120> blender<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
because I work with blender and the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.479 
because I work with blender and the
blender<00:00:43.140> preset<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.620> broken<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.250> one's

blender preset is broken this one's
always<00:00:44.670> worked<00:00:45.000> for<00:00:45.210> me<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.570> that's<00:00:45.690> what<00:00:45.899> I

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
always worked for me so that's what I

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
always worked for me so that's what I
normally<00:00:46.079> use<00:00:46.850> if<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:48.059> use<00:00:48.090> hexagon<00:00:48.809> or<00:00:49.200> one

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
normally use if you use hexagon or one

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.650 
normally use if you use hexagon or one
of<00:00:50.100> several<00:00:50.309> other<00:00:50.520> programs<00:00:50.820> they<00:00:51.239> all<00:00:51.360> have

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
of several other programs they all have

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.389 
of several other programs they all have
presets<00:00:52.559> here<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:53.070> work<00:00:53.219> very<00:00:53.250> well<00:00:55.399> then

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
presets here that work very well then

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.150 
presets here that work very well then
I'm<00:00:56.520> going<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.820> blender<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:58.010> importing<00:00:59.010> my

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
I'm going to blender and importing my

I'm going to blender and importing my
obj

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:14.329 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:17.649 

there's<00:01:14.990> my<00:01:15.259> blue<00:01:15.409> genesis<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:16.070> female<00:01:16.659> I'm

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
there's my blue genesis to female I'm

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.620 
there's my blue genesis to female I'm
going<00:01:18.020> to<00:01:18.140> do<00:01:18.229> a<00:01:18.259> very<00:01:18.590> easy<00:01:18.920> very<00:01:19.429> quick<00:01:20.090> morph

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
going to do a very easy very quick morph

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.830 
going to do a very easy very quick morph
here<00:01:21.399> just<00:01:22.399> to<00:01:22.640> make<00:01:22.789> her<00:01:22.939> a<00:01:22.969> little<00:01:23.390> bit

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
here just to make her a little bit

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.389 
here just to make her a little bit
bigger<00:01:24.110> so<00:01:24.409> that<00:01:24.740> it<00:01:24.829> changes<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:25.189> bone

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
bigger so that it changes the bone

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.940 
bigger so that it changes the bone
positions<00:01:25.929> make<00:01:26.929> her<00:01:27.079> waist<00:01:27.319> a<00:01:27.530> little<00:01:27.710> bit

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
positions make her waist a little bit

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.520 
positions make her waist a little bit
smaller<00:01:28.359> so<00:01:29.359> that<00:01:29.390> you<00:01:29.600> can<00:01:29.780> conspicuously

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
smaller so that you can conspicuously

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:46.490 
smaller so that you can conspicuously
tell<00:01:30.829> what<00:01:31.039> I've<00:01:31.159> done<00:01:31.369> here

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.850 

then<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.130> export<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.760> as<00:01:47.910> obj<00:01:48.360> again<00:01:48.830> Here<00:01:49.830> I

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
then I export that as obj again Here I

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.760 
then I export that as obj again Here I
am<00:01:50.100> back<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.520> dad<00:01:50.820> studio<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.660> I<00:01:52.320> will<00:01:52.530> start

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
what you're doing with your morph now

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.009 
what you're doing with your morph now
you<00:03:44.010> can<00:03:44.459> see<00:03:44.670> there<00:03:44.850> is<00:03:45.030> a<00:03:45.060> problem<00:03:45.510> when<00:03:45.989> i

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
you can see there is a problem when i

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.319 
you can see there is a problem when i
dial<00:03:46.320> in<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.650> new<00:03:46.799> morph<00:03:47.070> the<00:03:47.579> skeleton<00:03:48.090> does

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
dial in the new morph the skeleton does

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.050 
dial in the new morph the skeleton does
not<00:03:48.540> change<00:03:48.950> shape<00:03:49.950> and<00:03:50.160> size<00:03:50.340> with<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.850> morph

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
not change shape and size with the morph

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.660 
not change shape and size with the morph
so<00:03:51.360> when<00:03:52.260> I<00:03:52.290> attempt<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.709> pose<00:03:52.950> Genesis<00:03:53.489> to

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
so when I attempt to pose Genesis to

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.850 
so when I attempt to pose Genesis to
female<00:03:54.800> it's<00:03:55.800> going<00:03:56.129> to<00:03:56.310> look<00:03:56.489> terribly<00:03:57.330> wrong

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
female it's going to look terribly wrong

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.640 
female it's going to look terribly wrong
yikes<00:03:59.630> so<00:04:00.630> what<00:04:00.780> we're<00:04:00.900> going<00:04:01.020> to<00:04:01.110> do<00:04:01.320> now<00:04:01.470> is

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
yikes so what we're going to do now is

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.790 
yikes so what we're going to do now is
apply<00:04:01.770> a<00:04:01.920> skeleton<00:04:02.460> adjustment<00:04:02.940> so<00:04:03.290> I'm<00:04:04.290> going

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
apply a skeleton adjustment so I'm going

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.760 
apply a skeleton adjustment so I'm going

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.230 
to click on the joint editor tool up
here<00:04:07.800> it<00:04:08.130> looks<00:04:08.310> sort<00:04:08.460> of<00:04:08.550> like<00:04:08.610> a<00:04:08.730> bone<00:04:09.000> with<00:04:09.210> a

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
here it looks sort of like a bone with a

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.620 
here it looks sort of like a bone with a
band<00:04:09.660> date<00:04:09.840> across<00:04:10.080> it<00:04:11.000> which<00:04:12.000> means<00:04:12.330> that

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
band date across it which means that

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.510 
band date across it which means that
