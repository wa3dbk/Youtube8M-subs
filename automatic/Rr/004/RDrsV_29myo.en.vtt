00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
in light armor

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.620 
in light armor
it's<00:04:51.100> called<00:04:51.280> agile<00:04:51.520> defender<00:04:52.150> there's<00:04:52.419> five

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
it's called agile defender there's five

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.960 
it's called agile defender there's five
ranks<00:04:52.990> of<00:04:53.110> this<00:04:53.229> as<00:04:53.410> well<00:04:53.590> and<00:04:54.460> with<00:04:54.610> the<00:04:54.729> fifth

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
ranks of this as well and with the fifth

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.379 
ranks of this as well and with the fifth
rank<00:04:56.370> increases<00:04:57.370> the<00:04:57.490> armor<00:04:57.789> rating<00:04:57.910> of<00:04:58.270> your

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
rank increases the armor rating of your

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.140

light<00:04:58.600> armor<00:04:58.960> by<00:04:59.080> 100%<00:04:59.680> so<00:05:00.400> that's<00:05:00.550> a<00:05:00.669> ton<00:05:00.940> more

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
light armor by 100% so that's a ton more

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.510 
light armor by 100% so that's a ton more
armor<00:05:01.479> you're<00:05:01.599> getting<00:05:01.840> as<00:05:01.960> well<00:05:02.139> which<00:05:02.800> adds

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
armor you're getting as well which adds

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.360 
armor you're getting as well which adds
to<00:05:03.849> your<00:05:04.110> survivability<00:05:05.110> which<00:05:05.740> you<00:05:06.160> can't

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
to your survivability which you can't

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.350 
to your survivability which you can't
really<00:05:06.580> argue<00:05:06.639> with<00:05:06.910> that

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
really argue with that

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.510 
really argue with that
so<00:05:08.349> for<00:05:08.530> weapons<00:05:08.800> and<00:05:08.949> armor<00:05:09.160> it<00:05:09.250> should<00:05:09.430> be

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
so for weapons and armor it should be

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.029 
so for weapons and armor it should be
fairly<00:05:09.820> self-explanatory<00:05:10.419> by<00:05:11.050> now<00:05:11.199> one<00:05:11.800> hand
