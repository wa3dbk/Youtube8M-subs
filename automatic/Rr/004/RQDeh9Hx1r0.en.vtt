00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.140
 lot of thumb-up left 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.460
 many comments left behind and this one 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.289

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.630

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.149
 respond and just leave me 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.309
 immediately the very first reaction 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.750
 to grab 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.360
 I don't know why I'm so boring 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.059
 melvin what is your favorite band or who 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.950
 is your favorite singer lessons singer 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.070
 this is quite a difficult one 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.289
 ask me why because i really almost 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.390
 never mission safe really where i am 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.920
 someone very good without music 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.149
 and live so to speak 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.969
 you have those people who are really in the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.570
 of ever music that can just be 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.460
 not without 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.140
 and I hardly ever read 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.610
 maybe occasionally with something 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.100
 but that is not really one of them 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.840
 or from a certain singer me I have 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.189
 no favorite singer i have none 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.400
 favorite band so ask with none 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.400
 right 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.229
 I again what correct answer I did not want 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.200
 not why I am so difficult about that 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.430
 did a lot now you scare this mean 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.650
 I grabbed my own boost 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.850
 kudo 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.850
 and you have wasted time 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.869
 best commend ever 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.729
 what kind of phone do you have this I found 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.520
 pretty nice questions i have the samsung 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.130
 galaxy s5 yes look at it all the way 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.290
 nice and I like it very much 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.630
 i first had a galaxy s2 and did it 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.610
 to the galaxy s5 and i think it is one 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.740
 good mobile yes I am satisfied with it 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.750
 and I'm also quite careful with it 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.430
 once after it was smooth and then 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.050
 I slipped and then 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.540
 mobile better then I accidentally had 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.340
 time mobile did not let go and then there was 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.020
 a very small piece damaged 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.210
 if you are now very good viewers you 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.320
 here a very small piece with 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.910
 damage 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.680
 I have no scratches on my screen or 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.390
 not so i'm pretty sure faith goes with 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.030
 aversion but yes that's the phone 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.660
 I can say that I have no more 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.660
 say about that 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:29.040
 and now have quite a quick response 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.190
 no one likes your videos 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.760
 nobody needs your humor 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.370
 nobody thinks you're funny 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.200
 no worries i am nobody i found it 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.120
 quite a good reaction I was I would 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.260
 thought of what the fuck 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.000
 and then came the anticlimax so yes that 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.760
 melvin when I give you a new position 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.470
 what is your theory in the hospitality industry 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.750
 restaurants and five murders at 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.299
 five children and in are a number 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.400
 you suspect a natural oil the 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.260
 base in the restaurant and therefore everything is possible 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.510
 did not leave no 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.890
 melvin how long is a banana i have 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.750
 pretty sad news we have one 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.599
 no bananas in our house at the moment 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.069
 so i just had to see what's on one 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.720
 seemed banal and then I saw this one 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.579
 Galia melon 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.579
 we say look how long this thing is 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.390
 38 centimeters 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.520
 which language is the most difficult for you 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.200
 you can ask which language you are using 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.120
 I have no trouble because yes the are 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.690
 of course so much language in the world 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.370
 I don't speak 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.020
 how this all out just for you my 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.200
 can really expect true blanket away 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.300
 that I will answer it seriously 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.510
 Of course not start with much fun for 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.340
 your passion for the hundredth time 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.020
 people who don't know what they do with that 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.360
 cat mean we have a cat go 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.470
 to frodo and yes of course we want now 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.660
 see another child he is twice 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.250
 been previous videos and it is 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.440
 time again to show it once 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.350
 only I have a small problem 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.490
 frodo that is very much at the moment 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.140
 long outside 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.300
 so actually i can't go him 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.610
 filming I'll just try once 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.690
 to make another video of him 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.430
 I know you like it 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.060
 So are we just go I 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.190
 to do 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.410
 I promise you yes but this one 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.610
 asks a bum to have french bauer 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.610
 you for me 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.530
 which is really very bad though 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.720
 school year you had the most fun 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.520
 this is quite a nice question because I went 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.890
 you really think about it and then came 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.990
 I soon out of school or 4 and why 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.360
 because you have a school year four of us with 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.270
 Working week goes on and working weeks will be tough on that 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.569
 you can choose something or interest 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.479
 London or the Ardennes 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:52.219
 two more places in Paris and something else 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.479
 I chose the Ardennes because it seemed 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:55.339
 just super to go further 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:58.219
 in that it was also it was really a whole 

00:04:55.339 --> 00:05:00.889
 nice experience and that little thing in it 

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:03.169
 class 4 it does have class 4 it 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:05.119
 made school year I think yes 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:08.990
 place that was also nice class 2 too 

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:11.209
 but just class 4 yes that working week 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.469
 that 's just really super fat it was too 

00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:14.779
 really the lead so i think my 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:16.939
 experienced in you with school so and yes 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:18.259
 class 4 is for me think so 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:21.279
 been the nicest year 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:21.279
