 integrated early aid but there are still bottlenecks in the system it is 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:27.710
 to improve its position 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.779
 that's why the plan is 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.219
 constantly follow integrally established as an innovation on integral early aid 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.540
 according to constantly integral, 7 percent of the building blocks consist of a blow 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.620
 early signaling

 buffer basin 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.110
 I wanted to stab 2 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.160

 consistent diagnoses 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.230
 the building block friend you want these three again advice customers advice from the 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.320

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.280

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.990
 brook supports an SMS and advises parents this guidance is 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.680
 available during the entire process and can therefore have a birthday 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.659
 it rises synchronously 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.189
 preventive family support the family is supported through 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:01:59.920
 preventive programs 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.520

 guaranteed for optimal cooperation with these partners and aldermen 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.359
 the 87th minute think of work 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:40.749
 forming a sustainable management to work that ensures reliable 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.149
 links between all six building blocks 

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:46.949
 the aim is a nationwide whole of networks and integral 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:50.729
 early relief to realize that said outgoing is according to the building blocks
