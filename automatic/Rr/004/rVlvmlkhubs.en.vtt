00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.990
 is everyone is in Christ 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:14.849
 especially wikinews garden the front but 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.960
 before but the subscriber that I had to 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.600
 tell others to do rocketed ten 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.270
 members where I have thirty thousand subscribers 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.000
 it's marked here so thirty thousand with 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.859
 4 million shades ernotte complicated 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.849
 so on my videos all that so that makes 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.980
 very pleasure 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.420
 So here at the cliff everyone you 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.489
 really sorry for going to start that 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:40.770
 the information about iphone 5 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:41.940
 6 and 25-6 that he will not be much 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.950
 information was blowing because 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.719
 that sony is not improving big 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.059
 changes to talk to the iphone 5 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.559
 well done we'll say a little step 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.120
 that will happen that will be more for the 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.160
 big apple fans or those who have 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.870
 a lot of money to re buy a 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.489
 iphone since I'll tell you everything 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.410
 immediately hidden under them is as if 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.879
 you switch from iphone 4 iphone 4s it 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.920
 will just see maybe a few small 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.420
 changes that will be added in 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.040
 face that I still hope this 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.299
 give back even phone except with a 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.630
 other name it would still be very 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.000
 weird 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.290
 no but his country here it's okay 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.400
 turn branches as if you have to 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.049
 the money spent frankly even 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.909
 spent elsewhere it will be a little 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.250
 disappointing because the iphone his crate does not 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.560
 not going to ask finally for me 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.270
 it did not exist outright the purchase of 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.979
 this device but on the other hand 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.180
 be careful because here I actually 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.189
 really wanted to talk to you about 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.380
 the a26 wii is starting to have one say 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.090
 rumors and speculation but 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.009
 as serious enough since it's risky 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.229
 to be of those remunerated actually totally 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.549
 does that mean that anyway and 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.369
 26 Germans should appear 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.630
 should come out in 2014 tar should 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.070
 still to receive 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.420
 information and it remained to our 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.799
 questions will be back in 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.960
 the iphone 6 and I'm talking to you about that because 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.250
 that soubrÃ© the iphone 5 is for even for 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.840
 apple did not really matter and 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.460
 under really on iphone 6 postis good 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.710
 they really want to change the 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.909
 screen size ie 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.200
 the screen will be much greater it will 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.880
 to actually look like it's to forget a 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.049
 merger between a smartphone and a 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.820
 tablet it's true that now that 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.180
 does a lot of buzz ie the 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.040
 big phone 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.300
 samsung galaxy s 4 all that or that's 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.470
 really feel like fast it's 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.940
 a tablet but it's also a 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.080
 smartphone next because it's not 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.300
 as big as a tablet and that's 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.100
 as big as car smartphone 50 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.660
 much bigger than a smartphone 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.590
 normal size and so it's true that 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.120
 that's what really makes the vase is 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.760
 what the public is asking for is 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.370
 that's really the main cherub 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.110
 we will tell the public something that will 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.700
 to be between the smartphone and tablet that 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.160
 will still have a higher quality 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.290
 an influential screen a better 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.610
 image quality so still that's what 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.010
 to know if it is that the button 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.410
 big will outright disappear on 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.300
 the iphone 6 so it will be downright 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.310
 touch what to know also it's 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.500
 that there a little information is there that 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.510
 actually turns out to be fair 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.920
 she should squarely ie 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.110
 that he will have a fingerprint reader 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.850
 digitals which will be per year directly 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.709
 integrated on the home button 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.630
 finally the button enters quotation marks 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.340
 we are going to say the tactile man since he is going 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.239
 plus having two buttons at all if he 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.190
 must know also that the phone 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.720
 will not be flexible since I will 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.209
 had spoken or apple have filed a 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.220
 patent about flexibility in 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.270
 does the screen but that 's going to sound 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.590
 right now so maybe it 'll be 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.090
 for the iphone scene you know in 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.739
 twilight 26-16 where I believe we 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.239
 let's get markets in there in all 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.190
 case it's not for the iphone 6 the 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.480
 flexible phone but still we go 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.630
 so have to a bigger screen a 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.040
 better image quality which if he goes 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.640
 see yes so between a smartphone and a 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.110
 Tablet 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.700
 it's mostly also actually in the end 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.810
 the rome button that will also 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.430
 disappear so that's for sure they're going to 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.570
 turn into a touch that will not be 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.280
 thrown a phone because they're going 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.060
 turn a touch button but 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.440
 it is true that they will also do 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.850
 so appear a kind of reader 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.350
 fingerprint 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.549
 so that's all that's okay it's for a 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.160
 increased security at the level 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.420
 flights etc etc 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.860
 after that it's sure that the phone is not 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.470
 no rigor because if you scratch 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.269
 its fine taste on the textile dress we go 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.769
 call it that and all of a sudden 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.450
 you wanted down after finally open 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.310
 unlock your phone and that 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.380
 knowing that all this is going you did it 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.880
 fall that it's scratched down finally take 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.950
 fingerprints or 10 is very 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.930
 fragile and just a small stripe and 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.790
 after that here's the phone can not 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.549
 be available and will remain the 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.079
 to the bread you're going to say go ben for 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.750
 all the time actually for ever so 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:07.260
 it leaves to be bacteria so in fact 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.420
 to talk to you about this guy 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.220
 the fingerprint horns it's 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.480
 that actually this widescreen fingerprint 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.739
 digital all that I do not think it's ok 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.150
 to be the whole screen but I really believe 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.780
 for that it's going to be crystal of 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.250
 sapphire 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.799
 so if you want it really is to 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.229
 something that is a dream a rail to 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.820
 unreal bhl this will not be able to be scratched 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.639
 we will know more things in fact there 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.780
 about about in june 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.250
 so apple who are going to make the ads 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.050
 for the iphone 5 and it may be 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.910
 start a little talk for iphone 6 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.350
 but it's true so that this iphone so 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.050
 it seems to be quite promising by 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.160
 against iphone 5 is a lot less 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.360
 frankly a not a lot of 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.560
 changes we'll see how they 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.479
 will announce it maybe there are some 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.979
 not outright iphone 5 is where they 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.479
 are going to put down the low cost iphone 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.979
 so that's up to them to see because he 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.570
 there will also be the low cost that will appear 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.180
 soon with you know them 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.910
 marine colors and next game 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.139
 the hulls of different colors which has 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.910
 five different colors if I say no 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.169
 nonsense so it's true that it's risky 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.760
 to be quite competent also on it 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.350
 for the low cost iphone that will have no 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.850
 iphone 5 is normal should have one 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.320
 also be a little chama the video that 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.060
 is super fun is there I am in 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.860
 now makes it fun 30 May 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.720
 the harmony of the gentleman on my page 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.699
 personal facebook and then here is a 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.510
 huge thanks for the support to the next 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.510
