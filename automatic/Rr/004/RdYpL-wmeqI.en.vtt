00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.249 
versus gravity destroyer battles and
this<00:00:11.820> was<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.030> competition<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:12.929> was<00:00:13.049> from

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
the box and it'll be fun against gravity

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.390 
the box and it'll be fun against gravity
straw<00:00:15.660> yeah<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.650> combination<00:00:17.220> was<00:00:17.250> a

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
destroyer stadium really cool beyblades

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.070 
destroyer stadium really cool beyblades
and<00:00:28.859> i'll<00:00:28.980> first<00:00:29.220> launch<00:00:29.519> gravity<00:00:30.390> destroyer

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
and i'll first launch gravity destroyer

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.790 
and i'll first launch gravity destroyer
Oh<00:00:35.899> Harry<00:00:36.899> Smith

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
Oh Harry Smith

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.650 
Oh Harry Smith
oh<00:00:39.290> oh

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
oh oh

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.639 
oh oh
I<00:00:42.660> guess<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.050> was<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> pretty<00:00:43.559> good

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
I guess this was a pretty good

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.369 
I guess this was a pretty good
combination

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
combination

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.410 
combination
whoa<00:00:46.379> now<00:00:47.129> Maurice<00:00:47.700> makes<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.000> theory<00:00:48.180> test

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
whoa now Maurice makes a theory test

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.250 
whoa now Maurice makes a theory test
against<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:48.870> foyer<00:00:50.809> so<00:00:51.809> we're<00:00:51.899> gonna<00:00:51.989> just

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
against this foyer so we're gonna just

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.729 
against this foyer so we're gonna just
do<00:00:52.500> four<00:00:53.309> rounds<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:54.300> one<00:00:54.480> defensible<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.620> to

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
do four rounds to one defensible and to

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.069 
do four rounds to one defensible and to
encounter<00:00:55.980> on<00:00:56.340> four<00:00:56.520> destroyer<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.750> see<00:00:57.930> what

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
encounter on four destroyer to see what

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.790 
encounter on four destroyer to see what
will<00:00:58.199> happen

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
will happen

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.579 
will happen
so<00:00:59.670> restock<00:01:00.180> destroy<00:01:00.629> even<00:01:00.989> more<00:01:03.260> so<00:01:04.260> let's<00:01:04.470> be

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
so restock destroy even more so let's be

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.170 
so restock destroy even more so let's be
able<00:01:04.710> take<00:01:04.860> for<00:01:06.380> 100<00:01:07.380> another<00:01:08.220> big<00:01:08.490> attack<00:01:08.850> I

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
able take for 100 another big attack I

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.840 
able take for 100 another big attack I
guess<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.229> combination<00:01:10.799> wasn't<00:01:11.159> was<00:01:11.700> there

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
guess this combination wasn't was there

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.690 
guess this combination wasn't was there
for<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.090> really<00:01:12.299> good<00:01:12.570> reason<00:01:16.189> the<00:01:17.189> round<00:01:17.400> one

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
for a really good reason the round one

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.640 
for a really good reason the round one
goes<00:01:17.729> with<00:01:18.150> action<00:01:18.540> Aries<00:01:18.869> scores<00:01:19.290> now<00:01:19.439> one

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
goes with action Aries scores now one

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:28.999 
goes with action Aries scores now one
zero<00:01:19.950> no<00:01:20.250> time<00:01:20.490> for<00:01:20.670> round<00:01:20.850> two<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:27.860> Bob<00:01:28.860> will

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
zero no time for round two so Bob will

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.800 
zero no time for round two so Bob will
throw<00:01:29.189> us<00:01:29.250> off<00:01:29.460> Leslie<00:01:30.030> will<00:01:30.150> win

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.830
