 game consoles 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.569
 it will achieve 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:34.549

 every addition a nice holiday there is of course a good meal 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.600
 but that's not good enough for my ship 2 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.980
 If we are in the main restaurant and the Atlantic now have their full 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.850
 then the whole completely informal without reservation or pre-order 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.780

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.029
 third, it becomes areas of interest 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:46.959
 that is a solid term 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.519
 no problem no 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:54.579
 it is why he pursued the basis for that was his working day had ended Fri 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.579
 It is said that it is easy

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.489
 Stretching can be done here from the vinotheque 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.130
 my ship 2 years 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.160
 and how do you say so beautiful in the hamlet lies the truth and that's the name of it 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.860
 the vinotheque of my ship 2 here is someone special out of the two 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.690
 Mario Gomez our plan is so gradual 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.100

 Gutekunst but not much further Coach 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.910
 Failure to do so and we are already looking at Bianca Currie's concrete "We 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.219
 among other things, works of art for Fun Merkel apply 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:50.169
 Not 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:51.240
 not that one 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.660
 the spectators we are now here in the theater years on my ship 2 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.520

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.990
 in these disciplines 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:54.090
 Of course, that would not be all they will do if they do 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:57.509
 8 or 10 day trip on the make my ship 2 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:01.089
