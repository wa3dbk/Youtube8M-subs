00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.930
 how to make a focus of study 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.019
 photographic home and very economical for 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.849
 the first thing we need to do is go to 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.160
 the shop 100 pesetas to the Chinese more 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.870
 nearby and buy the typical salad bowl 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.800
 of plastic 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.529
 4 caps 4 bulbs and a bowl that 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.689
 lace with the salad bowl below 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.970
 to the plastic bowl will 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.919
 with a drill four holes the same 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.140
 diameter than the caps that we have 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.180
 bought once with the caps 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.820
 embedded in the salad bowl we will put 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.450
 all the wiring from behind behind 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.120
 the caps 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.520
 then we take the bowl more 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.070
 small and we will make a hole for you 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.710
 pass the cable we will pass the cable 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.780
 plug and we will place the bowl in the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.359
 bottom part of the salad bowl this 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.059
 Well bowl can be glued with silicone 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:55.829
 with glue or with insulating tape or with 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.570
 the first thing you find on hand in my 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.879
 case I give him glue and floor that 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.530
 I had over there because it's about doing 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.659
 the economic and to spend the least 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.720
 possible with those with the materials that 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:08.030
 we have at our reach 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.100
 once done this runs the inside of 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.440
 the plastic salad bowl with paper 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.620
 albal this makes it better to cool the 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.320
 light 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.710
 and at the same time makes the plastic does not 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.570
 heat sheath of light bulbs for 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.400
 that albal paper will not be spoiled by 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.770
 the edge of the salad bowl I put a 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.500
 little bit of electrical tape below 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.790
 I got the parasol of a car 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.220
 Reflective look and I cut it into pieces 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.840
 those pieces I was sticking around 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.539
 the salad bowl with five floors 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.930
 then with a chosen rope 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.870
 concise 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.370
 to act as a handle and that's all already 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.960

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.210
 professional as if it were perfectly 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.070
 a focus of 500 euros in a very 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.320
 economic with the materials that we have 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.910
