00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 Hello everyone guys with colors 1640 and 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.440
 today i would like to tell you about 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.400
 such a wonderful flash game and how 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.540
 your lassithi 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.030
 2 the game itself is something 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.050
 sort of intergalactic racing of the future 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:24.199
 on jet ships but I will not weary 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.199
 waiting let's look at the gameplay 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.309
 kill 9 different species are present 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.239
 ships at the beginning of the game will give you a bunch 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.340
 only three 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.480
 I recommend first hand 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:01.180
 used 1 2 about the third know 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:06.610
 I have not tried it with time when you 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:10.000
 open 4 I advise you not to use 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:13.960
 it is very low in mana with 100 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.590
 bump on the road yes qatar in my 3 4 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.950
 6 tracks they are very tortuous and there as 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.580
 important times 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:30.280
 I advise you to use 5 well 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:31.570
 Of course you are 8 7 they are also not bad 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.700
 behaves on the track 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:42.430
 blue two huge turbines well 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:44.580
 probably all ships a few words about 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.580
 charting 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.550
 overall the graphics are pretty good 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.610
 but of course for flash games there is 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.690
 certainly a couple of shortcomings but for example 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.070
 hand out 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.070
 low speed and start 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.940
 turn part of the track down below sometimes 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.430
 may disappear 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:06.760
 black light book talking about traffic 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.729
 what not to give and plot 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.610
 unfortunately in this and 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.110
 budget 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.650
 no, not just 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.650
 chasing 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.060
 I think 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.270
 over time it becomes 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.270
 here 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.780
 Thank you all for your attention with you 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.370
 absolutely 40 subscribe put 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.060
