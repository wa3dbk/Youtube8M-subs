recommend that you wash the stencil in
between<00:04:55.590> each<00:04:55.800> one<00:04:56.180> sometimes<00:04:57.180> you<00:04:57.330> can<00:04:57.450> get

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
between each one sometimes you can get

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.750 
between each one sometimes you can get
two<00:04:57.870> or<00:04:57.900> three<00:04:58.080> renditions<00:04:58.950> out<00:04:59.130> of<00:04:59.310> it<00:04:59.460> before

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
two or three renditions out of it before

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.400 
two or three renditions out of it before
you<00:04:59.789> have<00:05:00.030> to<00:05:00.180> wash<00:05:00.390> or<00:05:00.780> that<00:05:00.930> the<00:05:01.050> icing<00:05:01.380> gets

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
you have to wash or that the icing gets

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.969 
you have to wash or that the icing gets
on<00:05:01.680> the<00:05:01.770> back<00:05:01.919> and<00:05:02.160> starts<00:05:02.430> seeping<00:05:02.640> through

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
on the back and starts seeping through

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:06.590 
on the back and starts seeping through
but<00:05:04.979> definitely<00:05:05.550> you<00:05:05.700> have<00:05:05.729> to<00:05:05.940> wash<00:05:06.300> this

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.570 
but definitely you have to wash this
more<00:05:07.229> frequently<00:05:07.500> to<00:05:08.100> get<00:05:08.729> that<00:05:08.910> raised<00:05:09.180> look
