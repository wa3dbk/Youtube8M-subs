00:01:57.019 --> 00:01:57.029 
like with the power supply in the

00:01:57.029 --> 00:02:00.019 
like with the power supply in the
motherboard<00:01:57.569> it<00:01:57.749> supports<00:01:58.200> ITX<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.399> mini<00:01:59.819> ATX

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:00.029 
motherboard it supports ITX the mini ATX

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:03.769 
motherboard it supports ITX the mini ATX
and<00:02:00.569> ATX<00:02:01.159> type<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.340> boards<00:02:02.759> ok<00:02:03.149> in<00:02:03.329> case<00:02:03.600> you're

00:02:03.769 --> 00:02:03.779 
and ATX type of boards ok in case you're

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:05.300 
and ATX type of boards ok in case you're
wondering<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.289> size<00:02:04.529> of<00:02:04.709> the<00:02:04.829> motherboards

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
wondering the size of the motherboards

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.789 
wondering the size of the motherboards
that<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.549> supports<00:02:05.939> their<00:02:06.319> cable<00:02:07.319> management

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
that it supports their cable management

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.260 
that it supports their cable management
is<00:02:07.889> a<00:02:07.950> little<00:02:08.130> bit<00:02:08.220> different<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:08.789> this<00:02:09.090> type

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
is a little bit different on this type

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.510 
is a little bit different on this type
of<00:02:09.300> case<00:02:09.599> compared<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.349> other<00:02:10.530> cases<00:02:10.800> ok<00:02:11.459> so

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
of case compared to other cases ok so

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.820 
of case compared to other cases ok so
that's<00:02:12.330> one<00:02:12.540> thing<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:12.990> I<00:02:13.230> need<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.650> point

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
that's one thing that I need to point

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.339 
that's one thing that I need to point
out<00:02:14.099> about<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:14.610> but<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.270> cooling<00:02:15.690> factor<00:02:16.170> is

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
out about this but the cooling factor is

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.869 
out about this but the cooling factor is
there<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.800> does<00:02:16.980> come<00:02:17.340> with

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
there it does come with

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.729 
there it does come with
the<00:02:17.999> necessary<00:02:18.450> fans<00:02:18.749> except<00:02:19.200> for<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.469> front

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
the necessary fans except for the front

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.229 
the necessary fans except for the front
intake<00:02:20.159> fan<00:02:20.459> that<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.790> would<00:02:20.909> have<00:02:21.090> to

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
intake fan that you would have to

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.839 
intake fan that you would have to
install<00:02:21.540> here's<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.590> cable<00:02:23.219> management<00:02:23.430> it

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
install here's the cable management it

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.280 
install here's the cable management it
would<00:02:23.939> be<00:02:24.090> routed<00:02:24.329> behind<00:02:24.840> there<00:02:25.079> in<00:02:25.170> that

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
would be routed behind there in that

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.429 
would be routed behind there in that
corner<00:02:25.620> instead<00:02:26.040> of<00:02:26.249> going<00:02:26.489> behind<00:02:26.639> the

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.439 
corner instead of going behind the

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:30.020 
corner instead of going behind the
motherboard<00:02:28.439> for<00:02:28.950> example<00:02:29.459> there's<00:02:29.639> no<00:02:29.760> holes

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
motherboard for example there's no holes

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.940 
motherboard for example there's no holes
behind<00:02:30.299> there<00:02:30.659> instead<00:02:31.319> it's<00:02:31.499> at<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.739> back

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
behind there instead it's at the back

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.520 
behind there instead it's at the back
and<00:02:32.310> there's<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.359> view<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:34.019> fan<00:02:34.290> that<00:02:34.500> I

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
and there's the view of a fan that I

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.129 
and there's the view of a fan that I
added<00:02:34.859> for<00:02:35.400> intake<00:02:35.969> okay<00:02:36.629> so<00:02:36.719> it<00:02:36.840> gives<00:02:36.989> you<00:02:37.049> an

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:37.139 
added for intake okay so it gives you an

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:38.809 
added for intake okay so it gives you an
idea<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.469> can<00:02:37.620> add<00:02:37.739> two<00:02:37.980> fans<00:02:38.250> if<00:02:38.459> you<00:02:38.579> want

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
idea you can add two fans if you want

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.679 
idea you can add two fans if you want
alright<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:40.760> 120<00:02:41.760> millimeter<00:02:42.120> fans<00:02:42.389> fit

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
alright to 120 millimeter fans fit

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.490 
alright to 120 millimeter fans fit
nicely<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:44.629> what<00:02:45.629> else<00:02:45.780> can<00:02:45.959> I<00:02:46.019> show<00:02:46.049> you<00:02:46.260> here

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
nicely and what else can I show you here

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.530 
nicely and what else can I show you here
at<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.709> back<00:02:46.919> you've<00:02:47.310> got<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.519> power<00:02:47.790> supply<00:02:47.969> it

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
at the back you've got a power supply it

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.209 
at the back you've got a power supply it
doesn't<00:02:48.840> have<00:02:48.989> an<00:02:49.109> intake<00:02:49.499> for<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.829> air<00:02:49.950> for

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:50.219 
doesn't have an intake for the air for

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:51.619 
doesn't have an intake for the air for
the<00:02:50.280> power<00:02:50.459> supply<00:02:50.639> though<00:02:51.030> that<00:02:51.480> was<00:02:51.599> a

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
the power supply though that was a

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.240 
the power supply though that was a
little<00:02:51.810> bit<00:02:52.019> odd<00:02:52.469> that<00:02:52.500> they<00:02:52.859> didn't<00:02:53.069> put<00:02:53.219> that

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
little bit odd that they didn't put that

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.209 
little bit odd that they didn't put that
in<00:02:53.400> there<00:02:53.689> but<00:02:54.689> you<00:02:55.139> can<00:02:55.169> see<00:02:55.469> here<00:02:55.680> above<00:02:55.980> the

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:56.219 
in there but you can see here above the

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:58.099 
in there but you can see here above the
exhaust<00:02:56.699> fan<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.299> it<00:02:57.389> comes<00:02:57.599> included<00:02:57.780> with

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
exhaust fan that it comes included with

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.589 
exhaust fan that it comes included with
there's<00:02:58.769> some<00:02:58.919> switches<00:02:59.430> those<00:03:00.000> allow<00:03:00.329> you<00:03:00.389> to

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
there's some switches those allow you to

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.629 
there's some switches those allow you to
turn<00:03:00.840> high-low<00:03:01.500> for<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:01.829> fan<00:03:02.069> and<00:03:02.310> also<00:03:02.430> the

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
LED the blue LED on or off now you can

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.899 
LED the blue LED on or off now you can
see<00:03:06.540> here<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.109> cable<00:03:08.069> management<00:03:08.370> that<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:08.790> was

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
see here the cable management that I was

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.089 
see here the cable management that I was
talking<00:03:09.090> about<00:03:09.269> it's<00:03:09.750> on<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.079> side<00:03:10.319> ok<00:03:10.949> which

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
talking about it's on the side ok which

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.640 
talking about it's on the side ok which
is<00:03:11.129> fine<00:03:11.459> it<00:03:11.639> works<00:03:11.760> for<00:03:12.090> me<00:03:12.180> but<00:03:12.959> I<00:03:13.349> usually

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
is fine it works for me but I usually

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.530 
is fine it works for me but I usually
like<00:03:13.980> holes<00:03:14.310> along<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.909> motherboard<00:03:15.389> and

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
like holes along the motherboard and

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.420 
like holes along the motherboard and
they<00:03:15.659> didn't<00:03:15.840> add<00:03:16.049> that<00:03:16.260> in<00:03:16.439> here<00:03:16.650> so<00:03:16.889> that's

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
they didn't add that in here so that's

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.819 
they didn't add that in here so that's
not<00:03:17.819> very<00:03:18.000> good<00:03:18.319> even<00:03:19.319> though<00:03:19.439> they<00:03:19.620> have

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
not very good even though they have

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.409 
not very good even though they have
cable<00:03:20.040> management<00:03:20.310> there<00:03:20.760> I<00:03:20.790> still<00:03:21.150> want

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
cable management there I still want

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.170 
cable management there I still want
those<00:03:21.629> holes<00:03:22.159> on<00:03:23.159> the<00:03:23.370> motherboard<00:03:23.400> tray<00:03:23.939> so<00:03:24.030> I

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
those holes on the motherboard tray so I

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.640 
those holes on the motherboard tray so I
can<00:03:24.329> route<00:03:24.509> things<00:03:24.780> nicely<00:03:25.079> through<00:03:25.439> there

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
can route things nicely through there

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.939 
can route things nicely through there
overall<00:03:26.310> though<00:03:26.639> the<00:03:26.669> case<00:03:27.419> is<00:03:27.689> an<00:03:28.620> average

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:28.949 
overall though the case is an average

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:30.409 
overall though the case is an average
case<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.489> be<00:03:29.609> honest<00:03:29.909> nothing<00:03:30.090> spectacular

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
case to be honest nothing spectacular

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:31.999 
case to be honest nothing spectacular
out<00:03:31.199> of<00:03:31.319> the<00:03:31.409> ordinary

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:32.009 
out of the ordinary

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:34.129 
out of the ordinary
I<00:03:32.040> like<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.549> hot<00:03:32.729> swappable<00:03:33.239> drive<00:03:33.900> bay

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
I like the hot swappable drive bay

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:35.839 
I like the hot swappable drive bay
though<00:03:34.349> for<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.739> SSD<00:03:35.189> or<00:03:35.220> two<00:03:35.519> and<00:03:35.639> a<00:03:35.669> half
