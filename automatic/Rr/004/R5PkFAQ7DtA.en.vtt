00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello to all girls then and how to 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.759
 back with a new video 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.790
 actually today he is recording two 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.460
 so I do n't know which one you'll see first 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.139
 however this here will be the tutorial on 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.000
 as drawing limi eyebrows 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.430
 statistics collectively for it 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.320
 you requested and sincerely do me 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.820
 very pleased because for so many years 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.590
 that I fight with the shape of mine 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.750
 eyebrows and in the last period 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.480
 finally they have a shape almost 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.920
 the same so I'm happy I 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.559
 used products so to speak of 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.300
 Emergency this because I finished it 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.710
 the benefit pencil they used 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.510
 the last, for example, to the pencil 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.790
 I say I also finished the gel for 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.280
 eyebrows so you will also see 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.379
 let's say a method I use when 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.000
 just finished my pencils and then i 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.520
 my products that I normally use 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.760
 for the treatment of the massacres away and I hope that 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.079
 this video tutorial will help you there 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.170
 I send a kiss we choose the next one 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.050
 time for all guys then i am a 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.670
 bit cool then a polo shirt is then 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.470
 I like you now how or draw the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.070
 these eyebrows are my plays 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.990
 it comes naturally as you see I have 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.240
 however entire eyebrows many 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.729
 people just redesign it because 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.439
 therefore they do not completely have hairs 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.110
 have not completely restores the 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.549
 eyebrows shape to this one here 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.650
 eyebrows that I like best 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.600
 because it has a normal shape to an arc 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.520
 normal so I say washed 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.900
 simply a little to fill then a 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.810
 fill the little holes that they are 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.369
 at the beginning therefore denied to redefine 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.979
 more so as regards instead 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.770
 this, as you can see, is a 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.740
 moment of a different moment this 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.720
 because I find myself having a say 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.329
 sort of vertigo which therefore does not make me 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.520
 grow the hairs here provide the 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.040
 products that I am going to use for 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.520
 the moment I finished my classes 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.009
 pencils for eyebrows 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.920
 so both the benefit and the one 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:59.140
 kind of not opening this spoon 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.219
 what a limited edition of 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.259
 essence I believe last Christmas and I am 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:06.670
 present two eyeliner ricciarelli in 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.500
 cream 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.720
 I'm going to use this brown 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.980
 this number is a note that is good for 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.989
 my eyebrows 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.290
 even if I go to use this 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.000
 lighter brown eyeshadow to blend 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.680
 then to obviously make the 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.840
 eyebrows much more natural 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.849
 the problem of having as I said also 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.739
 in previous videos the eyebrows more 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.660
 dark compared to hair therefore not 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.700
 I can obviously go to use 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.140
 something much darker because 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.390
 it would make my look much more 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.769
 stiff something else stays inside you 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:41.260
 often even the set for 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.610
 eyebrows of essence this is not me 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.610
 particularly like 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.680
 since it doesn't last very long though 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.910
 usually uses work we say 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.579
 blend even the lighter eye shadow and 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.709
 precisely in cases of necessity the use 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:00.100
 and just to redesign however it is not a 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.959
 set that just makes other crazy 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.389
 what a brush should use 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.829
 classic of very fine lagers there 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:08.680
 we put very well with this here of 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:11.079
 essence just found it an hour 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.269
 99 and is perfect for teaching the 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:16.150
 eyebrows other that they must use 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.340
 is a corrector of use the 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.109
 corrector with more scrued than on 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.049
 so I'm going to use this here 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.710
 I do not like and the cover match 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.860
 of 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.660
 ds up this here 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.700
 then another past I'm going to do is 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.170
 use the gel and eyebrows by 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.960
 that in essence at this time 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.840
 finished and then for the moment I go 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.880
 to also use this jacket 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.920
 small troops will never return all of them 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.130
 we also know about the 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.690
 ca or buy the heaviest one 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.630
 complete the cheapest one for that 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.550
 it really serves little and nothing I can 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.440
 quietly begin to draw 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.130
 eyebrows in my living room 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:00.400
 essence is using the darker color 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:02.370
 I use this to say guide then 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:08.740
 to start making a guide line 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:16.030
 that a way then immediately to the part from 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:17.620
 correct on which I don't care about 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.440
 being excessively precise as 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:24.070
 you see already i am smearing because i will go to 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:27.790
 correct later with her liner 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.860
 and also with the corrector I take a 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:36.640
 brush of this type on the side 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:40.150
 softer start my eyeliner hours 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:44.200
 from the palette of essence in I apply one 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.810
 small amount is quite soft and 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.400
 so I don't want you to go drooling then 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.400
 the hotel to all small 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.620
 done this I am going to take the 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:11.790
 concealer for a classic brush from 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:20.850
 corrector and I'm going to redefine the bow 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:20.850
 here and also from below 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.960
 but let us proceed instead with the other part 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:33.530
 start as always from half eyebrows 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:36.470
 advice just that I'm going after re 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.600
 to take back my little brush and go to 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.990
 resume eyebrow set 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:45.669
 then the darkest part begins 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.669
 again implement my guideline 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:58.720
 I start from here therefore from the part I owe 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:58.720
 more correct yes 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.740
 now I proceed with fixing and then with the 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:27.190
 brush I'm going to break some 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:27.190
 lacquer itself drained mistress 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:38.550
 here are the brow nets marked 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:42.479
 as you can see they look anyway 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:44.340
 natural waited however owing them 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:47.310
 redraws the normal that the effect does not 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.669
 be super natural and we got it to the pc 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.330
 very 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:50.330
 Hello
