00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
around 6 hours or so on tall and then we

just<00:00:34.170> how<00:00:34.320> much<00:00:34.530> work<00:00:34.710> goes<00:00:34.890> into<00:00:34.950> creating

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
just how much work goes into creating

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.130 
just how much work goes into creating
the<00:00:35.550> game<00:00:35.700> from<00:00:36.180> creating<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.570> models<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
the game from creating the models to the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.200 
the game from creating the models to the
arena's<00:00:37.530> manually<00:00:38.340> animating<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.790> moves<00:00:38.969> and

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
arena's manually animating the moves and

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
so much more there's a ton of work that

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.889 
so much more there's a ton of work that
goes<00:00:41.160> into<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.910> was<00:00:42.000> all<00:00:42.120> really<00:00:42.600> cool

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.319 
goes into it and it was all really cool

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
gameplay in this video I'm gonna be

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.139

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.139 
challenge mode which features set
objectives<00:00:50.070> for<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.399> completing<00:00:50.789> matches

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
objectives for you completing matches

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.729 
objectives for you completing matches
similar<00:00:51.899> way<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.199> would<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.530> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
similar way that you would in the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.160 
similar way that you would in the
objectives<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.399> WWE's<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.329> case<00:00:54.539> your<00:00:54.780> case<00:00:54.930> I

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
objectives in WWE's to case your case I

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.319 
objectives in WWE's to case your case I
think<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.800> total<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.280> around<00:00:56.370> 40<00:00:56.969> hours<00:00:57.210> worth

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
think in total is around 40 hours worth

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.580 
think in total is around 40 hours worth
of<00:00:57.510> challenges<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.289> if<00:00:58.440> you're<00:00:58.559> a

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
of challenges so if you're a

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.590 
of challenges so if you're a
completionist<00:00:59.039> it's<00:00:59.670> going<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.910> take<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> long

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
completionist it's going to take a long

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.119 
completionist it's going to take a long
while<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.840> get<00:01:01.140> through<00:01:01.320> them<00:01:01.469> all<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:01.949> is

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
while to get through them all this is

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.560 
while to get through them all this is

in format WCW superstars so you can see

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.660 
in format WCW superstars so you can see
there<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.470> first<00:01:37.680> objective<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.340> hit<00:01:38.640> a

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
there the first objective is hit a

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.910 
there the first objective is hit a
strong<00:01:39.060> rebound<00:01:39.450> end<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.049> nigh<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:40.890> a

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
strong rebound end is nigh so that is a

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.590 
strong rebound end is nigh so that is a
variation<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.759> f5<00:01:42.150> that's<00:01:42.420> what<00:01:42.509> we're

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
variation of the f5 that's what we're

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.389 
variation of the f5 that's what we're
gonna<00:01:42.689> go<00:01:42.869> for<00:01:43.110> now<00:01:43.290> it's<00:01:43.680> will<00:01:43.860> lift<00:01:44.070> them<00:01:44.189> on

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
gonna go for now it's will lift them on

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.999 
gonna go for now it's will lift them on
the<00:01:44.549> shoulders<00:01:44.939> from<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.720> rebound<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.890> it's

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
the shoulders from the rebound and it's

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.859 
the shoulders from the rebound and it's
just<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.369> crazy<00:01:47.670> version<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.210> an<00:01:48.299> f5<00:01:48.659> which

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
just a crazy version of an f5 which

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.359 
just a crazy version of an f5 which
would<00:01:49.020> take<00:01:49.229> them<00:01:49.409> down<00:01:49.619> there<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.250> that

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
would take them down there and that

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.859 
would take them down there and that
guess<00:01:50.579> where<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.820> first<00:01:51.149> objective<00:01:51.570> they're

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
guess where the first objective they're

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.039 
guess where the first objective they're
marked<00:01:52.369> now<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.430> second<00:01:54.060> one<00:01:54.240> it's<00:01:54.479> using<00:01:54.990> a

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
marked now the second one it's using a

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:55.760 
marked now the second one it's using a
legal<00:01:55.409> move

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
legal move

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.260 
legal move
so<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.219> will<00:01:56.340> have<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.520> perform<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:57.000> torrent

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
so it will have to perform a torrent

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.030 
so it will have to perform a torrent
first<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.689> then<00:01:57.930> go<00:01:58.170> for<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.950> way

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
first and then go for it and the way

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.560 
first and then go for it and the way
legal<00:01:59.399> moves<00:01:59.549> work<00:01:59.790> in<00:01:59.969> this<00:02:00.149> game<00:02:00.390> is

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
legal moves work in this game is

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.780 
legal moves work in this game is
slightly<00:02:00.960> different<00:02:01.469> because<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.549> can't

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
slightly different because you can't

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.609 
slightly different because you can't
actually<00:02:02.909> get<00:02:03.119> disqualified<00:02:03.390> for<00:02:03.990> them<00:02:04.110> but

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
actually get disqualified for them but

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.959 
actually get disqualified for them but
depending<00:02:05.280> on<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.430> character<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.850> you

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
depending on the character that you

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.760 
depending on the character that you
choose<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.630> may<00:02:06.840> take<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.110> couple<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.590> moves

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
choose and it may take a couple of moves

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.100 
choose and it may take a couple of moves
before<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.399> get<00:02:08.580> disqualified<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:09.810> we'll

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
before you get disqualified so we'll

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.360 
before you get disqualified so we'll
just<00:02:10.229> try<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.470> set<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:10.830> up<00:02:10.860> now<00:02:11.099> we'll<00:02:11.250> go

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
just try and set that up now we'll go

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.630 
just try and set that up now we'll go
for<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.610> taunt<00:02:11.849> this<00:02:12.690> iceberg<00:02:12.989> gets<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.440> his

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
for the taunt this iceberg gets to his

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.120 
for the taunt this iceberg gets to his
feet<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.900> this<00:02:15.140> is<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:15.440> legal<00:02:15.620> move<00:02:15.860> so<00:02:16.010> we'll

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
feet and this is the legal move so we'll

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.130 
feet and this is the legal move so we'll
just<00:02:16.280> drop<00:02:16.700> a<00:02:16.760> nice<00:02:17.060> story<00:02:17.569> into<00:02:17.780> his<00:02:17.930> groin

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
just drop a nice story into his groin

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.809 
just drop a nice story into his groin
and<00:02:18.410> you<00:02:18.680> can<00:02:18.830> see<00:02:18.950> there<00:02:19.160> what<00:02:19.430> that's<00:02:19.610> done

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
and you can see there what that's done

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.790 
and you can see there what that's done
is<00:02:20.030> it's<00:02:20.060> actually<00:02:20.420> brought<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.260> referee<00:02:21.680> to

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
get I think it's three of those then you

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.790

what those actually do is if you've got

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.510 
what those actually do is if you've got
character<00:02:33.080> that's<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.440> heel<00:02:33.709> it<00:02:34.100> kind<00:02:34.400> of

is one of the secrets towards actually
getting<00:02:48.739> married<00:02:49.630> now<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.900> third<00:02:51.170> objective

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
getting married now the third objective

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.290 
getting married now the third objective
here<00:02:51.739> is<00:02:51.769> to<00:02:51.950> win<00:02:52.370> it<00:02:52.489> without<00:02:52.550> being<00:02:52.940> hit<00:02:53.120> with

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
here is to win it without being hit with

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.080 
here is to win it without being hit with
a<00:02:53.360> finisher<00:02:53.780> so<00:02:53.930> that<00:02:54.380> can<00:02:54.590> be<00:02:54.620> quite<00:02:55.010> hard<00:02:55.310> the

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
a finisher so that can be quite hard the

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.490 
a finisher so that can be quite hard the
eye<00:02:56.120> does<00:02:56.570> tend<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:56.900> go<00:02:57.019> off<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.200> finishers

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
eye does tend to go off the finishers

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.290 
eye does tend to go off the finishers
quite<00:02:57.769> often<00:02:57.950> in<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.370> difficult<00:02:59.150> they're

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
quite often in the difficult they're

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.210 
quite often in the difficult they're
kind<00:02:59.510> of<00:02:59.600> perverse<00:02:59.930> because<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.739> reversal

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
kind of perverse because the reversal

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.680 
kind of perverse because the reversal
system<00:03:01.550> in<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.880> game<00:03:02.030> there's<00:03:02.269> three

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
system in the game there's three

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.020 
system in the game there's three
different<00:03:02.870> ways<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.440> reverse<00:03:03.739> move<00:03:04.040> so<00:03:04.730> if<00:03:04.940> you

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
different ways to reverse move so if you

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.540 
different ways to reverse move so if you
go<00:03:05.150> for<00:03:05.330> a<00:03:05.390> strike<00:03:05.750> I<00:03:05.870> think<00:03:06.050> it's<00:03:06.170> l2<00:03:06.709> if<00:03:07.370> you

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
go for a strike I think it's l2 if you

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.699 
go for a strike I think it's l2 if you
go<00:03:07.640> a<00:03:07.670> reverse<00:03:08.000> a<00:03:08.150> grapple<00:03:08.660> then<00:03:08.840> it's<00:03:08.989> r2<00:03:09.260> and

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
go a reverse a grapple then it's r2 and

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.259 
go a reverse a grapple then it's r2 and
if<00:03:10.130> you<00:03:10.220> want<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.459> reverse<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.730> finish<00:03:11.150> of

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
if you want to reverse the finish of

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:12.040 
if you want to reverse the finish of
then<00:03:11.390> you<00:03:11.420> have<00:03:11.540> to<00:03:11.630> press<00:03:11.780> both<00:03:11.989> buttons

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
then you have to press both buttons

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.620 
then you have to press both buttons
together<00:03:12.739> so<00:03:13.610> not<00:03:14.030> only<00:03:14.090> is<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:14.330> a<00:03:14.420> case<00:03:14.600> of

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
together so not only is it a case of

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.150 
together so not only is it a case of
trying<00:03:14.989> to<00:03:15.050> time<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.350> move<00:03:15.650> properly<00:03:15.890> you

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
trying to time the move properly you

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.550 
trying to time the move properly you
have<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.370> try<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:16.730> guess<00:03:17.120> what<00:03:17.959> year<00:03:18.200> Cornyn's

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
have to try and guess what year Cornyn's

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.620 
have to try and guess what year Cornyn's
gonna<00:03:18.739> go<00:03:18.890> for<00:03:19.100> otherwise<00:03:19.850> if<00:03:20.150> they<00:03:20.269> go<00:03:20.360> for<00:03:20.570> a

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
gonna go for otherwise if they go for a

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:21.759 
gonna go for otherwise if they go for a
strike<00:03:20.870> and<00:03:20.900> you<00:03:21.140> press<00:03:21.320> the<00:03:21.470> reversed

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
strike and you press the reversed

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.110 
strike and you press the reversed
grapple<00:03:22.220> button<00:03:22.519> and<00:03:22.670> it's<00:03:22.790> not<00:03:22.910> gonna<00:03:23.030> work

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
grapple button and it's not gonna work

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.120 
grapple button and it's not gonna work
and<00:03:23.450> it's<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.019> same<00:03:24.170> for<00:03:24.200> finish<00:03:24.860> off<00:03:25.010> you

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
and it's the same for finish off you

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.710 
and it's the same for finish off you
press<00:03:25.340> one<00:03:25.610> button<00:03:25.640> it's<00:03:26.090> not<00:03:26.269> gonna<00:03:26.420> do<00:03:26.600> it

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
press one button it's not gonna do it

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.090 
press one button it's not gonna do it
unless<00:03:26.840> you<00:03:27.049> press<00:03:27.170> bought<00:03:27.470> them<00:03:27.680> at<00:03:27.829> the<00:03:27.890> same

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
unless you press bought them at the same

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.310 
unless you press bought them at the same
time<00:03:28.180> so<00:03:29.180> that<00:03:29.450> is<00:03:29.570> something<00:03:29.780> that<00:03:29.989> I<00:03:30.049> kind<00:03:30.260> of

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
time so that is something that I kind of

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.930 
time so that is something that I kind of
struggle<00:03:30.680> with<00:03:30.860> I<00:03:31.070> think<00:03:31.430> one<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:31.640> earliest

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
struggle with I think one the earliest

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.430 
struggle with I think one the earliest
Smackdown<00:03:32.360> games<00:03:32.570> you<00:03:32.720> used<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:33.049> use<00:03:33.200> that

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
Smackdown games you used to use that

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.400 
Smackdown games you used to use that
system<00:03:33.880> so<00:03:34.880> I<00:03:35.180> think<00:03:35.510> y'all<00:03:35.810> kind<00:03:36.049> of<00:03:36.140> got<00:03:36.230> used

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
system so I think y'all kind of got used

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.140 
system so I think y'all kind of got used
to<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.620> a<00:03:36.650> lot<00:03:36.860> quicker<00:03:37.070> than<00:03:37.130> I<00:03:37.310> did<00:03:37.519> I'm<00:03:37.880> so

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
to that a lot quicker than I did I'm so

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.810 
to that a lot quicker than I did I'm so
used<00:03:38.269> to<00:03:38.360> using<00:03:38.510> one<00:03:38.900> reversal<00:03:39.260> button<00:03:39.820> so

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
used to using one reversal button so

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.150 
used to using one reversal button so
that<00:03:41.180> will<00:03:41.420> take<00:03:41.630> some<00:03:41.900> getting<00:03:42.140> used<00:03:42.170> to<00:03:42.350> as

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
that will take some getting used to as

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.890 
that will take some getting used to as
for<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.459> game<00:03:43.579> player<00:03:43.790> I<00:03:43.970> really<00:03:44.420> enjoyed<00:03:44.720> it

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
for the game player I really enjoyed it

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.120 
for the game player I really enjoyed it
I<00:03:44.989> kind<00:03:45.260> of<00:03:45.290> went<00:03:45.410> in<00:03:45.590> it<00:03:45.680> with<00:03:45.799> thinking<00:03:46.040> it

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
I kind of went in it with thinking it

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.400 
I kind of went in it with thinking it
would<00:03:46.220> just<00:03:46.519> be<00:03:46.670> nightly<00:03:46.970> in<00:03:47.030> 64<00:03:47.570> games<00:03:47.780> so<00:03:48.290> on

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
would just be nightly in 64 games so on

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.170 
would just be nightly in 64 games so on
the<00:03:48.500> likes<00:03:48.650> of<00:03:48.769> Wrestlemania<00:03:49.340> 2000<00:03:50.000> and

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
normalcy but really it's kind of a

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.289 
normalcy but really it's kind of a
mixture<00:03:52.160> of<00:03:52.370> those<00:03:52.549> games<00:03:52.910> in<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.239> early

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299
