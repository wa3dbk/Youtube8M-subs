the<00:00:00.630> other<00:00:00.750> ones<00:00:00.960> we've<00:00:01.140> tailored<00:00:01.380> so<00:00:01.770> we're

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
the other ones we've tailored so we're

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.980 
the other ones we've tailored so we're
they're<00:00:02.070> very<00:00:02.280> very<00:00:02.490> easy<00:00:02.639> to<00:00:02.879> aerobrake<00:00:03.240> so

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
they're very very easy to aerobrake so

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.570 
they're very very easy to aerobrake so
and<00:00:04.500> that<00:00:04.620> didn't<00:00:04.920> have<00:00:05.040> anything<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.370> do<00:00:05.549> with

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
and that didn't have anything to do with

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.950 
and that didn't have anything to do with
the<00:00:05.790> weight<00:00:05.940> issue<00:00:06.089> then<00:00:06.390> no<00:00:06.540> it's<00:00:06.720> just<00:00:06.779> no<00:00:06.930> I

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
the weight issue then no it's just no I

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.009 
the weight issue then no it's just no I

candid<00:00:22.740> back<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.949> little<00:00:23.220> bit<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.519> get<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.670> little

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
candid back a little bit to get a little

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.960 
candid back a little bit to get a little
more<00:00:23.939> moment<00:00:24.330> arm<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.699> there<00:00:26.699> are<00:00:26.849> those

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
more moment arm and so there are those

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.029 
more moment arm and so there are those
the<00:00:27.029> actuators<00:00:27.779> are<00:00:27.900> different<00:00:28.230> but<00:00:28.740> gears

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
the actuators are different but gears

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.089 
the actuators are different but gears
can<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.400> forward<00:00:29.820> we<00:00:30.060> went<00:00:30.300> from<00:00:30.890> two<00:00:31.890> nose

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
can it forward we went from two nose

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.010 
can it forward we went from two nose
gear<00:00:32.369> one<00:00:32.820> most-viewed<00:00:33.149> or<00:00:33.329> two<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.630> smaller

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
gear one most-viewed or two to smaller

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.440 
gear one most-viewed or two to smaller
ones<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:35.010> effect<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.430> really<00:00:35.579> profound<00:00:35.969> this

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
ones the effect is really profound this

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.180 
ones the effect is really profound this
one<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:37.170> one's<00:00:37.410> kind<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.710> like<00:00:37.890> always

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
one this one's kind of like always

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.250 
one this one's kind of like always
taking<00:00:38.489> off<00:00:38.760> with<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.000> 15-9<00:00:39.390> left<00:00:39.750> across<00:00:39.930> one

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
taking off with a 15-9 left across one

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.500 
taking off with a 15-9 left across one
and<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.250> when<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.489> land<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.850> 15<00:00:42.180> not<00:00:42.329> right

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
and so when you land in a 15 not right

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.910 
and so when you land in a 15 not right
cross<00:00:42.780> one<00:00:42.989> two<00:00:43.020> contracts<00:00:43.680> straight<00:00:44.629> so<00:00:45.920> but

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
cross one two contracts straight so but

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.240 
cross one two contracts straight so but
all<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.399> those<00:00:47.489> things<00:00:47.760> improve<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:49.100> seat<00:00:50.100> all

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
all of those things improve the seat all

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.549 
all of those things improve the seat all
airplanes<00:00:50.550> we<00:00:51.390> change<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.840> fuel<00:00:52.079> system<00:00:52.289> that

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
airplanes we change the fuel system that

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.560 
airplanes we change the fuel system that
costs<00:00:52.949> us<00:00:52.980> some<00:00:53.190> weight<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:54.030> what<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.329> did<00:00:54.510> was

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
costs us some weight but what it did was

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.270 
costs us some weight but what it did was
it<00:00:54.780> give<00:00:54.989> us<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.170> high<00:00:55.320> angle<00:00:55.440> attack<00:00:55.800> range<00:00:56.039> for

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
it give us a high angle attack range for

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.619 
it give us a high angle attack range for
seats<00:00:56.489> all<00:00:56.610> our<00:00:56.730> plane<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.239> basically

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
seats all our plane this is basically

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.880 
seats all our plane this is basically
for<00:00:57.750> start-up<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.320> shut<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:59.180> and<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.890> what

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
for start-up to shut it and so what

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.830 
for start-up to shut it and so what
happens<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.699> CG<00:01:02.969> control<00:01:03.329> requirements

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
happens is the CG control requirements

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.789 
happens is the CG control requirements
for<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> three<00:01:04.170> airplanes<00:01:04.530> are<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> bit

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
for the three airplanes are a bit

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.000 
for the three airplanes are a bit
different<00:01:05.119> seats<00:01:06.119> all<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.390> very<00:01:06.570> conventional

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
different seats all is very conventional

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.230 
different seats all is very conventional
Stovall<00:01:08.010> when<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.520> get<00:01:08.670> into<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.000> need

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
Stovall when you get into that need

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.390 
Stovall when you get into that need
control<00:01:09.600> CG<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> little<00:01:10.170> different<00:01:10.500> because<00:01:11.250> in

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
control CG a little different because in

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.950 
control CG a little different because in
the<00:01:11.460> Stovall<00:01:11.820> mode<00:01:11.970> if<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.210> have<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.420> CG<00:01:12.720> very

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
the Stovall mode if you have the CG very

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.810 
the Stovall mode if you have the CG very
far<00:01:13.140> forward<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.710> just<00:01:13.860> very<00:01:14.220> nice<00:01:14.430> for<00:01:14.790> a

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
far forward is just very nice for a

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.240 
far forward is just very nice for a
pitching<00:01:15.509> moment<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.869> kind<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.110> thing<00:01:16.259> what

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
pitching moment to kind of thing what

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.859 
pitching moment to kind of thing what
happens<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.970> nose<00:01:18.119> wants<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.509> pitch<00:01:18.659> down

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
happens is the nose wants to pitch down

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.539 
happens is the nose wants to pitch down
because<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.380> CGS<00:01:19.770> forward<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.130> have<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.369> lift

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
because the CGS forward you have to lift

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.240 
because the CGS forward you have to lift
that<00:01:20.729> up<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.720> any<00:01:22.259> extra<00:01:22.650> lift<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.979> have<00:01:23.189> to

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
that up so any extra lift you have to

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.490 
that up so any extra lift you have to
lift<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.580> up<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.970> be<00:01:24.090> level<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.600> so

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
lift that up just to be level and so

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.539 
lift that up just to be level and so
that's<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.799> amount<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.070> thrust<00:01:26.280> you

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
that's the amount of thrust you

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.780 
that's the amount of thrust you
basically<00:01:26.909> lose

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
basically lose

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.070 
basically lose
and<00:01:27.910> so<00:01:28.000> this<00:01:28.090> thing<00:01:28.150> called<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:28.630> tint<00:01:28.870> curve

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
and so this thing called the tint curve

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.320 
and so this thing called the tint curve
which<00:01:29.260> shows<00:01:29.290> how<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.880> available<00:01:30.880> thrust<00:01:31.150> to

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
which shows how the available thrust to

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.140 
which shows how the available thrust to
you<00:01:31.450> for<00:01:31.630> vertical<00:01:31.870> lift<00:01:32.200> goes<00:01:32.920> off<00:01:33.190> so<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.820> CG

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
you for vertical lift goes off so the CG

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.250 
you for vertical lift goes off so the CG
requirements<00:01:34.660> are<00:01:34.720> a<00:01:34.750> bit<00:01:34.870> different<00:01:35.050> we

started<00:01:35.620> out<00:01:35.710> with<00:01:35.800> this<00:01:35.920> airplane<00:01:36.160> fuel<00:01:36.760> feed

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060

went<00:01:39.730> into<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:40.000> SWAT<00:01:40.570> effort<00:01:40.930> and<00:01:41.560> they

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
went into the SWAT effort and they

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.740 
went into the SWAT effort and they
become<00:01:42.010> more<00:01:42.190> optimized<00:01:42.730> on<00:01:43.330> this<00:01:43.540> airplane

there's a lot of smart things that went

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.150 
there's a lot of smart things that went

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
on then some of the things actually

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.500 
on then some of the things actually
added<00:02:06.580> weight<00:02:06.760> some<00:02:06.970> of<00:02:07.030> them<00:02:07.150> take<00:02:07.300> it<00:02:07.390> off

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
added weight some of them take it off

added weight some of them take it off
most<00:02:07.870> of<00:02:08.050> the<00:02:08.140> weight<00:02:08.320> was<00:02:08.950> captured<00:02:09.729> by

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
most of the weight was captured by

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.130 
most of the weight was captured by
refining<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.270> internal<00:02:13.630> structure<00:02:13.990> of<00:02:14.020> the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
the airplane was Stovall was supposed to

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.660 
the airplane was Stovall was supposed to
carry<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.400> thousand<00:02:21.820> that<00:02:21.970> way<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:23.670> somebody

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
carry a thousand that way so somebody

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.160 
carry a thousand that way so somebody
somewhere<00:02:25.030> along<00:02:25.209> the<00:02:25.360> line<00:02:25.480> says<00:02:25.750> hey<00:02:25.900> could

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
somewhere along the line says hey could

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.810 
somewhere along the line says hey could
you<00:02:26.260> guys<00:02:26.440> like<00:02:26.770> carry<00:02:27.130> two<00:02:27.280> thousand<00:02:27.670> pound

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
you guys like carry two thousand pound

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.280 
you guys like carry two thousand pound
weapons<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.330> somebody<00:02:28.630> was<00:02:28.810> dumb<00:02:29.020> enough<00:02:29.050> to

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
weapons and somebody was dumb enough to

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.100 
weapons and somebody was dumb enough to
say<00:02:29.440> why<00:02:29.650> sure<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.850> so<00:02:31.510> they<00:02:31.660> did<00:02:31.840> it<00:02:31.959> and

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
say why sure and so they did it and

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.800 
say why sure and so they did it and
unfortunately<00:02:32.290> what<00:02:32.830> happened<00:02:33.250> was<00:02:33.690> when<00:02:34.690> you

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
unfortunately what happened was when you

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.600 
unfortunately what happened was when you
look<00:02:34.989> at<00:02:35.110> that<00:02:35.200> all<00:02:35.260> of<00:02:35.500> stovall<00:02:35.860> ducting<00:02:36.280> for

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
look at that all of stovall ducting for

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.729 
look at that all of stovall ducting for
those<00:02:37.540> things<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:37.930> want<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.170> very<00:02:38.410> convoluted

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
those things you want a very convoluted

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.430 
those things you want a very convoluted
structure<00:02:39.550> and<00:02:40.480> they<00:02:40.570> took<00:02:40.750> six<00:02:41.080> or<00:02:41.230> seven

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
structure and they took six or seven

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.810 
structure and they took six or seven
hundred<00:02:41.650> pounds<00:02:41.800> on<00:02:42.070> the<00:02:42.130> airplane<00:02:42.489> just<00:02:42.520> by

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
hundred pounds on the airplane just by

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.370 
hundred pounds on the airplane just by
shortening<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.600> bulkhead<00:02:43.900> back<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.290> the

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
shortening the bulkhead back to the

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.979 
shortening the bulkhead back to the
original<00:02:44.739> requirement<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:45.840> cleaning<00:02:46.840> up<00:02:46.959> the

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
original requirement and cleaning up the

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.150 
original requirement and cleaning up the
structure<00:02:47.440> she<00:02:47.560> had<00:02:47.650> straight<00:02:47.920> through

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
structure she had straight through

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.850 
structure she had straight through
structures<00:02:48.610> instead<00:02:48.940> of<00:02:49.030> u-turn<00:02:49.360> structures

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
structures instead of u-turn structures

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.630 
structures instead of u-turn structures
that's

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
that's

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.220 
that's
when<00:02:53.000> somebody<00:02:53.360> said<00:02:53.570> once<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:53.960> it's<00:02:54.050> very

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
when somebody said once and it's very

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.290 
when somebody said once and it's very
very<00:02:54.590> true<00:02:54.890> of<00:02:55.040> this<00:02:55.190> airplane

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
very true of this airplane

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.930 
very true of this airplane
many<00:02:56.990> are<00:02:57.170> playing<00:02:57.500> holes<00:02:57.920> are<00:02:58.160> really<00:02:58.460> heavy

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
many are playing holes are really heavy

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.730 
many are playing holes are really heavy
they<00:03:00.540> are<00:03:00.690> because<00:03:01.080> you<00:03:01.200> have<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.440> build<00:03:01.620> this

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
they are because you have to build this

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.200 
they are because you have to build this
whole<00:03:01.950> interval<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.550> structure<00:03:02.910> around<00:03:03.060> the

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
whole interval the structure around the

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.520 
whole interval the structure around the
source<00:03:03.390> of<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.570> building<00:03:03.810> once<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.260> sew

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
source of the building once you sew

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.200 
source of the building once you sew
holes<00:03:04.740> are<00:03:04.920> heavy<00:03:05.100> it's<00:03:05.790> an<00:03:05.970> interesting

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
holes are heavy it's an interesting

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.750 
holes are heavy it's an interesting
concept<00:03:06.840> but<00:03:07.590> so<00:03:08.250> there's<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.520> lot<00:03:08.670> of

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
concept but so there's a lot of

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.550 
concept but so there's a lot of
optimization<00:03:10.310> structure<00:03:12.110> but<00:03:13.110> there<00:03:13.440> was<00:03:13.530> a

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
optimization structure but there was a

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.820 
optimization structure but there was a
lot<00:03:13.770> of<00:03:13.800> traits<00:03:14.480> basically<00:03:15.480> when<00:03:16.230> we<00:03:16.380> did<00:03:16.590> that

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
lot of traits basically when we did that

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.330 
lot of traits basically when we did that
the<00:03:17.550> admonition<00:03:18.270> was<00:03:18.920> we<00:03:19.920> will<00:03:20.010> build<00:03:20.220> a

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
the admonition was we will build a

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.370 
the admonition was we will build a
better<00:03:20.490> airplane<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.720> we<00:03:21.810> did<00:03:22.020> there<00:03:22.290> was

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
better airplane and we did there was

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.020 
better airplane and we did there was
nothing<00:03:22.800> about<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:23.160> post<00:03:23.400> swat<00:03:23.640> airplane
