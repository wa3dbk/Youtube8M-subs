00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.320
Sebastian (R): "Hello." Stefan (L):"Morning." R:"What can i do for you?"

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.400
L: "I heard you have the GTX590 available since yesterday."

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.760
R:"That´s correct." L:"Do you have different versions available ?"

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.440
R:"Let me show you some, e.g. we received two cards from Point Of View."

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.560
L:"Cool. So with 2 GTX580 chips and 3GB of RAM, right?"

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.080
R:"Yes and they are pre-overclocked."

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.440
R:"Charged and Ultra-Charged." L:"So this one with some more."

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.880
L:"So i just need to figure out which configuration i want."

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.680
R:"To make your decision a bit harder." L:"That´s never good."

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.120
R:"Never, but here i have an alternative. The AMD 6990 with two GPUs."

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.680
R:"Also two different cards, one from Sapphire and one from XFX."

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.200
L:"They have one more gigabyte RAM, right?"

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.120
R:"Yes 4GB, instead of 3GB." L:"But standard clock."

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.160
L:"I really wanted something pre-overclocked."

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:22.160
R:"Also available here, you got a little overlocking switch which let´s you choose."

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.080
L:"Not that bad either. Also with full guarantee, right?"

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.400
R:"Yes, but only in standard mode. If you overclock then it´s gone."

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:46.440
R:"So all the cards have two GPUs, the 
 6990 has the 6970 chip as basis."

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:56.200
R:"When overclocked they have the normal 6970 clock, else a reduced clock."

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.960
L:"But what is the length of these cards. I 
 know this one is 28 cm long."

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:10.200
R:"The 6990 needs 30,5 cm. In a big case it shouldn´t be a problem."

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.720
L:"Got a big case from you, so easy." R:"Cool."

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.520
L:"So both will fit, but i tend more to the GTX590."

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:26.240
R:"Both cards are very interesting. You don´t make a mista...

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.240
L:"That´s cool, you have a YouTube channel ? Didn´t know that."

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.760
R:"Have a look, nice channel." L:"You do interviews there or ..?"

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.720
R:"Product presentations and information. Also to these cards. Try it."

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.240
L:"I take that and have a look. You never know."

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.960
R:"Do i know you from somewhere? You look familiar."

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.200
L: "I don´t think so, but theres some guy on YouTube doing strange vids."

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.320
L:"Sometimes i am mistaken with him. Oh dear."

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.840
R:"Ah some kind of double. What a pity."

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.520
L:"I think i take em all. Have my generous day, you know ?"

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.920
R:"I make em ready."

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.560
L:"One for mum, one for dad, one for me and one for my brother."

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.720
L:"Go for it buddy."
