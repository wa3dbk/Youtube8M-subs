Verizon better speed but around like

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.510 
Verizon better speed but around like
around<00:02:09.410> where<00:02:09.890> I<00:02:09.920> work<00:02:10.369> I<00:02:10.700> do<00:02:10.820> get<00:02:11.300> like<00:02:12.520> 2mp

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
around where I work I do get like 2mp

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.240 
around where I work I do get like 2mp

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
like 2,000 KB and stuff so that's good

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.870 
like 2,000 KB and stuff so that's good
but<00:02:16.900> Verizon<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:18.050> I<00:02:18.080> speed<00:02:18.500> my<00:02:19.400> personal

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
but Verizon that I speed my personal

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.880 
but Verizon that I speed my personal
opinion<00:02:20.240> Verizon<00:02:20.690> better<00:02:20.870> speed<00:02:21.200> is<00:02:21.440> faster

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
opinion Verizon better speed is faster

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.980 
opinion Verizon better speed is faster
than<00:02:22.010> boost<00:02:22.420> especially<00:02:23.420> then<00:02:23.570> sprint

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
than boost especially then sprint

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.990 
than boost especially then sprint
because<00:02:24.080> I<00:02:24.230> did<00:02:24.620> use<00:02:25.220> boost<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.910> sprint<00:02:26.330> so

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
because I did use boost and sprint so

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.780 
because I did use boost and sprint so
they<00:02:29.000> use<00:02:29.150> same<00:02:29.480> tower<00:02:29.810> boost<00:02:30.520> sprain

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
they use same tower boost sprain

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.210 
they use same tower boost sprain
