anyway or he wouldn't lose much money so

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.330 
anyway or he wouldn't lose much money so
he<00:00:19.980> had<00:00:20.600> 11<00:00:21.600> trillion<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.500> residential

there has not been that to that extent

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.770 
there has not been that to that extent
is<00:02:12.459> not<00:02:12.640> enough<00:02:12.850> of<00:02:12.970> a<00:02:13.060> united<00:02:13.450> front<00:02:13.569> right

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
yeah I think and I can understand why

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.420

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
double whammy so we've had this great

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.210 
double whammy so we've had this great
economic<00:04:10.150> machine<00:04:10.799> like<00:04:11.799> nothing<00:04:12.130> the

economic machine like nothing the

world's ever seen and it's started
sputtering<00:04:14.859> a<00:04:15.160> little<00:04:15.400> and<00:04:15.640> we<00:04:16.510> said<00:04:16.690> well

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
sputtering a little and we said well

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.650 
sputtering a little and we said well
maybe<00:04:16.959> we<00:04:17.169> better<00:04:17.470> slow<00:04:17.769> it<00:04:18.010> down<00:04:18.269> and<00:04:19.269> see

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
maybe we better slow it down and see

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.449 
maybe we better slow it down and see
what<00:04:19.810> happens<00:04:20.140> and<00:04:20.229> it<00:04:20.530> sputters<00:04:20.919> more<00:04:21.190> and

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
what happens and it sputters more and

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.850 
what happens and it sputters more and
and<00:04:21.909> what<00:04:22.479> we<00:04:22.599> may<00:04:22.720> not<00:04:22.900> realize<00:04:23.320> is<00:04:23.590> there's

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
and what we may not realize is there's

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.469 
and what we may not realize is there's
an<00:04:24.010> interaction<00:04:24.340> that<00:04:24.789> the<00:04:24.940> slower<00:04:25.210> you<00:04:25.300> run

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
an interaction that the slower you run

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:25.620 
an interaction that the slower you run
the

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
the

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.750

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
machine have the port sputters so it's

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.000

it's a job to get it working again and

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.570 
it's a job to get it working again and
it<00:04:30.310> won't<00:04:30.490> happen<00:04:30.670> fast<00:04:31.090> Becky<00:04:31.600> I<00:04:31.780> mean<00:04:31.960> it<00:04:32.580> an
