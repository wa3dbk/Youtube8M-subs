00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.900
 my match on seeing them 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.710
 there everything is fine 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.840
 on the grounds 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.900
 that they try to force some good 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.260
 it 's still our first 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.260

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.800
 while still anchored this is so I 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.180
 look at the total benefit 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.840
 you 're always winning but if I look 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.840
 passion takes paths 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.880
 here I think we showed anyway 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.090
 we are able 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.159
 navigate too much respected 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.909

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.670

 play with his leopards it's good 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.600
 mentally or it's a decision 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:53.799
 final that you took to integrate 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.799
 the leopards I am very well in 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.719
 this team to be summoned 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.790
 I'm very proud of why because the 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.790
 moment the match started 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.790
 e 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.930
 the song of the country 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:17.019
 I had not arranged it because I 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.019
 came from far away 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.580
 people do not know the place so 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.000
 I come that I come from very very good 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.620
 young people to progress my club and I know 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.010
 that it was his dream of plans to see me 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.269
 until scenically 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.269
 I was singing 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.190
 I'm going to smash you mosson 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.730
 I am very proud to have been to 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.730
 parliament 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.950
 ok our condolences for the loss of 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:56.280
 daddy it's hard but god is in control 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.960
 tours ok thank you first to integrate 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.580
 the wolf not now I would also like 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.120
 to know how was this 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.640
 first 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.430
 by the way this first week of internship 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.850
 are you happy where you may have 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.350
 some few ideas about 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.240
 leopards what does not she have 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.180
 do it again to be better at the level 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.960
 we are the Congolese community 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:23.970
 population wants to see from our parts 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:26.720
 first I think two 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.630
 I want to know that 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.910
 the team informed the team that appeared 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.819
 from 13 years 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.560
 1 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.749
 I personally play in Europe 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.900
 online I saw a lot of players 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:40.999
 young people have a lot to be 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.489
 now this team will play when 

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:45.489
 even to play with more quality game 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:52.130
 selecting 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:54.650
 really make the difference but 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.890
 I knew I saw that the group has 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.690
 not motivate everyone 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.450
 two months get along well it's not 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.890
 that she has never eased at first this goal one 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.420
 can all go ahead we do not 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.750
 do not build your feet you are all his 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.750
 qualities 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.890
 what is it? 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.560
 here I think 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.780
 we will continue 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.370
 land training focus on our 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.020
 lives 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.040
 know how one or the other plays and 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.889
 I realize that 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.870
 okay okay 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.270
 but what is 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.580
 and the Congolese usually glk 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.180
 omelet call ronaldinho the ronaldinho 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:43.230
 powell how all you get this and 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.230
 how do you explain that 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.260
 when I was young draw 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:53.830
 ronaldinho every football player is 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:57.390
 impressed with his players and even 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.460
 less mediocre 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.599
 and when I hear stuff like that 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.039
 that's why 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:04.550
 is honor and it motivates me the 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.430
 help 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.110
 it rubs that same motive more for 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.860
 proof his position was well how 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.110
 are you thinking 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.300
 that's what everyone deserves for 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.349
 convalescents 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.349
 it is appropriate but quickly it 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:22.959
 obviously two very strong players because 

00:05:21.429 --> 00:05:24.639
 as soon as there are a lot of people who 

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:26.900
 went 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:30.040
 it's a man a point 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.600
 I do it we are 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.780
 I want to do everything I can to avoid 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.780
 to separate 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:42.110
 and the 2018 World Cup 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:45.229
 that's how religions you 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.819
 consider that you prepare for 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:52.020
 that she does not participate in the cup of 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:55.050
 world 2018 or of course 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:58.069
 a professional player is to 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:01.650
 ambitions and are you not putting limits 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:04.830
 there are a lot of people who is who who 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:07.440
 do not think the body got there 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:10.379
 when I said my ultimate team welded 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.070
 we all envied is qualified for the 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:16.020
 world cup and 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:20.570
 what I say I really trust 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.570
 only to be present 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:27.800
 and your contract in rotterdam beaujoire 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.539
 rotterdam is not it that ends 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.270
 next year 2016 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:34.310
 you have already targeted another river where 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:38.199
 you are already already offered 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.199
 clubs or how 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:44.139
 it's like you say my contract 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.139
 settles 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.599
 this season this morning 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:55.070
 in the round to cogitate 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:00.800
 I can myself in May 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:02.370
 go in a team up +3 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.139
 where the rabid wind 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.840
 the story the hand 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:09.210
 the agent because the season for me is 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.400
 still really 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.789
 I have too many things that convince 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.789
 season 

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:22.289
 this season in the end I become game 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:24.470
 and for a moment there I do everything I 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:26.110
