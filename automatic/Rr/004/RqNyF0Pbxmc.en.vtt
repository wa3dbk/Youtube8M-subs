two<00:02:06.149> free<00:02:06.360> negations<00:02:06.869> hey<00:02:07.560> guys<00:02:07.770> it's<00:02:08.160> a

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
two free negations hey guys it's a

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.300 
two free negations hey guys it's a
teacher<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.119> exclusive<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:10.560> negations<00:02:11.099> is

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
teacher to exclusive to negations is

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.160 
teacher to exclusive to negations is
pretty<00:02:11.849> cool<00:02:12.060> because<00:02:12.209> Konami<00:02:12.660> was<00:02:12.870> nice<00:02:13.020> to

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170

so<00:02:14.880> dholka<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.770> answer<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.250> plant<00:02:17.640> synchro

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
so dholka is the answer to plant synchro

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.560 
so dholka is the answer to plant synchro
