00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:07.860
 Lyrics: DADULLA Composer: DADULLA Arranger: DADULLA 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.760
 Translation: Waterwheel Pony: IA, Wolf Sound 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:23.800
 Secret のののそのに

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.580
 The afternoon when the sun shines from the leaves 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.180
 Deep in the forest outside the village 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.500
 A little curious, I want to pick up the mystery of the forest. 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.740
 Let me be a little, satisfying curiosity 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.180
 Adventures deep into the forest 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.740
 Come, let's go. 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.080
 Memories hundreds of years ago 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.680
 Before the child dies 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.480
 I said to myself. 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.220
 Live until the day we will meet again 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.620
 When I meet for the first time, who are you? 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.760
 Overlapping the past 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.440
 Go back soon, you say so 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.360
 I am a cursed person. 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.620
 But you don’t feel like you’re giving up 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.340
 Every time I say this 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.260
 "You are yours." 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.020
 Such fate so far 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.620
 Repeatedly 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.240
 Already faded feelings 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.200
 Now I have the color that belongs to you. 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.620
 It’s good to be able to do this all the time. 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.100
 Because you laugh and laugh 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.960
 Just a little bit 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.120
 Like the way the heart is suddenly stabbed 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.520
 One day I noticed the recorded comedy 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.820
 Ugly monsters seem to be bad guys 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.160
 Complaining in the mirror 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.680
 "It is clear that the world has abandoned us." 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.020
 The feelings that are overflowing are accepting all the unreasonable things. 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.760
 So when you shout 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.440
 "This is not the place where you should stay" 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.800
 Say, "You don't know what you hate most...!" 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.140
 I was sobbing while running out the door. 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.040
 Hey, what should I do? 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.040
 If there is really a god 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.500
 Please, please help us. 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.320
 I really pray when the night falls. 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.860
 It’s just comforting. 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.080
 This kind of thing is very clear. 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.120
 Misplaced fate 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.820
 Suddenly awakened 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.400
 The tears filled with biting emotions drenched the cheeks 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.800
 Maybe one day, body and mind 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.340
 Will become beasts 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.320
 Say goodbye to the world 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.620
 And the memory in your heart 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.960
 Forgot the pain that penetrated my heart 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.540
 The return of the child who ran out 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.460
 As if someone is whispering 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.700
 Let's deal with that guy. 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.260
 Honestly face the mood of attention 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.580
 Called your name while opening the door 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.600
 why…? 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.020
 Illuminate your words in the moonlight 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.760
 Can't stop the overflowing tears 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:48.840
 I like you very much, but I am, but it is such a presence... 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.120
 Thank you 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.600
 Take care 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.380
 I can laugh with you. 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.080
 Such a dreamlike story 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.000
 But say something like you. 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.620
 Is it so dirty? 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.120
 If you can, in the next world 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.760
 Let us meet again. 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.840
 Make the last wish on earth 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.280
 Closed his eyes 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.900
 now 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.320
 Silhouettes overlapping 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.260
 Such a fate, A morning light, cut through the night 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.960
 Unlocked the curse of tragedy and closed his eyes slightly 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.400
 The moment the color is seen in front of the scene 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.600
 Now I finally understand 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.620
 you 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.940
 Inner thoughts 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.440
