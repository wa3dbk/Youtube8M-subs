00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.250
 when we first heard about the most 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.560
 affordable crossover 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.510
 Renault Duster then thought that the French 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.790
 just slightly raised logan over 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.009
 the land provided him with all-wheel drive on 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.410
 which you can go no further broken 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.720
 primer and even thought was spinning in my head 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.210
 that cheap cannot be good 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.279
 it's like making an operation on 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.590
 heart transplant at home 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.830
 spending only bandages and brilliant green 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.119
 However, as it turned out, we were wrong and 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.579
 about everything in order 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.070
 There is a car that is associated 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.430
 with certain people for example mini 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.050
 very reminiscent of Mr. Bina Reno 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.800
 Duster turn especially the front 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.130
 his part 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.680
 very similar to 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.190
 head of the russian federation vladimir 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.190
 Putin's 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.890
 he as if says i will give you a brief 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.040
 four-wheel drive each to the same this 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.020
 the car is going to Russia since 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.400
 the task is to ensure everyone and 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.590
 each four-wheel drive 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.540
 it means that the duster must be 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.340
 affordable so as not to spend 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.920
 money to develop new parts 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.080
 70 percent of car components 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.630
 borrowed from existing models 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.790
 for example the interior is almost entirely taken from 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.130
 so same logan so you should not expect 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.200
 here are exquisite design solutions 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.090
 soft plastic and impressive list 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.140
 options 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.170
 no climate control in the top version 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.190
 only air conditioner ok stove control 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.770
 need to get used 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.530
 otherwise it's hard to understand what mode we are. 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.990
 chose an unusual for us it was like 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.240
 beep is off center 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.090
 steering as usual by c 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.460
 there is a pair of steering column switch 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.710
 signs of saving in principle behind the wheel 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.630
 Duster can get pretty comfortable 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.700
 but before finding the optimal 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.140
 position you need to play a little with 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.770
 regulations because the steering wheel 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:55.020
 adjusted only by the angle of inclination 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:58.060
 no adjustment of the flight and the seat 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.630
 did you find the height adjustment 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.520
 but there is one nuance is permissible to 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.530
 lower the seat is nothing special 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.250
 you just need to press the foot and she 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.400
 she goes down but to raise 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.190
 need a little effort to take the wheel and 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.760
 pull up only then you can lift 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.459
 the seats 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.350
 as for landing rear passengers 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.870
 that place is quite enough here 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.940
 the head does not rest on the ceiling with your knees 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.130
 ears do not close and more from 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.670
 budget crossover and no one requires 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.470
 the same can be said about the trunk 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.720
 all-wheel drive versions equal 400 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.970
 ohm eight liters curtain folds and 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.610
 decomposed completely by hand that 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.890
 certainly not very comfortable but under the floor 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.560
 trunk items are present lordly 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.580
 life for budget class 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.900
 full reserve and small 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.900
 soft material organizer 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.110
 and now tell you about what Duster us 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.239
 really surprised before the test 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.890
 we were pretty skeptical of him 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.110
 off-road ability 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.690
 because the crossover was not originally created 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.910
 for serious off-road but french to everyone 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.640
 his appearance made it clear that his wound 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.530
 recorded in the category of laggards and in the very 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.780
 In fact, he has short overhangs 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.120
 ground clearance 210 millimeters 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.670
 long-stroke suspension nissan ovsky 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.120
 wheel drive with the ability to lock 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.280
 axle couplings 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.950
 to check out this whole arsenal in 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.430
 action we are at the earliest opportunity 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.430
 turned off the road 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.080
 crashed on sand Duster tracks 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.910
 no problem overcame pool meter ford 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.760
 then on the waited stretch of road with pretty 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.220
 deep and viscous sand from the first time 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.080
 it was not possible to pass this segment because 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.290
 engine speed was on the mark 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.840
 three-four thousand and 135 horsepower 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.330
 two-liter engine was not easy 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.130
 fight the sticky soil under the wheels but 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.860
 then we took more overclocking 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.200
 engine speed drove higher and without 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.150
 problems overcame deep sand further 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.250
 there were obstacles more intended 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.940
 for real SUVs than for 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.550
 crossover 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.560
 however, before the curtains and confidently coped with 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.440
 steep climbs and water barriers 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.110
 and with other heavy sections of the strip 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.180
 obstacles and every time we thought 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.820
 that now something will definitely have to go for 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.070
 cable Frenchman tirelessly argued to us 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.490
 that his abilities are much greater than we 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.680
 thought 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.570
 no wonder that Renault Duster is created as 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.460
 minimum for off-road 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.840
 he has a time-tested full 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.600
 drive from nissan x-trail 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.360
 short overhangs and quite self 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.760
 impressive ground clearance in 21 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.980
 centimeter and i must say off asphalt he 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.140
 may allow much more than that 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.360
 it seems at first glance and to the commission 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:54.180
 even more than you yourself can 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.520
 it will allow it means that most likely 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.740
 you are unlikely to find the limit of the possible 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.870
 for this crossover due to the fact that 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.510
 morally not ready to give will give 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.610
 erp ordeal may outwardly he and 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.890
 not as corny as many modern 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.460
 crossovers can and interior of it 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.860
 plain 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.410
 can and frills less than in some 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.060
 minicar but duster more accessible 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.800
 most cars and off-road 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.960
 can give odds to many 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.689
 classmates it is this combination 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.379
 is the main 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:23.379
 we take the Frenchman
