maybe one of the neighbors knew about

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.660 
maybe one of the neighbors knew about
this<00:01:34.320> but<00:01:34.560> didn't<00:01:34.829> say<00:01:34.979> anything<00:01:35.520> because

this but didn't say anything because

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.020 
this but didn't say anything because
they<00:01:36.030> thought<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.570> would<00:01:36.659> be<00:01:36.780> awkward<00:01:40.880> I'm<00:01:41.880> not

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.750 
exactly but just a gas leak Chris all
right<00:03:35.079> on<00:03:36.079> the<00:03:36.260> scene<00:03:36.470> of<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.680> five-car<00:03:37.519> and

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
right on the scene of a five-car and

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.080 
right on the scene of a five-car and
after<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.090> dude<00:03:38.239> but<00:03:39.250> it's<00:03:40.250> also<00:03:40.400> knew<00:03:40.730> when

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
after the dude but it's also knew when

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.059 
after the dude but it's also knew when
maybe<00:03:41.299> maybe<00:03:42.109> he<00:03:42.260> really<00:03:42.530> likes<00:03:42.709> having<00:03:42.950> the

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
maybe maybe he really likes having the

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.619 
maybe maybe he really likes having the
gas<00:03:43.250> man<00:03:43.549> around<00:03:43.819> he<00:03:44.090> just<00:03:44.299> doesn't<00:03:44.510> know<00:03:44.569> how

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
gas man around he just doesn't know how

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:49.690 
gas man around he just doesn't know how
to<00:03:44.780> say<00:03:45.049> it<00:03:47.859> that's<00:03:48.859> all<00:03:49.069> for<00:03:49.310> the<00:03:49.400> ten<00:03:49.670> o'clock

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
to say it that's all for the ten o'clock

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.160 
to say it that's all for the ten o'clock
is<00:03:50.120> new<00:03:50.209> designs<00:03:50.599> it<00:03:50.980> may<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.370> gas<00:03:52.549> man<00:03:53.170> loves

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
is new designs it may the gas man loves

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.009 
is new designs it may the gas man loves
the<00:03:54.319> neighbor<00:03:54.639> and<00:03:55.639> I<00:03:55.939> think<00:03:56.209> that<00:03:56.359> scares<00:03:56.840> the

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
the neighbor and I think that scares the

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.750 
the neighbor and I think that scares the
gas<00:03:57.319> man<00:03:57.620> because<00:03:58.159> he's<00:03:58.310> had<00:03:58.489> his<00:03:58.579> heart

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
gas man because he's had his heart

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.990 
gas man because he's had his heart
broken<00:03:58.849> before<00:03:59.209> I<00:04:03.189> think<00:04:04.189> the<00:04:04.250> gas<00:04:04.459> man<00:04:04.760> should

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
broken before I think the gas man should

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.250 
broken before I think the gas man should
know<00:04:05.209> that<00:04:05.359> the<00:04:05.480> neighbor<00:04:05.659> would<00:04:05.750> never<00:04:06.049> do

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
know that the neighbor would never do

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.589 
know that the neighbor would never do
that<00:04:06.290> to<00:04:06.500> him<00:04:06.799> that<00:04:07.639> whatever<00:04:07.909> troubles<00:04:08.359> arise

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
that to him that whatever troubles arise

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:24.360 
that to him that whatever troubles arise
they<00:04:08.900> can<00:04:09.049> face<00:04:09.290> it

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.720 

I<00:04:25.390> want<00:04:26.390> you<00:04:26.540> inside
