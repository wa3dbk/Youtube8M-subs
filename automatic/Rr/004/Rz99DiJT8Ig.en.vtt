to<00:01:03.629> like<00:01:03.809> know<00:01:04.019> if<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.350> know<00:01:04.439> what<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.559> mean

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
to like know if you know what I mean

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.399 
to like know if you know what I mean
whereas<00:01:05.250> here<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:06.180> have<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.570> just<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.140> lot

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
whereas here you can have to just a lot

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.450 
whereas here you can have to just a lot
of<00:01:07.530> different<00:01:07.799> variations<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.549> stuff<00:01:08.760> we

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
of different variations and stuff we

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.240 
of different variations and stuff we
just<00:01:11.460> for<00:01:11.640> going<00:01:11.729> around<00:01:12.000> back<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.360> Ash<00:01:12.510> and

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
just for going around back on Ash and

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.380 
just for going around back on Ash and
Beatrice<00:01:14.250> obviously<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> lot<00:01:14.640> more<00:01:14.820> tunnel<00:01:15.270> I

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
Beatrice obviously a lot more tunnel I

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.630 
Beatrice obviously a lot more tunnel I
think<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:15.780> probably<00:01:16.229> easier<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.950> think<00:01:17.159> to

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
think it's probably easier I think to

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.370 
think it's probably easier I think to
get<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.000> know<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.210> stuff<00:01:18.509> by<00:01:18.780> doing<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> world

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
get to know the stuff by doing the world

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.929 
get to know the stuff by doing the world
tour<00:01:19.590> because<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:20.070> obviously<00:01:20.310> unlock<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
tour because you obviously unlock the

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.460 
tour because you obviously unlock the
skills<00:01:21.210> with<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.630> bit<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.049> can<00:01:22.140> kind<00:01:22.409> of

skills with a bit so you can kind of

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.039 
skills with a bit so you can kind of
learn<00:01:23.100> as<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.549> go<00:01:23.759> but<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.570> thing<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.930> have
