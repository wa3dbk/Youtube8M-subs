 bastia 12th hosts lorient 18th there is 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.180
 yet that two points of difference between 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.460
 these two formations 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.160
 a team of Lorient always decimated

 quercia but the return of jeremia 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.670
 aliadière will surely do good to 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:37.739
 time to move in Corsica a 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.420
 bastia team that has only one 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.210

 under his new colors 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.960
 a rookie who scores is always 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.920
 interesting for the rest of his match 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.079
 and besides that it puts him in confidence 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.120
 that she knocks on the bar

 penalty wahbi khazri suffered the fault 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.360
 he himself transformed the sentence into 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.910
 goal thanks to a 23rd minute panenka 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.869

 thundering match of Bastiais lorient a 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.819
 hard to wake up 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.009
 why not on this balloon with a 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:36.569
 attempt at the balloon's the player is 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.300

 with this deviation to milos krasic 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.979
 the Serbian passed and managed to score 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.510

 of the season outside it will do 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.850
 the fifth defeat away because 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.130
