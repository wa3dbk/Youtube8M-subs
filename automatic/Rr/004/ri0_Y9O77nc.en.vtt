surprise to some but to the rest of us I

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.569 
surprise to some but to the rest of us I
think<00:01:39.900> we<00:01:40.259> really<00:01:40.590> weren't<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.070> take<00:01:41.310> him<00:01:41.460> back

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
think we really weren't to take him back

think we really weren't to take him back
by<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:42.000> we<00:01:42.150> weren't<00:01:42.360> too<00:01:42.540> surprised<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.290> this

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
by this we weren't too surprised on this

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.700 
by this we weren't too surprised on this
being<00:01:44.369> because<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.850> all<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.360> 2013<00:01:46.259> Bethesda

being because of all of 2013 Bethesda

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.620 
being because of all of 2013 Bethesda

the<00:02:52.709> story<00:02:53.040> I<00:02:53.130> think<00:02:53.220> they<00:02:53.459> just<00:02:53.489> kind<00:02:53.790> of

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
the story I think they just kind of

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.160 
the story I think they just kind of
wanted<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.090> show<00:02:54.239> what<00:02:54.390> they<00:02:54.510> did<00:02:54.690> because<00:02:55.019> I

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
wanted to show what they did because I

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.630 
wanted to show what they did because I
had<00:02:55.290> environmental<00:02:55.950> scares<00:02:56.220> more<00:02:56.459> than

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
had environmental scares more than

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.430 
had environmental scares more than
actual<00:02:57.060> jump<00:02:57.329> scares<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:57.810> stuff<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.260> think

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
actual jump scares and stuff and I think

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.110 
actual jump scares and stuff and I think
that's<00:02:58.590> interesting<00:02:59.129> anyways<00:02:59.849> going

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
the vgas and that's all I can really

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.960 
the vgas and that's all I can really
remember<00:04:34.230> because<00:04:34.770> I<00:04:34.800> wasn't<00:04:35.130> as<00:04:35.430> huge<00:04:35.760> of<00:04:35.910> a

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
announced anyways point being is that I

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.680 
announced anyways point being is that I
think<00:04:40.860> III<00:04:41.490> would<00:04:41.670> be<00:04:41.790> a<00:04:41.820> key<00:04:42.090> area<00:04:42.330> even

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
think III would be a key area even

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.240 
think III would be a key area even
though<00:04:42.900> you<00:04:43.170> know<00:04:43.260> based<00:04:43.470> off<00:04:43.680> Jeff<00:04:43.890> Keeley's

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
though you know based off Jeff Keeley's

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.650 
though you know based off Jeff Keeley's
tweet<00:04:44.520> where<00:04:44.790> he<00:04:44.940> said<00:04:45.150> that<00:04:45.330> you<00:04:45.420> know<00:04:45.510> the

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
tweet where he said that you know the

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.510 
tweet where he said that you know the
marketing<00:04:46.050> strategy<00:04:46.440> was<00:04:46.590> amazing<00:04:47.400> I<00:04:47.490> think

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
marketing strategy was amazing I think

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.310 
marketing strategy was amazing I think
that's<00:04:47.820> kind<00:04:48.030> of<00:04:48.060> out<00:04:48.270> the<00:04:48.420> door<00:04:48.600> now<00:04:48.630> and<00:04:49.080> I

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
that's kind of out the door now and I

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.690 
that's kind of out the door now and I
don't<00:04:49.500> think<00:04:49.650> that<00:04:49.740> has<00:04:49.980> to<00:04:50.010> apply<00:04:50.340> what<00:04:50.430> the

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
don't think that has to apply what the

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.790 
don't think that has to apply what the
testa<00:04:51.090> had<00:04:51.480> to<00:04:51.600> do<00:04:51.720> because<00:04:51.870> this<00:04:52.080> is<00:04:52.200> prior<00:04:52.530> to

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
testa had to do because this is prior to

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.000 
testa had to do because this is prior to
all<00:04:53.130> the<00:04:53.430> delays<00:04:53.850> and<00:04:54.150> like<00:04:54.720> I<00:04:54.840> said<00:04:54.900> um<00:04:55.380> in<00:04:55.800> a

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
all the delays and like I said um in a

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.580 
all the delays and like I said um in a
few<00:04:56.400> videos<00:04:56.550> ago<00:04:56.840> how<00:04:57.840> Bethesda's<00:04:58.320> future

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
few videos ago how Bethesda's future

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.960 
few videos ago how Bethesda's future
game<00:04:58.770> is<00:04:58.890> delayed<00:04:59.040> I<00:04:59.340> think<00:04:59.550> it<00:04:59.610> was<00:04:59.640> delayed

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
game is delayed I think it was delayed

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.880 
game is delayed I think it was delayed
not<00:05:00.210> because<00:05:00.540> of<00:05:00.570> uh<00:05:00.870> you<00:05:01.140> know<00:05:01.170> the<00:05:01.410> money<00:05:01.620> and

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
not because of uh you know the money and

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.320 
not because of uh you know the money and
whatnot<00:05:02.250> I<00:05:02.490> think<00:05:02.850> it<00:05:02.910> was<00:05:03.000> more<00:05:03.120> start

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
whatnot I think it was more start

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.910 
whatnot I think it was more start
delayed<00:05:03.630> because<00:05:03.840> of<00:05:03.990> these<00:05:04.200> other<00:05:04.470> delays

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
delayed because of these other delays

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.740 
delayed because of these other delays
pushing<00:05:05.430> their<00:05:05.610> game<00:05:05.820> back<00:05:06.090> so<00:05:06.330> that<00:05:06.360> they<00:05:06.600> can

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
pushing their game back so that they can

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.840 
pushing their game back so that they can
market<00:05:07.200> these<00:05:07.320> other<00:05:07.590> games<00:05:07.890> and<00:05:08.130> then<00:05:08.580> they

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
market these other games and then they

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.820 
market these other games and then they
can<00:05:09.000> start<00:05:09.030> marketing<00:05:09.570> next<00:05:10.080> fall<00:05:10.230> off<00:05:10.350> for<00:05:10.620> um

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
can start marketing next fall off for um

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.220 
can start marketing next fall off for um
but<00:05:11.700> maybe<00:05:12.210> there's<00:05:12.600> always<00:05:12.870> the<00:05:12.990> small

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
but maybe there's always the small

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.270 
but maybe there's always the small
chance<00:05:13.500> that<00:05:13.590> they<00:05:13.830> don't<00:05:14.010> reveal<00:05:14.250> anything

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
chance that they don't reveal anything

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.910 
chance that they don't reveal anything
