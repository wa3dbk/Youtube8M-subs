00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.980
 the nephew amorim valley remembers when 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.520
 marijuana was not a topic but at 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.250
 alcohol was taken very seriously by the 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.960
 next picture a very talked about topic 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.239
 also very discussed in the past 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.239
 months marijuana not really 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.960
 came to this time that was another 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:04.949
 once more in our time not 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.869
 came drunk to the house was a 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.400
 grace education is applauded but the 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.400
 first china was a grace 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.659
 if it ends 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.100
 in relation to marijuana are 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.100
 consumed 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:33.440
 with my children 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.930

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.470
 this shit is good 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.690
 to adjust your family in the supposed 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.230
 no it's not a group it's a question with the 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.230
 what you have to live 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.520
 and although you see it the party 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.520
 independent if in the race 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:12.410
 is nothing less than tabaré vázquez 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.510
 that considers pablo mieres or has 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.459
 considered a man of right 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.080
 which he angered as also 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.760
 that with us are not models that are 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.680
 a different left we are not either 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.739
 of the white and red universe good 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.709
 has the truth that a space very this 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.200
 year us way 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:33.799
 constanza the rioter does not follow the 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.620
 arrow of the cacique that this time faced 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.209
 Danilo did not like that you're going to 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.209
 it will be announced that his next minister 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.090
 economy out danilo astori thinking 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.410
 who can be your future minister of 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.430
 economy 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.770
 if it rained it would be fervently 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:55.220
 fervently that was danilo counter 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.800
 astori again and his team because a 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.540
 of the characteristics that it has had 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.470
 all this movement that we put together with the 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.140
 candidacy and is to renew the 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.880
 people the idea that we in a 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.800
 new period we will not repeat the 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.020
 same faces good part of me 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.250
 radio nomination at least the 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.810
 presence of women I have not yet 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.000
 been to appoint no minister in 30 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.790
 years of knowledge that we have achieved 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.850
 it cost a lot to get here they want to go back to 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.200
 where we live want to not vote again 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:29.990
 pedro the angry present download the irpf 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.350
 but it shows that for that you need 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.350
 weather 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:41.420
 after eliminating and you weigh him 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:46.060
 to progressively no no no no no 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.060
 I want to promise as everyone promises 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.460
 from the growth 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:14.080
 the irate shot against danilo in his 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:17.470
 critics but to everyone's surprise 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.079
 this time the revoltosa put her shield 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.090
 of economy in the campaign because say 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.200
 I'm going to eliminate a tax is not talk 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.020
 of Economy 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.690
 let's say you have here a very empty 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.840
 important that left the state empty 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.030
 of circus pluna then and then there with 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.700
 300 million dollars that cost us and 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.350
 now I was doing it with ancap that 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.030
 has a hole of 150 million 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.070
 I can not say that I'm going to 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.450
 increase the education that I'm going to improve 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.950
 the salaries that I'm going to increase the 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.110
 amount of police to be able to have 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.730
 one in each corner and say that at the same 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.380
 time I will reduce taxes not 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.850
 you do not get both of these things 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.390
 it seems it would be good if astori 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.040
 will concentrate on their proposals 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.260
 for the proposals to stop the 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.680
 inflation is to say that there are pressures 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:04.020
 inflationary and nothing else is not talk 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.390
 of economics you have to explain why there 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.740
 pressure pressures and how it 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.740
 they would fight that expression 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:16.190
 he also liked hugs in the 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:19.220
 stage and invited an adversary who 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.600
 he showed respect to me he says he was 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.220
 above that here so let's give 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.720
 We are going to go into what is the 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.720
 active tries to steal some little huh 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.100
 a greeting in health 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:45.530
 tonight 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:49.500
 this furniture here I have a competitor 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:51.680
 It's very good quality, I do not like it 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.680
 much 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.270
 today I'm going to close you saying that this 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:04.270
 man 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.270
 hehehe 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.050
 this has been 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.910
 the handsome larrañaga confessed in a 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.180
 documentary that in his young beginnings 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:20.229
 he was not the bravest before an audience 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:24.699
 but now able that neither pass a 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:27.520
 week preparing the speech better and 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:29.530
 the silver a truck has asked for an act 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.419
 of 300 people and had to speak for 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.840
 the youth and I got on I forgot the 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:33.840
 speech 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:43.910
 that's why I do not have truths I do not show 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.910
 ficheras because I am free 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:51.350
 and I got on and forgot the speech 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.470
 well do not forget that you have a bit of 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.470
 memory 

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:58.050
 thus culminates another exciting stage a 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:02.610
 lake 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:05.360
 in power the only dose all follow 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.360
 rhythm
