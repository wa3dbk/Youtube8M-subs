00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:17.630
 take out the shakes 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.489
 then new little tutorial video 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.569
 yesterday I saw and I saw the 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:25.589
 the oil today it will be the pivot nba earlier 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.989
 in fact this one you've already watched the video of the oil 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:32.180
 leave like this 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.280
 see with the blade on the outside 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.360
 here it will be the downpour leave with the sum on the inside 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.990
 that's the big difference between the two 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.820
 so first of all 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.900
 three simple rotations 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.030
 the lake crisis 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.890
 sure to be in the right position 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.880
 we can also do more but with three years it's more beautiful 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.980
 then we forget his index behind 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.590
 laval the season so we start with season 2 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.060
 but his index behind 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.160
 to do well 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
 as for oil a rotation around the index 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.270
 so at rotations around the index we loose major comes replace by 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.270
 a hen 6 wrong not to drop the knife 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.090
 so there until then it's the same thing as the place that the normal school 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.810
 then how much change the wrist tilt 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.790
 as for oil 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.900
 to do well 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.900
 a rotation around the thumb 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.010
 and we recover the section of m 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.820
 so we were there 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.150
 rotation around the thumb 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.270
 we recover the series m 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.540
 right here 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.040
 a little trick is actually what can nap 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.160
 he's going to see a tax change 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.960
 we will change the accent 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.060
 of the knife 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.300
 story of coming back to do a rotation 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.040
 around the thumb in exactly the same way as 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.500
 than the previous 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.280
 but with the blade on the outside so in celebration we did a rotation like 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.210
 this one 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.210
 and I come I changed the story to make a rotation 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.959
 like that 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.829
 they can actually find themselves in the same position 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:15.829
 only for oil where will come to seize 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:17.769
 do not be a man 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.769
 to finish here the small rotation 

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:25.349
 for once I recommend you watch the other video for that I 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.209
 do not come back on it actually the biggest sum the biggest difference 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.609
 so in fact it's really the choice 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:36.539
 the fact that to travel that a rotation like this and there we arrive and we leave 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:38.079
 directly on a rotation 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.229
 with the blade on the outside 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:43.229
 so that's actually 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.349
 and then we just finished like this 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.269
 So that's really where this is where the 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.009
 difficulty to conclude the beginning 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:54.940
 it will be easy enough it's simple opening 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.129
 like to do it on simple as that 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.129
 this confetti of rotation in addition to contact epic factors 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:03.139
 we just dragged 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:05.229
 the back of the blade obviously 

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:07.919
 around the finger we recover with the thumb 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.239
 turn around the thumb 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.209
 with the back of the meets the thumb 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.209
 we come to recover the section of the world 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:18.879
 rotation site like that actually 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.469
 in fact it is this movement of the knife that is necessary 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:24.469
 we have to succeed in doing this is the part a little 

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:29.129
 in the part the go 1-5 alala block is different from the duel for the moment 

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:32.689
 here and then a last simple operation 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:35.989
 we just get the press m 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.989
 the faust rotation the end of the blade I'm talking about in your video 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:43.369
 and now we're pretty open here it's all over 

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:46.529
 So here it is for this video I hope that you are also a 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:47.649
 a bit 

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:50.549
 and then boom to next time I think I'm playing my turn is 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.549
 probably the case the peixe 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.239
 which is very complicated either you have to start with oil 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:59.350
 here we are 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.020
 do not hesitate to comment either below the video or 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.680
 poutine on the tour de france 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.359
 france bali song 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.959
 I managed to take eventually I will explain better 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.020
 according to what you want here are 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.039
 east on stage 

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.479
 a neighbor
