00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.250 
 clock no wonder horse power all
the<00:00:24.140> problems<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.230> everybody<00:00:26.039> has

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
the problems that everybody has

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.259 
the problems that everybody has
hopefully<00:00:28.260> I'm<00:00:28.650> not<00:00:28.800> saying<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.460> but

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
hopefully I'm not saying it is but

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.670 
hopefully I'm not saying it is but
hopefully<00:00:30.560> that<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.219> major<00:00:32.610> part<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.809> why

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
hopefully that is the major part of why

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
hopefully that is the major part of why
everybody's<00:00:35.550> doing<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.899> acuras<00:00:37.700> the

that's what they gotta do at least all
that<00:00:49.649> up<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.070> down<00:00:50.340> idling<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:52.340> the<00:00:53.340> check

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
that up and down idling and the check

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.220 
that up and down idling and the check
engine<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.989> can't<00:00:55.430> get<00:00:56.430> because<00:00:57.079> you<00:00:58.079> know

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
engine you can't get because you know

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.090 
engine you can't get because you know
you<00:00:59.039> tried<00:00:59.370> everything<00:00:59.940> like<00:01:00.329> me<00:01:01.100> finally

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
you tried everything like me finally

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.619 
you tried everything like me finally
it's<00:01:02.280> there<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.550> I'm<00:01:02.820> sure<00:01:03.030> there's<00:01:03.270> been<00:01:03.480> on

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
it's there and I'm sure there's been on

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.950 
it's there and I'm sure there's been on
the<00:01:04.110> internet<00:01:04.290> that's<00:01:04.739> how<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:04.920> found<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.549> but<00:01:06.540> I

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the internet that's how I found it but I

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.850 
the internet that's how I found it but I
wanted<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.799> make<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> youtube<00:01:09.240> video<00:01:09.510> i<00:01:09.869> want<00:01:10.770> it

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
wanted to make a youtube video i want it

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.429 
wanted to make a youtube video i want it
to<00:01:10.950> exactly<00:01:11.430> pinpoint<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.810> hopefully<00:01:12.960> that's

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
to exactly pinpoint so hopefully that's

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.320 
to exactly pinpoint so hopefully that's
the<00:01:13.560> major<00:01:13.830> problem<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.610> everybody<00:01:14.790> needs

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
to resolve and this ain't that hard to

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.429 
to resolve and this ain't that hard to
take<00:01:18.840> iron<00:01:19.080> I'm<00:01:19.610> no<00:01:20.610> way<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.939> mechanic<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:22.290> I'm

destroying everything I take apart which
that's<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.610> most<00:01:41.909> case<00:01:42.150> what<00:01:42.390> happens<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:43.259> in
