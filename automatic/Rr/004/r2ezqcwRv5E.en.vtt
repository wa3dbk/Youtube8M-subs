always has to what's word she has to

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.250 
always has to what's word she has to
work<00:02:31.459> a<00:02:31.610> little<00:02:31.640> bit<00:02:31.940> harder<00:02:32.300> than<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:33.019> man's

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
work a little bit harder than the man's

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.830 
work a little bit harder than the man's
have<00:02:33.560> to<00:02:33.709> yeah<00:02:33.920> she<00:02:34.190> has<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.459> prove<00:02:34.840> more

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840
