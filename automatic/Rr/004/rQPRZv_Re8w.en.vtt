00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.600
 totally welcome to the twelfth episode of couple chose pianist in 5 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.360
 minutes 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.460
 I take over my job from the founder of the Janus Online.com website 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:11.769
 tim and she became third beginners to play a keyword a piano without reading notes 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.259
 and those short five-minute videos I now teach you a fun and recognizable 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.609
 piece of piano in the hope that I can inspire you and show you 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:20.650
 how fast you can manage everything 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.650
 today i want to give you the chorus of claudia de breij 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.429
 I am very surprised how huge the vote is that it was quite exciting 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.259
 I did not think that the Dutch language would be so incredibly popular is that 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:32.960
 I really like to see 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.840
 I first play the song 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.520
 to the from which you see exactly which notes can stand 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.660
 the list two variants see the left hand an easy one 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.520
 and a difficult one 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.580
 because that way everyone can play at his or her own level with the beautiful 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.580
 number 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.540
 I have created a handy chord chart that will download your pin 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.440
 you can print it out during practice 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.250
 Here you will find the notes but also the pictures of chords you know 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.050
 exactly what need the agreement for me 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.810
 pf can be downloaded for free via the link peak in the description of this video 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:02.880
 placed on 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.880
 we will start soon 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.909
 we start to give up with the third finger for the first line 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.010
 so this is the councilman my piano we start from this crazy 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.580
 that is the first part of the first line up to the comma may I then with it 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.580
 take shelter 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.460
 and why stop there because we switched we now play the g with the 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.709
 second finger 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.099
 and we go for the second part of this rule 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.279
 with the g 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:17.279
 play with the third final 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.319
 we do it to them that must come out below 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.319
 one more time the first line 

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:34.839
 change 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:41.429
 encore that line slowly and then I move on to the second line 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.629
 according to the second line you start with your two fingers on the e 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:07.029
 again 

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:11.679
 third finger eating 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:19.439
 then the third arranged start just as the first to give up again 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.329
 we also just as the first line was switching 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.549
 one more third line 

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:45.619
 and then the last line 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:55.479
 again 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.819
 I played right hand first signs but slowly and then the 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.819
 agreements reached 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.650
 the chords at x a start of this video already that you have two variants that 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.889
 show 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.110
 the first easy one 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.219
 how do you play only the ground tones of the chords in a victory 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:51.020
 do you want two series 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.029
 and an agreement 

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:57.029
 wnf it wrc i'm going on and on 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.319
 if you find that awkward and you can't even transfer your hand to reekers 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:04.770
 can choose to play only once so a c 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.499
 one in minor 

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:07.629
 that is also possible 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:10.729
 but it can sound nice to not play with the opta because you 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.729
 than what gets fuller sound 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.400
 and you want to make something more difficult then you can also look for bargains 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:58.789
 yes it sounds like this 

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:34.869
 and if you are very nice then they want to finish that time with both 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.400
 then you can still sleep on this bill 

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:48.339
 and then your bed ends so 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.080
 well that seems like a perfect ending that was more for this week 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.629
 good luck practicing 

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:08.610

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.999
 under this video it is greatly appreciated your massive corpse 

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:13.180

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.599
 motivation for me 

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:17.300
 and I was really surprised to get wilders 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.139

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:21.050
