00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.620
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.530
 car 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.530
 Hmm 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.530
 dee 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:20.700
 This time it took me to buy mac mini 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:27.270
 First of all this magic trackpad 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:31.050
 This is a drop of 6800 yen , January 2 first sale of apple store in January January 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:33.980
 It became linear energy by discount only for 2 times 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.650
 So I bought it for 800 yen 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:41.000
 Also wireless keyboard This is also the first sale discount January 2 limited energy 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.270
 Because it is 1000 yen 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.850
 We purchased for 5,800 yen 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.170
 And 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.630
 mac mini body This is a disappointing, but it was not discounted even with the initial sale 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:57.640
 So I will buy at this retailers 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:01:01.440
 That is depending on the shop when you purchase at a mass retailer, but points are attached 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.500
 So that party percentage ぇ hey this 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:09.150
 You difference by each shop sell-mer 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:15.780
 Please and this is try being negotiated everyone's individually think different even department of personnel 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:20.070
 In my case this was the point I bought at the list price and the point I had originally 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.790
 It's not another education but I added it to get this 23-inch monitor. 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.160
 Was 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:29.140
 In it resolution Kedomo this monitor is what is 1920 multiplied by 1080 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.810
 Probably I think that I use the same panel as imac 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.250
 Oh 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.600
 I will do it again while doing this 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.460
 Actually it is 21 days for imac but this is 23 inches 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.390
 So I 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.280
 It is a general system 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:51.720
 Because it is 52,800 yen of 5,800 yen of 5,800 yen 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:55.350
 We were able to start Mac including monitor for 64,400 yen 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.920
 But in the sea in which I Eto had finished selling the first of another New Year I do not only buy in the price 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.570
 Also 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.990
 In that case, it is only 2000 high 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:06.220
 The point is that it is 66,400 yen 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.450
 So now it's about 47,000 on the net, right? 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.599
 that 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:15.849
 If the actual sales is to do so because is this Mac right 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:19.110
 Currently at ¥ 60,600 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:23.790
 You can start mac mini 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:28.230
 However, the monitor will use the existing monitor. 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:33.060
 In fact, this ne ne If Itteyuu still monitor it had a new depth from 12,000 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.490
 I think it is about 15,000 yen, but if it is 21 days in 23 cities, it will sell for another one 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.130
 10,000 2,000 yen and also might by 10,000 yen or Teru 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:43.930
 Please consider yourself while looking at this 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:49.780
 I bought an apple tv besides this This is 800 yen that occurs 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.290
 There is a big monitor here to take mirror link and say that I bought this neck 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.969
 I will 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.750
 It's 51 but it's actually a mirror of mac as a motor 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:58.610
 I am 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:05.720
 You can use it like this 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:08.420
 Finally, it's a summary, so in my case 64,400 yen Strictly speaking of dvi 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:13.910
 We bought cable to connect cable pattern monitor 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:16.850
 This hard hard off was 300 yen or 64,700 yen but 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.890
 Around 60,000 yen 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.819
 Well it is that Mac life is started 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:28.129
 How about that 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:29.030
 It though is in my case this is it merely you even try to be variously considered 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.550
 Please give me 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.730
 Also'll be fun to get lost 's it 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.730
 Cho 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.390
 Good Iiii 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.110
 wh 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.920
