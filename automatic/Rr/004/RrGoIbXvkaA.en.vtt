put<00:01:34.720> that<00:01:34.810> one<00:01:34.960> away

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
put that one away

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.279 
put that one away
so<00:01:36.880> this<00:01:37.060> stalk<00:01:37.390> here<00:01:37.600> where<00:01:37.929> it's<00:01:38.049> been<00:01:38.259> dug

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
so this stalk here where it's been dug

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:39.929 
so this stalk here where it's been dug
out<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:38.830> ground<00:01:39.039> that's<00:01:39.250> gone<00:01:39.490> a<00:01:39.520> bit<00:01:39.700> dry

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
out to the ground that's gone a bit dry

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.749 
out to the ground that's gone a bit dry
so<00:01:40.210> we'll<00:01:40.330> get<00:01:40.479> rid<00:01:40.630> of<00:01:40.659> that<00:01:41.429> and<00:01:42.429> then<00:01:42.580> there

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
so we'll get rid of that and then there

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.840 
so we'll get rid of that and then there
are<00:01:42.789> two<00:01:43.030> ways<00:01:43.240> you<00:01:43.450> can<00:01:43.600> cut<00:01:43.840> it<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:45.460> can<00:01:45.490> put

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
are two ways you can cut it you can put

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.630 
are two ways you can cut it you can put
your<00:01:46.000> knife<00:01:46.179> round<00:01:46.539> and<00:01:47.530> take<00:01:47.799> this<00:01:47.979> stalk<00:01:48.399> out

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
your knife round and take this stalk out

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.779 
your knife round and take this stalk out
and<00:01:49.149> then<00:01:49.689> slice<00:01:50.079> it<00:01:50.380> thinly<00:01:50.710> and<00:01:51.130> cook<00:01:51.640> it

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
and then slice it thinly and cook it

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.430 
and then slice it thinly and cook it
with<00:01:51.909> the<00:01:52.030> cauliflower<00:01:52.299> you<00:01:52.720> break<00:01:52.959> off<00:01:53.200> these

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
with the cauliflower you break off these

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.449 
with the cauliflower you break off these
into<00:01:53.799> little<00:01:53.830> trees

00:01:54.449 --> 00:01:54.459 
into little trees

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:56.940 
into little trees
and<00:01:55.209> that<00:01:55.750> goes<00:01:55.959> really<00:01:56.140> sweet<00:01:56.470> when<00:01:56.649> you<00:01:56.679> cook

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
and that goes really sweet when you cook

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.289 
and that goes really sweet when you cook
it<00:01:57.130> but<00:01:57.700> I<00:01:57.880> like<00:01:58.090> to<00:01:58.119> do<00:01:58.450> it<00:01:58.569> in<00:01:58.750> two<00:01:58.990> wedges<00:01:59.200> so

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
it but I like to do it in two wedges so

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.749 
it but I like to do it in two wedges so
cut<00:02:01.299> it<00:02:01.330> in<00:02:01.539> half<00:02:02.069> then<00:02:03.069> you<00:02:03.159> see<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.459> stem

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
cut it in half then you see the stem

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:09.449 
cut it in half then you see the stem
that<00:02:03.789> runs<00:02:04.209> up<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.420> cauliflower<00:02:04.990> I<00:02:08.310> cut<00:02:09.310> it

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
that runs up the cauliflower I cut it

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.979 
that runs up the cauliflower I cut it
into<00:02:09.670> wedges<00:02:10.000> like<00:02:10.390> this<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:13.180> then<00:02:13.660> when<00:02:13.840> you

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
into wedges like this and then when you

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.650 
into wedges like this and then when you
cook<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:14.739> serve<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:15.459> everyone<00:02:16.180> gets<00:02:16.209> a

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
cook it and you serve it everyone gets a

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
in one go so each grab a head of

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.840 
in one go so each grab a head of
broccoli<00:02:34.799> now<00:02:35.799> a<00:02:35.829> lot<00:02:36.100> of<00:02:36.130> people<00:02:36.370> normally

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
broccoli now a lot of people normally

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.550 
broccoli now a lot of people normally
don't<00:02:36.970> eat<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.329> stalk<00:02:37.630> but<00:02:37.900> that's<00:02:38.079> delicious

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
don't eat the stalk but that's delicious

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.840 
don't eat the stalk but that's delicious
so<00:02:38.769> we're<00:02:38.890> going<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.040> prepare<00:02:39.280> that<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:41.850> then

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
so we're going to prepare that and then

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.150 
so we're going to prepare that and then
you<00:02:43.000> cut<00:02:43.630> it<00:02:43.660> just<00:02:44.230> where<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.530> trees<00:02:44.769> come

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
you cut it just where the trees come

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.059 
you cut it just where the trees come
down<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:45.670> stop<00:02:45.940> meeting<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.019> trunk<00:02:47.319> just

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
down and stop meeting the trunk just

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.949 
down and stop meeting the trunk just
straight<00:02:48.940> through<00:02:50.489> that's<00:02:51.489> it<00:02:51.730> so<00:02:52.690> now<00:02:52.840> you're

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
straight through that's it so now you're

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.190 
straight through that's it so now you're
left<00:02:53.109> with<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.650> florets<00:02:54.069> and<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:55.840> can<00:02:56.019> just

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
left with the florets and you can just

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:13.220 
left with the florets and you can just
click<00:02:56.440> those<00:02:56.650> off

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.570 

you<00:03:14.230> want<00:03:14.379> everything<00:03:14.800> to<00:03:14.830> be<00:03:14.950> sort<00:03:15.310> of<00:03:15.430> the

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
you want everything to be sort of the

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:23.809 
you want everything to be sort of the
same<00:03:15.790> size<00:03:16.060> so<00:03:16.420> it<00:03:16.540> cooks<00:03:16.750> at<00:03:16.959> the<00:03:17.019> same<00:03:17.110> time

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.990 

okay<00:03:24.819> so<00:03:24.880> then<00:03:25.120> you're<00:03:25.209> left<00:03:25.330> with<00:03:25.480> your<00:03:25.599> stalk

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
okay so then you're left with your stalk

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.210 
okay so then you're left with your stalk
so<00:03:28.000> these<00:03:28.209> are<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.540> bits<00:03:28.690> here<00:03:29.110> if<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:30.010> look

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
so these are the bits here if you look

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.460 
so these are the bits here if you look
at<00:03:30.519> the<00:03:30.670> bottom<00:03:30.940> of<00:03:31.030> you<00:03:31.120> broccoli<00:03:31.540> can<00:03:32.380> you

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
at the bottom of you broccoli can you

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.830 
at the bottom of you broccoli can you
see<00:03:32.709> that<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.130> goes<00:03:33.280> from<00:03:33.640> pale<00:03:33.970> to<00:03:34.000> dark<00:03:34.599> green

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
see that it goes from pale to dark green

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.880 
see that it goes from pale to dark green
on<00:03:35.019> the<00:03:35.140> outside
