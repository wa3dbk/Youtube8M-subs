00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 yo everyone is hot who 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.430
 I hope you're doing a lot less well 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.290
 nickel and today we end up 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.240
 for a new video like you 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.620
 saw it under this video and beats 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.630
 today I will introduce you 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.620
 new information we found 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.809
 in source codes 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.580
 so I put an image on the screen 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.199
 so there you can see that it's written 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.070
 three new weapons with a point 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.380
 polling 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.720
 then there are three codes and below 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.340
 it's written we have to guess sega 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.349
 so shit the meaning of the sentence wants 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.300
 to say bacon must guess its three codes 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.250
 and blow and down some time ago 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.200
 modders have managed to find 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.989
 images in the source codes and bin there 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.790
 must show all gta 5 weapons 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.500
 so I put you several pictures to 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.180
 the screen that will scroll one by one 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.460
 so in the first frame we can 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.860
 see and down an assault rifle 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.570
 so I have no idea how he 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.969
 is called then we go to the second 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.960
 image so there we can still see 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.550
 an assault rifle 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.710
 it looks like a weapon in call of duty 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.000
 more precisely blackops of it looks like 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.160
 enormously the fal 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.690
 then I have no idea but that 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.340
 port and so is there I put you a 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.899
 third image on the screen so there we 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.729
 can see a sniper 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.159
 so for my part I think it's a 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.689
 sniper I have nothing else to add there 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.220
 on it then there I put you a 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.140
 new image on the screen so there you 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.390
 can see lovemaking pieces of 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.710
 tuning a vehicle that's called and 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.210
 tempo ballads 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.640
 according to ian 22 c pieces of 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.409
 customization that were created low by 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.240
 another mode hours then you have to 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.979
 surely not know and balatum not I 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.110
 you put an image on the screen so there 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.700
 you do not like looks like that so this 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.009
 image comes from iv gta 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.390
 if I'm not mistaken then that's it 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.680
 look like it's not a vehicle that 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.630
 I appreciate it enormously 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.400
