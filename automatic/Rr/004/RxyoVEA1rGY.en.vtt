and<00:00:00.420> how<00:00:00.989> is<00:00:01.110> finally<00:00:01.530> based<00:00:01.710> on<00:00:01.890> that<00:00:02.040> there

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
and how is finally based on that there

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.519 
and how is finally based on that there
and<00:00:02.550> I<00:00:02.910> want<00:00:03.180> to<00:00:03.300> speak<00:00:03.540> about<00:00:03.600> serve<00:00:04.290> that

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
and I want to speak about serve that

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.370 
and I want to speak about serve that
reason<00:00:04.890> do<00:00:05.700> this<00:00:05.910> first<00:00:06.150> you<00:00:08.960> hear<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.139> sound

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
reason do this first you hear the sound

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.259 
reason do this first you hear the sound
the<00:00:10.559> sound<00:00:10.830> is<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.309> proof<00:00:11.550> that<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.940> air<00:00:12.090> is

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
the sound is the proof that the air is

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.239 
the sound is the proof that the air is
going<00:00:12.630> yes<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.800> I<00:00:14.219> do<00:00:14.280> it<00:00:14.519> with<00:00:14.790> my<00:00:14.820> lungs<00:00:15.210> now

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:16.249 
going yes and I do it with my lungs now

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:19.249 
going yes and I do it with my lungs now
now<00:00:17.249> I<00:00:17.279> do<00:00:17.489> it<00:00:17.640> differently<00:00:17.759> I<00:00:18.239> make<00:00:18.569> my<00:00:18.869> cheeks

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:19.259 
now I do it differently I make my cheeks

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:23.179 
now I do it differently I make my cheeks
full<00:00:20.099> of<00:00:20.249> air<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.909> I<00:00:21.599> press<00:00:22.019> the<00:00:22.230> air<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.769> you

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
full of air and I press the air and you

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.290 
full of air and I press the air and you
hear<00:00:23.489> the<00:00:23.609> sound<00:00:25.369> proof<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.819> the<00:00:26.970> air<00:00:27.119> is

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
hear the sound proof that the air is

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.979 
hear the sound proof that the air is
going<00:00:27.630> out<00:00:28.339> so<00:00:29.339> once<00:00:29.669> with<00:00:29.909> my<00:00:30.059> lungs<00:00:30.300> once<00:00:30.839> we

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:30.989 
going out so once with my lungs once we

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.069 
going out so once with my lungs once we
match<00:00:31.259> it<00:00:31.289> now<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.009> have<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.759> ID<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.750> we<00:00:33.929> do

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
match it now we have the ID so we do

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.910 
match it now we have the ID so we do
this<00:00:34.230> now

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.520 

and<00:00:37.010> at<00:00:37.879> the<00:00:37.969> same<00:00:38.179> time<00:00:38.449> you<00:00:38.719> do<00:00:38.929> this<00:00:39.140> with

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530

your lungs you take a breath by your
nose<00:00:41.480> lugia<00:00:45.550> you<00:00:46.550> see<00:00:49.629> and<00:00:50.629> now<00:00:50.899> you<00:00:51.440> continue

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
nose lugia you see and now you continue

00:00:52.070 --> 00:01:00.990
