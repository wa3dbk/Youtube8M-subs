00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.810
 Hello Alexey with you today 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.890
 will go about the fan circuit 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:15.900
 cooling quad cf moto 500 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:19.200
 Well, let's start from where 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.850
 the whole circuit is powered on 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.160
 fan means she passes 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.860
 starting from the positive terminal 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.250
 passes through the main relay through 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.579
 the main fuse here comes 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.640
 power supply for 1 fuse in the block 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.670
 fuse here it is this one 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.880
 the red wire here goes the jumper on 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:48.059
 fuse and so he went green 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.280
 red wire here it is we have a relay 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.739
 fan on 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.149
 so here we have this green red 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.149
 the wire 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:01:01.790
 so this fuse responds 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:08.100
 only for to include a conclusion 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:11.039
 relay relay fan means blue 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.829
 the red wire goes from here to itself 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:17.100
 fan is plus means control 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:23.219
 side here it is our minus comes 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:26.009
 after the fan start sensor plus 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:28.740
 to the governors comes from the castle 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.229
 ignition that is when you turn on 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.010
 Ignition here appears plus if 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:38.590
 submit minus from 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.909
 the fan sensor then turns on the area 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.860
 have accordingly included 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.229
 fan 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.409
 I want a little bit of this scheme 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.360
 improve because why tell 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.450
 icon to 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.479
 the fan is working and you turn off 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.440
 ATV chain is broken and the fan 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:02.590
 stops cooling so i want him 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.619
 Dead still waiting for the engine to the desired 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.340
 temperature until the sensor turns off 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:13.150
 for what you need to do 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.300
 here from here here is the wire that comes from 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:20.319
 us from the ignition 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.870
 This is our black black wire 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.090
 disconnect insulate it here 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.730
 throw a jumper here to here in this terminal 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:33.160
 we will be standing here plus that is 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:36.540
 as soon as we submit a minus from the sensor y 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.760
 us fan will turn on 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.549
 hence after turning off the ignition 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.600
 or but still on or off 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:47.200
 the fan will turn on at the time 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:51.239
 at the temperature sensor command so we 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.239
 move to the front of the ATV 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:03:00.209
 here it is a shoe 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:03.209
 fan means here it is our blue blue 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:08.239
 wire with a red stripe is our plus 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:14.900
 came from the relay here they are wires 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:18.739
 which go to the sensor green minus and 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:22.069
 black with a red stripe goes to the relay 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:25.969
 It means how everything works, that is, we turn it on 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:30.780
 ignition closes these two reasons 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:36.540
 worked relay the emperor will earn everything 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:39.480
 ok so i made some changes to 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.609
 I wanted this scheme so that I could see 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.219
 turn on the fan or not 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:49.580
 I turned on for this I did 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:54.880
 I connected such a button 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:57.500
 it means this button has a light bulb here 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.170
 hooked up as follows on one 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.730
 side buttons when we serve food at 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.540
 we light up the lamp 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.720
 I connected these to the terminals, that is 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:13.540
 minus u and plus y filed a button that is 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.380
 now when power is applied to 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.709
 fan motor 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.940
 we have a button lights it please 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.299
 that is, we see that the fan 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.299
 turned on 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:31.740
 also what else did if for some 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:35.510
 the reason you have a faulty road breaks down 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:38.430
 fan switch or relay 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:41.580
 I mean I used the emergency circuit. 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:45.390
 inclusions that is, I force feed 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:49.130
 voltage on the fan on this one 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:52.650
 block with this button 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:56.880
 then how did I take a plus after 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:59.970
 ignition call and minus and that is when 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.690
 ignition on on i click on 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:06.380
 button and bypassing the entire circuit former 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.500
 fan turns on 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.190
 But that's what I think is enough to 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:16.730
 drive home and troubleshoot 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:19.250
 which appeared to fix everything else 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.320
 since we control switching on all the time 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.160
 we can see when the fan turned on 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.500
 the light bulb comes on and we can 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.900
 forcibly turn on the fan 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:33.520
 here so thank you all for your attention with you 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.520
 was alexey bye
