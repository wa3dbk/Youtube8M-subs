when<00:00:40.260> we<00:00:40.530> should<00:00:40.710> be<00:00:40.860> flat<00:00:41.989> make<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.140> felt<00:00:43.440> like

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
when we should be flat make it felt like

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.950 
when we should be flat make it felt like
turn<00:00:44.370> as<00:00:44.489> well<00:00:44.760> as<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.940> flap<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.420> facing<00:00:45.840> away

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
turn as well as the flap is facing away

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.020 
turn as well as the flap is facing away
from<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:48.110> I'm<00:00:49.110> going<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.730> fold<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.879> flap

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
from you I'm going to fold this flap

00:00:51.030 --> 00:01:05.110 
from you I'm going to fold this flap
down<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.260> edge<00:00:53.719> like<00:00:54.719> this

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.550 

like<00:01:05.810> this<00:01:07.810> and<00:01:08.810> do<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.050> same<00:01:09.230> with<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:09.530> other

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
like this and do the same with the other

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:26.850 
like this and do the same with the other
side<00:01:20.050> so<00:01:21.050> shut<00:01:21.290> off<00:01:21.380> that<00:01:23.740> so<00:01:24.740> it<00:01:24.920> oranges<00:01:25.340> on

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
side so shut off that so it oranges on

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.300 
side so shut off that so it oranges on
there<00:01:27.860> should<00:01:28.070> be<00:01:28.270> three<00:01:29.270> flaps<00:01:29.660> I<00:01:30.170> mean<00:01:31.100> two

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
there should be three flaps I mean two

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.380 
there should be three flaps I mean two
flaps<00:01:32.560> well<00:01:33.850> open<00:01:34.850> up<00:01:34.910> one<00:01:35.330> flap<00:01:37.180> just<00:01:38.180> like

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
flaps well open up one flap just like

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.500 
flaps well open up one flap just like
this<00:01:39.430> so<00:01:40.430> there<00:01:40.670> should<00:01:40.850> be<00:01:40.880> a<00:01:41.000> heavier<00:01:41.450> flop

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
this so there should be a heavier flop

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.450 
this so there should be a heavier flop
but<00:01:44.510> it<00:01:44.600> must<00:01:44.810> be<00:01:45.140> like<00:01:45.260> a<00:01:45.320> heavier<00:01:45.770> side<00:01:46.010> here

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
but it must be like a heavier side here

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.460 
but it must be like a heavier side here
and<00:01:46.940> I'll<00:01:47.090> like<00:01:47.300> this<00:01:47.480> side<00:01:47.920> here<00:01:50.140> fold<00:01:51.140> these

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
and I'll like this side here fold these

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.990 
and I'll like this side here fold these
edges<00:01:51.980> into<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.030> middle<00:01:53.960> crease<00:01:54.350> like<00:01:54.980> like<00:01:55.970> a

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
edges into the middle crease like like a

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.620 
edges into the middle crease like like a
folding<00:01:56.480> airplane<00:02:02.500> you<00:02:03.500> should<00:02:03.770> have<00:02:03.920> this

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
folding airplane you should have this

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:22.160 
folding airplane you should have this
and<00:02:05.630> do<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.840> same<00:02:06.020> at<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.200> other<00:02:06.350> side

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:33.199 

Fisher<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.069> this<00:02:28.130> then<00:02:29.130> just<00:02:29.700> fold<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.330> in<00:02:32.209> like

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
Fisher of this then just fold it in like

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:48.800 
Fisher of this then just fold it in like
this<00:02:39.770> okay<00:02:40.770> so<00:02:43.880> now<00:02:45.080> if<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.230> open<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.680> up<00:02:47.810> just

like being opening will fold you want to
fold<00:02:52.980> paper<00:02:53.940> in<00:02:54.090> half<00:02:54.150> just<00:02:54.780> like<00:02:54.900> this<00:02:56.060> so<00:02:57.060> if

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
fold paper in half just like this so if

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.860 
fold paper in half just like this so if
there's<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.569> vertical<00:02:58.200> line<00:02:58.410> going<00:02:58.890> through<00:02:58.920> it

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:09.979

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
well kind of like a vertical crease okay

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.979 
well kind of like a vertical crease okay
and<00:03:10.980> then<00:03:11.130> just<00:03:12.650> rip<00:03:13.650> right<00:03:14.040> on<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:14.430> line

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
and then just rip right on that line

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:22.640 
and then just rip right on that line
like<00:03:15.989> about<00:03:16.380> maybe<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:17.069> half<00:03:17.400> an<00:03:17.640> inch<00:03:21.410> so<00:03:22.410> yeah

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
like about maybe a half an inch so yeah

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.920 
like about maybe a half an inch so yeah
like<00:03:22.860> this

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.929 

and<00:03:30.049> take<00:03:31.099> this<00:03:32.099> edge<00:03:32.519> and<00:03:33.060> just<00:03:33.870> fold<00:03:34.260> it<00:03:34.439> up

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:34.939 
and take this edge and just fold it up

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:44.660 
and take this edge and just fold it up
at<00:03:35.939> an<00:03:36.180> angle<00:03:41.239> so<00:03:42.239> let<00:03:42.390> you<00:03:42.540> have<00:03:42.689> this<00:03:43.670> and

at an angle so let you have this and

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.809 
at an angle so let you have this and
this<00:03:45.329> will<00:03:45.629> be<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.989> lips<00:03:47.959> so<00:03:48.959> you<00:03:49.019> have<00:03:49.290> this

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.280 

somebody<00:04:18.570> should<00:04:18.870> have<00:04:18.960> something<00:04:19.140> that

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
looks like this so the next part is

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:30.410 
looks like this so the next part is
really<00:04:24.600> easy<00:04:27.860> open<00:04:28.860> it<00:04:29.010> up<00:04:29.190> open<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.970> duck<00:04:30.180> up

have this and it the mouth like is
really<00:04:46.320> cool<00:04:46.620> because<00:04:46.830> if<00:04:47.670> you<00:04:48.210> just<00:04:48.420> let<00:04:48.600> go

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
really cool because if you just let go

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.140 
really cool because if you just let go
it<00:04:50.250> just<00:04:51.210> wants<00:04:51.480> to<00:04:51.600> the<00:04:51.870> paper<00:04:52.110> also<00:04:52.320> unfold

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
it just wants to the paper also unfold
