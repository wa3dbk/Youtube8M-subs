little bit more and see if I could I'm
just<00:02:43.170> probably<00:02:43.380> going<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.650> look<00:02:43.799> for<00:02:43.950> some

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
just probably going to look for some

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.509 
just probably going to look for some
more<00:02:44.310> positive<00:02:44.820> signals<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:46.220> go<00:02:47.220> from<00:02:47.370> there

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
more positive signals and go from there

someday<00:05:02.789> but<00:05:03.510> i<00:05:03.780> don't<00:05:04.080> know<00:05:04.169> that's<00:05:04.800> one<00:05:05.010> of

neighborhood association here is

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.479 
neighborhood association here is
probably<00:05:11.760> pretty<00:05:12.030> tight<00:05:12.389> so<00:05:14.180> that's<00:05:15.180> about<00:05:15.450> it
