00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
you're not an ultimate Iron Man or iron

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.510 
you're not an ultimate Iron Man or iron
man<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.469> try<00:00:46.680> out<00:00:46.739> this<00:00:46.890> place<00:00:47.160> as<00:00:47.309> well

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
man to try out this place as well

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.639 
man to try out this place as well
because<00:00:47.969> it's<00:00:48.420> really<00:00:48.840> efficient<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.350> do<00:00:49.469> it

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
because it's really efficient to do it

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.160 
because it's really efficient to do it
it's<00:00:50.370> not<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.789> good<00:00:51.000> for<00:00:51.300> higher<00:00:51.539> levels<00:00:51.930> but

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
it's not that good for higher levels but

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.740 
it's not that good for higher levels but
I<00:00:52.440> believe<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.949> level<00:00:53.219> till<00:00:53.430> 71<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.329> then

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
I believe to level till 71 and then

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.060 
I believe to level till 71 and then
after<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.230> think<00:00:55.410> that's<00:00:55.739> when<00:00:56.039> you

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
after that I think that's when you

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.439 
after that I think that's when you
should<00:00:56.280> start<00:00:56.520> pyramid<00:00:56.879> plunder<00:00:57.180> I'm<00:00:57.300> not

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
should start pyramid plunder I'm not

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.220 
should start pyramid plunder I'm not
sure

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
sure

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.290 
sure
personally<00:00:58.859> myself<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.280> never<00:00:59.789> really<00:01:00.149> done

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
personally myself I never really done

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.810 
personally myself I never really done
pyramid<00:01:00.690> plunder<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.500> much<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:02.129> did<00:01:02.640> other

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
pyramid plunder that much I did other

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.630 
pyramid plunder that much I did other

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
methods but other than that this is

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.190 
methods but other than that this is
should<00:01:06.030> be<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> really<00:01:06.390> good<00:01:06.600> place<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.869> get

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
all to get it so I would say it took me

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.440 
all to get it so I would say it took me
about<00:02:19.810> maybe<00:02:20.260> about<00:02:21.130> like<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.580> thousand<00:02:22.209> five

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
is going to be all really useful for

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.020 
is going to be all really useful for
training<00:02:46.989> and<00:02:47.319> especially<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.519> melee<00:02:48.700> one<00:02:48.910> is

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
training and especially the melee one is

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.309 
training and especially the melee one is
going<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.269> be<00:02:49.420> really<00:02:49.690> good<00:02:49.810> for<00:02:50.019> Slayer

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
going to be really good for Slayer

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.100 
going to be really good for Slayer
because<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.220> body<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:52.450> bottom<00:02:52.959> I

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
because the body and the bottom I

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.160 
because the body and the bottom I
believe<00:02:53.709> give<00:02:54.069> about<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.640> same<00:02:54.850> amount

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
believe give about the same amount

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.130 
believe give about the same amount
magic-based<00:02:56.170> defense<00:02:56.830> against<00:02:57.569> mage<00:02:58.569> attacks

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
magic-based defense against mage attacks

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.559 
magic-based defense against mage attacks
melee<00:02:59.950> matched<00:03:00.160> based<00:03:00.489> attacks<00:03:00.940> so<00:03:01.450> it's

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
melee matched based attacks so it's

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:02.880 
melee matched based attacks so it's
going<00:03:01.690> to<00:03:01.780> be<00:03:01.870> really<00:03:02.170> useful<00:03:02.200> for<00:03:02.650> me<00:03:02.709> while

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
going to be really useful for me while

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.380 
going to be really useful for me while

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
now for regular Ironman accounts this

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.610 
now for regular Ironman accounts this
method<00:05:07.510> is<00:05:07.660> going<00:05:07.840> to<00:05:07.930> be<00:05:07.990> very<00:05:08.200> useful

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
method is going to be very useful

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.860 
method is going to be very useful
because<00:05:08.770> regular<00:05:09.490> ironmans<00:05:10.060> can<00:05:10.570> pretty<00:05:10.750> much

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
because regular ironmans can pretty much

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.020 
because regular ironmans can pretty much
make<00:05:11.169> them<00:05:11.380> into<00:05:11.590> unpowered<00:05:11.980> orbs<00:05:12.190> then<00:05:12.790> power

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
make them into unpowered orbs then power

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.580 
make them into unpowered orbs then power
them<00:05:13.300> up<00:05:13.419> get<00:05:13.750> some<00:05:13.780> bad<00:05:14.110> all<00:05:14.290> staffs

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
them up get some bad all staffs

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.980 
them up get some bad all staffs
basically<00:05:15.520> craft<00:05:15.760> them<00:05:15.940> together<00:05:16.090> and<00:05:16.660> I'll

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
basically craft them together and I'll

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.750 
basically craft them together and I'll
come<00:05:17.230> and<00:05:17.350> make<00:05:17.560> a<00:05:17.590> really<00:05:17.980> nice<00:05:18.250> amount<00:05:18.580> of

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
come and make a really nice amount of

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.820 
come and make a really nice amount of
profits<00:05:19.240> so<00:05:19.750> I<00:05:19.780> believe<00:05:20.050> this<00:05:20.290> is<00:05:20.470> one<00:05:20.620> of<00:05:20.650> the

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
profits so I believe this is one of the

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.950 
profits so I believe this is one of the
best<00:05:21.010> ways<00:05:21.250> to<00:05:21.610> make<00:05:21.970> money<00:05:22.120> for<00:05:22.360> regular<00:05:22.690> army

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
250 Slayer points so I believe I

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.350 
250 Slayer points so I believe I
currently<00:06:23.830> have<00:06:24.100> a<00:06:24.160> like<00:06:24.340> hundred<00:06:24.970> lives<00:06:25.150> or

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360

something like that so if you want to do

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.200 
something like that so if you want to do
this<00:06:26.979> latter<00:06:27.220> point<00:06:27.280> shouldn't<00:06:27.760> take<00:06:27.880> longer

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 
this latter point shouldn't take longer

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.880 
this latter point shouldn't take longer
all<00:06:28.479> circuits<00:06:28.780> maybe<00:06:29.020> like<00:06:29.229> a<00:06:29.260> day<00:06:29.500> maybe<00:06:29.740> less

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:29.890 
all circuits maybe like a day maybe less

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.409 
all circuits maybe like a day maybe less
I<00:06:30.250> don't<00:06:30.669> remember<00:06:30.910> how<00:06:31.180> long

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419
