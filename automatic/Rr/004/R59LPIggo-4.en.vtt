quite<00:01:09.940> flexible<00:01:10.680> material<00:01:11.680> this<00:01:11.920> one<00:01:12.159> and

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
quite flexible material this one and

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.859 
quite flexible material this one and
let's<00:01:14.110> pop<00:01:14.409> my<00:01:14.740> fourth<00:01:15.430> gen<00:01:15.790> iPod<00:01:16.390> Touch<00:01:16.630> in

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
let's pop my fourth gen iPod Touch in

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.910 
let's pop my fourth gen iPod Touch in
just<00:01:17.560> offer<00:01:17.770> it<00:01:17.950> up<00:01:17.979> to<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.310> top<00:01:18.520> like<00:01:18.909> so

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
just offer it up to the top like so

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.219 
just offer it up to the top like so
ease<00:01:20.920> it<00:01:21.190> into<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.520> case<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.780> then<00:01:22.930> it's<00:01:23.080> just

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
ease it into the case and then it's just

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.319 
ease it into the case and then it's just
a<00:01:23.440> matter<00:01:23.470> of<00:01:24.570> stretching<00:01:25.570> it<00:01:25.659> around<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
a matter of stretching it around the

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:34.380 
a matter of stretching it around the
iPod<00:01:28.329> to<00:01:28.719> fit<00:01:28.899> it<00:01:29.020> into<00:01:29.200> place<00:01:29.619> like<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:33.390> there

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
iPod to fit it into place like so there

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.929 
iPod to fit it into place like so there
we<00:01:34.630> go<00:01:34.659> so<00:01:35.109> that's<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.590> iPod<00:01:36.250> in<00:01:36.399> now<00:01:36.609> that<00:01:36.789> the

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
we go so that's the iPod in now that the

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.789 
we go so that's the iPod in now that the
new<00:01:37.090> 4th<00:01:37.450> gen<00:01:37.630> iPod<00:01:38.020> Touch<00:01:38.259> as<00:01:38.500> you<00:01:38.619> probably

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
new 4th gen iPod Touch as you probably

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.090 
new 4th gen iPod Touch as you probably
know<00:01:39.100> is<00:01:39.729> a<00:01:39.789> very<00:01:40.270> low<00:01:40.600> profile<00:01:41.140> so<00:01:41.829> it's<00:01:41.950> quite

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
know is a very low profile so it's quite

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.029 
know is a very low profile so it's quite
tricky<00:01:42.399> to<00:01:42.549> fit<00:01:42.820> into<00:01:42.969> some<00:01:43.240> of<00:01:43.329> these<00:01:43.390> cases

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
tricky to fit into some of these cases

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.380 
tricky to fit into some of these cases
one<00:01:45.039> of<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:45.250> things<00:01:45.429> that<00:01:45.549> people<00:01:45.670> do<00:01:45.939> ask<00:01:46.149> me

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
one of the things that people do ask me

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.539 
one of the things that people do ask me

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
which I'm going to cover off first is it

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.899 
which I'm going to cover off first is it
does<00:01:48.820> a<00:01:49.060> case<00:01:49.420> affect<00:01:49.899> the<00:01:50.609> film<00:01:51.609> type

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909

it's<00:04:16.479> not<00:04:16.630> too<00:04:16.959> obtrusive<00:04:17.380> on<00:04:17.829> the<00:04:17.919> card<00:04:18.130> so<00:04:18.310> I

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
it's not too obtrusive on the card so I

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.190 
it's not too obtrusive on the card so I
don't<00:04:18.579> think<00:04:19.299> it<00:04:19.419> looks<00:04:19.510> particularly<00:04:19.900> nice

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
don't think it looks particularly nice

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.779 
don't think it looks particularly nice
stuck<00:04:20.560> on<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:20.799> back<00:04:20.950> but<00:04:21.160> it<00:04:21.250> doesn't<00:04:21.519> really

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
stuck on the back but it doesn't really

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:23.850 
stuck on the back but it doesn't really
get<00:04:22.120> in<00:04:22.240> the<00:04:22.360> way<00:04:22.510> I'm<00:04:22.630> not<00:04:22.810> a<00:04:22.840> big<00:04:23.200> fan<00:04:23.530> of<00:04:23.560> it

get in the way I'm not a big fan of it

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.480 
get in the way I'm not a big fan of it
but<00:04:24.550> it<00:04:25.120> doesn't<00:04:25.810> sort<00:04:26.380> of<00:04:26.530> affect<00:04:26.890> the<00:04:27.100> use<00:04:27.280> of

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
but it doesn't sort of affect the use of

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.070 
but it doesn't sort of affect the use of
the<00:04:27.550> case<00:04:27.760> I<00:04:27.940> suppose<00:04:28.270> and<00:04:28.510> the<00:04:28.570> fact<00:04:28.780> you<00:04:28.870> can

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
the case I suppose and the fact you can

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.710 
the case I suppose and the fact you can

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
time you get a little fingerprint on it

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.210 
time you get a little fingerprint on it
he's<00:04:33.820> really<00:04:34.300> quite<00:04:34.720> good<00:04:34.930> it's<00:04:35.710> not<00:04:35.979> too

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
he's really quite good it's not too

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.890 
he's really quite good it's not too
tacky<00:04:36.520> it's<00:04:36.940> just<00:04:37.120> got<00:04:37.270> a<00:04:37.300> little<00:04:37.390> bit<00:04:37.600> of<00:04:37.690> tack

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
tacky it's just got a little bit of tack

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.360 
tacky it's just got a little bit of tack
to<00:04:38.080> it<00:04:38.229> and<00:04:38.620> it<00:04:38.710> doesn't<00:04:38.890> leave<00:04:39.160> any

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370

stickiness on the back of the case when

stickiness on the back of the case when
it's<00:04:42.580> um<00:04:42.909> removed<00:04:43.479> there's<00:04:43.870> no<00:04:44.020> sticky<00:04:44.500> there

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:47.519 
at all
it<00:04:46.089> just<00:04:46.269> clings<00:04:46.599> to<00:04:46.809> it<00:04:46.929> not<00:04:47.079> sure<00:04:47.319> how<00:04:47.469> long

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:47.529 
it just clings to it not sure how long

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:50.069 
it just clings to it not sure how long
this<00:04:48.149> stickiness<00:04:49.149> is<00:04:49.269> going<00:04:49.449> to<00:04:49.509> last<00:04:49.689> because

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:50.079 
this stickiness is going to last because

00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:51.899 
this stickiness is going to last because
I<00:04:50.259> haven't<00:04:50.439> been<00:04:50.619> using<00:04:50.769> you<00:04:51.009> that<00:04:51.159> long<00:04:51.369> but

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:51.909 
I haven't been using you that long but

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:54.839 
I haven't been using you that long but
it<00:04:52.029> certainly<00:04:52.209> feels<00:04:52.569> alright<00:04:53.399> and<00:04:54.399> I<00:04:54.489> think

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:54.849 
it certainly feels alright and I think

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:57.629 
it certainly feels alright and I think
that<00:04:55.119> the<00:04:55.409> sticky<00:04:56.409> swipe<00:04:56.829> as<00:04:57.129> they<00:04:57.249> called<00:04:57.519> it

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
that the sticky swipe as they called it

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.079 
that the sticky swipe as they called it
it's<00:04:57.789> quite<00:04:58.059> a<00:04:58.299> nice<00:04:58.689> addition<00:04:59.139> to<00:04:59.169> the<00:04:59.379> case

00:05:00.079 --> 00:05:00.089 
it's quite a nice addition to the case

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:01.949 
it's quite a nice addition to the case
offers<00:05:01.089> a<00:05:01.149> decent<00:05:01.539> amount<00:05:01.599> of<00:05:01.779> protection

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:01.959
