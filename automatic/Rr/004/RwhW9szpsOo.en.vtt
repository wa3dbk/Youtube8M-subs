00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello here is open again bio cook 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.160
 fit for the first time 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.160
 your partner focus 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.430
 in the council for cakes have mocked 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.650
 that the apple is the best of intercession 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.869
 to bake apples at all what's up 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.410
 he is certainly but it's just 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:32.410
 really a cooker eg now we do 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:36.309
 We have some butter or butter 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:39.510
 margarine should be soft is here one 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.510
 a bit too tight 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:42.809
 2 1 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.960
 to drive 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.150
 the recipe take you again the infobox 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.760
 there is the link to the homepage where that 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:02.059
 recipe then really detailed 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.949
 family is a bit and listed 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.369
 Here we have something with something 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.170
 baking powder undervalued has this been going 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.560
 Comparison after we first beat 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.560
 indeed the 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.329
 I lay 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:53.350
 That said, that serves us as something 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:57.520
 stronger cake dough in principle so 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.710
 ground we have a cake shape 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.250
 with breading so sunk cutter and 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.470
 renÃ© mail 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.470
 and there comes in our cake dough rhine 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:29.400
 Distribute something that must be so perfect 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.400
 he's running anyway he's running after 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.690
 then you already do enough principle 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.180
 August finished because stands out this time 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.630
 creme fraiche now comes a yolk 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.630
 in addition 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:06.550
 when this time say a little more sugar 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:10.690
 2 2 tablespoons one more time 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:16.090
 stir and then comes a good one 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:18.700
 first fortifying custard powder 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:23.800
 take then you have the vanilla too 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:27.880
 nothing else fits with richards 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:33.010
 Mostly exits to the print pool 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:35.760
 pure master is with a little bit the 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.760
 once a whisk 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:42.880
 that's in principle now and angus now 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.710
 It's okay to peel the apples as normal 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.710
 and then exclude 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:19.450
 then again a few before said then fits 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:28.410
 a shell sugar though he is for 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:28.410
 mix some sugar with cinnamon pepper 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:36.430
 rolling apple centers 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.220
 the boscope just needs it 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:47.770
 sugar and then we set him ever 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:50.350
 a cake mold all so finished yet 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.110
 ever quite good it came from one was 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.940
 a bit too right break 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:05:01.919
 you want to know something in hazelnuts here 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:01.919
 It is possible with walnuts 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.120
 i can just from my childhood 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.880
 I usually have so many of them 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:18.900
 marzipan, I do not mind anything else 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:22.460
 be and roses water then comes standards 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:25.290
 Load on it classic would be cranberries 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.360
 I 've been running it at the moment 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.440
 tastes fantastic thinking 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.200
 you actually porsche 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.820
 Christmassy the recipe but how 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.560
 said that actually fits any fits 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.100
 jam if it has bear is optically 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.870
 from cranberries 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.490
 that is really secondarily so 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.620
 Now comes our course 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.630
 But first look at that one 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:54.230
 The jam does not cover it 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:56.880
 bounce well 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:58.620
 so the morning sees little covered 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:05.940
 so not not completely filled out 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:09.210
 form but she gives herself to another 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:12.110
 gen to be consistent it okay going in now 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:14.370
 160 degrees in the oven convection preheated 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.820
 how long then really was that 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.380
 holds the cake was now an hour 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.490
 and 15 minutes in the oven that comes 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.500
 of course if you are still relatively high 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.840
 form to me every normal shape the 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.979
 are slightly thicker and are the 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.640
 apples you have to, of course, too small 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:29.210
 to cut 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.320
 then you come for an hour approximately 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.750
 I never know in there are raisins 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.340
 Of course that would be tactic where they are 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.919
 in the prater floral or is it like that 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.840
 in the minds of the judgment for example 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:40.919
 also fits very well 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.419
 he is still a bit warm 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:44.780
 that's why I already write icing sugar 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:44.780
 from 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.900
 there are still a bit cool 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.199
 and then only cut up 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:58.910
 now he takes out directly falls he asks 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:07:00.830
 the citizens yes i hope my suggestion 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.250
 failed to advent and run to 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.120
 Of course, it was also delicious 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.100
 the cinnamon stars come slowly 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.160
 so that she is also really good at christmas 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:12.050
 Taste and go abo is all here 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.280
