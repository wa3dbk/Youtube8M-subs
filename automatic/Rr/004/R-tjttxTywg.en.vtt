00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
so up front you'll notice the GLI looks

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.860 
so up front you'll notice the GLI looks
a<00:00:39.490> lot<00:00:39.670> like<00:00:39.820> the<00:00:39.970> Jetta<00:00:40.210> it<00:00:40.660> has<00:00:40.840> a

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
a lot like the Jetta it has a
