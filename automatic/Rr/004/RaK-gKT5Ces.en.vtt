00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.000 
the coleman quad LED lantern the biggest
downfall<00:00:56.430> on<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.660> takes<00:00:57.899> 8<00:00:58.559> d

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
downfall on this is that it takes 8 d

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.610 
downfall on this is that it takes 8 d
cell<00:00:59.280> batteries<00:00:59.989> so<00:01:00.989> that's<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.320> little<00:01:01.440> bit

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
cell batteries so that's a little bit

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.009 
cell batteries so that's a little bit
spendy<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.879> be<00:01:03.000> putting<00:01:03.270> those<00:01:03.390> batteries<00:01:03.870> in

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
spendy to be putting those batteries in

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.370 
spendy to be putting those batteries in
there<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.739> says<00:01:05.390> you<00:01:06.390> should<00:01:06.600> get<00:01:06.780> 75

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
there but it says you should get 75

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.140 
there but it says you should get 75
hours<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.860> runtime<00:01:08.040> off<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.580> those<00:01:08.700> batteries

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
hours of runtime off of those batteries

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.530 
hours of runtime off of those batteries
