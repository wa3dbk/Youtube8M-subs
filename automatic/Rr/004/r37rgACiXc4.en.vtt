fantastic<00:00:13.769> thing<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.130> I'm<00:00:14.309> going<00:00:14.549> to

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
fantastic thing and I'm going to

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.849 
fantastic thing and I'm going to
demonstrate<00:00:15.089> one<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.929> essential

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
demonstrate one of the essential

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.980 
demonstrate one of the essential
techniques<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.609> used<00:00:17.910> in<00:00:18.060> my<00:00:18.210> turntable

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
techniques that I used in my turntable

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.590 
techniques that I used in my turntable
is<00:00:19.140> party<00:00:19.590> routine<00:00:20.010> namely<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.029> technique<00:00:21.449> of

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
is party routine namely the technique of

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.630 
is party routine namely the technique of
back<00:00:21.930> spinning<00:00:22.260> now<00:00:22.590> back<00:00:22.859> spinning<00:00:23.160> has<00:00:23.400> its

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
back spinning now back spinning has its

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.300 
back spinning now back spinning has its
roots<00:00:24.029> in<00:00:24.150> old-school<00:00:24.779> hip-hop<00:00:25.199> where<00:00:25.890> DJ's

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
roots in old-school hip-hop where DJ's

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.910 
roots in old-school hip-hop where DJ's
would<00:00:26.580> extend<00:00:27.300> usually<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.019> break<00:00:28.289> sort<00:00:28.800> of

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
would extend usually the break sort of

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.370 
would extend usually the break sort of
the<00:00:29.070> drum<00:00:29.369> break<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:30.240> song<00:00:30.449> by<00:00:30.840> taking<00:00:31.170> two

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
the drum break of a song by taking two

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.729 
the drum break of a song by taking two
of<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.679> same<00:00:31.920> record<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:33.410> manually<00:00:34.410> playing

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
of the same record and manually playing

of the same record and manually playing
and<00:00:35.070> rewinding<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:36.030> one<00:00:36.300> part<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.809> keep<00:00:36.960> it

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
and rewinding that one part to keep it

going<00:00:37.500> endlessly<00:00:38.390> Grandmaster<00:00:39.390> Flash<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.230> one

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
going endlessly Grandmaster Flash is one

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.860 
going endlessly Grandmaster Flash is one
of<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> pioneers<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.300> technique

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
of the pioneers of this technique

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.630 
of the pioneers of this technique
probably<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.410> pioneer<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.190> technique

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
probably the pioneer of this technique

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.540 
probably the pioneer of this technique
which<00:00:44.850> i<00:00:45.300> think<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.899> reason<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.550> when

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
which i think is the reason that when

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.060 
which i think is the reason that when
you<00:00:47.640> do<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:47.940> fast<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:48.570> called<00:00:48.780> flashing<00:00:49.559> so

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
you do this fast it's called flashing so

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.760 
you do this fast it's called flashing so
here<00:00:51.000> we<00:00:51.120> go<00:00:51.300> um<00:00:51.480> first<00:00:52.379> I'll<00:00:52.559> demonstrate

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
here we go um first I'll demonstrate

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:15.499 
here we go um first I'll demonstrate
what<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.280> looks<00:00:53.520> like<00:01:14.000> alright<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.330> is

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
what it looks like alright so this is

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.030 
what it looks like alright so this is
the<00:01:15.540> technique<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.049> we're<00:01:16.320> going<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.560> talk

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
the technique that we're going to talk

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.010 
the technique that we're going to talk
about<00:01:17.250> we're<00:01:17.759> going<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.939> go<00:01:18.030> step<00:01:18.360> by<00:01:18.390> step<00:01:18.540> and

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
about we're going to go step by step and

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.010 
about we're going to go step by step and
break<00:01:19.799> down<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.130> whole<00:01:20.159> process<00:01:20.720> first<00:01:21.720> step

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
break down the whole process first step

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.410 
break down the whole process first step
is<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.619> let<00:01:22.799> one<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> records<00:01:23.610> play<00:01:23.909> now

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
is you let one of the records play now

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.590 
is you let one of the records play now
your<00:01:24.689> best<00:01:24.900> friend<00:01:25.229> here<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.400> sticker<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
your best friend here is the sticker the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.210 
your best friend here is the sticker the
sticker<00:01:27.840> will<00:01:28.080> tell<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.500> where<00:01:28.740> your<00:01:28.860> sound

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
sticker will tell you where your sound

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.420 
sticker will tell you where your sound
is<00:01:29.460> um<00:01:29.670> if<00:01:30.030> we<00:01:30.180> visualize<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:31.860> record<00:01:32.189> like<00:01:32.400> a

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
is um if we visualize the record like a

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
is um if we visualize the record like a
clock<00:01:32.820> we<00:01:33.450> can<00:01:33.600> sort<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.900> make<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.110> makeshift

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
clock we can sort of make a makeshift

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.090 
clock we can sort of make a makeshift
estimation<00:01:36.450> as<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.720> where<00:01:36.990> say<00:01:37.409> our<00:01:37.680> first

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
estimation as to where say our first

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.340 
estimation as to where say our first
kick<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.579> maybe<00:01:39.119> it's<00:01:39.299> always<00:01:39.570> at<00:01:39.720> 12<00:01:39.990> o'clock

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
kick is maybe it's always at 12 o'clock

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.170 
kick is maybe it's always at 12 o'clock
so<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.799> when<00:01:40.950> we<00:01:41.310> know<00:01:41.490> when<00:01:41.670> we<00:01:41.790> bring<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
so that when we know when we bring the

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.840 
so that when we know when we bring the
record<00:01:42.479> back<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:43.170> sticker<00:01:43.560> here<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.130> always

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
record back that sticker here is always

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.420 
record back that sticker here is always
coming<00:01:45.149> back<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.630> same<00:01:45.840> place<00:01:46.170> or

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
coming back to the same place or

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.800 
coming back to the same place or
equivalently<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.640> same<00:01:47.850> time<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.540> this

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
equivalently the same time in this

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.660 
equivalently the same time in this
example<00:01:49.140> I'm<00:01:49.500> going<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.710> set<00:01:49.950> both<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.340> them<00:01:50.490> at

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
example I'm going to set both of them at

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.819 
example I'm going to set both of them at
12<00:01:51.360> o'clock<00:01:51.750> first<00:01:52.350> what<00:01:52.500> we're<00:01:52.590> going<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.740> do

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
12 o'clock first what we're going to do

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.170 
12 o'clock first what we're going to do
is<00:01:52.920> we're<00:01:53.009> going<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.159> repeat<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.700> bar<00:01:53.909> whoops

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
is we're going to repeat to bar whoops

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.170 
is we're going to repeat to bar whoops
so<00:01:54.750> let's<00:01:54.930> count<00:01:55.110> out<00:01:55.290> one<00:01:55.740> two<00:01:56.250> three<00:01:56.729> four

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
so let's count out one two three four

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.709 
so let's count out one two three four
two<00:01:57.600> two<00:01:57.840> three<00:01:58.700> alright<00:01:59.700> so<00:01:59.939> step<00:02:00.149> one<00:02:00.360> we<00:02:00.509> let

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
two two three alright so step one we let

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.300 
two two three alright so step one we let
the<00:02:00.840> record<00:02:01.140> play<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.590> crossfader<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.159> all

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
the record play the crossfader is all

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.980 
the record play the crossfader is all
the<00:02:02.430> way<00:02:02.579> on<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.969> side<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.509> turntable

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
the way on the side of the turntable

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.580 
the way on the side of the turntable
playing<00:02:04.340> step<00:02:05.340> 2<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.909> we<00:02:06.659> play<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.350> other

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
playing step 2 is we play the other

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.089 
playing step 2 is we play the other
record<00:02:08.009> from<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.209> one<00:02:09.420> from<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.929> same<00:02:10.259> in

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
record from the one from that same in

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.380 
record from the one from that same in
this<00:02:11.280> case<00:02:11.340> kick<00:02:11.879> drum

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
this case kick drum

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.830 
this case kick drum
uh<00:02:13.160> when<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.520> third<00:02:14.819> bar<00:02:15.090> would<00:02:15.360> actually

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
uh when the third bar would actually

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.340 
uh when the third bar would actually
start<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:16.920> we'd<00:02:17.160> go<00:02:17.310> one<00:02:17.580> two<00:02:17.940> three<00:02:18.240> four<00:02:18.930> two

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
start so we'd go one two three four two

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.100 
start so we'd go one two three four two
two<00:02:19.620> three<00:02:20.280> four<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:21.060> then<00:02:21.090> over<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.959> next

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
two three four and then over to the next

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.650 
two three four and then over to the next
turntable<00:02:22.709> dropping<00:02:23.130> on<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.340> one<00:02:23.490> here<00:02:23.790> so

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
turntable dropping on the one here so

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:35.600 
turntable dropping on the one here so
let's<00:02:24.840> do<00:02:24.990> that<00:02:25.020> part<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:34.370> alright<00:02:35.370> the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
let's do that part of it alright the

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.420 
let's do that part of it alright the
next<00:02:36.209> step<00:02:36.800> and<00:02:37.970> this<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.090> kind<00:02:39.330> of<00:02:40.430> the

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
next step and this is kind of the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.449 
next step and this is kind of the
crucial<00:02:41.910> step<00:02:42.239> of<00:02:42.450> this<00:02:42.900> whole<00:02:43.080> thing<00:02:43.350> is<00:02:43.530> that

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
crucial step of this whole thing is that

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.110 
crucial step of this whole thing is that
once<00:02:45.150> we<00:02:45.360> switch<00:02:45.750> from<00:02:46.140> this<00:02:47.100> turntable<00:02:47.430> to

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
once we switch from this turntable to

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.620 
once we switch from this turntable to
this<00:02:48.270> turntable<00:02:49.220> we<00:02:50.220> manually<00:02:50.790> bring<00:02:51.420> the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
this turntable we manually bring the

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.320 
this turntable we manually bring the
record<00:02:51.959> back<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.560> its<00:02:53.340> original<00:02:53.459> position

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
record back to its original position

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.870 
record back to its original position
now<00:02:55.320> our<00:02:55.560> techniques<00:02:55.980> for<00:02:56.190> doing<00:02:56.519> this<00:02:56.670> um

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
now our techniques for doing this um

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.210 
now our techniques for doing this um
there<00:02:57.330> are<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.600> few<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:58.019> you<00:02:58.080> can<00:02:58.140> do<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:59.040> two

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
there are a few that you can do the two

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.000 
there are a few that you can do the two
I<00:02:59.250> recommend<00:02:59.970> working<00:03:00.570> with<00:03:00.900> is<00:03:01.080> one<00:03:01.739> the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
I recommend working with is one the

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.990 
I recommend working with is one the
rewind<00:03:02.370> method<00:03:03.440> and<00:03:04.440> in<00:03:04.890> this<00:03:05.070> method<00:03:05.280> we're

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
rewind method and in this method we're

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.030 
rewind method and in this method we're
going<00:03:06.269> to<00:03:06.390> actually<00:03:06.720> take<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.930> finger<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.560> place

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
going to actually take a finger to place

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.509 
going to actually take a finger to place
it<00:03:08.220> between<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.580> label<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.890> groove<00:03:11.160> sort

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
it between the label and the groove sort

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.160 
it between the label and the groove sort
of<00:03:11.610> in<00:03:11.700> this<00:03:11.820> areas<00:03:12.209> where<00:03:12.390> I<00:03:12.420> think<00:03:12.480> is

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
of in this areas where I think is

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.130 
of in this areas where I think is
probably<00:03:13.380> optimal<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.130> then<00:03:14.610> anyone<00:03:15.390> holding

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
probably optimal and then anyone holding

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.720 
probably optimal and then anyone holding
on<00:03:16.320> to<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.620> record<00:03:16.920> just<00:03:17.130> rotating<00:03:17.640> your

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
on to the record just rotating your

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.660 
on to the record just rotating your
wrist<00:03:17.970> backwards<00:03:21.829> until<00:03:22.829> you<00:03:23.280> get<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.579> that

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
wrist backwards until you get to that

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.199 
wrist backwards until you get to that
sound<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.840> other<00:03:25.049> option<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:25.680> a<00:03:25.769> pull<00:03:26.430> back

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.160 

and<00:03:30.209> what<00:03:30.360> I'm<00:03:30.480> going<00:03:30.630> to<00:03:30.660> do<00:03:30.840> here<00:03:31.049> is

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
and what I'm going to do here is

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.229 
and what I'm going to do here is
actually<00:03:31.320> do<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.100> series<00:03:32.459> of<00:03:32.579> little<00:03:32.730> throws

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
actually do a series of little throws

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.509 
actually do a series of little throws
where<00:03:33.959> I'm<00:03:34.110> going<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.320> sort<00:03:34.560> of<00:03:34.620> move<00:03:34.860> bring

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
where I'm going to sort of move bring

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.430 
where I'm going to sort of move bring
the<00:03:35.610> record<00:03:35.880> back<00:03:36.060> sort<00:03:36.900> of<00:03:36.989> flicking<00:03:37.320> my

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
the record back sort of flicking my

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.170 
the record back sort of flicking my
wrist<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.799> little<00:03:38.010> bit<00:03:38.160> with<00:03:38.549> the<00:03:38.700> contour<00:03:39.150> of

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
wrist a little bit with the contour of

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.270 
wrist a little bit with the contour of
the<00:03:39.360> record<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:39.989> we<00:03:40.410> should<00:03:40.680> keep<00:03:40.829> it<00:03:41.010> like

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
the record and we should keep it like

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.170 
the record and we should keep it like
this<00:03:41.900> until<00:03:42.900> I<00:03:42.959> get<00:03:43.200> back<00:03:43.350> and<00:03:43.799> if<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:44.820> know<00:03:44.880> how

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
this until I get back and if I know how

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.900 
this until I get back and if I know how
many<00:03:45.360> times<00:03:45.600> I've<00:03:45.780> revolved<00:03:46.200> I<00:03:46.290> can<00:03:46.500> kind<00:03:46.680> of

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
many times I've revolved I can kind of

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.600 
many times I've revolved I can kind of
catch<00:03:47.910> it<00:03:48.120> right<00:03:48.299> at<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.630> at<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:48.989> sweet<00:03:49.230> spot

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
catch it right at the at the sweet spot

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.580 
catch it right at the at the sweet spot
as<00:03:50.610> far<00:03:50.940> as<00:03:51.239> how<00:03:51.420> many<00:03:51.480> times<00:03:51.959> we<00:03:52.230> bring<00:03:52.470> it

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
as far as how many times we bring it

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.430 
as far as how many times we bring it
back<00:03:53.060> if<00:03:54.060> you're<00:03:54.329> doing<00:03:54.480> two<00:03:54.810> bar<00:03:54.989> whoops<00:03:55.260> and

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
back if you're doing two bar whoops and

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.069 
back if you're doing two bar whoops and
you're<00:03:55.560> working<00:03:55.769> on<00:03:56.010> a<00:03:56.070> 33<00:03:56.760> rpm<00:03:56.970> record<00:03:57.660> you're

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
you're working on a 33 rpm record you're

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.750 
you're working on a 33 rpm record you're
going<00:03:58.320> to<00:03:58.410> bring<00:03:58.560> it<00:03:58.680> back<00:03:58.829> roughly<00:03:59.340> two<00:03:59.579> and<00:03:59.610> a

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
going to bring it back roughly two and a

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.569 
going to bring it back roughly two and a
half<00:03:59.940> times<00:04:00.680> another<00:04:01.680> way<00:04:01.860> to<00:04:01.920> think<00:04:02.130> about<00:04:02.280> it

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
half times another way to think about it

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.789 
half times another way to think about it
is<00:04:02.910> if<00:04:03.150> your<00:04:03.510> starting<00:04:03.989> point<00:04:04.200> is<00:04:04.440> twelve

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
is if your starting point is twelve

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.100 
is if your starting point is twelve
o'clock<00:04:05.239> that's<00:04:06.239> sort<00:04:06.510> of<00:04:06.540> your<00:04:06.660> home<00:04:06.870> base

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
o'clock that's sort of your home base

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.840 
o'clock that's sort of your home base
point<00:04:07.440> and<00:04:07.620> you're<00:04:07.920> going<00:04:08.130> to<00:04:08.160> pass<00:04:08.370> twelve

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
point and you're going to pass twelve

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.360 
point and you're going to pass twelve
o'clock<00:04:09.180> two<00:04:09.690> times<00:04:10.019> before<00:04:10.620> you<00:04:10.950> finally

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
o'clock two times before you finally

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.030 
o'clock two times before you finally
come<00:04:11.549> back<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:12.840> actually<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.410> beginning<00:04:13.560> of

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
come back to actually the beginning of

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.830 
come back to actually the beginning of
the<00:04:14.310> record<00:04:14.609> before<00:04:14.760> before<00:04:15.329> you<00:04:15.420> get<00:04:15.540> back<00:04:15.690> to

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
the record before before you get back to

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.900 
the record before before you get back to
where<00:04:15.959> you<00:04:16.049> need<00:04:16.140> to<00:04:16.200> go<00:04:16.410> so<00:04:17.280> let's<00:04:17.310> go

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
where you need to go so let's go

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:25.400 
where you need to go so let's go
those<00:04:18.600> those<00:04:18.930> steps<00:04:19.609> 1<00:04:20.609> 2<00:04:21.090> 3<00:04:21.510> 4<00:04:22.049> 2<00:04:22.500> 2

[Music]
all<00:04:28.130> right<00:04:28.250> so<00:04:28.370> I<00:04:28.400> rewound<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:28.940> record<00:04:29.300> and

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
all right so I rewound the record and

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.150 
all right so I rewound the record and
now<00:04:29.810> it's<00:04:30.020> just<00:04:30.169> simply<00:04:30.680> a<00:04:30.710> matter<00:04:31.040> of

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
now it's just simply a matter of

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.390 
now it's just simply a matter of
repeating<00:04:31.610> so<00:04:32.740> after<00:04:33.740> when<00:04:33.889> this<00:04:34.040> is<00:04:34.190> done

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
repeating so after when this is done

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.250 
repeating so after when this is done

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
play this one I'm going to rewind this

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.150 
play this one I'm going to rewind this
turntable<00:04:40.430> over<00:04:40.970> here<00:04:41.440> rinse<00:04:42.440> and<00:04:42.590> repeat<00:04:42.710> and

turntable over here rinse and repeat and
you<00:04:43.490> have<00:04:43.639> yourself<00:04:43.790> a<00:04:44.360> backspin<00:04:45.199> so<00:04:45.770> let's

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
you have yourself a backspin so let's

00:04:46.460 --> 00:05:13.960 
you have yourself a backspin so let's
start<00:04:46.729> fold<00:04:46.940> at<00:04:47.060> the<00:04:47.090> beginning<00:05:12.490> and<00:05:13.490> there

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
start fold at the beginning and there

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.129 
start fold at the beginning and there
you<00:05:14.060> have<00:05:14.210> it<00:05:14.330> now<00:05:14.360> you'll<00:05:14.630> notice<00:05:14.810> I<00:05:14.990> was

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
you have it now you'll notice I was

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.440 
you have it now you'll notice I was
doing<00:05:15.380> something<00:05:15.789> to<00:05:16.789> make<00:05:16.970> sure<00:05:17.000> I<00:05:17.180> was<00:05:17.419> in

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
doing something to make sure I was in

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.420 
doing something to make sure I was in
the<00:05:17.600> right<00:05:17.810> spot<00:05:17.870> so<00:05:18.200> a<00:05:18.440> couple<00:05:18.710> times<00:05:19.070> on<00:05:19.250> this

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
the right spot so a couple times on this

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.480 
the right spot so a couple times on this
side<00:05:19.610> actually<00:05:19.880> rewound<00:05:20.389> back<00:05:20.690> too<00:05:21.260> far<00:05:21.590> and

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
side actually rewound back too far and

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.520 
side actually rewound back too far and
what<00:05:22.729> I<00:05:22.760> did<00:05:23.000> in<00:05:23.120> that<00:05:23.210> case<00:05:23.479> is<00:05:23.720> before<00:05:24.320> the

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
what I did in that case is before the

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.320 
what I did in that case is before the
one<00:05:24.740> was<00:05:25.160> going<00:05:25.340> to<00:05:25.460> hit<00:05:25.699> that<00:05:25.729> one<00:05:26.090> that<00:05:26.300> I

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
one was going to hit that one that I

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.690 
one was going to hit that one that I
need<00:05:26.419> it<00:05:26.630> to<00:05:26.660> drop<00:05:26.990> on<00:05:27.200> I<00:05:27.410> gave<00:05:27.979> myself<00:05:28.160> a

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
need it to drop on I gave myself a

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.240 
need it to drop on I gave myself a
little<00:05:29.539> back<00:05:29.900> and<00:05:29.930> forth<00:05:30.350> to<00:05:30.590> see<00:05:30.770> what<00:05:30.950> sound

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
little back and forth to see what sound

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.980 
little back and forth to see what sound
was<00:05:31.400> there<00:05:31.669> and<00:05:31.850> that<00:05:32.210> can<00:05:32.330> kind<00:05:32.479> of<00:05:32.600> cue<00:05:32.840> you

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
was there and that can kind of cue you

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.450 
was there and that can kind of cue you
into<00:05:33.289> whether<00:05:33.470> or<00:05:33.620> not<00:05:33.740> you've<00:05:33.950> made<00:05:34.160> it<00:05:34.280> back

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
into whether or not you've made it back

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.409 
into whether or not you've made it back
to<00:05:34.639> the<00:05:34.729> right<00:05:34.880> place

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419
