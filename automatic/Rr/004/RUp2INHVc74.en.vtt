00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
with the spin move but I'm finally taken

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.940

down<00:04:17.340> at<00:04:17.519> the<00:04:17.549> 28<00:04:18.060> yard<00:04:18.480> line<00:04:18.959> I<00:04:19.200> thought<00:04:19.650> I<00:04:19.680> had

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
down at the 28 yard line I thought I had

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.500 
down at the 28 yard line I thought I had
more<00:04:20.130> room<00:04:20.310> than<00:04:20.489> I<00:04:20.609> really<00:04:20.910> do<00:04:21.060> you<00:04:21.269> know<00:04:21.390> what

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
more room than I really do you know what

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.409 
more room than I really do you know what

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
I mean so it's still 14 to 6

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.630 
I mean so it's still 14 to 6
Tampa<00:04:25.110> Bay<00:04:25.140> coming<00:04:25.710> right<00:04:25.980> back<00:04:26.220> with<00:04:26.490> it

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.530 
we should have this victory and they
don't<00:05:33.630> get<00:05:33.990> it<00:05:34.169> they<00:05:34.460> do<00:05:35.460> not<00:05:35.669> get<00:05:36.090> the<00:05:36.240> first

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
don't get it they do not get the first

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.250 
don't get it they do not get the first
down<00:05:36.840> turnover<00:05:37.620> on<00:05:37.650> downs<00:05:38.630> but<00:05:39.630> hey<00:05:39.810> we<00:05:40.020> ran

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
down turnover on downs but hey we ran

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.500 
down turnover on downs but hey we ran
the<00:05:40.440> ball<00:05:40.620> three<00:05:40.979> straight<00:05:41.310> times<00:05:41.610> and<00:05:42.150> had<00:05:42.390> to

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
the ball three straight times and had to

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.670 
the ball three straight times and had to
punt<00:05:42.750> the<00:05:42.870> ball<00:05:42.900> back<00:05:43.380> to<00:05:43.410> them<00:05:43.830> so<00:05:44.610> here<00:05:45.030> we<00:05:45.120> go

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
punt the ball back to them so here we go

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.230 
punt the ball back to them so here we go
they<00:05:46.740> actually<00:05:46.919> have<00:05:47.280> one<00:05:47.550> timeout<00:05:48.030> so<00:05:48.180> I

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
they actually have one timeout so I

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.790 
they actually have one timeout so I
think<00:05:48.510> we<00:05:48.600> must<00:05:48.750> have<00:05:48.900> passed<00:05:49.140> it<00:05:49.320> so<00:05:49.350> second

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
think we must have passed it so second

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.159 
think we must have passed it so second
