bottle is empty and if it was completely
full<00:01:25.710> not<00:01:26.670> only<00:01:26.909> would<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.090> be<00:01:27.360> quite<00:01:27.630> a

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
full not only would that be quite a

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.859 
full not only would that be quite a
heavy<00:01:27.960> weight<00:01:29.030> when<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.329> attached<00:01:30.689> to

heavy weight when this is attached to
your<00:01:31.110> bum<00:01:31.350> bag<00:01:31.590> or<00:01:31.950> whatever<00:01:32.729> bag<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.240> that

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
your bum bag or whatever bag it is that

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.649 
your bum bag or whatever bag it is that
you're<00:01:33.540> using<00:01:34.040> whilst<00:01:35.040> out<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.369> training<00:01:35.820> I'm

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
you're using whilst out of training I'm

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.330 
you're using whilst out of training I'm
not<00:01:36.990> convinced<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.979> would<00:01:38.130> stay<00:01:38.310> in

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
not convinced that it would stay in

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.880 
not convinced that it would stay in
there<00:01:38.729> if<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.150> was<00:01:39.270> turned<00:01:39.540> upside<00:01:39.930> down<00:01:39.960> but

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
there if it was turned upside down but

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.620 
there if it was turned upside down but
it<00:01:41.009> does<00:01:41.189> clearly<00:01:41.579> demonstrate<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.450> it's

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
it does clearly demonstrate that it's

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.800 
it does clearly demonstrate that it's
capable<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.290> holding<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.829> 750<00:01:44.820> mil<00:01:45.110> size<00:01:46.110> bottle

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
capable of holding a 750 mil size bottle

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.520 
capable of holding a 750 mil size bottle
let's<00:01:48.810> take<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:50.990> all<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.380> way<00:01:52.530> down<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:53.280> a

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
let's take that all the way down to a

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.560 
let's take that all the way down to a
500<00:01:55.530> ml<00:01:55.619> bottle<00:01:56.390> slots<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.630> quite<00:01:58.049> nicely

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.850 

the<00:02:00.990> compression<00:02:01.320> board<00:02:02.810> tightens<00:02:03.810> up<00:02:03.990> very

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
the compression board tightens up very

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.480 
the compression board tightens up very
well<00:02:04.950> around<00:02:05.550> it<00:02:05.820> keeping<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.390> nice<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.630> snug

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
well around it keeping it nice and snug

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.960 
well around it keeping it nice and snug
I<00:02:08.490> think<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.830> 500<00:02:10.830> mil<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.280> probably<00:02:11.700> an

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
I think that 500 mil is probably an

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.290 
I think that 500 mil is probably an
ideal<00:02:12.420> water<00:02:13.350> sized<00:02:13.770> bottle<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:15.060> get<00:02:15.210> our

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
ideal water sized bottle to get our

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.450 
ideal water sized bottle to get our
training<00:02:15.660> with<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:19.590> if<00:02:19.740> we<00:02:19.890> take<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.280> water

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
training with so if we take the water

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.250 
training with so if we take the water
bottle<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:22.400> combine<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.610> with<00:02:24.260> the

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
bottle and combine it with the

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.940 
bottle and combine it with the
wall-to-wall<00:02:25.890> bum<00:02:26.490> bag<00:02:26.840> you'll<00:02:27.840> notice<00:02:28.320> or
