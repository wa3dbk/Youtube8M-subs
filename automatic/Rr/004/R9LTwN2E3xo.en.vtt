00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
very rarely get to see people implement

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.929 
very rarely get to see people implement
it<00:02:50.219> in<00:02:50.639> the<00:02:51.569> fight<00:02:52.280> so<00:02:53.280> going<00:02:53.969> from<00:02:54.239> that<00:02:55.939> we're

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:56.939 
it in the fight so going from that we're

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:58.640 
it in the fight so going from that we're
going<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.120> see<00:02:57.389> how<00:02:57.599> good<00:02:57.870> his<00:02:58.079> jab<00:02:58.379> has

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
going to see how good his jab has

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.170 
going to see how good his jab has
improved<00:02:59.129> in<00:02:59.489> his<00:02:59.699> speed<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:01.819> think<00:03:02.819> that'll<00:03:03.090> be

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
improved in his speed I think that'll be

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.420 
improved in his speed I think that'll be
a<00:03:03.209> good<00:03:03.389> tip<00:03:03.659> form<00:03:03.989> but<00:03:04.889> Canelo's<00:03:05.519> flosses<00:03:07.430> he

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
a good tip form but Canelo's flosses he

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.429 
a good tip form but Canelo's flosses he
becomes<00:03:08.879> in<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.419> second<00:03:09.780> half<00:03:09.959> of<00:03:10.139> the<00:03:10.199> fight

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
becomes in the second half of the fight

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.220 
becomes in the second half of the fight
complacent<00:03:11.400> he's<00:03:12.120> throwing<00:03:12.569> two<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:12.959> three

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
complacent he's throwing two and three

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.099 
complacent he's throwing two and three
punches<00:03:13.819> he<00:03:14.819> doesn't<00:03:15.120> move<00:03:15.209> his<00:03:15.269> head<00:03:15.629> as<00:03:15.840> much

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
punches he doesn't move his head as much

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.189 
punches he doesn't move his head as much
and<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:17.459> later<00:03:18.000> parts<00:03:18.509> of<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:18.720> fight<00:03:18.930> he's

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
and the later parts of the fight he's

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:23.839 
and the later parts of the fight he's
just<00:03:19.439> like<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.879> standing<00:03:20.879> target<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:22.849> that

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
just like a standing target and that

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.550 
just like a standing target and that
could<00:03:24.180> come<00:03:24.389> to<00:03:24.569> hurt<00:03:25.019> him<00:03:25.259> and<00:03:25.680> if<00:03:25.859> you<00:03:26.009> Laura

could come to hurt him and if you Laura

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.159 
could come to hurt him and if you Laura
what<00:03:28.560> you<00:03:28.799> cannot<00:03:29.280> do<00:03:29.669> against<00:03:30.449> canelo<00:03:30.780> is

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
what you cannot do against canelo is

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.520 
what you cannot do against canelo is

him to circle to his right laura has a

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:39.619 
him to circle to his right laura has a
problem<00:03:37.709> or<00:03:38.250> was<00:03:38.519> not<00:03:38.729> a<00:03:38.759> problem<00:03:39.090> he's<00:03:39.389> very

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
problem or was not a problem he's very

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.929 
problem or was not a problem he's very
comfortable<00:03:40.319> with<00:03:40.530> circling<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.519> his<00:03:41.699> right

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:41.939 
comfortable with circling to his right

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:46.030 
comfortable with circling to his right
side<00:03:42.239> and<00:03:42.629> keeping<00:03:43.019> his<00:03:43.459> right<00:03:44.459> hand<00:03:44.759> very<00:03:45.090> low

side and keeping his right hand very low

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.089 
side and keeping his right hand very low
so<00:03:47.040> he<00:03:47.729> tries<00:03:48.000> to<00:03:48.030> get<00:03:48.479> under<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.900> shots<00:03:49.169> but

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
so he tries to get under the shots but

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.210 
so he tries to get under the shots but

sometimes he just falls asleep and he's

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.360 
sometimes he just falls asleep and he's
not<00:03:53.639> aware<00:03:54.000> of<00:03:54.060> distance<00:03:54.750> Canelo<00:03:55.560> has<00:03:55.889> a<00:03:55.919> very

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
not aware of distance Canelo has a very

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.319 
not aware of distance Canelo has a very
fast<00:03:56.879> left<00:03:57.479> hook<00:03:58.040> he<00:03:59.040> has<00:03:59.159> a<00:03:59.189> very<00:03:59.489> fast<00:03:59.909> left

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
fast left hook he has a very fast left

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.050 
fast left hook he has a very fast left
to<00:04:00.479> the<00:04:00.599> body<00:04:00.840> hook<00:04:01.469> to<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.829> head<00:04:02.040> and<00:04:02.340> that's

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
to the body hook to the head and that's

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.610 
to the body hook to the head and that's
the<00:04:03.209> combination<00:04:03.449> they've<00:04:03.989> been<00:04:04.109> working<00:04:04.290> on

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
the combination they've been working on

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.280 
the combination they've been working on
for<00:04:04.650> Laura<00:04:05.189> because<00:04:05.909> they<00:04:06.120> think<00:04:06.239> one<00:04:06.659> shot<00:04:07.019> is

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
for Laura because they think one shot is

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.589 
for Laura because they think one shot is
going<00:04:07.530> to<00:04:07.590> put<00:04:07.829> Laura<00:04:08.129> on<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.489> canvas<00:04:08.969> then

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
going to put Laura on the canvas then

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.270 
going to put Laura on the canvas then
they<00:04:09.810> can<00:04:09.989> start<00:04:10.019> to<00:04:10.379> go<00:04:10.469> to<00:04:10.500> work<00:04:10.769> but<00:04:11.159> they

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
they can start to go to work but they

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.490 
they can start to go to work but they
want<00:04:11.519> to<00:04:11.609> lay<00:04:11.759> in<00:04:11.819> the<00:04:12.000> left<00:04:12.209> to<00:04:12.359> the<00:04:12.389> body<00:04:12.659> to

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
want to lay in the left to the body to

want to lay in the left to the body to

his advantages Laura can change the

his advantages Laura can change the
angles<00:04:44.009> on<00:04:44.220> Canelo<00:04:45.000> very<00:04:45.270> fast<00:04:45.630> because

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
angles on Canelo very fast because

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.850 
angles on Canelo very fast because
Canelo<00:04:46.410> has<00:04:46.650> very<00:04:46.979> slow<00:04:47.460> feet<00:04:48.319> he<00:04:49.319> has<00:04:49.500> fast

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
Canelo has very slow feet he has fast

Canelo has very slow feet he has fast
hands<00:04:50.520> and<00:04:51.349> everybody's<00:04:52.349> impressed<00:04:52.620> with

hands and everybody's impressed with

that<00:04:52.979> but<00:04:53.520> he<00:04:53.729> has<00:04:53.910> very<00:04:54.120> slow<00:04:54.599> footwork<00:04:55.259> as

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
that but he has very slow footwork as

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.730 
that but he has very slow footwork as
you<00:04:56.520> saw<00:04:56.789> against<00:04:57.150> Mayweather<00:04:57.740> Mayweather

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
you saw against Mayweather Mayweather

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.070 
you saw against Mayweather Mayweather
could<00:04:59.250> get<00:04:59.430> in<00:04:59.550> position<00:05:00.060> and<00:05:00.180> do<00:05:00.360> anything<00:05:00.720> he

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
could get in position and do anything he

wanted<00:05:01.410> to<00:05:01.560> do<00:05:01.740> with<00:05:01.949> Canelo<00:05:02.340> because

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
wanted to do with Canelo because

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.110 
wanted to do with Canelo because
Mayweather<00:05:03.570> foot<00:05:04.110> speed<00:05:04.440> is<00:05:05.160> what<00:05:05.490> dictated

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
Mayweather foot speed is what dictated

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.270 
Mayweather foot speed is what dictated
the<00:05:06.210> pace<00:05:06.240> of<00:05:06.630> the<00:05:06.720> fight<00:05:06.750> and<00:05:07.169> Canelo<00:05:08.009> could

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
the pace of the fight and Canelo could
