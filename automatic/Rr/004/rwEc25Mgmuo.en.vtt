welcome<00:00:01.170> to<00:00:01.290> the<00:00:01.380> chemistry<00:00:01.829> question<00:00:02.040> Jordan

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
welcome to the chemistry question Jordan

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.760 
welcome to the chemistry question Jordan
here<00:00:03.120> you<00:00:03.570> may<00:00:03.720> or<00:00:03.840> may<00:00:03.870> not<00:00:04.080> know<00:00:04.259> this<00:00:04.440> but<00:00:04.650> I

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
here you may or may not know this but I

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.190 
here you may or may not know this but I
am<00:00:04.799> also<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.490> scuba<00:00:05.940> diver<00:00:05.970> and<00:00:06.480> today<00:00:06.810> I<00:00:06.839> wanted

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
am also a scuba diver and today I wanted

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.799 
am also a scuba diver and today I wanted
to<00:00:07.259> talk<00:00:07.470> about<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:08.010> science<00:00:08.760> behind<00:00:09.090> scuba

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
to talk about the science behind scuba

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.980 
to talk about the science behind scuba
diving<00:00:10.200> so<00:00:11.160> we're<00:00:11.340> going<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.670> first<00:00:11.990> explore

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
diving so we're going to first explore

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.580 
diving so we're going to first explore
colors<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:13.920> how<00:00:14.610> water<00:00:15.379> absorbs<00:00:16.379> and

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
colors and how water absorbs and

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.689 
colors and how water absorbs and
scatters<00:00:16.710> colors

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
scatters colors

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.000 
scatters colors
it<00:00:17.970> starts<00:00:18.630> with<00:00:18.750> longer<00:00:19.170> wavelengths<00:00:19.770> such

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
it starts with longer wavelengths such

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.609 
it starts with longer wavelengths such
as<00:00:20.279> red<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:21.090> then<00:00:21.630> continues<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.140> orange

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
as red and then continues to orange

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.609 
as red and then continues to orange
yellow<00:00:23.000> and<00:00:24.000> violet<00:00:24.180> on<00:00:24.600> green<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.350> then

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
yellow and violet on green and then

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.380 
yellow and violet on green and then
finally<00:00:25.980> blue<00:00:26.539> so<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.990> have<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> quiz<00:00:29.390> this

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
finally blue so I have a quiz this

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.260 
finally blue so I have a quiz this
picture<00:00:30.810> was<00:00:30.960> taken<00:00:30.990> at<00:00:31.410> 50<00:00:31.740> feet<00:00:32.000> what<00:00:33.000> color

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
picture was taken at 50 feet what color

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.569 
picture was taken at 50 feet what color
is<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.719> cloth<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.290> see<00:00:37.340> would<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.370> have

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
is the cloth you see would you have

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.520 
is the cloth you see would you have
guessed<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.090> was<00:00:39.120> bright<00:00:39.450> red<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:40.350> is

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
guessed that it was bright red this is

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.470 
guessed that it was bright red this is
that<00:00:40.710> same<00:00:40.920> picture<00:00:41.160> with<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.579> flesh<00:00:41.820> showing

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
that same picture with the flesh showing

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.520 
that same picture with the flesh showing
how<00:00:42.629> water<00:00:42.930> absorbs<00:00:43.590> colors<00:00:45.379> continuing<00:00:46.379> on

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
how water absorbs colors continuing on

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.049 
how water absorbs colors continuing on
this<00:00:46.800> shows<00:00:47.399> us<00:00:47.520> why

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
this shows us why

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.770 
this shows us why
shallow<00:00:48.600> water<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:49.410> almost<00:00:49.860> clear<00:00:50.780> well

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
shallow water is almost clear well

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.930 
shallow water is almost clear well
slightly<00:00:52.110> deeper<00:00:52.530> water<00:00:52.890> has<00:00:53.489> sort<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.850> a

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
slightly deeper water has sort of a

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.200 
slightly deeper water has sort of a
light<00:00:54.120> blue<00:00:54.949> deeper<00:00:55.949> still<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:57.030> have<00:00:57.149> a

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
light blue deeper still you have a

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.750 
light blue deeper still you have a
darker<00:00:57.629> blue<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.829> then<00:00:58.980> I'm<00:00:59.100> even<00:00:59.399> darker

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
darker blue and then I'm even darker

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.660 
darker blue and then I'm even darker
blue<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.270> some<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.199> darkest<00:01:01.920> waters<00:01:02.340> are

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
blue and some of the darkest waters are

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.730 
blue and some of the darkest waters are
almost<00:01:03.030> black<00:01:05.030> so<00:01:06.229> now<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.380> we've<00:01:07.530> talked

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
almost black so now that we've talked

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.300 
almost black so now that we've talked
about<00:01:07.830> color<00:01:08.189> let's<00:01:08.460> talk<00:01:08.700> about<00:01:08.850> pressure

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
about color let's talk about pressure

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.630 
about color let's talk about pressure
recall<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.490> one<00:01:11.850> atmosphere<00:01:12.510> as<00:01:13.640> 14.7

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
recall that one atmosphere as 14.7

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.710 
recall that one atmosphere as 14.7

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
pounds per square inch and a scuba tank

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.429 
pounds per square inch and a scuba tank

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
square inch of pressure need to stink

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.420 
square inch of pressure need to stink
markings<00:01:28.740> show<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.030> equal<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:31.430> 207

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
markings show that that is equal to 207

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.569 
markings show that that is equal to 207
atmospheres<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.720> same<00:01:34.590> tank<00:01:34.920> would

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
atmospheres and that same tank would

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.469 
atmospheres and that same tank would
have<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> volume<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.540> 80<00:01:37.200> cubic<00:01:37.740> feet<00:01:37.979> if<00:01:38.479> the

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
have a volume of 80 cubic feet if the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.550 
have a volume of 80 cubic feet if the
air<00:01:39.780> was<00:01:40.560> at<00:01:40.890> one<00:01:41.130> atmosphere<00:01:41.670> pressure<00:01:41.939> so

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
air was at one atmosphere pressure so

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.490 
air was at one atmosphere pressure so
roughly<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.680> size<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.070> telephone<00:01:44.280> booth<00:01:45.500> so

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
roughly the size of a telephone booth so

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.639 
roughly the size of a telephone booth so
tanks<00:01:47.369> come<00:01:47.610> in<00:01:47.820> both<00:01:47.970> steel<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.780> aluminum

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
tanks come in both steel and aluminum

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.030 
tanks come in both steel and aluminum
now<00:01:50.490> aluminum<00:01:51.119> has<00:01:51.509> become<00:01:52.110> more<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.799> more

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
now aluminum has become more and more

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.219 
now aluminum has become more and more
favored<00:01:53.670> because<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.479> may<00:01:54.630> recall<00:01:54.930> from<00:01:54.990> my

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
favored because you may recall from my

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.880 
favored because you may recall from my
other<00:01:55.380> videos<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.340> lighter<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.710> will<00:01:58.710> not

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
other videos it is lighter and will not

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.300 
other videos it is lighter and will not
rust<00:01:59.719> going<00:02:00.719> on<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.490> pressure<00:02:04.280> we<00:02:05.280> have

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
rust going on to pressure we have

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.270 
rust going on to pressure we have
Boyle's<00:02:05.880> law<00:02:06.000> which<00:02:06.500> shows<00:02:07.500> pretty<00:02:07.920> much<00:02:08.069> the

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
Boyle's law which shows pretty much the

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.520 
Boyle's law which shows pretty much the
pressure<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.789> volume<00:02:08.910> are<00:02:09.300> inversely

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
pressure and volume are inversely

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
pressure and volume are inversely
proportional<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:11.160> we<00:02:11.280> can<00:02:11.430> see<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.879> as

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
proportional so we can see that as

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.250 
proportional so we can see that as
it<00:02:13.120> was<00:02:13.270> greater<00:02:13.510> we<00:02:13.720> get<00:02:13.870> an<00:02:13.990> additional

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
it was greater we get an additional

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.350 
it was greater we get an additional
atmosphere<00:02:15.010> of<00:02:15.130> pressure<00:02:15.340> for<00:02:15.700> every<00:02:16.000> 10

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
atmosphere of pressure for every 10

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.510 
atmosphere of pressure for every 10
meters<00:02:16.750> or<00:02:17.020> 33<00:02:17.710> feet<00:02:17.950> roughly<00:02:18.400> of<00:02:18.850> sea<00:02:19.390> water

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
meters or 33 feet roughly of sea water

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.830 
meters or 33 feet roughly of sea water
then<00:02:21.520> volume<00:02:22.360> decreases<00:02:23.520> so<00:02:24.520> if<00:02:24.940> you<00:02:25.540> hold

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
then volume decreases so if you hold

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.750 
then volume decreases so if you hold

your breath at Deathwing come up here

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.820 
your breath at Deathwing come up here
ask<00:02:28.000> long<00:02:28.300> over-expansion<00:02:29.110> injury<00:02:29.560> which<00:02:29.800> is

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
ask long over-expansion injury which is

don't<00:03:15.610> we<00:03:15.820> just<00:03:15.910> use<00:03:16.480> pure<00:03:17.410> oxygen<00:03:17.890> I<00:03:18.220> mean<00:03:18.430> we

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
don't we just use pure oxygen I mean we

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.180 
don't we just use pure oxygen I mean we
need<00:03:19.060> oxygen<00:03:19.330> and<00:03:20.080> we<00:03:20.980> use<00:03:21.250> it<00:03:21.550> up<00:03:21.790> in<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.660> body

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
need oxygen and we use it up in the body

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.760 
need oxygen and we use it up in the body
so<00:03:24.190> it<00:03:24.490> makes<00:03:24.700> perfect<00:03:24.820> sense

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
so it makes perfect sense

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.620 
so it makes perfect sense
