like<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> thin<00:00:26.760> piece<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:26.970> paper<00:00:27.470> release<00:00:28.470> it

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
like a thin piece of paper release it

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.230 
like a thin piece of paper release it
you<00:00:28.949> just<00:00:29.070> hit<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.400> black<00:00:29.609> lever<00:00:29.910> that

you just hit the black lever that

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.749 
you just hit the black lever that
releases<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:31.019> then<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.830> can<00:00:31.920> come<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.460> you

clamp with no adjustment the clamp comes

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.630 
clamp with no adjustment the clamp comes
in<00:01:08.130> two<00:01:08.280> sizes<00:01:09.080> the<00:01:10.080> clamp<00:01:10.409> here<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> 7-inch

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
in two sizes the clamp here is a 7-inch

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.750 
in two sizes the clamp here is a 7-inch
this<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> 10-inch<00:01:12.780> clamp<00:01:13.159> the<00:01:14.159> operation

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
this is a 10-inch clamp the operation

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.789 
this is a 10-inch clamp the operation
the<00:01:14.790> same<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.150> both<00:01:15.330> clamps<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.590> only

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
the same on both clamps the only

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.749 
the same on both clamps the only
difference<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.369> length<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.790> jaw<00:01:19.759> okay

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
difference is the length of the jaw okay

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.999 
difference is the length of the jaw okay
we<00:01:21.000> have<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.150> new<00:01:21.360> style<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.110> shelf<00:01:22.380> pin<00:01:22.680> jig

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
we have a new style of a shelf pin jig

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.830 
we have a new style of a shelf pin jig
it's<00:01:23.460> not<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.850> normal<00:01:24.210> jig<00:01:24.509> they've<00:01:24.720> been

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
it's not the normal jig they've been

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.899 
it's not the normal jig they've been
looking<00:01:25.170> at<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.470> last<00:01:25.680> 10<00:01:26.100> years<00:01:26.340> this

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
looking at in the last 10 years this

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.170 
looking at in the last 10 years this
one's<00:01:27.150> different<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:28.250> had<00:01:29.250> trouble<00:01:29.700> making<00:01:29.880> my

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
one's different I had trouble making my

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.840 
one's different I had trouble making my
own<00:01:30.210> cabinets<00:01:30.900> work<00:01:31.140> with<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.130> Shelf<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.640> jig

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
own cabinets work with the Shelf in jig

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.580 
own cabinets work with the Shelf in jig
that<00:01:32.880> I've<00:01:33.090> been<00:01:33.240> buying<00:01:33.479> because<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.350> pin

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
that I've been buying because the pin

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.679 
that I've been buying because the pin
holes<00:01:34.860> were<00:01:35.130> either<00:01:35.220> too<00:01:35.369> close<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:36.000> style<00:01:36.360> or

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
holes were either too close to style or

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.690 
holes were either too close to style or
they're<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.590> panel<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.280> wouldn't<00:01:38.579> work

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
they're in the panel that wouldn't work

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.640 
they're in the panel that wouldn't work
for<00:01:38.759> me<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.570> what<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.780> did<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.049> came<00:01:40.320> up<00:01:40.470> with<00:01:40.560> an

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
for me so what I did I came up with an

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.950 
for me so what I did I came up with an
idea<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:41.430> putting<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.820> third<00:01:42.060> set<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.450> holes<00:01:42.630> in

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
idea of putting a third set of holes in

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.319 
idea of putting a third set of holes in
this<00:01:43.530> third<00:01:43.860> set<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.250> holes<00:01:44.460> there<00:01:45.030> three

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
this third set of holes there three

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.210 
this third set of holes there three
quarters<00:01:45.659> from<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.930> edge<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.920> way<00:01:47.070> you're

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
quarters from the edge that way you're

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.499 
quarters from the edge that way you're
