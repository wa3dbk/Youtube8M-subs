00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:08.570
 hello to all today we are going to realize 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:11.610
 a very simple cup that smarties 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:15.389
 then now I'll show you what you are 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.749
 will serve as you see you need to 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.789
 fimo balls of various of three colors 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:24.300
 black balls two bigger one more 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.710
 small a ball of brown smoke one 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.630
 of a color you prefer in this 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.189
 In case I have this blue two big balls 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.400
 pink even if you don't see it, I'm a rose 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.290
 clear 4 small white balls and one 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.920
 a little bigger two just a little more 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.340
 smaller ones as you can see here too 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.710
 of the molds because in this case the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.280
 I will do the cupcake with the help of the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.010
 stencil 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.170
 then we put our ball 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.290
 colored inside the stencil e 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.590
 let's press 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.300
 after having pressed our ball well 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:04.320
 let's go get brown fimo this time 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:08.369
 cell apply above and start a 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:13.460
 take it to make it stick on the whole 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:16.469
 blue part once made of lives well 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.789
 we will get this thing here 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:26.189
 let's take the toothbrush let's go to 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:28.939
 tapping to make the texture one 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.609
 once we have tapped everything 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.409
 gently we go to extract the 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:38.069
 our cupcake as you see comes off 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.039
 easily at this point we go to 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:42.600
 make the cream to put on top 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.509
 sorry if sometimes it goes out of focus 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.969
 to the camera but I am with the light 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.520
 artificial unfortunately this camera 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:52.859
 makes me this effect here then in 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.859
 In this case I use the stencil and I have it 

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:57.509
 already realized you take fimo 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:59.219
 as we did for the stencil of 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.840
 put the cupcakes inside 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.729
 and then gently press on the back 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.000
 widened and do leak out and is 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.790
 out of this effect here if you want to 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.840
 a sausage you can now too 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.239
 little one 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.780
 you then roll it up towards 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.400
 the other in this way you see is also in 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.870
 In this case you can make cream in 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.370
 this way I saw that maybe not 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.599
 all have the stencil available 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:33.650
 now we come to assemble it with it 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:38.099
 then we put it in the center and 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.450
 we press lightly to do it to di vive 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.580
 well paying attention not to 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.360
 crush too much because otherwise 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:49.440
 we risk changing the design 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.819
 made with the stencil once 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.099
 he joined everything well we put it 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.930
 momentarily aside 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.140
 now let's go get ours 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.299
 balls as you see it made of these 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.120
 small dimensions that will be ours 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:06.930
 smarties once we did 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.370
 a slab we go slightly to 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.400
 crush them without exaggerating 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.440
 see in this way to leave neither 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.620
 rather often type a couple of 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.200
 millimeters and we do the same thing with 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.790
 all other colors 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.880
 once we get crushed too 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.859
 our last press the smarties 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.019
 our cupcake and let's go to 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:35.840
 position where we like most by pressing 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.840
 lightly to make them stick to the cream 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:47.900
 we also apply our last one 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:51.200
 smarties and here is ours 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:56.120
 cupcake and beautiful de corato 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:58.239
 now we need our black balls 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.569
 white that we're going to make him the face 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:06.790
 take the dots and flatten 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:10.250
 slightly and let's position them 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:14.299
 at the base of the cupcake 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:19.389
 in this way then we take the dots 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:26.810
 larger whites and position them 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:29.289
 let's take the smallest names 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:34.539
 cannes aside we do a little 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:37.190
 salamino with the other dot of smoke 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:43.450
 sorry black defeats color falls 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:53.539
 black a little bit more and helping us 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:58.030
 let's go to treat it a little bit then 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:05:04.729
 we are going to apply on ours 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:09.590
 creating in this way now with i 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:13.780
 two pink dots we go to make the 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:18.169
 cheeks in our cupcake 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:20.770
 and here is our kawaii cupcake with 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.770
 the smarties
