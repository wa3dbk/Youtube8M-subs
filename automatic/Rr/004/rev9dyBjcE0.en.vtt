00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:10.160
 Hello, today I want to show you 

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:11.680
 another recipe bait one 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.140
 cook bait 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.409
 will it not quite normal not quite 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:21.859
 habitual 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:22.599
 At the first stage, everything is as usual the basis 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:28.480
 this 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:28.480
 breadcrumbs and I dropped sides a 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:41.739
 then some hercules in general proportions 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:47.359
 no there is no exactly yes and can not be 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:51.019
 Well, usually the basis of any such dry 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:56.149
 bait make up breadcrumbs 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:01:02.449
 they naturally usually sytet times in two 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:08.800
 more than other ingredients so all 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:08.800
 depends on how you like best 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.720
 mixed a little semolina 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:23.180
 add will not be worse 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:31.149
 semolina porridge will not spoil and can be even 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:31.149
 I have a little bran here 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:48.979
 lie long ago I decided to use 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:52.000
 about him in this form balls such as 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.000
 helped a little 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:08.049
 bran so rye bran there composition 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:11.759
 rye bran sweat rye flour 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.759
 you're still a bit 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.490
 so now this unusual 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.490
 ingredient 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:48.570
 we will not dilute it with water this 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:56.340
 prikormku dilute yoghurt drinking not 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:03:00.900
 very familiar thinner but how 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.660
 it turned out the fish also do not like a fool 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.890
 dairy products 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:11.670
 this yogurt without any flavorings 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:14.280
 without any additives, I mix the bait 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.380
 at home you can do directly 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:25.530
 fishing wounds bring along yogurt and 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:28.739
 finish there smell so good i would 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:33.410
 replaced such prikormku well still in 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:38.310
 principle, you can add a little sugar 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:45.570
 now the weather is warm sweet fish too 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:49.190
 loves a little one and a half spoons 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:54.959
 knead like a normal dry bait 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:56.970
 fold principle i think you can 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.620
 use and a store today 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:04.430
 looked these yogurts there under a million 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:08.820
 different there are different additives 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:11.540
 strawberry peach and so on think 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.610
 if used by any 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:20.070
 flavoring will be fine too but i 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:25.880
 decided not to take the risk yet and took the usual 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:29.300
 yogurt without any food odors 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.300
 rather yogurt 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:50.660
 Here such a bait turned out attached 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:53.729
 well the ball and crumbles also easy 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:58.160
 Here such I would not quite normally not 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:05:00.570
