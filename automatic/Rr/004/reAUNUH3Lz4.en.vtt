00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.490
 in the rubber 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.930
 what happens facu 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:32.090
 closing shot the dogs 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:35.950
 but something 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.950
 something of bouquets what is that 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.960
 well I'll keep signing you sometimes to 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.550
 see if at least sometime life 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.930
 you can end up shooting it because 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.460
 I'm a cheese filming 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.460
 and it does not look like I'm a guy it 's big 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.790
 no not with this sense because the period 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.790
 for the house 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.630
 we are going to fall to the post called team 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.630
 of the local problems of the 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.630
 impressive 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.280
 if it does not go quiet guy 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.000
 title 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:51.240
 we do not have rotated flight 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.470
 news of the goal and the pigeon with 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.470
 shotgun up the plant a crazy 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.300
 That 's right 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:55.540
 but they have good 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:59.760
 but these dates 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.760
 It is easy 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.930
 ah 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.110
 if we did, we made a run 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.069
 the dove the flight here in this mount 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.420
 unfortunately we could not film the 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.420
 shots where you call you have 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.460
 a nice harvest I think there's like 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.680
 Many 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.690
 like 15 sticks a thing like that probably 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.150
 some nights sincerely 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.340
 contexts very well the dog a little 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.750
 anxious does not recover them between 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.570
 the bushes a tremendous chaos 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.560
 so good now we're going because 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:35.340
 we started in the morning with partridge and 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.820
 hare at sunset with pigeons and 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.930
 At nightfall, we will have some whiskers with 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.840
 the variety and it is a variety and 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.260
 it's like the forum people say how 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.260
 make a mustache
