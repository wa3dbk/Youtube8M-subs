00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
the other two little inputs which

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.869 
the other two little inputs which
obviously<00:00:52.710> aren't<00:00:52.980> going<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.309> work<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> lot

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
obviously aren't going to work on a lot

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.970 
obviously aren't going to work on a lot
of<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.059> newer<00:00:54.239> MacBook<00:00:54.690> Pros<00:00:55.020> because<00:00:55.620> we

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
of the newer MacBook Pros because we

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.569 
of the newer MacBook Pros because we
only<00:00:56.160> have<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:57.000> one<00:00:57.140> headphone<00:00:58.140> jack<00:00:58.649> which<00:00:59.489> i

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
only have the one headphone jack which i

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.580 
only have the one headphone jack which i
think<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.850> actually<00:01:00.000> also<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.780> mic<00:01:01.079> jack<00:01:01.379> like

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
think is actually also a mic jack like

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.149 
think is actually also a mic jack like
in<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> same<00:01:02.100> one<00:01:02.309> but<00:01:02.969> anyway<00:01:03.379> um<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.860> got

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
in the same one but anyway um so I got

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.490 
in the same one but anyway um so I got
kind<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.519> irritated<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:08.090> look<00:01:09.090> online<00:01:09.500> the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
kind of irritated and look online the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.940 
kind of irritated and look online the
only<00:01:10.740> thing<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.130> really<00:01:11.400> saw<00:01:11.700> was<00:01:12.950> to

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
only thing that I really saw was to

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.030 
only thing that I really saw was to
purchase<00:01:14.220> like<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.990> USB<00:01:15.990> thing<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.650> plugs<00:01:16.860> in

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
purchase like a USB thing that plugs in

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.999 
purchase like a USB thing that plugs in
that<00:01:17.189> gives<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.729> two<00:01:17.880> boards<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:19.200> that

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
that gives you the two boards so that

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.120 
that gives you the two boards so that
you<00:01:20.549> could<00:01:20.729> plug<00:01:21.030> these<00:01:21.420> two<00:01:21.770> in<00:01:23.240> also<00:01:25.100> but<00:01:26.100> I

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
you could plug these two in also but I

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.160 
you could plug these two in also but I
didn't<00:01:26.580> really<00:01:26.850> want<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.119> do<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.509> because<00:01:27.810> I

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
didn't really want to do that because I

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.840 
didn't really want to do that because I
just<00:01:28.320> feel<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:28.680> 50<00:01:29.040> bucks<00:01:29.189> on<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.820> I

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
just feel like 50 bucks on this so I

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.300 
just feel like 50 bucks on this so I
think<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.479> should<00:01:30.689> work<00:01:31.189> obviously<00:01:32.189> it

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
think that it should work obviously it

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.270 
think that it should work obviously it
does<00:01:32.460> because<00:01:32.880> I'm<00:01:33.030> recording<00:01:33.180> like<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.840> so

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
does because I'm recording like that so

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.969 
does because I'm recording like that so
wouldn't<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.369> like<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.790> know<00:01:37.700> so<00:01:38.810> I'm<00:01:39.979> going

the<00:02:54.010> way<00:02:54.040> will<00:02:54.340> for<00:02:54.549> you<00:02:54.669> yours<00:02:55.000> is<00:02:55.329> going<00:02:55.569> to

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:55.719 
the way will for you yours is going to

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:58.319 
the way will for you yours is going to
look<00:02:55.900> like<00:02:55.989> this<00:02:56.169> one<00:02:56.349> here<00:02:56.760> do<00:02:57.760> you<00:02:57.819> see<00:02:57.849> how

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
look like this one here do you see how

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.119 
look like this one here do you see how
it<00:02:58.389> says<00:02:58.629> built-in<00:02:59.079> microphone<00:02:59.680> built-in

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
it says built-in microphone built-in

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.429 
it says built-in microphone built-in
output<00:03:00.669> this<00:03:01.450> is<00:03:01.629> talking<00:03:02.049> about<00:03:02.290> your

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:02.439 
output this is talking about your

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:05.580 
output this is talking about your
headset<00:03:03.010> so<00:03:03.489> in<00:03:03.819> the<00:03:04.389> headset<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:05.019> is<00:03:05.169> built-in

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
headset so in the headset it is built-in

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.319 
headset so in the headset it is built-in
so<00:03:05.939> kind<00:03:06.939> of<00:03:07.060> weird<00:03:08.549> so<00:03:09.549> you<00:03:10.000> just<00:03:10.120> need<00:03:10.269> to

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
so kind of weird so you just need to

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:16.500 
so kind of weird so you just need to
make<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:10.689> look<00:03:10.900> like<00:03:11.530> this<00:03:12.389> and<00:03:15.510> obviously

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
make it look like this and obviously

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.119 
make it look like this and obviously
everything<00:03:16.959> you<00:03:17.049> do<00:03:17.169> saves<00:03:17.500> on<00:03:17.829> its<00:03:17.979> own

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
everything you do saves on its own

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.670 
everything you do saves on its own
because<00:03:18.690> you're<00:03:19.690> running<00:03:20.019> a<00:03:20.109> Mac<00:03:20.260> or<00:03:20.530> you

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
because you're running a Mac or you

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.300 
because you're running a Mac or you

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
through the computer okay

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.370 
through the computer okay
and<00:04:19.989> then<00:04:20.829> for<00:04:21.010> the<00:04:21.099> input<00:04:22.110> you<00:04:23.110> need<00:04:23.260> to

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
and then for the input you need to

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.850 
and then for the input you need to
choose<00:04:23.650> this<00:04:23.860> device

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
choose this device

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.260 
choose this device
and<00:04:25.759> as<00:04:26.389> you<00:04:26.810> can<00:04:26.960> see<00:04:27.199> I<00:04:27.650> don't<00:04:28.069> have<00:04:28.610> to<00:04:29.060> plug

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
and as you can see I don't have to plug

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.920 
and as you can see I don't have to plug
either<00:04:29.539> one<00:04:29.900> of<00:04:29.930> these<00:04:30.139> in<00:04:31.240> obviously<00:04:32.240> all<00:04:32.629> it

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
either one of these in obviously all it

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.110 
either one of these in obviously all it
needs<00:04:33.110> is<00:04:33.319> the<00:04:33.530> USB<00:04:33.979> port<00:04:35.229> which<00:04:36.229> is<00:04:36.259> nice<00:04:36.590> so

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
needs is the USB port which is nice so

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.070 
needs is the USB port which is nice so
you<00:04:38.120> don't<00:04:38.300> have<00:04:38.449> to<00:04:38.599> pay<00:04:38.750> for<00:04:38.810> the<00:04:39.050> other

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
you don't have to pay for the other

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:46.809 
you don't have to pay for the other
thing<00:04:39.469> because<00:04:39.830> this<00:04:40.490> will<00:04:40.939> work<00:04:45.460> yeah

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:46.819 
thing because this will work yeah

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:51.189 
thing because this will work yeah
so<00:04:48.250> make<00:04:49.250> sure<00:04:49.280> to<00:04:49.849> probably<00:04:50.389> turn<00:04:50.689> this<00:04:50.930> all

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
so make sure to probably turn this all

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:54.850 
so make sure to probably turn this all
the<00:04:51.349> way<00:04:51.469> up<00:04:52.689> which<00:04:53.689> I<00:04:53.810> thought<00:04:54.050> I<00:04:54.080> did

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
the way up which I thought I did

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.100
