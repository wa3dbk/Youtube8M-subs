00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
it very well could be I don't think it's

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.760 
it very well could be I don't think it's
likely<00:05:18.220> though<00:05:18.669> so<00:05:19.479> I<00:05:19.750> decided<00:05:20.409> to<00:05:20.500> give<00:05:20.680> him

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.200 
likely though so I decided to give him
the<00:05:20.919> benefit<00:05:21.280> of<00:05:21.340> the<00:05:21.460> doubt<00:05:21.669> and<00:05:21.729> I<00:05:22.030> guess

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
the benefit of the doubt and I guess

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.460 
the benefit of the doubt and I guess
that's<00:05:22.419> something<00:05:22.569> I<00:05:22.810> kind<00:05:23.020> of<00:05:23.080> realized
