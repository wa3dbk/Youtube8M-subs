00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399

potentially it being our last patch we
all<00:00:53.550> know<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.760> dice<00:00:54.120> loves<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.600> patch<00:00:54.809> when

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
all know that dice loves the patch when

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.200 
all know that dice loves the patch when
DLCs<00:00:56.039> come<00:00:56.280> down<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.550> pipeline<00:00:56.760> because<00:00:57.030> it

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
DLCs come down the pipeline because it

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.760 
DLCs come down the pipeline because it
saves<00:00:57.420> them<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.629> little<00:00:57.750> bit<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:57.989> money<00:00:58.140> unless

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
couple days ago I asked a question the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.030 
couple days ago I asked a question the
suppression<00:01:09.390> mechanism<00:01:10.020> what<00:01:10.409> would<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.799> do

there<00:01:44.909> was<00:01:45.060> screen<00:01:45.360> shake<00:01:45.630> before<00:01:45.810> there<00:01:46.350> was

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
there was screen shake before there was

nothing on this sort of scale so the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.370 
nothing on this sort of scale so the
players<00:01:51.270> got<00:01:51.479> used<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.869> because<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.350> a

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
players got used to it because it is a

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
boy up they added even more recoil they

added even more bullet deviation and

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
gotta tweak it all the way to the right

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.200 
gotta tweak it all the way to the right
before<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.350> figure<00:02:13.620> out<00:02:13.740> how<00:02:13.920> far<00:02:14.190> too<00:02:14.400> too

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
before you figure out how far too too

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.000 
before you figure out how far too too
far<00:02:15.450> is<00:02:15.660> so<00:02:15.870> they<00:02:15.990> quickly<00:02:16.230> backed<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.800> down

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
far is so they quickly backed it down

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.890 
far is so they quickly backed it down
and<00:02:17.310> this<00:02:17.850> is<00:02:18.030> where<00:02:18.180> we're<00:02:18.390> at<00:02:18.450> we're<00:02:18.750> at<00:02:18.870> a

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
and this is where we're at we're at a

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.900 
and this is where we're at we're at a
happy<00:02:19.110> medium<00:02:19.440> between<00:02:19.650> what<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.340> was<00:02:20.550> in<00:02:20.760> beta

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
happy medium between what it was in beta

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.640 
happy medium between what it was in beta
and<00:02:21.270> when<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.750> game<00:02:21.930> first<00:02:21.960> launched<00:02:22.560> in

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
and when the game first launched in

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.120 
and when the game first launched in
vanilla<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:24.000> horrendous<00:02:24.690> patch<00:02:25.590> God

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
vanilla and that horrendous patch God

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.420 
vanilla and that horrendous patch God
you<00:02:26.490> know<00:02:26.580> God<00:02:26.940> rested<00:02:27.390> soul<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:28.590> we<00:02:28.770> had<00:02:29.010> for

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
you know God rested soul that we had for

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.820 
you know God rested soul that we had for
quite<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:30.000> while<00:02:30.210> actually<00:02:30.570> so<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.530> question

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
quite a while actually so the question

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.430 
quite a while actually so the question
is<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.100> do<00:02:32.550> they<00:02:32.670> tweak<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.090> again<00:02:33.440> knowing

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
is this do they tweak it again knowing

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.100 
is this do they tweak it again knowing
that<00:02:34.860> they<00:02:35.010> have<00:02:35.280> eight<00:02:35.910> months<00:02:36.300> or<00:02:36.420> so<00:02:36.630> before

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
that they have eight months or so before

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.840 
that they have eight months or so before
beta<00:02:37.530> comes<00:02:37.740> out<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.190> they<00:02:38.370> have<00:02:38.400> feedback

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
beta comes out and they have feedback

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.030 
beta comes out and they have feedback
together<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.690> what<00:02:40.230> do<00:02:40.320> they<00:02:40.380> do<00:02:40.500> with<00:02:40.710> it<00:02:40.920> I

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
together and what do they do with it I

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.190

249 do you give them the ability to have

or the only kits in the game to

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.770 
or the only kits in the game to
introduce<00:03:05.190> suppression<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:05.940> think<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.660> was<00:03:06.750> a

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
introduce suppression I think that was a

a thought process beyond that in a game

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.710 
a thought process beyond that in a game

going to have it battlefield 4 but
here's<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.130> relationship<00:03:57.050> when<00:03:58.050> you<00:03:58.170> give

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
here's the relationship when you give

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.470 
here's the relationship when you give
the<00:03:58.770> power<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.400> community<00:03:59.850> to<00:04:00.120> pick<00:04:00.300> and

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
the power to the community to pick and

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.410 
the power to the community to pick and
choose<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:01.080> cream<00:04:01.380> rises<00:04:01.410> to<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.130> top<00:04:02.420> so

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
choose the cream rises to the top so

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.510 
choose the cream rises to the top so
let's<00:04:03.840> say<00:04:04.020> this<00:04:04.230> button<00:04:04.830> is<00:04:04.920> a<00:04:04.950> toggle<00:04:05.250> for

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
let's say this button is a toggle for

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.740 
let's say this button is a toggle for
the<00:04:05.610> server<00:04:05.820> admins<00:04:06.270> they<00:04:06.450> turn<00:04:06.630> off

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
the server admins they turn off

the server admins they turn off
suppression<00:04:07.290> if<00:04:07.440> it's<00:04:08.220> a<00:04:08.310> popular<00:04:08.790> game<00:04:09.060> mode

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.190 
suppression if it's a popular game mode
people<00:04:10.590> will<00:04:10.740> flock<00:04:10.920> to<00:04:11.070> it<00:04:11.310> if<00:04:11.580> not<00:04:12.420> no<00:04:13.050> one

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.260 
people will flock to it if not no one
will<00:04:13.350> use<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.800> so<00:04:13.950> it<00:04:14.070> puts<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.460> choice<00:04:14.850> back

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
on the guy center mass three meters away

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.290 
on the guy center mass three meters away
and<00:05:00.710> then<00:05:00.860> you<00:05:01.040> watch<00:05:01.220> that<00:05:01.250> bullet<00:05:01.820> tracer<00:05:02.150> go

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
and then you watch that bullet tracer go

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.140 
and then you watch that bullet tracer go
over<00:05:02.690> his<00:05:02.750> left<00:05:03.170> shoulder<00:05:03.290> and<00:05:03.920> go<00:05:04.850> hit<00:05:05.030> the

over his left shoulder and go hit the

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.600 
over his left shoulder and go hit the
moon<00:05:05.360> and<00:05:05.630> as<00:05:06.080> you<00:05:06.170> can<00:05:06.320> see<00:05:06.350> there's<00:05:07.070> a<00:05:07.130> small

moon and as you can see there's a small

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.220 
moon and as you can see there's a small
texture<00:05:08.090> glitch<00:05:08.330> here<00:05:08.570> but<00:05:08.720> this<00:05:08.840> is<00:05:08.930> a<00:05:08.990> nice

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
texture glitch here but this is a nice

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.280 
texture glitch here but this is a nice
spot<00:05:09.590> to<00:05:09.920> kind<00:05:10.670> of<00:05:10.790> watch<00:05:10.940> that<00:05:11.240> a<00:05:11.420> bomb<00:05:11.660> and

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
spot to kind of watch that a bomb and

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
just playing super defensively I'm

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.350 
just playing super defensively I'm
trying<00:05:15.980> to<00:05:16.040> inch<00:05:16.220> out<00:05:16.460> to<00:05:16.610> figure<00:05:16.880> out<00:05:17.000> where<00:05:17.330> I

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
trying to inch out to figure out where I

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.600 
trying to inch out to figure out where I
can<00:05:17.510> get<00:05:17.750> away<00:05:17.900> from<00:05:18.110> that<00:05:18.560> little<00:05:18.830> texture

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
can get away from that little texture

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.720 
can get away from that little texture
glitch<00:05:19.880> and<00:05:20.410> farmath<00:05:21.410> the<00:05:21.710> kills<00:05:21.980> I<00:05:22.340> willeth

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
glitch and farmath the kills I willeth

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.760 
glitch and farmath the kills I willeth
so<00:05:23.450> it's<00:05:23.720> about<00:05:23.900> the<00:05:24.020> only<00:05:24.050> good<00:05:24.230> thing<00:05:24.380> I<00:05:24.620> did

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
so it's about the only good thing I did

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.830 
so it's about the only good thing I did
this<00:05:24.890> entire<00:05:25.250> round<00:05:25.580> so<00:05:26.210> what<00:05:26.570> do<00:05:26.630> you<00:05:26.690> guys

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
this entire round so what do you guys

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.180 
this entire round so what do you guys
think<00:05:26.900> do<00:05:27.470> you<00:05:27.560> think<00:05:27.770> they're<00:05:27.890> gonna<00:05:27.950> mess

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
think do you think they're gonna mess

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.100 
think do you think they're gonna mess
with<00:05:28.400> suppression<00:05:28.910> I<00:05:29.030> really<00:05:29.540> do<00:05:29.720> think<00:05:29.930> they

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
with suppression I really do think they

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.690 
with suppression I really do think they
will<00:05:30.320> I'm<00:05:30.560> not<00:05:30.800> sure<00:05:30.860> the<00:05:31.220> tweak<00:05:31.430> that<00:05:31.550> they're

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700 
will I'm not sure the tweak that they're

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.970 
will I'm not sure the tweak that they're
going<00:05:31.790> to<00:05:31.850> make<00:05:32.090> but<00:05:32.750> i<00:05:32.780> think<00:05:33.140> the<00:05:33.320> the

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
going to make but i think the the

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.190 
going to make but i think the the
mechanic<00:05:34.640> the<00:05:35.030> mechanism<00:05:35.420> will<00:05:35.900> be<00:05:36.080> in

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
mechanic the mechanism will be in

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.740 
mechanic the mechanism will be in
battlefield<00:05:36.710> 4<00:05:36.790> but<00:05:37.790> hopefully<00:05:38.360> there<00:05:38.570> is<00:05:38.720> a

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
battlefield 4 but hopefully there is a

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.200 
battlefield 4 but hopefully there is a
switch<00:05:39.230> on<00:05:39.410> it<00:05:39.590> of<00:05:39.710> some<00:05:39.950> sort<00:05:40.220> so<00:05:40.490> it<00:05:40.760> gives<00:05:40.910> us

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
switch on it of some sort so it gives us

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.450 
switch on it of some sort so it gives us
the<00:05:41.510> power<00:05:41.690> of<00:05:42.050> choice<00:05:42.650> again<00:05:43.100> just<00:05:43.340> like

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
the power of choice again just like

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.950 
the power of choice again just like
they've<00:05:43.640> done<00:05:43.820> with<00:05:43.970> the<00:05:44.030> hardcore<00:05:44.510> mode<00:05:44.720> true

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
they've done with the hardcore mode true

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.080 
they've done with the hardcore mode true
hardcore<00:05:45.260> more<00:05:45.590> friendly<00:05:46.070> fire<00:05:46.280> mini-map<00:05:46.910> and
