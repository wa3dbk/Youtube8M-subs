00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.190
 this is really a 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.629
 we're going to say a rainbow vehicle 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.610
 colors change as and when 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:35.570
 degraded and frankly I find that it 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.489
 really beautiful 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.620

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.250
 in the game only had to go back up 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.559
 in the vehicle you want to change 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.879
 of color for it to work so 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.440

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.700

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.640

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.070

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.880
