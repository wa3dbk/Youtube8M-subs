00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.320 
53 and i thought it maybe just give you
the<00:00:22.439> classes<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:22.980> I've<00:00:23.160> used<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.460> most<00:00:23.609> this

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
the classes that I've used the most this

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.480 
the classes that I've used the most this
prestige<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:24.900> far<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.890> maybe<00:00:26.010> just<00:00:26.220> give<00:00:26.400> you

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
prestige so far and maybe just give you

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.589 
prestige so far and maybe just give you
a<00:00:26.550> heads<00:00:26.760> up<00:00:26.910> as<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.119> what<00:00:27.359> are<00:00:27.449> some<00:00:27.570> good

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
a heads up as to what are some good

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.660 
a heads up as to what are some good
combinations<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.769> say<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.010> start<00:00:29.400> off<00:00:29.490> with

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
combinations so I say to start off with

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.400 
combinations so I say to start off with
for<00:00:29.789> your<00:00:29.910> first<00:00:30.119> air<00:00:30.390> game<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.810> really<00:00:31.289> think

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
for your first air game I really think

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.200 
for your first air game I really think
that<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.890> first<00:00:32.219> recon<00:00:32.579> class<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.000> pretty

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
that the first recon class is pretty

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.790 
that the first recon class is pretty
good<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.510> know<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.719> UMP<00:00:34.140> will<00:00:34.290> wrap<00:00:34.469> fire

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
good you know that UMP will wrap fire

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.709 
good you know that UMP will wrap fire
you<00:00:35.370> also<00:00:35.489> have<00:00:35.640> dead<00:00:35.850> silence<00:00:36.239> on<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.510> class

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
you also have dead silence on that class

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.270 
you also have dead silence on that class
as<00:00:36.930> well<00:00:36.960> when<00:00:37.320> dead<00:00:37.530> silence<00:00:37.890> isn't<00:00:38.070> actually

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
as well when dead silence isn't actually

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.670 
as well when dead silence isn't actually
unlocked<00:00:38.700> until<00:00:38.910> level<00:00:39.180> 55<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:40.020> that's<00:00:40.469> really

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
unlocked until level 55 so that's really

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.900 
unlocked until level 55 so that's really
good<00:00:40.800> perk<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.190> if<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.460> wanting<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.730> stick

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910

good perk so if you wanting to stick
with<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.120> for<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.300> while<00:00:42.360> that's<00:00:42.600> cool<00:00:42.840> if

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
with that for a while that's cool if

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.830 
with that for a while that's cool if

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.279 
silencer i really find they were sit it
feels<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.059> much<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.629> call<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.020> for

feels so much like the call of you for
mp5<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:53.160> unreal<00:00:53.610> I've<00:00:54.090> got<00:00:54.300> cake<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.750> for

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
mp5 it's unreal I've got cake on it for

the<00:00:54.989> reduced<00:00:55.260> recoil<00:00:55.500> haven't<00:00:55.980> really<00:00:56.160> been

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
the reduced recoil haven't really been

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.680 
the reduced recoil haven't really been
experimenting<00:00:57.120> too<00:00:57.270> much<00:00:57.420> with<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
experimenting too much with the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.750 
experimenting too much with the
proficiencies<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.469> probably<00:00:58.949> should<00:00:59.190> but<00:00:59.340> kick

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
proficiencies I probably should but kick

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.189 
proficiencies I probably should but kick
is<00:00:59.940> just<00:01:00.149> something<00:01:00.300> that's<00:01:00.539> really<00:01:00.719> easy<00:01:00.960> and

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
is just something that's really easy and

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.229 
is just something that's really easy and
it<00:01:01.770> just<00:01:01.920> makes<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.160> very<00:01:02.370> easy<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.730> use<00:01:02.879> in

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
it just makes it very easy to use in

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.729 
it just makes it very easy to use in
terms<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.899> secondary<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.320> haven't<00:01:04.589> really

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
terms of the secondary I haven't really

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.530 
terms of the secondary I haven't really
used<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.010> Magnum<00:01:05.309> yet<00:01:05.489> but<00:01:05.670> any<00:01:06.180> kind<00:01:06.450> of

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
used the Magnum yet but any kind of

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.120 
used the Magnum yet but any kind of
handgun<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.080> pretty<00:01:07.320> good<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.560> notice<00:01:07.799> really

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
handgun is pretty good you notice really

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.969 
handgun is pretty good you notice really
go<00:01:08.760> quick<00:01:09.000> switch<00:01:09.420> time<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.740> if<00:01:10.830> you're

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
go quick switch time and and if you're

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.380 
go quick switch time and and if you're

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
not running slow down pro which means

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.670 
not running slow down pro which means
you're<00:01:12.570> switching<00:01:12.990> between<00:01:13.049> weapon<00:01:13.619> to

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
you're switching between weapon to

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.140 
you're switching between weapon to
quicker<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.130> think<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.729> want<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.939> go<00:01:15.000> with<00:01:15.119> a

quicker I think you want to go with a

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.060 
quicker I think you want to go with a
pistol<00:01:15.450> as<00:01:15.630> opposed<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> machine<00:01:16.619> pistol

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
kind of get up in their business I've

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.190 
kind of get up in their business I've
been<00:01:23.640> playing<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.880> lot<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.119> Kill<00:01:24.570> Confirmed<00:01:24.600> and

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
been playing a lot of Kill Confirmed and

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.480 
been playing a lot of Kill Confirmed and
I<00:01:25.259> feel<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.560> really<00:01:25.740> works<00:01:26.070> for<00:01:26.310> kill

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
I feel that really works for kill

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.390 
I feel that really works for kill
confirmed<00:01:27.110> second<00:01:28.110> perk<00:01:28.259> quick<00:01:28.590> draw<00:01:28.829> pro<00:01:29.189> I

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
confirmed second perk quick draw pro I

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.039 
confirmed second perk quick draw pro I
just<00:01:29.610> think<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> really<00:01:30.090> good<00:01:30.180> park<00:01:30.509> it

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
just think it's a really good park it

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.410 
just think it's a really good park it
takes<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.409> long<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.590> throw<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.420> concussions

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
takes so long to throw the concussions

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.539 
takes so long to throw the concussions
and<00:01:33.570> flashes<00:01:33.930> without<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.500> big<00:01:35.189> earthquake

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.370 
drill pro and then stalker pro this is
I'd<00:01:37.650> say<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.100> must<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.790> SMGs<00:01:39.659> for<00:01:40.259> me

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
I'd say it's a must on the SMGs for me

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.660 
I'd say it's a must on the SMGs for me
anyway<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.799> means<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.189> can<00:01:41.340> strafe

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
anyway it means that you can strafe

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.910 
anyway it means that you can strafe
about<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.270> much<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:43.020> move<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.380> quickly<00:01:43.590> while

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
about so much you move so quickly while

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.020 
about so much you move so quickly while
aiming<00:01:44.100> down<00:01:44.280> site<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.759> definitely

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
aiming down site and that definitely

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.639 
aiming down site and that definitely
saved<00:01:45.420> me<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.630> lots<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.049> cayenne<00:01:46.200> kills<00:01:46.470> so

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
saved me in lots of cayenne kills so

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.980 
saved me in lots of cayenne kills so

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
it was really good been experimenting

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.709 
it was really good been experimenting
with launches<00:02:05.159> trying<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.820> take<00:02:05.969> down<00:02:06.000> s<00:02:06.390> port

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
with launches trying to take down s port

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.300 
with launches trying to take down s port
for<00:02:06.899> some<00:02:06.990> extra<00:02:07.229> points<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.619> my<00:02:07.740> point<00:02:07.979> streak

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
for some extra points to my point streak

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.119 
for some extra points to my point streak
I<00:02:08.520> don't<00:02:09.479> like<00:02:09.569> i<00:02:09.869> have<00:02:10.110> installed<00:02:10.410> pro<00:02:10.800> for

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
I don't like i have installed pro for

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.270 
I don't like i have installed pro for
the<00:02:11.220> assault<00:02:11.520> rifles<00:02:11.879> for<00:02:12.150> some<00:02:12.300> reason

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
the assault rifles for some reason

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.520 
the assault rifles for some reason
30<00:02:13.550> I've<00:02:13.970> gone<00:02:14.150> with<00:02:14.330> sitrep<00:02:14.660> here<00:02:14.840> but<00:02:15.470> again

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
30 I've gone with sitrep here but again

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.559 
30 I've gone with sitrep here but again
the<00:02:15.770> third<00:02:15.920> tier<00:02:16.100> is<00:02:16.190> up<00:02:16.310> to<00:02:16.430> you<00:02:16.550> I<00:02:16.760> really

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
the third tier is up to you I really

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.180 
the third tier is up to you I really
think<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.840> Recon<00:02:18.170> pro<00:02:18.380> is<00:02:18.620> probably<00:02:18.980> one<00:02:19.160> of

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
think the Recon pro is probably one of

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.130 
think the Recon pro is probably one of
the<00:02:19.280> best<00:02:19.370> parts<00:02:19.700> in<00:02:19.850> tier<00:02:20.420> 1<00:02:20.630> by<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:20.870> long<00:02:21.110> shot

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
the best parts in tier 1 by a long shot

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.080 
the best parts in tier 1 by a long shot
you<00:02:21.890> know<00:02:22.010> so<00:02:22.190> many<00:02:22.250> times<00:02:22.520> you<00:02:22.670> can<00:02:22.940> just

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
you know so many times you can just

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.790 
you know so many times you can just
flash<00:02:23.300> an<00:02:23.450> enemy<00:02:23.720> they'll<00:02:23.959> be<00:02:24.319> on<00:02:24.560> the

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
flash an enemy they'll be on the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.680 
flash an enemy they'll be on the
mini-map<00:02:25.100> until<00:02:25.550> they<00:02:25.670> regenerate<00:02:26.569> their

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
mini-map until they regenerate their

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.940 
mini-map until they regenerate their
health<00:02:26.870> also<00:02:27.230> if<00:02:27.350> you<00:02:27.380> click<00:02:27.470> them<00:02:27.800> with<00:02:27.920> a

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
health also if you click them with a

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.290 
health also if you click them with a
bullet<00:02:28.190> when<00:02:28.520> you've<00:02:28.670> actually<00:02:28.790> got<00:02:29.030> recon

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
bullet when you've actually got recon

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.880 
bullet when you've actually got recon
pro<00:02:29.569> so<00:02:30.140> I<00:02:30.170> think<00:02:30.290> that's<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.590> really<00:02:30.770> great

pro so I think that's a really great
perk<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.430> then<00:02:31.670> quick-draw<00:02:32.060> pro<00:02:32.270> again<00:02:32.569> just

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
perk and then quick-draw pro again just

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.479 
perk and then quick-draw pro again just

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
in a lot of gun fights with that fast

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.860 
in a lot of gun fights with that fast

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
gun for the I think it's the Delta kind

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.870 
gun for the I think it's the Delta kind
of<00:02:48.170> reticle<00:02:48.860> I<00:02:48.980> really<00:02:49.400> like<00:02:49.489> that<00:02:49.640> one<00:02:49.700> the
