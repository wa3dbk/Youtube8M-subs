00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
five and six except etcetera now I could

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.630 
five and six except etcetera now I could
hide<00:01:10.640> all<00:01:11.030> these<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:11.690> select<00:01:12.080> one<00:01:12.470> and<00:01:12.800> I<00:01:13.310> can't

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
hide all these to select one and I can't

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.640 
hide all these to select one and I can't
see<00:01:13.880> one<00:01:14.150> right<00:01:14.390> now<00:01:14.660> I'm<00:01:15.230> going<00:01:15.439> to<00:01:15.530> select

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
see one right now I'm going to select

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.210 
see one right now I'm going to select
one<00:01:16.250> and<00:01:16.960> basically<00:01:17.960> one<00:01:18.290> is<00:01:18.439> so<00:01:18.619> active<00:01:18.829> I'm

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
one and basically one is so active I'm

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.740 
one and basically one is so active I'm
going<00:01:19.880> to<00:01:20.090> basically<00:01:20.570> move<00:01:21.100> this<00:01:22.299> marker<00:01:23.299> to

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
going to basically move this marker to

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.440 
going to basically move this marker to
where<00:01:23.930> I<00:01:23.990> want<00:01:24.439> one<00:01:25.280> to<00:01:25.670> be<00:01:25.970> when<00:01:26.390> the

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
where I want one to be when the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.469 
where I want one to be when the
animation<00:01:27.200> stops<00:01:27.890> image<00:01:28.369> one's<00:01:28.729> going<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:29.210> be

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
animation stops image one's going to be

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.859 
animation stops image one's going to be
at<00:01:29.720> this<00:01:30.649> point<00:01:30.950> in<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:31.220> animation<00:01:31.549> stops<00:01:32.060> so

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
at this point in the animation stops so

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.630 
at this point in the animation stops so
I<00:01:32.899> could<00:01:33.079> take<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.350> marker<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.100> drag<00:01:34.520> the

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
I could take the marker and drag the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.410 
I could take the marker and drag the
marker<00:01:34.850> to<00:01:35.329> hear<00:01:36.130> roughly<00:01:37.130> short<00:01:37.640> of<00:01:37.790> one

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
marker to hear roughly short of one

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.899 
marker to hear roughly short of one
second<00:01:38.960> then<00:01:39.500> I<00:01:39.590> could<00:01:39.770> take<00:01:39.890> exciter<00:01:40.670> because

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
second then I could take exciter because

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.490 
second then I could take exciter because
he<00:01:41.030> I<00:01:41.060> can't<00:01:41.390> really<00:01:41.600> select<00:01:42.079> it<00:01:42.229> because<00:01:42.380> it's

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
he I can't really select it because it's

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.440 
he I can't really select it because it's
behind<00:01:42.740> everything<00:01:43.159> well<00:01:43.880> it<00:01:43.969> technically<00:01:44.299> is
