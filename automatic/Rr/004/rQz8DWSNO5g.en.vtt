00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.520 

I<00:00:16.440> think<00:00:17.440> the<00:00:17.560> teaching<00:00:17.920> of<00:00:18.010> writing<00:00:18.220> is<00:00:18.520> is

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:19.530 
I think the teaching of writing is is

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.960 
I think the teaching of writing is is
challenging<00:00:20.530> especially<00:00:21.190> in<00:00:21.550> the<00:00:21.610> primary

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
challenging especially in the primary

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.240 
challenging especially in the primary
grades<00:00:22.240> because<00:00:22.570> students<00:00:23.500> come<00:00:23.680> to<00:00:23.770> with

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
grades because students come to with

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.580 
grades because students come to with
such<00:00:24.490> a<00:00:24.520> range<00:00:25.029> of<00:00:25.270> understanding<00:00:25.960> and<00:00:26.140> a

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
such a range of understanding and a

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.710 
such a range of understanding and a
range<00:00:26.920> of<00:00:27.160> abilities<00:00:27.670> and<00:00:27.850> it's<00:00:28.330> hard<00:00:28.600> for

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
range of abilities and it's hard for

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.780 
range of abilities and it's hard for
teachers<00:00:29.230> if<00:00:29.860> it's<00:00:30.010> hard<00:00:30.250> for<00:00:30.370> us<00:00:30.430> to<00:00:30.490> get<00:00:30.670> our

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:30.790 
teachers if it's hard for us to get our

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.810 
teachers if it's hard for us to get our
head<00:00:31.060> around<00:00:31.090> how<00:00:31.840> to<00:00:32.349> teach<00:00:32.860> all<00:00:33.340> of<00:00:33.400> those

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
head around how to teach all of those

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.580 
head around how to teach all of those
different<00:00:34.059> children<00:00:34.660> in<00:00:34.840> different<00:00:35.440> places

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
different children in different places

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.740 
different children in different places
simultaneously<00:00:36.330> that's<00:00:37.330> our<00:00:37.480> writers

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
simultaneously that's our writers

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.229 
simultaneously that's our writers
workshop<00:00:37.989> works<00:00:38.680> beautifully<00:00:39.309> because<00:00:40.000> you

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
workshop works beautifully because you

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.210 
workshop works beautifully because you
really<00:00:40.510> can<00:00:40.690> meet<00:00:40.870> the<00:00:40.960> needs<00:00:41.199> it's<00:00:41.770> a<00:00:41.949> very

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
really can meet the needs it's a very

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.040 
really can meet the needs it's a very
best<00:00:42.550> form<00:00:42.790> of<00:00:42.910> differentiation<00:00:43.510> you<00:00:43.870> can

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
best form of differentiation you can

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.990 
best form of differentiation you can
meet<00:00:44.260> the<00:00:44.410> needs<00:00:45.040> of<00:00:45.160> all<00:00:45.400> of<00:00:45.430> your<00:00:45.670> students

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
meet the needs of all of your students

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.750 
meet the needs of all of your students
wherever<00:00:46.150> they<00:00:46.510> happen<00:00:46.720> to<00:00:46.900> be<00:00:47.050> I<00:00:47.409> also<00:00:48.280> think

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
wherever they happen to be I also think

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.869 
wherever they happen to be I also think
that<00:00:49.000> if<00:00:49.330> teachers<00:00:49.629> are<00:00:50.019> not<00:00:50.350> writers<00:00:50.879> that

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
that if teachers are not writers that

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:53.939 
that if teachers are not writers that
presents<00:00:52.659> a<00:00:52.930> particular<00:00:53.170> challenge<00:00:53.800> I

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
presents a particular challenge I

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:55.770 
presents a particular challenge I
recommend<00:00:54.309> that<00:00:54.580> teachers<00:00:54.970> write<00:00:55.300> with<00:00:55.600> their

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
recommend that teachers write with their

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.479 
recommend that teachers write with their
students<00:00:56.140> the<00:00:56.650> first<00:00:56.890> five<00:00:57.129> or<00:00:57.309> ten<00:00:57.460> minutes

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
students the first five or ten minutes

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.570 
students the first five or ten minutes
every<00:00:58.180> day<00:00:58.210> in<00:00:58.659> Writers<00:00:59.320> Workshop<00:00:59.350> and<00:00:59.890> that

colleagues<00:05:25.919> and<00:05:26.159> we<00:05:26.570> inspire<00:05:27.570> them<00:05:27.870> to

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
colleagues and we inspire them to

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.409 
colleagues and we inspire them to
communicate<00:05:28.199> and<00:05:28.860> we<00:05:29.130> build<00:05:29.460> on<00:05:29.729> what<00:05:30.180> they

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
communicate and we build on what they

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.850 
communicate and we build on what they
come<00:05:31.490> knowing<00:05:32.990> rather<00:05:33.990> than<00:05:34.289> you<00:05:34.740> know

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
this i think really slows down both
