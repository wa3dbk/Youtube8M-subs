00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.310 
remember Kobayashi is an eating machine
he's<00:01:30.729> got<00:01:30.970> a<00:01:31.000> formula<00:01:31.420> down<00:01:31.780> where<00:01:32.020> he<00:01:32.110> just

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
he's got a formula down where he just

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.950
