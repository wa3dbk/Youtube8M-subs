now our potatoes have cooled down

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.289 
now our potatoes have cooled down
they're<00:01:51.770> not<00:01:51.799> completely<00:01:52.430> cool<00:01:52.670> but<00:01:53.119> I'm<00:01:53.210> just

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
they're not completely cool but I'm just

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.300 
they're not completely cool but I'm just
going<00:01:53.509> to<00:01:53.540> cut<00:01:53.750> these<00:01:53.899> in<00:01:54.079> half<00:01:54.110> on<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.649> long

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
going to cut these in half on the long

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.030 
going to cut these in half on the long
edge<00:01:55.579> like<00:01:55.939> that<00:01:55.970> and<00:01:56.560> then<00:01:57.560> what<00:01:57.740> we're<00:01:57.890> going

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040
