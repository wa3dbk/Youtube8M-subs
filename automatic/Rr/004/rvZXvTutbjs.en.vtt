an ILS approach or is that only in bad
weather<00:01:00.589> I'm<00:01:01.370> here<00:01:01.640> I<00:01:01.969> unless<00:01:02.359> this<00:01:02.510> is<00:01:02.719> very

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289

weather I'm here I unless this is very
very<00:01:03.680> standard<00:01:03.890> I'm<00:01:04.189> saying<00:01:04.489> most<00:01:05.390> of<00:01:05.509> the

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
very standard I'm saying most of the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.170 
very standard I'm saying most of the
time<00:01:05.750> finalists<00:01:06.320> produce<00:01:06.799> is<00:01:06.920> quite<00:01:07.130> safe<00:01:07.729> is

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
time finalists produce is quite safe is

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.539 
time finalists produce is quite safe is
straightforward<00:01:09.170> also<00:01:09.979> good<00:01:10.100> for<00:01:10.220> you<00:01:10.310> see

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
straightforward also good for you see

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.639 
straightforward also good for you see
they<00:01:10.700> only<00:01:10.729> kept<00:01:11.090> can<00:01:11.299> plane<00:01:12.140> soon<00:01:12.380> really

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
they only kept can plane soon really

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:15.820 
they only kept can plane soon really
quickly<00:01:12.950> after<00:01:13.070> each<00:01:13.310> other<00:01:13.780> yeah<00:01:14.780> it's<00:01:15.770> a

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
quickly after each other yeah it's a

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.230 
quickly after each other yeah it's a
mining<00:01:16.159> country<00:01:16.280> there<00:01:16.789> it's<00:01:16.909> going<00:01:17.060> to<00:01:17.119> be

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
mining country there it's going to be

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.639 
mining country there it's going to be
the<00:01:17.630> main<00:01:17.780> runner<00:01:18.020> is<00:01:18.140> going<00:01:18.289> to<00:01:18.350> be<00:01:18.409> closed

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
the main runner is going to be closed

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:20.620 
the main runner is going to be closed
because<00:01:18.979> they're<00:01:19.610> doing<00:01:19.820> some<00:01:20.000> resurfacing

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
because they're doing some resurfacing

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.179 
because they're doing some resurfacing
work<00:01:20.780> so<00:01:21.350> we're<00:01:21.470> going<00:01:21.560> to<00:01:21.649> land<00:01:21.770> on<00:01:21.860> this<00:01:21.950> fair

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
work so we're going to land on this fair

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.109 
work so we're going to land on this fair
one<00:01:22.369> way<00:01:22.549> which<00:01:23.299> is<00:01:23.509> doesn't<00:01:24.049> have<00:01:24.229> an<00:01:24.320> ILS<00:01:25.119> so

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
one way which is doesn't have an ILS so

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.020 
one way which is doesn't have an ILS so
we're<00:01:26.240> doing<00:01:26.360> sort<00:01:26.869> of<00:01:26.929> GPS<00:01:27.409> approach<00:01:27.970> okay<00:01:28.970> so

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
we're doing sort of GPS approach okay so

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.050 
we're doing sort of GPS approach okay so
it's<00:01:29.659> got<00:01:29.750> a<00:01:29.810> higher<00:01:29.960> minimum<00:01:30.789> what<00:01:31.789> is<00:01:31.909> the

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
it's got a higher minimum what is the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.499 
it's got a higher minimum what is the
GPS<00:01:32.240> approach<00:01:32.780> um<00:01:33.319> is<00:01:33.979> it<00:01:34.159> when<00:01:34.340> you<00:01:34.509> saw

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
GPS approach um is it when you saw

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.279 
GPS approach um is it when you saw
actually<00:01:35.899> done<00:01:36.050> it<00:01:37.119> is<00:01:38.119> we<00:01:38.539> just<00:01:38.659> have<00:01:38.750> a<00:01:39.110> green

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
actually done it is we just have a green

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.639 
actually done it is we just have a green
light

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
light

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.330

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
if you monitor the GPS that is locked

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.690 
if you monitor the GPS that is locked
into<00:01:45.520> okay<00:01:46.520> make<00:01:47.060> sure<00:01:47.240> that<00:01:48.340> it's<00:01:49.340> in<00:01:49.549> the
