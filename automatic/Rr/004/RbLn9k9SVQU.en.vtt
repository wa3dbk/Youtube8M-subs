this battery life I've been using this
phone<00:02:36.970> since<00:02:37.720> about<00:02:37.960> eight<00:02:38.140> a.m.<00:02:38.770> and<00:02:39.160> we're

that<00:03:42.790> white<00:03:43.000> space<00:03:43.300> same<00:03:44.170> as<00:03:44.380> on<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.920> galaxy

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370

that white space same as on the galaxy
s3<00:03:45.820> now<00:03:46.690> we<00:03:46.750> can<00:03:47.200> zoom<00:03:47.830> in<00:03:48.040> and<00:03:48.540> galaxy<00:03:49.540> s3

s3 now we can zoom in and galaxy s3
cleared<00:03:50.080> up<00:03:50.200> faster<00:03:50.680> there<00:03:50.890> and<00:03:51.130> that<00:03:51.970> was

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
cleared up faster there and that was

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.000 
cleared up faster there and that was
actually<00:03:52.300> at<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:52.810> same<00:03:53.050> time<00:03:53.290> let's<00:03:53.830> click

onto a link and see which device gets to
a<00:03:56.620> link<00:03:57.100> faster<00:03:58.060> so<00:03:58.180> we're<00:03:58.270> gonna<00:03:58.360> move<00:03:58.450> over

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
a link faster so we're gonna move over

where<00:04:07.090> are<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.269> same<00:04:07.450> Wi-Fi<00:04:07.660> network<00:04:07.900> here

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.650 
where are the same Wi-Fi network here
looks<00:04:09.310> like<00:04:09.459> the<00:04:09.550> galaxy<00:04:09.910> s3<00:04:10.150> is<00:04:10.209> slightly

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
looks like the galaxy s3 is slightly

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.210 
looks like the galaxy s3 is slightly
ahead<00:04:12.930> okay<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:14.050> galaxy<00:04:14.380> s3<00:04:14.650> actually<00:04:15.040> one

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
ahead okay the galaxy s3 actually one

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.640 
ahead okay the galaxy s3 actually one
which<00:04:15.430> is<00:04:15.550> surprising<00:04:16.120> because<00:04:16.230> my<00:04:17.230> previous

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
which is surprising because my previous

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.770 
which is surprising because my previous
tests<00:04:18.070> were<00:04:18.190> showing<00:04:18.549> that<00:04:18.730> the<00:04:18.880> HTC<00:04:19.450> One<00:04:19.630> X

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
tests were showing that the HTC One X

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.159 
tests were showing that the HTC One X
was<00:04:20.049> winning<00:04:20.380> so<00:04:21.340> let's<00:04:21.520> go<00:04:21.729> back<00:04:22.169> another

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
was winning so let's go back another

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:24.210 
was winning so let's go back another
thing<00:04:23.350> I<00:04:23.440> should<00:04:23.500> mention

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
thing I should mention

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.730 
thing I should mention
in<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.490> cyanogenmod<00:04:25.210> 10<00:04:25.510> and<00:04:25.780> and<00:04:26.410> nine

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
in the cyanogenmod 10 and and nine

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.390 
in the cyanogenmod 10 and and nine
actually<00:04:27.340> for<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.210> for<00:04:28.540> the<00:04:28.570> 1x<00:04:29.140> you<00:04:29.890> get<00:04:30.370> a

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
actually for the for the 1x you get a

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.240 
actually for the for the 1x you get a
remapping<00:04:30.970> of<00:04:31.330> these<00:04:31.510> buttons<00:04:31.780> so<00:04:32.320> that<00:04:32.560> will

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
remapping of these buttons so that will

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.390 
remapping of these buttons so that will
go<00:04:33.370> back<00:04:33.550> home<00:04:33.730> this<00:04:34.570> button<00:04:34.900> here<00:04:34.930> usually

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
go back home this button here usually

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.070 
go back home this button here usually
assigned<00:04:36.400> to<00:04:36.580> multitask<00:04:37.060> now<00:04:37.330> opens<00:04:37.720> menu

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
assigned to multitask now opens menu

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.140 
assigned to multitask now opens menu
that<00:04:38.590> is<00:04:38.830> so<00:04:39.040> that<00:04:39.160> you<00:04:39.220> don't<00:04:39.490> get<00:04:39.640> that<00:04:39.820> strip

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
that is so that you don't get that strip

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.640 
that is so that you don't get that strip
along<00:04:40.390> the<00:04:40.450> bottom<00:04:40.720> that<00:04:40.960> takes<00:04:41.200> up<00:04:41.380> precious

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
along the bottom that takes up precious

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.230 
along the bottom that takes up precious
screen<00:04:42.040> space<00:04:42.280> so<00:04:42.820> you<00:04:42.880> might<00:04:43.120> be<00:04:43.150> thinking

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
screen space so you might be thinking

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.390 
screen space so you might be thinking
where<00:04:43.720> is<00:04:43.960> multitask<00:04:44.620> well<00:04:44.920> that's<00:04:45.100> a<00:04:45.190> tap<00:04:45.370> and

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
where is multitask well that's a tap and

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.670 
where is multitask well that's a tap and
hold<00:04:45.700> of<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.060> home<00:04:46.210> button<00:04:46.420> just<00:04:47.110> as<00:04:47.290> you're

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
hold of the home button just as you're

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.400 
hold of the home button just as you're
used<00:04:47.890> to<00:04:48.070> so<00:04:48.760> let's<00:04:48.910> test<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.510> speed<00:04:49.840> of<00:04:50.110> going

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
used to so let's test the speed of going

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.730 
used to so let's test the speed of going
back<00:04:50.560> home<00:04:51.540> slightly<00:04:52.540> faster<00:04:52.780> on<00:04:53.080> the<00:04:53.170> 1x<00:04:53.530> but

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
back home slightly faster on the 1x but

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.420 
back home slightly faster on the 1x but
really<00:04:53.950> we're<00:04:54.250> talking<00:04:54.280> you<00:04:55.030> know<00:04:56.430> negligible

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
really we're talking you know negligible

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.180 
really we're talking you know negligible
amounts<00:04:57.910> of<00:04:58.000> time<00:04:58.150> let's<00:04:58.300> try<00:04:58.450> that<00:04:58.570> again<00:04:58.630> I

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
amounts of time let's try that again I

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.980 
amounts of time let's try that again I
kind<00:05:00.190> of<00:05:00.250> did<00:05:00.400> a<00:05:00.430> little<00:05:00.640> delay<00:05:00.970> there<00:05:01.240> let's

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
kind of did a little delay there let's

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.500 
kind of did a little delay there let's
go<00:05:02.170> back<00:05:02.470> in<00:05:04.170> one<00:05:05.170> more<00:05:05.380> time<00:05:06.030> okay<00:05:07.030> the<00:05:07.180> 1x

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
go back in one more time okay the 1x

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.850 
go back in one more time okay the 1x
slightly<00:05:08.080> faster<00:05:08.290> they're<00:05:08.650> opening<00:05:09.250> folders

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
slightly faster they're opening folders

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.980 
slightly faster they're opening folders
it's<00:05:11.860> really<00:05:12.070> hard<00:05:12.220> to<00:05:12.550> tell<00:05:12.790> but<00:05:13.060> the<00:05:13.180> 1x<00:05:13.540> if

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
it's really hard to tell but the 1x if

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.659 
it's really hard to tell but the 1x if
you<00:05:14.110> do<00:05:14.260> it<00:05:14.350> at<00:05:14.440> the<00:05:14.500> same<00:05:14.620> time<00:05:14.830> the<00:05:15.220> one<00:05:15.370> is<00:05:15.490> in

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
you do it at the same time the one is in

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.480 
you do it at the same time the one is in
when<00:05:15.850> X<00:05:15.970> is<00:05:16.060> actually<00:05:17.010> slightly<00:05:18.010> faster

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
when X is actually slightly faster

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.030 
when X is actually slightly faster
they're<00:05:18.940> probably<00:05:19.180> on<00:05:19.450> par<00:05:19.900> in<00:05:20.200> in<00:05:20.470> probably

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
they're probably on par in in probably

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.700 
they're probably on par in in probably
fifty<00:05:21.550> percent<00:05:21.820> of<00:05:21.940> situations<00:05:22.570> the<00:05:23.020> 1x<00:05:23.440> seems

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
fifty percent of situations the 1x seems

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.960 
fifty percent of situations the 1x seems
to<00:05:23.860> be<00:05:23.950> faster<00:05:24.160> but<00:05:24.370> it<00:05:24.520> doesn't<00:05:24.880> really

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
to be faster but it doesn't really

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.280 
to be faster but it doesn't really
matter<00:05:25.180> because<00:05:25.480> both<00:05:25.780> of<00:05:25.810> these<00:05:26.020> devices

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
matter because both of these devices

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.940 
matter because both of these devices
with<00:05:27.070> cyanogenmod<00:05:27.850> ten<00:05:28.210> are<00:05:28.419> crazy<00:05:29.320> fast<00:05:29.650> and

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
with cyanogenmod ten are crazy fast and

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.950 
with cyanogenmod ten are crazy fast and
of<00:05:30.040> course<00:05:30.220> with<00:05:30.370> cyanogenmod<00:05:30.970> ten<00:05:31.270> you<00:05:31.780> get<00:05:31.930> a

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
of course with cyanogenmod ten you get a

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.570 
of course with cyanogenmod ten you get a
lot<00:05:32.230> of<00:05:32.260> cool<00:05:32.530> features<00:05:32.560> that<00:05:33.070> you<00:05:33.190> can<00:05:33.340> tweak

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
lot of cool features that you can tweak

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.970 
lot of cool features that you can tweak
so<00:05:34.270> let's<00:05:34.419> get<00:05:34.540> the<00:05:34.720> galaxy<00:05:35.380> s3<00:05:35.650> out<00:05:35.770> of<00:05:35.890> the

so let's get the galaxy s3 out of the

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.070 
so let's get the galaxy s3 out of the
way<00:05:36.130> we'll<00:05:36.340> zoom<00:05:36.370> in<00:05:36.610> on<00:05:36.700> the<00:05:36.790> screen<00:05:37.060> we<00:05:37.960> don't

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
shows up up here in the clock we can

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.969 
shows up up here in the clock we can
change<00:05:55.270> the<00:05:55.690> battery<00:05:56.050> percentage<00:05:56.260> whether<00:05:56.830> we

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
change the battery percentage whether we

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:58.710 
change the battery percentage whether we
want<00:05:57.160> to<00:05:57.220> have<00:05:57.370> the<00:05:57.490> battery<00:05:57.700> hidden<00:05:58.180> or<00:05:58.690> a

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
want to have the battery hidden or a

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.120 
want to have the battery hidden or a
percentage<00:05:59.050> which<00:05:59.350> is<00:05:59.470> always<00:05:59.620> nice<00:05:59.860> and

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
percentage which is always nice and

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.240 
percentage which is always nice and
we've<00:06:01.030> got<00:06:01.330> other<00:06:01.660> other<00:06:02.620> options<00:06:03.070> down<00:06:03.190> here

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
we've got other other options down here

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.460 
we've got other other options down here
for<00:06:03.550> performance<00:06:04.060> we<00:06:04.210> can<00:06:04.390> change<00:06:04.660> that<00:06:04.960> the

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
for performance we can change that the

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.040 
for performance we can change that the
processor<00:06:06.460> clocking<00:06:06.940> and<00:06:07.150> here's<00:06:07.690> a<00:06:07.750> really

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
processor clocking and here's a really

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.900 
processor clocking and here's a really
cool<00:06:08.350> feature<00:06:08.530> I<00:06:08.919> actually<00:06:09.070> just<00:06:09.400> discovered

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
cool feature I actually just discovered

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.659 
cool feature I actually just discovered
of<00:06:10.169> cyanogenmod<00:06:11.169> 10<00:06:11.410> if<00:06:11.590> you<00:06:11.800> go<00:06:12.070> to<00:06:12.130> language

and input and you go to the settings and

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.280 
and input and you go to the settings and
down<00:06:15.340> here<00:06:15.580> to<00:06:15.729> advanced<00:06:16.240> you<00:06:16.870> can<00:06:17.050> actually

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.290 
down here to advanced you can actually

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.490 
down here to advanced you can actually
change<00:06:17.890> the<00:06:18.540> vibration<00:06:19.540> duration<00:06:20.350> in

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
change the vibration duration in

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.550 
change the vibration duration in
milliseconds<00:06:20.979> for<00:06:21.400> the<00:06:21.520> keyboard<00:06:22.200> by<00:06:23.200> default

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
milliseconds for the keyboard by default

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.960 
milliseconds for the keyboard by default
most<00:06:23.890> keyboards<00:06:24.130> have<00:06:24.460> this<00:06:24.580> little<00:06:24.700> bit<00:06:24.880> of

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:24.970 
most keyboards have this little bit of

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.150 
most keyboards have this little bit of
tactile<00:06:25.330> feedback<00:06:25.570> some<00:06:26.410> devices<00:06:26.650> it's<00:06:26.979> way

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 
tactile feedback some devices it's way

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.580 
tactile feedback some devices it's way
too<00:06:27.220> much<00:06:27.550> it<00:06:27.760> feels<00:06:27.910> weird<00:06:28.270> but<00:06:29.050> with<00:06:29.229> with

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
too much it feels weird but with with

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.010 
too much it feels weird but with with
this<00:06:29.860> with<00:06:30.790> with<00:06:30.970> cyanogenmod<00:06:31.570> 10<00:06:31.810> and

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
this with with cyanogenmod 10 and

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.140 
this with with cyanogenmod 10 and
previous<00:06:32.320> versions<00:06:32.650> of<00:06:32.849> cyanogenmod<00:06:33.849> you<00:06:34.000> can

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
previous versions of cyanogenmod you can

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.650 
previous versions of cyanogenmod you can
change<00:06:34.510> that<00:06:34.810> to<00:06:35.440> a<00:06:35.470> very<00:06:35.770> granular

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
change that to a very granular

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.690 
change that to a very granular
so<00:06:36.960> I've<00:06:37.080> got<00:06:37.230> a<00:06:37.260> perfect<00:06:37.650> 19<00:06:37.920> millisecond<00:06:38.520> set

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:38.700 
so I've got a perfect 19 millisecond set

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.850 
so I've got a perfect 19 millisecond set
