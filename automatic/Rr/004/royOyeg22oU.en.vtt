windows search they can't seem to find

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.100 
windows search they can't seem to find
it<00:02:37.370> on<00:02:37.489> their<00:02:37.610> computer<00:02:38.150> it's<00:02:38.870> there

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
it on their computer it's there

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.630 
it on their computer it's there
somewhere<00:02:39.349> because<00:02:39.890> otherwise<00:02:40.159> you<00:02:40.430> can't

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
somewhere because otherwise you can't

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.190 
somewhere because otherwise you can't
launch<00:02:40.819> the<00:02:41.030> game<00:02:41.150> it's<00:02:41.360> got<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:41.930> be<00:02:42.019> there

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
launch the game it's got to be there

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.410 
launch the game it's got to be there
somewhere<00:02:42.650> so<00:02:44.200> one<00:02:45.200> easy<00:02:45.530> way<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.680> do<00:02:45.890> that

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
somewhere so one easy way to do that

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.150 
somewhere so one easy way to do that
would<00:02:47.420> be<00:02:47.450> just<00:02:47.959> go<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:48.620> your<00:02:48.769> Program<00:02:49.129> Files

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
would be just go to your Program Files

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.119 
would be just go to your Program Files
folder<00:02:49.970> like<00:02:50.690> in<00:02:51.109> my<00:02:51.260> case<00:02:51.319> I<00:02:51.680> have<00:02:51.769> to<00:02:51.950> i<00:02:51.980> have

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
folder like in my case I have to i have

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.710 
folder like in my case I have to i have
x86<00:02:53.030> which<00:02:53.450> is<00:02:53.660> my<00:02:54.849> 32-bit<00:02:55.849> applications<00:02:56.540> and

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
x86 which is my 32-bit applications and

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.180 
x86 which is my 32-bit applications and
then<00:02:56.810> there's<00:02:56.989> just<00:02:57.200> regular<00:02:57.560> Program<00:02:57.920> Files

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
then there's just regular Program Files

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.069 
then there's just regular Program Files
which<00:02:58.670> is<00:02:59.109> your<00:03:00.109> 64-bit<00:03:00.859> stuff<00:03:01.810> depending<00:03:02.810> on

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
which is your 64-bit stuff depending on

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.140 
which is your 64-bit stuff depending on
your<00:03:03.230> system<00:03:03.500> if<00:03:03.950> you<00:03:04.400> have<00:03:04.519> a<00:03:04.549> 64-bit

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
your system if you have a 64-bit

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.970 
your system if you have a 64-bit
operating<00:03:05.629> system<00:03:06.079> or<00:03:06.200> not<00:03:06.319> you<00:03:06.650> might<00:03:06.769> not

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
operating system or not you might not

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.210 
operating system or not you might not
have<00:03:07.159> both<00:03:07.400> of<00:03:07.430> them<00:03:07.700> so<00:03:09.970> if<00:03:10.970> you<00:03:11.690> do<00:03:12.220> search

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
have both of them so if you do search

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.059 
have both of them so if you do search
right<00:03:13.790> in<00:03:13.940> this<00:03:14.060> folder<00:03:14.709> search<00:03:15.709> for<00:03:15.950> your

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
right in this folder search for your

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:22.240 
right in this folder search for your
trucks<00:03:16.430> to<00:03:16.579> exe<00:03:18.669> and<00:03:20.620> bang<00:03:21.620> there<00:03:21.859> it<00:03:21.950> is<00:03:22.069> right

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
trucks to exe and bang there it is right

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.180 
trucks to exe and bang there it is right
there<00:03:22.419> immediately<00:03:23.709> it'll<00:03:24.709> speed<00:03:24.919> up<00:03:25.069> the

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
there immediately it'll speed up the

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.280 
there immediately it'll speed up the
time<00:03:25.400> it's<00:03:25.940> in<00:03:26.090> your<00:03:26.269> it's<00:03:26.660> more<00:03:26.989> than<00:03:27.109> likely

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
time it's in your it's more than likely

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.740 
time it's in your it's more than likely
in<00:03:27.530> your<00:03:27.650> program<00:03:27.980> file<00:03:28.220> somewhere<00:03:28.549> so<00:03:29.000> if<00:03:29.599> you

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
in your program file somewhere so if you

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.319 
in your program file somewhere so if you
do<00:03:29.870> that<00:03:30.019> it<00:03:30.200> only<00:03:30.319> has<00:03:30.669> you<00:03:31.669> know<00:03:31.760> so<00:03:32.000> much<00:03:32.180> to

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
do that it only has you know so much to

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.150 
do that it only has you know so much to
check<00:03:32.540> consider<00:03:32.900> your<00:03:33.049> entire<00:03:33.349> hard<00:03:33.590> drive<00:03:33.680> it

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
check consider your entire hard drive it

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.559 
check consider your entire hard drive it
should<00:03:34.340> find<00:03:34.549> it<00:03:34.730> a<00:03:34.760> lot<00:03:34.879> faster<00:03:35.419> and<00:03:37.000> you<00:03:38.000> know

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
should find it a lot faster and you know

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.259 
should find it a lot faster and you know
you<00:03:39.379> have<00:03:39.639> like<00:03:40.639> I<00:03:40.790> said<00:03:40.819> if<00:03:41.060> you<00:03:41.120> have<00:03:41.209> a

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
you have like I said if you have a

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.420 
you have like I said if you have a
64-bit<00:03:41.900> operating<00:03:42.079> system<00:03:42.829> like<00:03:42.949> this<00:03:43.160> is

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
64-bit operating system like this is

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.849 
64-bit operating system like this is
check<00:03:43.970> in<00:03:44.150> your<00:03:44.329> x86<00:03:45.169> folder<00:03:45.319> because<00:03:45.680> it's<00:03:45.799> a

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
check in your x86 folder because it's a

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.909 
check in your x86 folder because it's a
32-bit<00:03:46.400> game<00:03:46.699> if<00:03:47.299> you<00:03:48.079> don't<00:03:48.349> you<00:03:48.590> should<00:03:48.769> only

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:48.919 
32-bit game if you don't you should only

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.189 
32-bit game if you don't you should only
have<00:03:49.190> a<00:03:49.579> regular<00:03:50.209> Program<00:03:50.720> Files<00:03:50.959> folder

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:51.199 
have a regular Program Files folder

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:53.229 
have a regular Program Files folder
without<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:51.919> x86<00:03:52.310> at<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.879> end<00:03:53.030> so<00:03:53.209> just

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
without the x86 at the end so just

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.659 
without the x86 at the end so just
searching<00:03:53.780> that<00:03:53.959> and<00:03:54.260> it<00:03:55.220> should<00:03:55.400> pop<00:03:55.639> right

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:55.669 
searching that and it should pop right

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.689 
searching that and it should pop right
up<00:03:55.879> for<00:03:56.180> you<00:03:56.239> guys<00:03:56.709> so<00:03:57.709> hopefully<00:03:58.220> you<00:03:58.549> guys
