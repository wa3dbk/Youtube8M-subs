00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:24.330
 Also introduce the new youtube one 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:26.970
 company cassettes have black bread themselves 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:33.410
 and so on special at the scar is 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:37.170
 that's not a typical fell the stock 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:40.230
 Can you get a real 14 millimeters 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:45.059
 question she goes through her goes 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.010
 completely one uses for it 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.480
 we are adapter list space he has 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.649
 but then comes the company bot 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.649
 the 1 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.120
 the reason why he did that 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.949
 There are certainly some people who want one 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.640
 company learn but the banner pÃ©cs the 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.949
 advantage is 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.570
 by being like a real 14 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.830
 you can have a millimeter share 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:16.170
 needed for mpeg then sets the ball 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.880
 clean and ready can then without 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.409
 problems driving the pick without you 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.869
 have to think that the share 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:27.090
 You can also look at it 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.329
 the axis is also consistent without 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.110
 thread everything stuck how can I axel 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.110
 pull out 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.290
 So put it in directly 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.030
 the advantage is who no musterknaben 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.130
 to lug or similar is the 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.350
 then only needs the axis on one 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.250
 to attract 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.930
 in that the axel weber pushes 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:02:36.410
 Can do that with a simple key 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:36.410
 ready for pulling
