Kaurava is a simple handheld system it

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.660 
Kaurava is a simple handheld system it
passes<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.630> needle<00:00:12.990> through<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.290> cork<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.889> then

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
passes a needle through the cork I then

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.420 
passes a needle through the cork I then
push<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:14.940> button<00:00:15.179> which<00:00:15.719> pushes<00:00:16.049> inert<00:00:16.949> argon

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
push a button which pushes inert argon

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.670 
push a button which pushes inert argon
gas<00:00:17.670> into<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.240> bottle<00:00:18.539> let<00:00:19.199> go<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.560> button

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
gas into the bottle let go of the button

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.420 
gas into the bottle let go of the button
and<00:00:19.890> then<00:00:19.980> wine<00:00:20.220> comes<00:00:20.490> out<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:21.630> for<00:00:21.840> example

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
and then wine comes out so for example

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.109 
and then wine comes out so for example
attach<00:00:23.430> like<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.080> top<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.470> bottle

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
attach like so to the top of the bottle

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.230 
attach like so to the top of the bottle
push<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.269> needle<00:00:27.420> through<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.720> cork<00:00:29.090> tip<00:00:30.090> the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
push the needle through the cork tip the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.799 
push the needle through the cork tip the
bottle<00:00:30.390> sideways<00:00:32.059> push<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.210> button<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:33.630> gas

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
bottle sideways push the button so gas

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.119 
bottle sideways push the button so gas
goes<00:00:34.020> in<00:00:34.579> let<00:00:35.579> go<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.880> wine<00:00:36.059> comes<00:00:36.329> out<00:00:37.129> you

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
goes in let go and wine comes out you

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.440 
goes in let go and wine comes out you
can<00:00:38.160> pour<00:00:38.489> as<00:00:38.579> much<00:00:38.760> or<00:00:38.910> as<00:00:38.969> little<00:00:39.030> as<00:00:39.300> you

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
can pour as much or as little as you

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.420 
can pour as much or as little as you
like<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:40.469> longer<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.860> hold<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.100> button<00:00:41.340> the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
like the longer you hold the button the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.549 
like the longer you hold the button the
more<00:00:41.550> gas<00:00:41.730> goes<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.809> more<00:00:42.989> wine<00:00:43.170> will<00:00:43.379> come

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
more gas goes in the more wine will come

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.639 
more gas goes in the more wine will come
out<00:00:43.700> when<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.789> are<00:00:44.879> done<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.300> simply<00:00:46.020> drop<00:00:46.500> my

out when you are done I simply drop my

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.630 
out when you are done I simply drop my
hand<00:00:48.020> let<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> extra<00:00:49.410> gas<00:00:49.530> come<00:00:49.829> out<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.489> can

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
hand let the extra gas come out you can

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.490 
hand let the extra gas come out you can
see<00:00:50.820> hard-on<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.629> inert<00:00:51.899> it's<00:00:52.110> part<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.410> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
see hard-on is inert it's part of the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.930 
see hard-on is inert it's part of the
air<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:52.770> breathe<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.340> does<00:00:53.489> not<00:00:53.610> react

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
air we breathe and it does not react

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.310 
air we breathe and it does not react
with<00:00:54.090> oxygen<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.800> then<00:00:55.800> remove<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.219> needle

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.300 

you<00:00:59.800> can<00:00:59.920> see<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:01.120> cork<00:01:01.360> is<00:01:01.480> resealed<00:01:01.870> I<00:01:02.310> spent

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
you can see the cork is resealed I spent

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.369 
you can see the cork is resealed I spent
11<00:01:03.640> years<00:01:03.910> developing<00:01:04.659> a<00:01:04.780> needle<00:01:05.019> that<00:01:05.199> could

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
11 years developing a needle that could

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.280 
11 years developing a needle that could
go<00:01:05.500> through<00:01:05.740> cork<00:01:06.010> without<00:01:06.310> causing<00:01:06.700> damage

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
go through cork without causing damage

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.330 
go through cork without causing damage
permanent<00:01:08.290> damage<00:01:08.560> to<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.770> cork<00:01:09.010> so<00:01:09.130> that<00:01:09.280> it

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
permanent damage to the cork so that it

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.640 
permanent damage to the cork so that it
can<00:01:09.490> behave<00:01:09.760> like<00:01:10.090> it<00:01:10.210> normally<00:01:10.330> does<00:01:10.540> you<00:01:11.500> can

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
glasses of wine I can have them from

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.510 
glasses of wine I can have them from
four<00:01:27.640> different<00:01:27.729> bottles<00:01:28.240> so<00:01:29.200> for<00:01:29.440> me<00:01:29.530> as<00:01:29.740> a

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
four different bottles so for me as a

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.670 
four different bottles so for me as a
small<00:01:30.850> collector<00:01:31.270> I<00:01:31.509> can<00:01:32.020> learn<00:01:32.170> three<00:01:32.590> or

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
small collector I can learn three or

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.680 
small collector I can learn three or
four<00:01:32.860> times<00:01:33.039> as<00:01:33.310> fast<00:01:33.340> about<00:01:33.850> wine<00:01:34.090> then<00:01:34.450> if<00:01:34.570> I

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
four times as fast about wine then if I

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.240 
four times as fast about wine then if I
were<00:01:34.810> to<00:01:34.869> pull<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.259> cork<00:01:35.530> and<00:01:35.710> drink<00:01:35.890> only<00:01:35.979> one

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
were to pull the cork and drink only one

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.100 
were to pull the cork and drink only one
bottle<00:01:36.460> so<00:01:37.300> I<00:01:37.330> can<00:01:37.600> have<00:01:37.750> three<00:01:37.930> or<00:01:38.050> four

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
bottle so I can have three or four

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.600 
bottle so I can have three or four
different<00:01:38.289> white<00:01:38.770> Burgundy's<00:01:39.220> in<00:01:39.340> an<00:01:39.430> evening

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
different white Burgundy's in an evening

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.400 
different white Burgundy's in an evening
and<00:01:39.820> compare<00:01:40.539> different<00:01:40.960> regions<00:01:41.259> of<00:01:41.350> the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
and compare different regions of the

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.350 
and compare different regions of the
same<00:01:41.649> year<00:01:41.920> for<00:01:42.850> me<00:01:42.940> that's<00:01:43.119> a<00:01:43.270> great

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
same year for me that's a great

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.840 
same year for me that's a great
advantage<00:01:43.720> I<00:01:44.140> can<00:01:44.590> also<00:01:44.740> check<00:01:45.220> on<00:01:45.520> the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
advantage I can also check on the

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.730 
advantage I can also check on the
evolution<00:01:46.300> of<00:01:46.360> a<00:01:46.450> wine<00:01:46.660> I'll<00:01:47.200> taste<00:01:47.380> it<00:01:47.560> one

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
evolution of a wine I'll taste it one

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.139 
evolution of a wine I'll taste it one
year<00:01:47.950> and<00:01:48.100> if<00:01:48.160> it's<00:01:48.310> not<00:01:48.430> ready<00:01:48.670> I'll<00:01:48.820> taste<00:01:49.030> it

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
year and if it's not ready I'll taste it

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.900 
year and if it's not ready I'll taste it
again<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.479> next<00:01:49.660> year<00:01:50.460> until<00:01:51.460> it's<00:01:51.610> ready<00:01:51.820> and

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
again the next year until it's ready and

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.630 
again the next year until it's ready and
then<00:01:52.090> I<00:01:52.149> can<00:01:52.300> pull<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.570> cork<00:01:52.890> for<00:01:53.890> restaurants

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
then I can pull the cork for restaurants

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.090 
then I can pull the cork for restaurants

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
that allows them to dramatically

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.130 
that allows them to dramatically
increase<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.850> wines<00:01:58.539> they<00:01:58.750> sell<00:01:58.960> by<00:01:59.080> the
