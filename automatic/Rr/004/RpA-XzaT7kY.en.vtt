racing sonic it has been out of box

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.650 
racing sonic it has been out of box
but<00:03:18.630> I<00:03:18.660> keep<00:03:18.840> stuff<00:03:19.110> in<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.410> box<00:03:20.090> just<00:03:21.090> for<00:03:21.209> I

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
but I keep stuff in the box just for I

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.039 
but I keep stuff in the box just for I
don't<00:03:21.870> know<00:03:21.989> collecting<00:03:22.560> purposes<00:03:22.830> I<00:03:24.049> like

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
don't know collecting purposes I like

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.949 
don't know collecting purposes I like
all<00:03:25.290> these<00:03:25.560> all<00:03:25.950> these<00:03:26.130> figures<00:03:26.640> if<00:03:27.060> if<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:27.750> did

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
all these all these figures if if I did

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.900 
all these all these figures if if I did
not<00:03:28.140> have<00:03:28.530> them<00:03:28.709> in<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:28.980> bubble<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.489> would<00:03:29.760> have

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
not have them in the bubble I would have

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.770 
not have them in the bubble I would have
far<00:03:30.360> more<00:03:30.390> space<00:03:30.989> than<00:03:31.170> I<00:03:31.290> do<00:03:31.350> now<00:03:31.730> but<00:03:32.730> I<00:03:33.000> just

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
far more space than I do now but I just

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.750 
far more space than I do now but I just
think<00:03:34.049> that<00:03:34.170> they're<00:03:34.860> more<00:03:35.010> secure<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:35.640> they

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
think that they're more secure and they

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.940 
think that they're more secure and they
they<00:03:36.030> don't<00:03:36.150> know<00:03:36.959> harm<00:03:37.260> could<00:03:37.470> really<00:03:37.680> come

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
they don't know harm could really come

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.570 
they don't know harm could really come
to<00:03:38.130> them<00:03:38.310> if<00:03:38.790> they<00:03:39.030> were<00:03:39.090> in<00:03:39.269> a<00:03:39.330> bubble<00:03:39.510> if<00:03:40.549> so<00:03:41.549> I

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
to them if they were in a bubble if so I

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.550 
to them if they were in a bubble if so I
keep<00:03:41.880> them<00:03:42.090> in<00:03:42.269> they<00:03:42.450> all<00:03:42.570> have<00:03:42.780> been<00:03:42.989> out<00:03:44.120> so

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
keep them in they all have been out so

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.670 
keep them in they all have been out so
yeah<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:46.890> then<00:03:47.250> uh<00:03:47.930> they<00:03:48.930> get<00:03:49.170> these<00:03:49.350> out<00:03:49.530> of

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
yeah and then uh they get these out of

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.699 
yeah and then uh they get these out of
the<00:03:49.739> light<00:03:49.920> they're<00:03:50.880> out<00:03:51.060> of<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.360> dark<00:03:51.870> this
