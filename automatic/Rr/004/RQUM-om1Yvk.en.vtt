00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:12.500
 let's get down to pray 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:15.320
 new green borscht hasn't worked with it yet 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.009
 just now for the first time I'll start 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:24.409
 native 80 skin 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:27.509
 But yesterday I went through it completely here 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:32.899
 sweet him good i had the same 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:37.199
 added a bit of what i did 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:39.269
 seal type stuffing glands to 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.879
 grease does not come out of the gear 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:44.250
 I was especially pleased that here 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.039
 from the top all the way through 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.870
 hole in the gear and when 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.289
 when I opened it 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.230
 brand new then here a lot 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.710
 grease just pour out because she 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:05.489
 probably already beginning to thin 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:07.830
 temperature and the liquid part came out that 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:13.500
 I still did not like this one 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:17.130
 adjustment knot I do not know in general he 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.040
 regulates of course but its design 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.860
 I really don't like it because 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.110
 ribbon rubs tomato special 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.630
 metal such a solder 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:32.850
 metal I do not know how long 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:37.290
 stomp to stand here with the other end of the cape 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:40.410
 wines shifts from whom the movie is generally not 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.450
 I know how it would be nothing like Genz 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.210
 but also the sole 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:49.820
 it is not hard to press on it normally but 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.820
 so she is not very fat 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:58.800
 ergonomics ergonomics good for me 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.250
 like here with this constructive made 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.820
 such that there are two holes 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:09.780
 threaded here under m5 if not mistaken 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:15.710
 you can just take a wooden board for 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:20.610
 drilled in the boards when spinning on the screws 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:23.900
 flip over and take this board like this 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.040
 instructions just to any table 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.010
 attach and you can work already 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.970
 upright that is in this plan just 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.910
 great there like some else there 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.460
 angular emphasis but as far as I understood it 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.490
 the design is not very good that is it 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:45.680
 somewhere here it is attached I hang out 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.680
 I'll probably invent something 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.160
 so I really like the machine 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.360
 originally that is what included 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:59.740
 By the way , the new typewriter is here 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.750
 this wheel here backlash back and forth I 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.530
 spend there gum 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:09.100
 sealing here is the front roller though 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:12.370
 he and plastic but he on bearings 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:19.260
 oil seals that is grease from there anywhere 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:21.880
 I do not know the latch system 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.720
 how effective is it 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:31.710
 there is a spring worth not know 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:35.830
 time will tell so what is the best 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:40.080
 our folk pot-bellied interskol tuesday 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:45.430
 easy to wear can work 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:47.350
 attack put full speed maximum 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.830
 well, let's see ourselves 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.830
 will show 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:51.910
 I don't know well, I like it 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:53.460
 no negative and and work i'm not 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.990
 felt uncomfortable 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.990
 everything is very good ergonomic 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:08.630
 everything is fine I don't know of course not 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.630
 they said that we could try with one hand 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:35.930
 but behind the hand is not comfortable somehow he seems to be 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:41.930
 trying to get out like this 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:48.210
 go on let's say so sprinkle 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:52.529
 more comfortable of course and safer with hands so 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:55.559
 which is basically a very good machine 

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:57.749
 constructive as well as blue 

00:06:55.559 --> 00:07:01.229
 what did I like about the bearings 

00:06:57.749 --> 00:07:03.409
 front rollers, especially not so 

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:07.789
 no added to green 

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:10.249
 ergonomics good handle is comfortable and here 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:13.699
 no negative yet 

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:13.699
 thanks to all
