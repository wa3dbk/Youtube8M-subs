00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
know I think it'll be a while I think so

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:31.870 
know I think it'll be a while I think so
I<00:05:28.970> think<00:05:29.300> so<00:05:29.630> we<00:05:30.320> would<00:05:30.650> just<00:05:30.800> see<00:05:31.490> that<00:05:31.639> you

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
I think so we would just see that you

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.610 
I think so we would just see that you
see<00:05:32.030> that<00:05:32.060> we<00:05:32.300> went<00:05:32.450> to<00:05:32.510> CD<00:05:32.840> we<00:05:33.169> went<00:05:33.320> to<00:05:33.410> sea<00:05:33.590> ES

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
see that we went to CD we went to sea ES

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.589 
see that we went to CD we went to sea ES

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
and they had they really started that

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:37.629
