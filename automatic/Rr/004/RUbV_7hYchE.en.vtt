think it looks nice the stickers are

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.520 
think it looks nice the stickers are
very<00:01:38.820> badly<00:01:39.060> worn<00:01:39.360> on<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.229> don't<00:01:40.380> know<00:01:40.439> if

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
very badly worn on this I don't know if

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.899 
very badly worn on this I don't know if
you<00:01:40.619> can<00:01:40.740> kind<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.040> see<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.369> but<00:01:41.670> they're

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
you can kind of see that but they're

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.440 
you can kind of see that but they're
warm<00:01:42.930> fairly<00:01:43.439> bad<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:45.119> reason<00:01:45.360> I'm

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
warm fairly bad the the reason I'm

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.700 
warm fairly bad the the reason I'm
leaving<00:01:45.570> those<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:45.990> they're<00:01:46.170> not<00:01:46.350> getting<00:01:46.619> the

rotate<00:02:35.840> these<00:02:36.079> out<00:02:36.379> and<00:02:36.769> then<00:02:37.239> around<00:02:41.319> get<00:02:42.319> in

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:42.439 
rotate these out and then around get in

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:44.080 
rotate these out and then around get in
there<00:02:42.620> rotate<00:02:42.950> them<00:02:43.069> out<00:02:43.220> spin<00:02:43.849> that<00:02:44.030> around

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
there rotate them out spin that around

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.809 
there rotate them out spin that around
like<00:02:44.450> so<00:02:44.859> then<00:02:45.859> you<00:02:46.010> can<00:02:46.159> take<00:02:46.310> this<00:02:46.519> section

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
like so then you can take this section

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.349 
like so then you can take this section
