 hello very good everyone I'm Juan Cotino 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.960
 24 how are you welcome to a new 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.760
 video to my channel after these days 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.650
 I feel the absence of videos of agreements 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.880
 but we are like you already know good is 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.830
 for those who do not know it too 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.630
 I always speak I always try to speak in 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.340
 my channel to also set aside for the 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.950
 that they do not know no because there are always people 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.930
 that is not aware of what is the 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.829
 competitive world that is a world in the 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.039
 which I am very involved in 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:42.530
 lately not but good I roll that 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:44.719
 is close the open cup is more today than 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.730
 I upload this video today at 10 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:50.839
 we played myself and my team the first round 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.690
 of the open cup 3 of lvp and that's why 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:55.219
 these days may not have gone up 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.699
 videos because we've been preparing 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:01.820
 and so and so we have been training 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.979
 and the truth if the competitive remove 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.330
 a lot of time talking about it 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:07.490
 competitive that's just what it is 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.750
 this game that you are seeing is a 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.520
 competitive game by that you have me 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.310
 seen a little static there was 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.479
 waiting for my partner what you see 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.009
 in the minimum to overtake the 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.550
 position by the train towards the pump and 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.659
 could put the competitive what 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.469
 you think of the competitive 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.119
 I really the truth the truth 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:31.130
 thinking without uploading it more to my channel 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.130
 put in that last low 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.210
 takes the kill cam and the game or 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.600
 be sorry the round for the team and 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.580
 good as I was saying competitive 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.640
 I'm thinking of going up more often to 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.250
 my channel I know that some do not like what 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.840
 I know I know I know because I always 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.460
 channel I 've always been uploading online 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.659
 but I do not know to see I like to go up 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.729
 lately what more competitive game 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.799
 It does not bother me, it does not bother me 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.229
 when then go play a game 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.659
 online and upload that game not because no 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.220
 I know I do not mind the truth but I 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.800
 I want you to talk to me, I need you to 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.470
 say either for the comments 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.330
 d 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.280
 it is not not inventing a bit the erase 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.280
 because I just got up is worth 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.980
 I need you to tell me and via twitter 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:26.050
 via comments on this video yes 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.330
 if you want it to go online because the 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.549
 competitive such boring or we like 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.489
 but I propose you seriously I encourage you to 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.739
 that provides the competitive and that you start 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:39.640
 by league mode than white in a game 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.140
 I think that it challenges you good and there was 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.090
 there someone shoots me and I do not have 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.769
 bitch and beige that was decision was a 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.200
 my teammate was messing 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:52.720
 in a center and good and that jump is 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:55.660
 catch or which frog in one lately I 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.150
 they are putting a lot with the game 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.730
 but I cheer I think this game 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.980
 suitable for you to undoubtedly give you 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.750
 for trying the competitive and as I have already 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.330
 said you start by league mode which is a 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.210
 mode that is already in the game 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.890
 predetermined how bad it is not what 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.700
 better to try the competitive because 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.610
 it's against guiris the connection is a bit 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.280
 unbalanced because if it touches hosting 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:25.290
 franchute then the most possible thing is that you 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.290
 violen or that it opens you of legs 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.860
 The best that is, then, try a little 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.320
 in league mode you try to get a 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.800
 equipment that you already know you can upload 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.380
 to upload the declassification of rank and 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.970
 others not with your team of four and you go 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.650
 raising the league and if you see that you like 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.650
 You can compete on a web page like 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.620
 it's vp that there are big tournaments like 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:53.010
 the final speaks open cup which are 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.170
 of payments and the open cabes of payment but 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.060
 get a lot of money and even go to 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.540
 the final cap that the final changes is a 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:04.830
 the issue is that it does not impose no in order 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.210
 I am not going to I animated years already I 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.910
 I propose that you try the competitive 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.610
 because I want to direct a little bit 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.970
 let's say 30% my channel to the competitive 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.040
 and another percentage to the smallest online 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.290
 because in this game I do not fit anymore 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.549
 online I do not fit more online and good 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.460
 here starting the round how crazy and 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.990
 I tried to make a rush and it worked for me 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.330
 I took two casualties one of them to my 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.490
 Cadiz friend and well I think I do 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.770
 the full team here if I remember correctly 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.750
 yes golf me last is good I'm going to climb 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.480
 a piece of departure 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.420
 I do not remember well who was now at 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.050
 end of the game I put the markers 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.050
 although I think it was 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.789
 good memories 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.270
 and good as I said then a 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:50.800
 percentage to a competitive other to 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.120
 online but smaller because this 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.599
 game 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.969
 it's more competitive I can not upload more 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.789
 competitive I promise 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:02.770
 another percentage is already worn out 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:04.539
 the parodies that little I would have left of 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.520
 this game that parodied me already in this 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:09.550
 game my mother that comes the bald base 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.639
 and see it is that come please and 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:15.330
 good to be where they are stung leave me alone 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:18.090
 only in front of four 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.860
 and I have to try to play the epic 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.360
 of the area 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.580
 good to start see me and a little 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.289
 static aymat to the first 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.000
 the other three know that I'm here in 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.759
 this small staircase to access 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.939
 catwalk passes one there I hope you go 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:34.979
 to come, I'll kill you and kill him 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:36.659
 with cubanito man now I have seen 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.889
 the name is that I see it pretty bad 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:42.520
 quality that's why I tell you 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:44.979
 and well it reminds us that in more it was a 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.689
 true but good I 'm still here I say 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.949
 there is no time left for 30 seconds to 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:50.229
 place the most possible that you are 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:52.539
 waiting for all there is the oma must and I think 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:55.360
 that they do not drink it if the pump should and should 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:57.719
 I propose to anyone to place me no no 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.719
 there is no one 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.449
 and now I propose to place what 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.099
 happens that things do not always go well 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:06.900
 and I hear someone from behind 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:08.970
 trying to trick my big bug friend 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.190
 Cadiz great fault but now what 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.599
 I lose sight I look around 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.120
 I get into what has been the first 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:17.110
 point to leave point and find it the 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.030
 uai seyyam shot 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.350
 see what else quickly does not give me time 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.960
 to place so I have to go crazy 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.880
 for him and then I just finally with him and 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.620
 I get another last dre mine that departures 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.380
 here is also the truth that I came out 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.120
 I left and already good and I have all the 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:34.700
 streak have all the streak in bay of yo 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:39.129
 I think it's a pretty big advantage 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:41.289
 in an abuse in being superior berries 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:45.159
 has the green streak in competitive 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:46.749
 I say it is already an abuse an abuse a 

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:48.210
 abuse because you could say it 's a 

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:51.389
 local bank 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:54.150
 60 percent without salt stretch it well and 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:56.580
 at the right moment to start at 60 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.540
 percent of winning the game here and 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.850
 well here they place in ve do the 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.980
 the 314 I wanted them to place 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.200
 there because we are using steps and such and 

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:09.680
 it seems that they placed the other one as the 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:12.890
 pump pump info is called and 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.330
 Well, it's going to end already, we won 60 

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.220
 starting here I take one in the back 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:19.600
 he hit 20 thousand shots and they take it from me and 

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:21.910
 finally that already with scoop 

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.740

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:26.590
