00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
leaked and that shouldn't be a surprise

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.490 
leaked and that shouldn't be a surprise
considering<00:00:15.120> how<00:00:15.660> often<00:00:15.900> we<00:00:16.199> are<00:00:16.230> actually

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
considering how often we are actually

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.950 
considering how often we are actually
looking<00:00:16.949> at<00:00:17.310> traits<00:00:17.670> but<00:00:18.180> moving<00:00:18.600> on<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.930> a

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
looking at traits but moving on to a

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.590 
looking at traits but moving on to a
little<00:00:19.199> midseason<00:00:19.949> update<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:21.000> can<00:00:21.029> see<00:00:21.420> that

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
little midseason update you can see that

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.189 
little midseason update you can see that
after<00:00:21.720> 15<00:00:22.410> games<00:00:22.740> we<00:00:23.250> have<00:00:23.460> only<00:00:23.760> one<00:00:24.330> vibe

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
after 15 games we have only one vibe

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.109 
after 15 games we have only one vibe
but<00:00:25.500> I'm<00:00:25.650> not<00:00:25.830> too<00:00:26.070> worried<00:00:26.430> about<00:00:26.609> our<00:00:26.670> win

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
but I'm not too worried about our win

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.939 
but I'm not too worried about our win
record<00:00:27.420> just<00:00:27.840> quite<00:00:28.109> yet<00:00:28.410> because<00:00:28.590> we<00:00:28.920> are

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
record just quite yet because we are

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.490 
record just quite yet because we are
early<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.640> season<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.269> also<00:00:30.960> we<00:00:31.199> are<00:00:31.230> in

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
early in the season and also we are in

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.920 
early in the season and also we are in
the<00:00:31.679> Eastern<00:00:32.099> Conference<00:00:32.399> what<00:00:33.300> I'm<00:00:33.420> truly

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
the Eastern Conference what I'm truly

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.620 
the Eastern Conference what I'm truly
worried<00:00:34.440> about<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:35.130> our<00:00:35.340> point<00:00:35.880> differential

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
worried about is our point differential

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.310 
worried about is our point differential
it<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.559> very<00:00:37.890> high<00:00:38.309> with<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> very<00:00:39.300> very<00:00:39.420> big

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
it is very high with a very very big

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.709 
it is very high with a very very big
minus<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.370> front<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.450> is

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
minus in front of it so that is

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.690 
minus in front of it so that is
something<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.320> definitely<00:00:43.649> need<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.430> change

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
something we definitely need to change

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.450 
something we definitely need to change
but<00:00:45.180> when<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.480> comes<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.870> our<00:00:45.960> rebounding

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
but when it comes to our rebounding

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.220 
but when it comes to our rebounding
blocking<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.700> steals<00:00:48.059> we're<00:00:48.600> actually<00:00:48.780> doing

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
blocking and steals we're actually doing

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.619 
blocking and steals we're actually doing
quite<00:00:49.469> nice<00:00:49.829> but<00:00:50.370> unfortunately<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.420> one

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
quite nice but unfortunately the one

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.900 
quite nice but unfortunately the one
area<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.410> hurting<00:00:52.649> us<00:00:52.980> are<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.520> shooting

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
area that is hurting us are the shooting

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.910 
area that is hurting us are the shooting
percentages<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.079> are<00:00:55.230> seeing<00:00:55.530> right

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
percentages that you are seeing right

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.729 
percentages that you are seeing right
here<00:00:55.949> they<00:00:56.579> are<00:00:56.760> definitely<00:00:57.360> not<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:58.379> good

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
here they are definitely not that good

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.099 
here they are definitely not that good
but<00:00:59.250> they<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.699> be<00:00:59.850> explained<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.600> single

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
but they can be explained in a single

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.479 
but they can be explained in a single
word<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.359> consistency<00:01:03.359> consistency

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
team the same way that I'm running my

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.530 
team the same way that I'm running my
Los<00:02:37.050> Angeles<00:02:37.590> Lakers<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.730> is<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.120> take<00:02:39.300> a

Los Angeles Lakers and that is to take a

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.600 
Los Angeles Lakers and that is to take a
lot<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:39.900> three-point<00:02:40.800> shots<00:02:41.160> but

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
lot of three-point shots but

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.370 
lot of three-point shots but
unfortunately<00:02:42.330> if<00:02:42.450> we<00:02:42.630> don't<00:02:42.840> really<00:02:43.050> have

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
unfortunately if we don't really have

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.890 
unfortunately if we don't really have
the<00:02:43.800> same<00:02:44.040> type<00:02:44.489> of<00:02:44.520> shooters<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.390> have<00:02:45.690> in

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
the same type of shooters that I have in

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.660 
the same type of shooters that I have in
Los<00:02:46.080> Angeles<00:02:46.350> so<00:02:46.830> with<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.130> being<00:02:47.370> said

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
Los Angeles so with that being said

Los Angeles so with that being said
we're<00:02:48.150> going<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.540> make<00:02:48.660> an<00:02:48.810> effort<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.230> attack

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
we're going to make an effort to attack

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.490 
we're going to make an effort to attack
the<00:02:50.040> basket<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.850> right<00:02:51.360> there<00:02:51.660> is<00:02:51.810> exactly

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
the basket and right there is exactly

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.860 
the basket and right there is exactly
what<00:02:52.709> I'm<00:02:52.800> talking<00:02:53.280> about<00:02:53.360> defense<00:02:54.360> leading

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
what I'm talking about defense leading

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.500 
what I'm talking about defense leading
to<00:02:55.020> offense<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:56.190> best<00:02:56.400> case<00:02:56.640> scenario<00:02:57.180> a

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
to offense and the best case scenario a

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.229 
to offense and the best case scenario a
huge<00:02:58.110> alley-oop<00:02:58.770> dunk<00:02:59.070> for<00:02:59.550> mr.<00:02:59.850> Andrew

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.570 
huge alley-oop dunk for mr. Andrew
Wiggins<00:03:00.600> so<00:03:01.350> right<00:03:01.590> there<00:03:01.890> we<00:03:01.920> get<00:03:02.220> another

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
Wiggins so right there we get another

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.820 
Wiggins so right there we get another
defensive<00:03:03.270> stop<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.900> course<00:03:04.170> we<00:03:04.620> are

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
defensive stop and of course we are

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.979 
defensive stop and of course we are
looking<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.580> attack<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.239> basket

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
looking to attack the basket

working out we are definitely getting

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.540 
working out we are definitely getting
those<00:03:24.390> easy<00:03:24.720> looks<00:03:25.170> around<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.709> basket<00:03:26.250> and

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
those easy looks around the basket and

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.760 
those easy looks around the basket and
we<00:03:26.760> are<00:03:26.880> not<00:03:27.209> relying<00:03:27.660> on<00:03:27.930> our<00:03:28.110> three-point

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
shot so far so good but if the end of

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.040

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
to find a way to come back from a

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810 
ten-point deficit and I'm hoping that we

ten-point deficit and I'm hoping that we
can<00:06:32.840> do<00:06:33.200> it<00:06:33.350> twice<00:06:33.590> in<00:06:34.040> a<00:06:34.280> single<00:06:34.310> game<00:06:35.150> that

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:35.540 
can do it twice in a single game that

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.360 
can do it twice in a single game that
will<00:06:35.690> see<00:06:35.870> huge<00:06:36.140> that<00:06:36.590> would<00:06:36.770> be<00:06:36.950> huge<00:06:37.280> for

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
will see huge that would be huge for

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.320 
will see huge that would be huge for
morale

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330 
morale

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.030 
morale
that<00:06:38.450> would<00:06:38.630> be<00:06:38.780> huge<00:06:39.110> for<00:06:39.170> the<00:06:39.410> team<00:06:39.620> spirit

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:40.040 
that would be huge for the team spirit

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.520 
that would be huge for the team spirit
and<00:06:40.340> look<00:06:40.700> at<00:06:40.820> Tony<00:06:41.060> Wroten<00:06:41.480> right<00:06:41.840> there<00:06:42.170> you

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
and look at Tony Wroten right there you

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.290 
and look at Tony Wroten right there you
knocking<00:06:42.920> over<00:06:43.010> Jeff<00:06:43.430> Teague<00:06:43.670> and<00:06:43.940> taking

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
knocking over Jeff Teague and taking

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.120 
knocking over Jeff Teague and taking
that<00:06:44.390> little<00:06:44.840> step<00:06:45.110> back<00:06:45.350> to<00:06:45.560> get<00:06:45.740> fine<00:06:45.980> to

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.130 
that little step back to get fine to

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.950 
that little step back to get fine to
free<00:06:46.310> point<00:06:46.610> line<00:06:46.850> hoisting<00:06:47.450> it<00:06:47.570> up<00:06:47.690> and

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 
free point line hoisting it up and

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.190 
free point line hoisting it up and
nothing<00:06:48.410> but<00:06:48.980> net<00:06:49.490> that<00:06:49.820> was<00:06:50.030> beautiful<00:06:50.780> and<00:06:50.990> I

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:51.200 
nothing but net that was beautiful and I

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.350 
nothing but net that was beautiful and I
think<00:06:51.260> that<00:06:51.830> could<00:06:52.010> definitely<00:06:52.280> be<00:06:52.670> the<00:06:53.120> play

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 
think that could definitely be the play

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.630 
think that could definitely be the play
of<00:06:53.540> the<00:06:53.750> game<00:06:53.780> but<00:06:54.410> unfortunately<00:06:54.640> talking

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:55.640 
of the game but unfortunately talking

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.270 
of the game but unfortunately talking
about<00:06:55.880> the<00:06:56.090> game<00:06:56.330> we<00:06:56.840> are<00:06:56.960> now<00:06:57.140> down<00:06:57.440> by<00:06:57.710> 11

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 
about the game we are now down by 11

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.760 
about the game we are now down by 11
points<00:06:58.550> and<00:06:58.910> we<00:06:59.300> simply<00:06:59.570> haven't<00:07:00.260> figured<00:07:00.620> out

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:00.770 
points and we simply haven't figured out

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.160

how<00:07:01.190> to<00:07:01.250> get<00:07:01.670> back<00:07:01.730> into<00:07:02.360> it<00:07:02.510> just<00:07:02.930> quite<00:07:03.140> yet

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.170 
how to get back into it just quite yet
