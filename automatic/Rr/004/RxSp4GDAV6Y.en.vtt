00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 Miguel Angel Rocha talks to you in 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.589
 this time I bring you the custom 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.250
 recovery 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.070
 recovery project version 2.6 point 1.0 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.809
 for our l9 this recovery works 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.820
 both for popular unlocked as 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.560
 bootloader unlocked the only 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.289
 requirement is to have previously installed 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.390
 a custom recovery version that is not 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.730
 it matters is stubborn to see and it's not functions 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.250
 similar to chloroform as it is 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.660
 install zip files aster whites 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.660
 install rooms 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.900
 It also allows us what is being 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.150
 make backup copies from our 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.800
 system and so on and so one of the 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.260
 advantages of this interface that gives us is 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.239
 that shows us from the time or the 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.390
 percentage of our battery or not if 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.220
 they could notice that the same thing is blocked 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.530
 which allows us to save energy and 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.660
 when we are using it but good 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.660
 not to do it so much longer 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.620
 The first thing they are going to do is 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.450
 next are going to download the following 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.370
 files as there is always a 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.490
 description here below in the video les 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.200
 I leave the download links and they will be 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.900
 the following files here if please 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.580
 I ask you to pay attention if you have the 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.430
 locked bootloader moves in which 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.070
 says his blog and if they have it unlocked 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.509
 move in which says boot a lock a 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.850
 once they have moved it to their cell phone and 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:25.390
 be the external internal memory is 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.610
 indifferent proceed to enter mode 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.899
 recovery for it we are going to pay it and 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.899
 we enter in recovery mail 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.140
 once inside the road the only thing that 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.370
 we have to do is go install 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.370
 from sd card 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.330
 as I always tell them if they moved it to 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.850
 the internal memory select you see 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.270
 from sdk and if it went to the micro sdk 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.760
 select giusti from external in my 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.880
 case went to the internal 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.920
 and they are going to look for the file I turn them to 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.830
 remember if you have the bootloader 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.350
 blocked select the one that says but 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.680
 love ' and if they have it unlocked 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.210
 they select boot a log in this case I 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.630
 I will select the debut loader 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.630
 locked 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.730
 once they have selected it they will 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.120
 the option to install 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.640
 the process is very fast 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.580
 once you have finished 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.220
 dang or back exxon to a supported robot 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.459
 and in all the recovery mode and here 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.610
 We have our custom team win recovery 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.819
 project installed without any problem the 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.500
 which works perfectly as they 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.959
 I commented, I do not know if I told you it was the 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.140
 touch which greatly facilitates the 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:50.410
 mobility to get out it's enough to give in 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:54.180
 reboot and in system I hope they work and 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.180
 see you until next time
