00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
for an emperor level start this segment

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.640 
for an emperor level start this segment
will<00:00:14.549> probably<00:00:15.059> be<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.360> last<00:00:15.660> in<00:00:16.020> this<00:00:16.230> series

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
will probably be the last in this series

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.640 
will probably be the last in this series
and<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:17.789> promised<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.449> hundred<00:00:18.660> turns<00:00:18.960> will

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
and I promised you a hundred turns will

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.290 
and I promised you a hundred turns will
definitely<00:00:20.160> get<00:00:20.310> there<00:00:20.520> by<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.850> end<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.150> this

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
definitely get there by the end of this

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.859 
definitely get there by the end of this
segment

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
segment

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.740 
segment
and<00:00:22.340> if<00:00:23.340> we<00:00:23.490> were<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.609> play<00:00:23.970> through<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.390> the

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
and if we were to play through to the

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.380 
and if we were to play through to the
end<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.050> game<00:00:25.260> with<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:25.830> start<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:27.000> next

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
end of the game with this start the next

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.419 
end of the game with this start the next
twenty<00:00:27.660> or<00:00:27.779> thirty<00:00:28.019> turns<00:00:28.320> would<00:00:28.619> probably<00:00:29.220> be

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
twenty or thirty turns would probably be

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.400 
twenty or thirty turns would probably be
the<00:00:29.580> most<00:00:29.730> fundamental<00:00:30.480> in<00:00:30.720> picking<00:00:31.320> a

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
the most fundamental in picking a

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.979 
the most fundamental in picking a
strategy<00:00:31.920> for<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.309> rest<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.700> game<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.840> in

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
strategy for the rest of the game so in

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.330 
strategy for the rest of the game so in
some<00:00:34.170> ways<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.500> our<00:00:34.710> most<00:00:34.890> important

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
some ways this is our most important

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.660 
some ways this is our most important
segment<00:00:35.960> we<00:00:36.960> need<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.530> talk<00:00:37.710> about<00:00:37.739> one<00:00:38.430> major

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
segment we need to talk about one major

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.729 
segment we need to talk about one major
problem<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.600> will<00:00:39.780> govern<00:00:39.960> our<00:00:40.290> strategy

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
problem that will govern our strategy

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.000 
problem that will govern our strategy
and<00:00:40.980> that's<00:00:41.100> our<00:00:41.280> terrain<00:00:42.290> to<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.410> south<00:00:43.649> we

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
and that's our terrain to the south we

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.340 
and that's our terrain to the south we
have<00:00:44.040> really<00:00:44.700> awful<00:00:45.090> terrain<00:00:45.390> Tundra<00:00:46.110> ice

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
have really awful terrain Tundra ice

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.010 
have really awful terrain Tundra ice
some<00:00:47.309> decent<00:00:47.610> resources<00:00:48.120> but<00:00:48.450> just<00:00:48.840> not<00:00:48.989> a

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
some decent resources but just not a

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.979 
some decent resources but just not a
whole<00:00:49.230> lot<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.530> work<00:00:49.680> with<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:50.010> terms<00:00:50.219> of

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
whole lot to work with in terms of

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.529 
whole lot to work with in terms of
serviceable<00:00:51.989> city<00:00:52.260> sites<00:00:53.300> because<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.420> that

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
serviceable city sites because of that

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.290 
serviceable city sites because of that
we<00:00:54.809> have<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.170> look<00:00:55.320> elsewhere<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:56.190> expand<00:00:57.059> and

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
we have to look elsewhere to expand and

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.860 
we have to look elsewhere to expand and
get<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.289> really<00:00:58.530> good<00:00:58.649> core<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.129> cities<00:00:59.660> but<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
get a really good core of cities but the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.270 
get a really good core of cities but the
problem<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> north<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.160> west

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
problem is to the north and to the west

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.789 
problem is to the north and to the west
we<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:02.760> other<00:01:03.030> sibs<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:04.379> really<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> only

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
we have other sibs so really the only

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.830 
we have other sibs so really the only
way<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.220> get<00:01:05.460> out<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.850> kind<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.540> dilemma

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
way to get out of this kind of dilemma

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.870 
way to get out of this kind of dilemma
is<00:01:07.170> either<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.590> build<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.100> bunch<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.430> cities<00:01:08.729> in

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
is either to build a bunch of cities in

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.910 
is either to build a bunch of cities in
the<00:01:08.970> south<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.390> east<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.869> really<00:01:10.590> focus

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
the south and the east and really focus

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.210 
the south and the east and really focus
on<00:01:11.040> city<00:01:11.250> management<00:01:11.640> specialization<00:01:12.540> or

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
on city management specialization or

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.170 
on city management specialization or
probably<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.310> more<00:01:14.460> straightforward<00:01:14.729> route

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
probably the more straightforward route

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.940 
probably the more straightforward route
is<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.810> go<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:15.990> war<00:01:16.259> with<00:01:16.560> one<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
is to just go to war with one of the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.550 
is to just go to war with one of the
sibs<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.869> that's<00:01:18.869> going<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.110> be<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.290> route<00:01:19.409> we

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
sibs and that's going to be the route we

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.980 
sibs and that's going to be the route we
take<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:21.000> segment<00:01:21.210> will<00:01:21.479> focus<00:01:21.659> on

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
take so this segment will focus on

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.200 
take so this segment will focus on
building<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.619> very<00:01:23.070> strong<00:01:23.460> army<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:24.030> can

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
building a very strong army that we can

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.580 
building a very strong army that we can
use<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.720> declare<00:01:25.310> war<00:01:26.689> against<00:01:27.689> Willem<00:01:28.470> van

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
use to declare war against Willem van

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.069 
use to declare war against Willem van
Orange<00:01:29.009> or<00:01:29.220> de<00:01:29.340> Gaulle<00:01:29.659> let's<00:01:30.659> talk<00:01:30.780> about<00:01:30.900> how

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
Orange or de Gaulle let's talk about how

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.620 
Orange or de Gaulle let's talk about how
we<00:01:31.140> do<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.470> first<00:01:31.710> our<00:01:31.920> tech<00:01:32.420> will<00:01:33.420> need<00:01:33.540> to

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
we do that first our tech will need to

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.420 
we do that first our tech will need to
pick<00:01:33.750> up<00:01:33.869> construction<00:01:34.530> for<00:01:34.920> catapults

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
pick up construction for catapults

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.609 
pick up construction for catapults
catapults<00:01:36.390> make<00:01:36.600> any<00:01:36.869> unit<00:01:37.229> good<00:01:37.380> against

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
catapults make any unit good against

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.109 
catapults make any unit good against
cities<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.159> will<00:01:38.280> definitely<00:01:38.790> want<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:38.970> take

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
cities and will definitely want to take

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.330 
cities and will definitely want to take
as<00:01:39.270> many<00:01:39.360> cities<00:01:39.720> as<00:01:39.840> possible<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:41.009> we'll<00:01:41.159> be

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
as many cities as possible so we'll be

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.270 
as many cities as possible so we'll be
line<00:01:41.549> construction<00:01:42.390> we<00:01:43.290> need<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.649> hook<00:01:44.130> up

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
line construction we need to hook up

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.480 
line construction we need to hook up
iron<00:01:44.689> that's<00:01:45.689> for<00:01:46.619> building<00:01:46.890> swordsmen<00:01:47.310> which

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
iron that's for building swordsmen which

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.490 
iron that's for building swordsmen which
will<00:01:47.640> be<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.000> primary<00:01:48.570> unit<00:01:48.990> we<00:01:49.079> use<00:01:49.110> to

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
will be the primary unit we use to

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.660 
will be the primary unit we use to

improvements to our cities we'll whip

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.069 
improvements to our cities we'll whip
out<00:01:58.500> greeneries<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.310> then<00:01:59.520> barracks<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.180> by

this gem style as long as possible so

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.550 
this gem style as long as possible so
that<00:02:40.639> said<00:02:40.969> let's<00:02:41.209> hop<00:02:41.719> to<00:02:41.900> it<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.079> try<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.290> see

that said let's hop to it and try to see

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.039 
that said let's hop to it and try to see
if<00:02:42.590> we<00:02:42.709> can<00:02:43.010> build<00:02:43.370> an<00:02:43.639> army<00:02:44.030> from<00:02:44.299> basically

enemies one of the big problems in war
for<00:02:55.219> us<00:02:55.280> will<00:02:55.489> be<00:02:55.609> defending<00:02:56.060> the

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
for us will be defending the

southeastern Peninsula
you<00:02:57.949> basically<00:02:58.099> have<00:02:58.549> so<00:02:58.819> many<00:02:59.169> tiles<00:03:00.169> to

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
you basically have so many tiles to

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.740 
you basically have so many tiles to
reveal<00:03:00.859> here<00:03:01.099> or<00:03:01.310> spawn<00:03:01.639> bust<00:03:01.909> here<00:03:02.150> that's

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
reveal here or spawn bust here that's

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.539 
reveal here or spawn bust here that's
we're<00:03:03.019> going<00:03:03.139> to<00:03:03.199> dedicate<00:03:03.349> three<00:03:03.889> units<00:03:04.310> just

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
we're going to dedicate three units just

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:05.979 
we're going to dedicate three units just
to<00:03:04.639> spawn<00:03:04.909> busting<00:03:05.329> and<00:03:05.510> that's<00:03:05.719> going<00:03:05.930> to

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
to spawn busting and that's going to

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.990 
to spawn busting and that's going to
cost<00:03:06.409> this<00:03:06.590> money<00:03:06.799> and<00:03:07.040> it's<00:03:07.669> going<00:03:07.879> to

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
cost this money and it's going to

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000 
cost this money and it's going to
produce<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:09.139> number<00:03:09.230> of<00:03:09.349> units<00:03:09.409> we<00:03:09.739> can<00:03:09.889> use

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
produce the number of units we can use

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.080 
produce the number of units we can use
to<00:03:10.189> attack<00:03:12.400> another<00:03:13.400> problem<00:03:13.819> that<00:03:13.849> we'll

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
to attack another problem that we'll

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.990 
to attack another problem that we'll
have<00:03:14.269> is<00:03:14.780> with<00:03:15.199> our<00:03:15.560> workers<00:03:16.189> we<00:03:16.669> just<00:03:16.849> don't

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
have is with our workers we just don't

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.879 
have is with our workers we just don't
have<00:03:17.060> enough<00:03:17.120> workers<00:03:17.540> for<00:03:18.049> three<00:03:18.229> cities<00:03:18.560> but

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
have enough workers for three cities but

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:20.349 
have enough workers for three cities but
we<00:03:19.099> don't<00:03:19.280> have<00:03:19.370> time<00:03:19.489> to<00:03:19.639> build<00:03:19.729> anymore

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
we don't have time to build anymore

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.659 
we don't have time to build anymore
so<00:03:21.019> we'll<00:03:21.409> just<00:03:21.530> actually<00:03:22.009> have<00:03:22.129> to<00:03:22.280> end<00:03:22.579> up

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
so we'll just actually have to end up

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.550 
so we'll just actually have to end up
sucking<00:03:22.909> it<00:03:23.120> up<00:03:23.209> and<00:03:23.479> you<00:03:24.109> know<00:03:24.199> making<00:03:24.379> our

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
sucking it up and you know making our

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.520 
sucking it up and you know making our
workers<00:03:24.829> work<00:03:25.040> overtime<00:03:26.109> we'll<00:03:27.109> also<00:03:27.290> be

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
workers work overtime we'll also be

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.670 
workers work overtime we'll also be
doing<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.829> liberal<00:03:28.220> amount<00:03:28.459> of<00:03:30.189> actually

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
doing a liberal amount of actually

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.530 
doing a liberal amount of actually
slavery<00:03:33.680> so<00:03:33.979> without<00:03:34.310> our<00:03:34.549> useful<00:03:35.180> buildings

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
slavery so without our useful buildings

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.449 
slavery so without our useful buildings
so<00:03:35.930> we'll<00:03:36.259> definitely<00:03:36.379> switch<00:03:36.799> in<00:03:36.979> and<00:03:37.099> out<00:03:37.220> of

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
so we'll definitely switch in and out of

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.610 
so we'll definitely switch in and out of
hammer<00:03:37.699> configurations<00:03:38.449> and<00:03:38.810> growth

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
hammer configurations and growth

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.189 
hammer configurations and growth
configurations<00:03:40.340> -<00:03:41.150> alternately<00:03:41.750> get<00:03:41.989> to

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:42.199 
configurations - alternately get to

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:45.339 
configurations - alternately get to
slavery<00:03:42.829> whipping<00:03:43.310> points<00:03:43.639> and<00:03:44.199> so<00:03:45.199> if<00:03:45.259> you

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
slavery whipping points and so if you

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.020 
slavery whipping points and so if you
see<00:03:45.560> me<00:03:45.709> doing<00:03:45.919> a<00:03:46.069> lot<00:03:46.220> of<00:03:46.340> management<00:03:46.639> on<00:03:47.000> the

ahead and move to a growth configuration

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.060 
ahead and move to a growth configuration
and<00:04:21.479> we'll<00:04:21.840> prioritize<00:04:22.079> a<00:04:22.470> barracks<00:04:22.919> after

this<00:04:25.400> mound<00:04:26.400> city<00:04:26.820> looks<00:04:27.060> like<00:04:27.330> it's<00:04:27.509> going<00:04:27.690> to

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
this mound city looks like it's going to

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.689 
this mound city looks like it's going to
need<00:04:27.870> another<00:04:27.960> three<00:04:28.500> turns<00:04:28.740> before<00:04:29.130> we<00:04:29.460> can

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
need another three turns before we can

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:32.450 
need another three turns before we can
start<00:04:30.389> working<00:04:30.539> stuff<00:04:30.930> and<00:04:31.169> actually<00:04:32.009> we'll

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
start working stuff and actually we'll

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.010 
start working stuff and actually we'll
go<00:04:32.580> ahead<00:04:32.699> and<00:04:32.820> starve<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.360> city<00:04:33.570> of<00:04:33.690> it<00:04:33.810> just

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
go ahead and starve the city of it just

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.320 
go ahead and starve the city of it just
so<00:04:34.110> we<00:04:34.199> can<00:04:34.289> work<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:34.710> gold<00:04:35.190> which<00:04:36.000> is<00:04:36.120> a<00:04:36.180> very

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
so we can work the gold which is a very

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.710 
so we can work the gold which is a very
powerful<00:04:37.190> tile<00:04:38.190> so<00:04:39.090> try<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.300> work<00:04:39.449> that<00:04:39.570> as

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
powerful tile so try to work that as

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:47.230 
powerful tile so try to work that as
much<00:04:39.900> as<00:04:40.020> possible

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.460 

gold<00:04:48.240> will<00:04:48.360> help<00:04:48.570> out<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:48.720> lot<00:04:48.990> because<00:04:49.199> it

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
gold will help out a lot because it

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.050 
gold will help out a lot because it
gives<00:04:49.590> us<00:04:49.740> some<00:04:49.860> additional<00:04:50.160> happiness<00:04:50.849> and

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
gives us some additional happiness and

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.029 
gives us some additional happiness and
that'll<00:04:51.960> be<00:04:52.050> a<00:04:52.080> big<00:04:52.289> deal<00:04:52.470> since<00:04:52.710> we'll<00:04:52.919> be

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
that'll be a big deal since we'll be

00:04:53.039 --> 00:05:00.350 
that'll be a big deal since we'll be
doing<00:04:53.220> a<00:04:53.280> lot<00:04:53.430> of<00:04:53.460> whipping<00:04:58.610> we<00:04:59.610> only<00:04:59.729> need<00:05:00.000> I

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
doing a lot of whipping we only need I

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.029 
doing a lot of whipping we only need I
guess<00:05:00.599> looks<00:05:00.810> like<00:05:00.930> six<00:05:01.139> hammers<00:05:01.500> so<00:05:01.770> we<00:05:01.860> can

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
guess looks like six hammers so we can

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:03.710 
guess looks like six hammers so we can
move<00:05:02.160> to<00:05:02.310> a<00:05:02.370> three<00:05:02.580> hammer<00:05:02.789> configuration<00:05:03.479> we

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
move to a three hammer configuration we

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.060 
move to a three hammer configuration we
do<00:05:03.840> have<00:05:03.960> one<00:05:04.139> there<00:05:04.380> so<00:05:05.360> we'll<00:05:06.360> do<00:05:06.509> that<00:05:07.070> this

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
do have one there so we'll do that this

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.260 
do have one there so we'll do that this
guy's<00:05:08.340> going<00:05:08.520> to<00:05:08.580> go<00:05:08.699> up<00:05:08.820> and<00:05:08.940> try<00:05:09.090> to<00:05:09.150> get

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
guy's going to go up and try to get

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.120 
guy's going to go up and try to get
these<00:05:09.419> gems<00:05:09.780> online<00:05:10.199> so<00:05:10.440> we<00:05:10.530> can<00:05:10.680> work<00:05:10.830> them<00:05:10.979> as

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
these gems online so we can work them as

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.129 
these gems online so we can work them as
long<00:05:11.220> as<00:05:11.400> possible<00:05:11.880> while<00:05:12.090> we<00:05:12.240> get<00:05:12.389> the<00:05:12.630> while

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
long as possible while we get the while

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:18.860 
long as possible while we get the while
we<00:05:13.259> have<00:05:13.409> it<00:05:13.440> in<00:05:13.680> our<00:05:13.770> borders<00:05:17.750> I'm<00:05:18.750> actually

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
we have it in our borders I'm actually

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.860 
we have it in our borders I'm actually
going<00:05:19.110> to<00:05:19.199> shift<00:05:19.560> our<00:05:20.210> spawn<00:05:21.210> busting<00:05:21.570> units

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
going to shift our spawn busting units

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.740 
going to shift our spawn busting units
one<00:05:22.860> to<00:05:23.099> the<00:05:23.190> east<00:05:23.400> so<00:05:23.940> that<00:05:24.120> we<00:05:24.210> get<00:05:24.509> more<00:05:24.570> of

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
one to the east so that we get more of

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.680 
one to the east so that we get more of
this<00:05:24.930> peninsula<00:05:25.110> uncovered<00:05:25.680> at<00:05:25.860> the<00:05:25.979> cost<00:05:26.220> of

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
this peninsula uncovered at the cost of

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.760 
this peninsula uncovered at the cost of
allowing<00:05:27.690> barbarians<00:05:28.050> to<00:05:28.139> spawn<00:05:28.349> to<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:28.590> west

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
allowing barbarians to spawn to the west

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.409 
allowing barbarians to spawn to the west
you<00:05:29.120> can<00:05:30.120> see<00:05:30.210> as<00:05:30.810> I<00:05:31.500> speak<00:05:32.360> there<00:05:33.360> are

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
you can see as I speak there are

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.680 
you can see as I speak there are
barbarians<00:05:33.870> giving<00:05:34.440> us<00:05:34.530> some<00:05:34.680> trouble<00:05:34.919> in<00:05:35.690> in

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
barbarians giving us some trouble in in

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.899 
barbarians giving us some trouble in in
the<00:05:37.440> southeast<00:05:37.889> well<00:05:38.130> hopefully<00:05:38.370> that<00:05:38.669> Archer

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
the southeast well hopefully that Archer

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:42.920 
the southeast well hopefully that Archer
will<00:05:39.030> attack<00:05:39.300> us<00:05:39.330> so<00:05:39.720> and<00:05:40.409> what<00:05:41.340> happened<00:05:41.849> here

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
will attack us so and what happened here

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.360 
will attack us so and what happened here
looks<00:05:43.380> like<00:05:43.470> the<00:05:43.590> French<00:05:43.860> took<00:05:44.039> these<00:05:44.220> two

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
looks like the French took these two

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.820 
looks like the French took these two
tiles<00:05:44.610> from<00:05:44.789> us<00:05:45.229> that's<00:05:46.229> a<00:05:46.320> big<00:05:46.469> deal<00:05:46.650> because

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
tiles from us that's a big deal because

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.159 
tiles from us that's a big deal because
they<00:05:47.250> got<00:05:47.370> the<00:05:47.490> farm<00:05:47.759> from<00:05:48.180> us<00:05:48.360> and<00:05:48.630> they<00:05:49.050> took

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 
they got the farm from us and they took

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.850 
they got the farm from us and they took
the<00:05:49.320> farm<00:05:49.560> up<00:05:49.860> and<00:05:51.199> I'm<00:05:52.199> not<00:05:52.409> really<00:05:52.530> sure<00:05:52.740> how

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
the farm up and I'm not really sure how

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.010 
the farm up and I'm not really sure how
this<00:05:52.889> border<00:05:53.340> came<00:05:53.580> up<00:05:53.729> it's<00:05:54.419> just<00:05:54.570> not<00:05:54.870> a

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
this border came up it's just not a

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.050 
this border came up it's just not a
border<00:05:55.380> that<00:05:55.409> you<00:05:55.500> normally<00:05:55.620> see<00:05:55.889> and<00:05:56.370> I<00:05:56.639> guess

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
border that you normally see and I guess

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.110 
border that you normally see and I guess
maybe<00:05:57.240> I'm<00:05:58.370> we<00:05:59.370> have<00:05:59.490> more<00:05:59.729> influence<00:05:59.909> on

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
maybe I'm we have more influence on

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.339 
maybe I'm we have more influence on
these<00:06:00.300> two<00:06:00.449> tiles<00:06:00.599> I'm<00:06:00.780> not<00:06:00.900> really<00:06:01.020> sure<00:06:01.199> how

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:01.349 
these two tiles I'm not really sure how

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:03.499 
these two tiles I'm not really sure how
that<00:06:01.409> happened<00:06:01.620> at<00:06:01.889> all<00:06:02.120> so<00:06:03.120> maybe<00:06:03.360> they

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
that happened at all so maybe they

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:05.629 
that happened at all so maybe they
founded<00:06:03.780> another<00:06:03.990> city<00:06:04.400> this<00:06:05.400> might

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 
founded another city this might

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:10.879 
founded another city this might
definitely<00:06:05.849> bias<00:06:06.539> our<00:06:06.930> war<00:06:07.560> on<00:06:09.770> preference<00:06:10.770> we

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889 
definitely bias our war on preference we

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:11.959 
definitely bias our war on preference we
might<00:06:11.070> want<00:06:11.219> to<00:06:11.250> go<00:06:11.340> to<00:06:11.400> war<00:06:11.580> with<00:06:11.699> the<00:06:11.789> Gaul

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:11.969 
might want to go to war with the Gaul

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:13.370 
might want to go to war with the Gaul
because<00:06:12.240> of<00:06:12.360> these<00:06:12.449> two<00:06:12.599> tiles<00:06:12.810> get<00:06:13.080> taken

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
because of these two tiles get taken

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.570 
because of these two tiles get taken
from<00:06:13.500> us<00:06:13.620> those<00:06:13.770> are<00:06:13.860> important<00:06:14.190> tiles<00:06:14.370> to

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
from us those are important tiles to

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.560 
from us those are important tiles to
mound<00:06:14.760> city

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570 
mound city

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.480 
mound city
so<00:06:16.020> we'll<00:06:16.320> think<00:06:16.440> about<00:06:16.590> that<00:06:16.740> in<00:06:17.400> the

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
so we'll think about that in the

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:18.920 
so we'll think about that in the
meantime<00:06:17.670> we<00:06:17.940> do<00:06:18.030> have<00:06:18.150> to<00:06:18.270> switch<00:06:18.480> up<00:06:18.720> and

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
meantime we do have to switch up and

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.110 
meantime we do have to switch up and
work<00:06:19.320> you<00:06:19.710> know<00:06:19.800> different<00:06:20.160> tiles<00:06:20.520> for<00:06:20.760> forms

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
work you know different tiles for forms

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.960 
work you know different tiles for forms
and<00:06:22.130> that's<00:06:23.130> going<00:06:23.280> to<00:06:23.340> set<00:06:23.520> us<00:06:23.610> back<00:06:23.790> in

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
and that's going to set us back in

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.190 
and that's going to set us back in
Mountain<00:06:24.090> City<00:06:24.360> by<00:06:24.510> a<00:06:24.540> little<00:06:24.780> bit<00:06:24.900> it's

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
Mountain City by a little bit it's

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.980 
Mountain City by a little bit it's
unfortunate<00:06:28.700> we<00:06:29.700> begin<00:06:29.940> wit<00:06:30.120> now<00:06:30.270> yes<00:06:30.600> we<00:06:30.780> can

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
unfortunate we begin wit now yes we can

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.840 
unfortunate we begin wit now yes we can
go<00:06:31.710> to<00:06:31.770> the<00:06:31.890> growth<00:06:32.100> configuration<00:06:32.670> you<00:06:32.760> can

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:32.850 
go to the growth configuration you can

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.250 
go to the growth configuration you can
see<00:06:33.060> who<00:06:33.450> would<00:06:33.540> have<00:06:33.660> grown<00:06:33.900> we<00:06:34.050> would<00:06:34.170> have

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260 
see who would have grown we would have

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.690 
see who would have grown we would have
been<00:06:34.350> able<00:06:34.500> to<00:06:34.590> work<00:06:34.830> the<00:06:34.980> fourth<00:06:35.220> we<00:06:35.340> try<00:06:35.550> we

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:35.700 
been able to work the fourth we try we

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.540 
been able to work the fourth we try we
can't<00:06:35.880> do<00:06:35.970> that<00:06:36.090> anymore<00:06:36.150> that's<00:06:36.660> really<00:06:37.200> a

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.550 
can't do that anymore that's really a

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.780 
can't do that anymore that's really a
bummer

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:38.790 
bummer

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:45.980 
bummer
so<00:06:43.910> probably<00:06:44.910> have<00:06:45.060> enough<00:06:45.270> gold<00:06:45.510> to<00:06:45.720> research

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990 
so probably have enough gold to research

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.080 
so probably have enough gold to research
mathematics<00:06:46.530> now<00:06:46.680> and<00:06:46.920> hey<00:06:47.190> look<00:06:47.460> we<00:06:47.580> met<00:06:47.970> the

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.090 
mathematics now and hey look we met the

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.200 
mathematics now and hey look we met the
last<00:06:48.120> Civ<00:06:48.540> scary's<00:06:49.140> the<00:06:49.320> first<00:06:49.770> I<00:06:50.210> haven't

last Civ scary's the first I haven't

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.350 
last Civ scary's the first I haven't
played<00:06:51.630> with<00:06:51.900> him<00:06:52.050> too<00:06:52.350> much<00:06:52.530> I<00:06:53.030> know<00:06:54.030> that<00:06:54.300> he

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 
played with him too much I know that he

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.210 
played with him too much I know that he
builds<00:06:54.630> fewer<00:06:54.930> units<00:06:55.140> and<00:06:55.500> Cyrus<00:06:55.920> the<00:06:56.100> other

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220 
builds fewer units and Cyrus the other

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.250 
builds fewer units and Cyrus the other
Persian<00:06:56.640> leader<00:06:56.820> but<00:06:57.750> I<00:06:57.780> don't<00:06:57.960> know<00:06:58.050> a<00:06:58.080> whole

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:58.260 
Persian leader but I don't know a whole

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.410 
Persian leader but I don't know a whole
lot<00:06:58.320> about<00:06:58.530> him<00:06:58.920> since<00:06:59.640> he's<00:06:59.820> not<00:07:00.000> too<00:07:00.180> close

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:00.420 
lot about him since he's not too close

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.510 
lot about him since he's not too close
to<00:07:00.540> us<00:07:00.690> he's<00:07:00.840> not<00:07:01.020> really<00:07:01.400> impacting<00:07:02.400> our

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 
to us he's not really impacting our

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.460 
to us he's not really impacting our
immediate<00:07:02.760> strategy<00:07:03.390> if<00:07:03.840> this<00:07:04.050> were<00:07:04.200> a<00:07:04.260> full

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:04.470 
immediate strategy if this were a full

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:05.720 
immediate strategy if this were a full
playthrough<00:07:04.710> I<00:07:04.950> would<00:07:05.190> definitely<00:07:05.520> look<00:07:05.640> up

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:05.730 
playthrough I would definitely look up

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.120 
playthrough I would definitely look up
his<00:07:05.910> xml<00:07:06.330> values<00:07:06.660> right<00:07:06.870> now<00:07:07.020> and<00:07:07.290> incorporate

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.130 
his xml values right now and incorporate

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.950 
his xml values right now and incorporate
him<00:07:08.280> into<00:07:08.490> our<00:07:08.580> strategy<00:07:08.790> but<00:07:09.570> since<00:07:09.780> it's<00:07:09.900> not

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 
him into our strategy but since it's not

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.450 
him into our strategy but since it's not
pressing<00:07:10.260> at<00:07:10.590> the<00:07:10.740> moment<00:07:11.040> we're<00:07:11.190> just<00:07:11.340> going

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:11.460 
pressing at the moment we're just going

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:16.010 
pressing at the moment we're just going
to<00:07:11.750> roll<00:07:12.750> with<00:07:12.900> it<00:07:12.930> and<00:07:14.600> it'll<00:07:15.600> weaken<00:07:15.900> our

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:16.020 
to roll with it and it'll weaken our

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.660 
to roll with it and it'll weaken our
strategy<00:07:16.440> for<00:07:16.650> diplomacy<00:07:17.040> but<00:07:17.280> we<00:07:17.400> don't

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:17.670 
strategy for diplomacy but we don't

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:18.710 
strategy for diplomacy but we don't
really<00:07:17.760> need<00:07:17.910> to<00:07:18.030> be<00:07:18.120> concerned<00:07:18.240> with<00:07:18.540> them

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 
really need to be concerned with them

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:41.309 
really need to be concerned with them
too<00:07:18.870> much<00:07:19.020> just<00:07:19.560> yet<00:07:19.770> so

00:07:41.309 --> 00:07:41.319 

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:44.229 

and<00:07:42.580> we're<00:07:43.580> going<00:07:43.699> to<00:07:43.759> give<00:07:43.879> this<00:07:43.999> guy<00:07:44.209> a

00:07:44.229 --> 00:07:44.239 
and we're going to give this guy a

00:07:44.239 --> 00:07:45.820 
and we're going to give this guy a
strength<00:07:44.899> promotion<00:07:45.379> just<00:07:45.589> because<00:07:45.739> you

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:45.830 
strength promotion just because you

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.019 
strength promotion just because you
might<00:07:45.979> be<00:07:46.069> doing<00:07:46.159> battle<00:07:46.549> with<00:07:46.639> all<00:07:46.759> sorts<00:07:46.969> of

00:07:47.019 --> 00:07:47.029 
might be doing battle with all sorts of

00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:48.999 
might be doing battle with all sorts of
piles<00:07:47.239> down<00:07:47.449> here<00:07:47.689> and<00:07:47.869> I<00:07:48.469> believe<00:07:48.739> we<00:07:48.889> have

00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:49.009 
piles down here and I believe we have

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:51.309 
piles down here and I believe we have
most<00:07:49.309> of<00:07:49.429> this<00:07:49.579> peninsula<00:07:49.819> fob<00:07:50.269> spawn<00:07:50.899> busted

00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:51.319 
most of this peninsula fob spawn busted

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:54.339 
most of this peninsula fob spawn busted
down<00:07:51.469> so<00:07:51.739> that's<00:07:51.799> good<00:07:52.069> for<00:07:52.099> us<00:07:53.229> we're<00:07:54.229> going

00:07:54.339 --> 00:07:54.349 
down so that's good for us we're going

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:56.049 
down so that's good for us we're going
to<00:07:54.409> whip<00:07:54.529> this<00:07:54.649> barracks<00:07:55.129> right<00:07:55.459> when<00:07:55.759> the

00:07:56.049 --> 00:07:56.059 
to whip this barracks right when the

00:07:56.059 --> 00:08:02.679 
to whip this barracks right when the
mind<00:07:56.299> gets<00:07:56.509> online<00:07:57.339> so<00:08:00.459> in<00:08:01.459> three<00:08:02.299> turns<00:08:02.509> we

00:08:02.679 --> 00:08:02.689 
mind gets online so in three turns we

00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:04.089 
mind gets online so in three turns we
should<00:08:02.839> probably<00:08:02.989> have<00:08:03.379> enough<00:08:03.589> hammers<00:08:03.949> to

00:08:04.089 --> 00:08:04.099 
should probably have enough hammers to

00:08:04.099 --> 00:08:08.979 
should probably have enough hammers to
get<00:08:04.219> that<00:08:04.369> whipped<00:08:06.339> and<00:08:07.599> we'll<00:08:08.599> have<00:08:08.719> a<00:08:08.749> hammer

00:08:08.979 --> 00:08:08.989 
get that whipped and we'll have a hammer
