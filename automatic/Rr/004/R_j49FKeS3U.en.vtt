00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
using my fingertips I think that this

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.170

really helps to warm this product up

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.149 
really helps to warm this product up
because<00:03:08.599> it<00:03:08.750> is<00:03:08.780> pretty<00:03:09.260> thick<00:03:09.739> in<00:03:09.980> its

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
because it is pretty thick in its

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.030 
because it is pretty thick in its
consistency<00:03:11.000> now<00:03:11.780> when<00:03:12.349> you<00:03:12.439> think<00:03:12.650> of<00:03:12.739> a<00:03:12.829> mask

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
consistency now when you think of a mask

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.409 
consistency now when you think of a mask
you<00:03:13.250> think<00:03:13.489> is<00:03:13.579> something<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:14.090> you<00:03:14.239> would

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
saw instant results so I'm assuming if

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.319

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
you use a lip scrub I mean it can only

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.869 
you use a lip scrub I mean it can only
get<00:03:56.720> better<00:03:56.989> than<00:03:57.530> that<00:03:57.680> but<00:03:58.370> like<00:03:58.609> I<00:03:58.639> said<00:03:58.849> a

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
get better than that but like I said a

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.460 
get better than that but like I said a
