00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
of need more people to know about it you

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.060 
of need more people to know about it you
know<00:01:13.490> that<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.520> i<00:01:15.150> say<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:16.049> with<00:01:16.290> reluctance

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
know that I i say this with reluctance

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.170 
know that I i say this with reluctance
but<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:18.710> kind<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.830> think<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.189> we<00:01:20.340> need<00:01:20.369> help<00:01:20.820> a

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
but I kind of think that we need help a

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.990 
but I kind of think that we need help a
little<00:01:22.049> bit<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.590> mean<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.189> know<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.700> you

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
little bit I mean I I know that you

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.899 
little bit I mean I I know that you
don't<00:01:24.210> want<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.570> ask<00:01:24.750> for<00:01:24.960> help<00:01:25.110> you'd<00:01:25.909> rather

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
don't want to ask for help you'd rather

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.140 
don't want to ask for help you'd rather
just<00:01:27.060> complain<00:01:27.689> about<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:28.229> but<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.740> think<00:01:29.700> we

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
just complain about it but I think we

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.609 
just complain about it but I think we
need<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:32.119> maybe<00:01:33.119> if<00:01:33.270> we<00:01:33.299> do<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.600> video<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:34.259> a

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
need it maybe if we do a video just a

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.120 
need it maybe if we do a video just a
skimpy<00:01:35.009> was<00:01:35.310> just<00:01:35.520> retweet<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.240> or<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.750> know
