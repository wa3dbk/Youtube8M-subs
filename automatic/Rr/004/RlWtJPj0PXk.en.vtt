00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
because it's a little tricky how this

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.569 
because it's a little tricky how this
works<00:00:46.520> and<00:00:48.559> these<00:00:49.559> are<00:00:49.620> tiebreaker<00:00:50.190> questions

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
works and these are tiebreaker questions

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.160 
works and these are tiebreaker questions
which<00:00:50.730> just<00:00:51.030> took<00:00:51.149> sup<00:00:51.329> strings<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.020> can

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
which just took sup strings and you can

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.439 
which just took sup strings and you can
evaluate<00:00:52.350> later<00:00:52.739> here's<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.610> leaderboard

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
evaluate later here's the leaderboard

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.720 
evaluate later here's the leaderboard
which<00:00:54.750> calculates<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.980> points<00:00:56.280> each<00:00:56.399> person

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
which calculates the points each person

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.160 
which calculates the points each person
has<00:00:56.879> based<00:00:57.239> on<00:00:57.449> which<00:00:57.660> games<00:00:57.870> have<00:00:58.050> already

been won so that would change all the
points<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:01.980> here<00:01:02.160> after<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:02.820> hit<00:01:02.940> update

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
points in here after we hit update

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.899 
points in here after we hit update
leaderboard<00:01:03.840> which<00:01:04.799> we<00:01:05.250> would<00:01:05.400> do<00:01:05.610> down<00:01:05.880> here

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
leaderboard which we would do down here

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.880 
leaderboard which we would do down here
he<00:01:06.869> uses<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> wp<00:01:07.830> surveys<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:09.560> we<00:01:10.560> hit<00:01:10.710> update

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
possible points that have already been

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:30.470 
possible points that have already been
played<00:02:24.230> it<00:02:25.230> will<00:02:27.830> so<00:02:28.830> this<00:02:29.100> person<00:02:29.340> has<00:02:29.670> 220

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
played it will so this person has 220

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.060 
played it will so this person has 220
points<00:02:30.660> because<00:02:31.140> they<00:02:31.290> got<00:02:31.440> most<00:02:31.740> of<00:02:31.920> the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
points because they got most of the

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:41.650 
points because they got most of the
right<00:02:36.110> anyway<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.880> that's<00:02:38.880> how<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.180> works<00:02:40.340> I

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
right anyway and that's how that works I

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.180 
right anyway and that's how that works I
think<00:02:42.660> there's<00:02:42.780> too<00:02:42.900> much<00:02:42.990> more<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.350> go<00:02:43.500> over

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
think there's too much more to go over

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.010 
think there's too much more to go over
you<00:02:47.190> do<00:02:47.370> have<00:02:47.550> to<00:02:47.760> enable<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.270> widget<00:02:48.630> that's

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
you do have to enable the widget that's

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.620 
you do have to enable the widget that's
important<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.740> note<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:50.520> have<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.060> create
