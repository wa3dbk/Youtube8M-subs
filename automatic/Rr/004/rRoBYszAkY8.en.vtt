00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 once on the moon an unusual baby was born 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:10.139
 I was born and it happened that he got 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.170

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:17.550

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:44.489
 I donâ€™t even want to walk better 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:47.550

 something I did not understand it well and no legs 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:01.170
 Baba Capa said that the mood depends 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.830
 from the leg with which you stand on that 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.160
 hordes 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:08.370
 it's just like that 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.980
 mood depends on a variety of things 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.710
 mean this whole story with legs is nonsense 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.710
 [music] 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:20.690

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.860
 I forgot about everything with these legs 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.860
 [music]
