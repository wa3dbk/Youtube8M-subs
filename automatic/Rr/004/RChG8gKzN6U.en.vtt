00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 Hello 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:23.750
 what happens friends and subscribers of your ex 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:25.640
 another novelty I am traking and good 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.050
 this time I'm going to help 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.420
 fix the problem that they have several 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.730
 with the call of duty that tells you that 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.250
 the servers do not serve things like that and 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.050
 Well this is because your model or 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.600
 router can not solve all the dns 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.410
 that brings on for example can be your 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.390
 tablet holder the ipad 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.160
 so if you do not want to do this that 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.870
 I'm going to say try to disconnect 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.420
 how many devices to see if to the 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.430
 good scale then let's go right now 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.340
 change our dns 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.340
 let's confirm network we go to the network that 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.990
 let's be connected let's go again to 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.340
 set up the network and we go here up 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.030
 down in the configuration tab 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:09.170
 basic where dns configuration says 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:11.730
 let's manual the tab below and 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.490
 good as you will see here I already have it 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.560
 because as it has set are 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.590
 they are google dns that are especially 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.260
 to increase your internet speed and 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:27.030
 good as you see the first one is 8.8 point 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.930
 8.8 and the second 8.8 points 4.4 other 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.260
 I'm going to leave them in the 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.860
 description so that there they expose it 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:38.940
 we give ready and good we like to disconnect 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.640
 there is no longer disconnect and good what 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.140
 what's next we're going to start another session 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.510
 time 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.700
 or just connect him to xbox live 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.590
 It is not going to take much longer to be 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.909
 suppose there will be if the internet is faster 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.880
 but what he's doing right now is that 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.430
 your signal is entering your modem 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.270
 xbox to connect to the internet and 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.579

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.259

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:05.140
