pretty cool so I'll show you how to make

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.490 
pretty cool so I'll show you how to make
the<00:00:26.580> brushes<00:00:26.970> versus<00:00:27.420> what<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.750> regular

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
the brushes versus what the regular

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.269 
the brushes versus what the regular
papers<00:00:29.039> looks<00:00:29.279> like<00:00:29.460> before<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:31.279> couldn't

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
papers looks like before you couldn't

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.889

die<00:00:32.399> on<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.730> essentially<00:00:33.540> because<00:00:33.690> that's<00:00:33.840> how

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
die on it essentially because that's how

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.600 
die on it essentially because that's how
it<00:00:33.960> works<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.590> don't<00:00:34.739> get<00:00:34.800> pop<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.460> this

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
it works you don't get pop in and this

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.220 
it works you don't get pop in and this
is<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.940> paint<00:00:36.239> chip<00:00:36.480> Earl<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.719> takes<00:00:36.930> away

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
is the paint chip Earl it takes away

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.630 
is the paint chip Earl it takes away
i'll<00:00:37.800> show<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.040> how<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.160> make<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.399> as<00:00:38.489> well

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
i'll show you how to make that as well

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.010 
i'll show you how to make that as well
but<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.000> first<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.390> all<00:00:39.450> start<00:00:39.750> with<00:00:39.840> some

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
but you first of all start with some

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.440 
but you first of all start with some
sticks<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.500> some<00:00:40.680> oil<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:42.059> gives<00:00:42.329> you

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
sticks in some oil and that gives you

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.990 
sticks in some oil and that gives you
the<00:00:42.690> paintbrush<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:44.250> we<00:00:45.120> can<00:00:45.329> make<00:00:45.450> these<00:00:47.000> and
