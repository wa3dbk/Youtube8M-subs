00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
really like a blasian here it's a little

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.029 
really like a blasian here it's a little
bit<00:02:00.579> thicker<00:02:00.909> than<00:02:01.180> your<00:02:01.329> indian<00:02:01.689> remy<00:02:01.960> so<00:02:02.649> it

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
bit thicker than your indian remy so it

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.330 
bit thicker than your indian remy so it
looks<00:02:03.430> a<00:02:03.579> little<00:02:03.759> more<00:02:04.149> yakky<00:02:04.780> but<00:02:05.680> by<00:02:06.280> no

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
looks a little more yakky but by no

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.270 
looks a little more yakky but by no
means<00:02:06.520> is<00:02:07.090> it<00:02:07.119> yakky<00:02:07.509> okay<00:02:08.019> it<00:02:08.289> just<00:02:08.649> looks<00:02:08.950> a

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
means is it yakky okay it just looks a

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.660 
means is it yakky okay it just looks a
little<00:02:09.519> more<00:02:09.789> all<00:02:10.090> coarser<00:02:11.019> and<00:02:11.260> so<00:02:11.920> it<00:02:12.099> is

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
little more all coarser and so it is

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.290 
little more all coarser and so it is
more<00:02:13.090> believable<00:02:13.390> but<00:02:14.050> anyway<00:02:14.970> this<00:02:15.970> is<00:02:16.269> my

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
more believable but anyway this is my

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.589 
more believable but anyway this is my

closure or close and I see that it looks

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.800 
closure or close and I see that it looks
