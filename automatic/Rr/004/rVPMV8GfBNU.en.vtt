00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
disaster to be honest I tried to dye a

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.310 
disaster to be honest I tried to dye a
figure<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:21.150> dye<00:00:21.330> didn't<00:00:21.689> take<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
figure and the dye didn't take and the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.380 
figure and the dye didn't take and the
figure<00:00:22.619> warped<00:00:23.130> because<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.730> hot<00:00:24.000> water

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
figure warped because of the hot water

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.980 
figure warped because of the hot water
and<00:00:24.859> I<00:00:25.859> had<00:00:26.279> this<00:00:26.550> pretty<00:00:26.820> much<00:00:27.000> start<00:00:27.390> over

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
and I had this pretty much start over

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.859 
and I had this pretty much start over
again<00:00:28.050> on<00:00:28.410> some<00:00:28.590> aspects<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.400> but<00:00:29.869> feeling

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
again on some aspects of it but feeling

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.350 
again on some aspects of it but feeling
a<00:00:30.929> bit<00:00:31.080> more<00:00:31.260> positive<00:00:31.470> today<00:00:31.969> going<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.059> be

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
a bit more positive today going to be

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.780 
a bit more positive today going to be
trying<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.230> make<00:00:34.380> some<00:00:34.710> progress<00:00:35.010> as<00:00:35.430> far<00:00:35.640> as

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
actually making that base body start to

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.209 
actually making that base body start to
look<00:00:39.000> like<00:00:39.410> shredder<00:00:40.410> I'm<00:00:40.649> going<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.100> be

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
look like shredder I'm going to be

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.639 
look like shredder I'm going to be
starting<00:00:41.610> again<00:00:42.600> going<00:00:43.020> back<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.230> my<00:00:43.469> design

I'm<00:00:57.750> going<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:57.989> be<00:00:58.109> using<00:00:58.350> fabric<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.980> do<00:00:59.129> that

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
I'm going to be using fabric to do that

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.830 
I'm going to be using fabric to do that
much<00:00:59.579> in<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.789> same<00:00:59.940> way<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.149> did<00:01:00.270> with<00:01:00.600> my

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
much in the same way I did with my

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.470 
much in the same way I did with my
Doctor<00:01:01.800> Doom<00:01:01.980> fire<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.789> his<00:01:03.030> legs<00:01:03.270> could

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
Doctor Doom fire so that his legs could

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.170 
Doctor Doom fire so that his legs could
still<00:01:03.750> articulate<00:01:04.470> fully<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:05.220> actual

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
still articulate fully in actual

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.640 
still articulate fully in actual
production<00:01:06.510> toys<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.049> would<00:01:07.140> use<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> soft

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
production toys that would use a soft

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.380 
production toys that would use a soft
rubber<00:01:07.799> but<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.189> don't<00:01:08.400> have<00:01:08.490> access<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> lot

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
rubber but I don't have access to a lot

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.929 
rubber but I don't have access to a lot
of<00:01:09.740> resources<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:11.189> make<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.369> kind<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.760> thing

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
of resources to make that kind of thing

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.820 
of resources to make that kind of thing
so<00:01:11.970> it's<00:01:12.240> caught<00:01:12.479> I'm<00:01:12.780> going<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.080> be<00:01:13.170> using<00:01:13.320> so

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
so it's caught I'm going to be using so

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.800 
so it's caught I'm going to be using so
here's<00:01:14.010> my<00:01:14.159> base<00:01:14.490> figure<00:01:14.790> I've<00:01:15.119> sanded<00:01:15.420> down<00:01:15.630> a

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
here's my base figure I've sanded down a

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.810 
here's my base figure I've sanded down a
lot<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.259> her<00:01:16.350> around<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:16.830> crotch<00:01:17.220> area<00:01:17.610> and

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
lot of her around this crotch area and

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.030 
lot of her around this crotch area and
I'm<00:01:18.659> going<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.900> be<00:01:19.020> attaching<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.530> fabric

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
I'm going to be attaching the fabric

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.210 
I'm going to be attaching the fabric
around<00:01:20.580> here<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.570> then<00:01:22.290> I'll<00:01:22.530> hang<00:01:22.740> down<00:01:22.979> over

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
around here and then I'll hang down over

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.630 
around here and then I'll hang down over
his<00:01:24.170> legs<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.530> then<00:01:25.950> hopefully<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.430> cloth

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
his legs and then hopefully the cloth

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.850 
his legs and then hopefully the cloth
will<00:01:26.909> am<00:01:27.570> Elohim<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.020> articulate<00:01:28.680> I've

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
will am Elohim to articulate I've

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.530 
will am Elohim to articulate I've
actually<00:01:29.070> sanded<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.759> lot<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.119> bets<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.450> I

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
actually sanded a lot of the bets that I

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.630 
actually sanded a lot of the bets that I
think<00:01:30.810> would<00:01:31.020> suffer<00:01:31.409> from<00:01:31.439> pain<00:01:31.829> rub<00:01:32.070> around

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
think would suffer from pain rub around

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.940 
think would suffer from pain rub around
there<00:01:33.180> here<00:01:33.750> which<00:01:33.990> was<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.229> best<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.560> wanted

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
there here which was the best I wanted

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.740 
there here which was the best I wanted
to<00:01:35.070> die<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.549> I've<00:01:35.939> gone<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.329> with<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> red

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
to die and I've gone in with a red

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.190 
to die and I've gone in with a red
sharpie<00:01:37.250> over<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.369> sand<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:39.060> areas<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
sharpie over the sand it areas and the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.200 
sharpie over the sand it areas and the
plastic<00:01:40.860> because<00:01:41.250> it's<00:01:41.400> no<00:01:41.549> sign<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:41.970> seems

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
plastic because it's no sign that seems

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.200 
plastic because it's no sign that seems
to<00:01:42.390> take<00:01:42.710> red<00:01:43.710> sharpie<00:01:44.159> quite<00:01:44.549> well<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:44.970> maybe

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
to take red sharpie quite well so maybe

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.350 
to take red sharpie quite well so maybe
that's<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.570> solution<00:01:45.780> for<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.799> future<00:01:47.360> I've

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
that's a solution for the future I've

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.039 
that's a solution for the future I've
done<00:01:48.630> again<00:01:48.990> here<00:01:49.409> on<00:01:50.189> his<00:01:50.700> knees<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.689> know<00:01:51.840> if

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
done again here on his knees you know if

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.020 
done again here on his knees you know if
they're<00:01:52.380> going<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.070> sun<00:01:53.280> paper<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.820> their

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
they're going on a sun paper in their

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.850 
they're going on a sun paper in their
novella<00:01:54.360> Dremel<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.899> then<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:55.530> called<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
novella Dremel and then just called the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.980 
novella Dremel and then just called the
endless<00:01:56.070> ledge<00:01:56.340> happy<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:57.450> hopefully<00:01:57.810> there

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
endless ledge happy so hopefully there

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
sure if that's going to work again I'm

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.020 
sure if that's going to work again I'm
just<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.829> pin<00:02:02.250> drop<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.579> can't<00:02:02.790> be<00:02:02.880> bothered

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
just a pin drop I can't be bothered

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.090 
just a pin drop I can't be bothered
sanding<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:03.990> down<00:02:04.020> all<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.530> time<00:02:04.710> I'm<00:02:04.950> looking

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
sanding it down all the time I'm looking

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.760 
sanding it down all the time I'm looking
for<00:02:05.430> shortcuts<00:02:05.930> and<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:07.020> should<00:02:07.200> saw<00:02:07.320> yesterday

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
for shortcuts and I should saw yesterday

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.410 
for shortcuts and I should saw yesterday
they're<00:02:07.950> not<00:02:08.069> really<00:02:08.220> working<00:02:08.640> but<00:02:09.119> them

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
they're not really working but them

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.290 
they're not really working but them
we'll<00:02:10.050> see<00:02:10.229> how<00:02:10.349> this<00:02:10.500> one<00:02:10.709> goes<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.550> let's<00:02:12.150> get

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
we'll see how this one goes so let's get

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.100 
we'll see how this one goes so let's get
started<00:02:12.810> with

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
started with

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:37.840 
started with
the<00:02:13.410> fabric<00:02:15.080> sexiness

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.990 

okie-dokie<00:02:38.850> so<00:02:39.260> it<00:02:40.260> is<00:02:40.640> looking<00:02:41.640> like<00:02:41.760> a

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
okie-dokie so it is looking like a

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.250 
okie-dokie so it is looking like a
lovely<00:02:42.210> waitress<00:02:44.150> not<00:02:45.150> much<00:02:45.330> greatness<00:02:45.930> to

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
lovely waitress not much greatness to

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.250 
lovely waitress not much greatness to
look<00:02:46.410> at<00:02:46.560> at<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.740> moment<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.900> it's<00:02:48.900> all<00:02:49.020> gonna

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
look at at the moment and it's all gonna

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.780 
look at at the moment and it's all gonna
be<00:02:49.440> in<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.590> paint<00:02:49.770> and<00:02:49.920> everything<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.430> final

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
be in the paint and everything and final

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.580 
be in the paint and everything and final
stage<00:02:51.000> just<00:02:51.510> doesn't<00:02:51.930> look<00:02:52.020> like<00:02:52.080> he's<00:02:52.410> merely

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
stage just doesn't look like he's merely

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.640 
stage just doesn't look like he's merely
winning<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.070> miniskirt<00:02:53.390> now<00:02:54.390> so<00:02:55.170> what<00:02:55.380> I<00:02:55.410> was

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
winning a miniskirt now so what I was

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.260 
winning a miniskirt now so what I was
doing<00:02:55.860> there<00:02:56.010> was<00:02:56.160> attaching<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.700> cloth<00:02:56.970> so

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
doing there was attaching the cloth so

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.630 
doing there was attaching the cloth so
there's<00:02:57.450> essentially<00:02:57.780> three<00:02:58.280> pieces<00:02:59.280> there's

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
there's essentially three pieces there's

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.880 
there's essentially three pieces there's
the<00:03:00.110> skirt<00:03:01.110> piece<00:03:01.320> wrapping<00:03:01.800> around

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
the skirt piece wrapping around

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.280 
the skirt piece wrapping around
underneath<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:03.030> front<00:03:03.300> part<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.170> back

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
underneath the front part and the back

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.410 
underneath the front part and the back
one<00:03:04.740> as<00:03:05.130> well<00:03:06.380> and<00:03:07.380> so<00:03:07.950> it's<00:03:08.220> really<00:03:08.700> messy<00:03:09.209> up

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
one as well and so it's really messy up

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.760 
one as well and so it's really messy up
the<00:03:10.520> top<00:03:11.720> with<00:03:12.720> superglue<00:03:13.140> holding<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.680> in

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
the top with superglue holding it in

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.890 
the top with superglue holding it in
place<00:03:13.920> that's<00:03:14.580> because<00:03:14.910> I'm<00:03:15.030> going<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.300> put<00:03:15.660> a

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
place that's because I'm going to put a

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.460 
place that's because I'm going to put a
wrap<00:03:16.350> round<00:03:16.590> of<00:03:16.890> styrene<00:03:17.790> plastic<00:03:18.540> around<00:03:19.290> it

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
wrap round of styrene plastic around it

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.620 
wrap round of styrene plastic around it
to<00:03:20.130> cover<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.459> up<00:03:20.520> and<00:03:20.640> then<00:03:20.820> sculpt<00:03:21.239> on<00:03:21.390> top

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
to cover that up and then sculpt on top

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.210 
to cover that up and then sculpt on top
of<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.900> study<00:03:22.140> in<00:03:22.290> his<00:03:23.780> belt<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:25.590> all<00:03:25.830> be

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
of the study in his belt so that all be

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.610 
of the study in his belt so that all be
covered<00:03:26.970> up<00:03:28.370> so<00:03:29.370> that's<00:03:29.720> that<00:03:30.720> basic<00:03:31.350> part

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
covered up so that's that basic part

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.550 
covered up so that's that basic part
done<00:03:31.860> um<00:03:32.670> what<00:03:33.540> I<00:03:33.570> think<00:03:33.930> I'm<00:03:34.110> going<00:03:34.320> to<00:03:34.440> do

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
done um what I think I'm going to do

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.530 
done um what I think I'm going to do
once<00:03:34.800> I<00:03:34.950> get<00:03:35.100> our<00:03:35.250> bow<00:03:35.400> in<00:03:35.550> place<00:03:35.670> is<00:03:36.239> then

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
once I get our bow in place is then

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.430 
once I get our bow in place is then
removable<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:38.239> it<00:03:39.239> should<00:03:39.480> keep<00:03:39.810> it<00:03:39.989> shape

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
removable and it should keep it shape

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.860 
removable and it should keep it shape
mostly<00:03:40.950> because<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.370> superglue<00:03:41.790> is<00:03:41.970> there<00:03:42.239> so

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
mostly because the superglue is there so

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.420 
mostly because the superglue is there so
sculpting<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.739> M<00:03:45.500> material<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.680> then<00:03:47.280> I'll

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
sculpting the M material and then I'll

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.270 
sculpting the M material and then I'll
reattach<00:03:47.670> it<00:03:48.150> when<00:03:48.390> I'm<00:03:48.510> ready<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:49.010> finish<00:03:50.010> off

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
reattach it when I'm ready to finish off

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.789 
reattach it when I'm ready to finish off
all<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.580> sculpting<00:03:51.030> and<00:03:51.709> assemble<00:03:52.709> the

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
all the sculpting and assemble the

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.440 
all the sculpting and assemble the
figure<00:03:53.040> finally<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:53.519> used<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.880> super<00:03:54.060> glue<00:03:54.420> to

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
figure finally I used the super glue to

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.390 
figure finally I used the super glue to
make<00:03:54.930> some<00:03:55.170> pinches<00:03:55.650> on<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:55.950> material

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
make some pinches on the material

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.550 
make some pinches on the material
wrexham<00:03:56.880> in<00:03:56.970> place<00:03:57.209> and<00:03:57.420> it's<00:03:58.019> just<00:03:58.080> to<00:03:58.350> create

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
wrexham in place and it's just to create

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.920 
wrexham in place and it's just to create
these<00:03:58.709> folds<00:03:59.810> because<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:01.470> have<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:01.830> get<00:04:02.010> that

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
these folds because you have to get that

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.330 
these folds because you have to get that
cel-shaded<00:04:03.930> look<00:04:03.959> and<00:04:04.410> that's<00:04:04.530> one<00:04:05.010> kind<00:04:05.220> of

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
cel-shaded look and that's one kind of

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.160 
cel-shaded look and that's one kind of
trying<00:04:05.579> to<00:04:05.670> anticipate<00:04:05.970> here<00:04:06.630> so<00:04:06.840> that<00:04:07.019> when<00:04:07.110> I

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
trying to anticipate here so that when I

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.590 
trying to anticipate here so that when I
go<00:04:07.440> to<00:04:07.470> finally<00:04:08.070> paint<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.549> there's<00:04:09.329> going<00:04:09.510> to

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
go to finally paint it there's going to

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.449 
go to finally paint it there's going to
be<00:04:09.720> some<00:04:10.019> of<00:04:10.140> those<00:04:10.230> folds<00:04:10.680> I<00:04:10.860> can<00:04:11.040> add<00:04:11.160> in<00:04:11.340> the

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
be some of those folds I can add in the

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.780 
be some of those folds I can add in the
depth<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.180> highlights<00:04:12.829> -<00:04:13.829> yeah<00:04:14.100> that's<00:04:14.340> a

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
depth and the highlights - yeah that's a

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.170 
depth and the highlights - yeah that's a

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
going to go too much into sculpting

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.740 
going to go too much into sculpting
because<00:04:29.760> I've<00:04:29.910> shown<00:04:30.150> that<00:04:30.330> and<00:04:30.540> enough

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
because I've shown that and enough

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.620 
because I've shown that and enough
previous<00:04:31.260> videos<00:04:31.620> but<00:04:31.800> I'm<00:04:32.490> using<00:04:32.790> Miller<00:04:33.419> Pot

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
previous videos but I'm using Miller Pot

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.340 
previous videos but I'm using Miller Pot
superfine<00:04:34.290> white<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:34.919> black<00:04:35.640> and<00:04:35.970> that<00:04:36.450> is<00:04:36.660> so

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
superfine white and black and that is so

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.260 
superfine white and black and that is so
that<00:04:37.380> I<00:04:37.770> can<00:04:37.830> get<00:04:38.160> a<00:04:38.190> differentiation<00:04:39.090> between

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
that I can get a differentiation between

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.310 
that I can get a differentiation between
the<00:04:39.510> costume<00:04:40.080> and<00:04:40.280> armor<00:04:41.330> when<00:04:42.330> I<00:04:42.360> sculpt<00:04:42.990> so

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
the costume and armor when I sculpt so

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.140 
the costume and armor when I sculpt so
that<00:04:43.470> I<00:04:43.500> can<00:04:43.770> get<00:04:43.950> a<00:04:43.979> good<00:04:44.430> idea<00:04:44.490> of<00:04:44.820> what<00:04:45.030> its

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
that I can get a good idea of what its

00:04:45.150 --> 00:05:08.250 
that I can get a good idea of what its
gonna<00:04:45.360> look<00:04:45.450> like<00:04:45.599> when<00:04:46.410> it's<00:04:46.590> finished

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.810 

so<00:05:09.260> as<00:05:09.350> you<00:05:09.440> can<00:05:09.560> see<00:05:09.620> from<00:05:10.010> the<00:05:10.130> time-lapse<00:05:10.550> I

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
so as you can see from the time-lapse I

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.850 
so as you can see from the time-lapse I
tried<00:05:11.060> to<00:05:11.150> spend<00:05:11.390> an<00:05:11.510> hour<00:05:11.660> or<00:05:11.930> so<00:05:12.170> every<00:05:12.200> night

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
tried to spend an hour or so every night

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.490 
tried to spend an hour or so every night
I<00:05:12.920> could<00:05:13.480> sculpting<00:05:14.480> sanding<00:05:15.230> and<00:05:15.440> shaping

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
I could sculpting sanding and shaping

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.930 
I could sculpting sanding and shaping
the<00:05:16.310> Porta<00:05:16.760> Potty<00:05:16.940> that<00:05:17.630> I<00:05:17.690> finally<00:05:18.110> got

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
the Porta Potty that I finally got

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.210 
the Porta Potty that I finally got
shredder<00:05:19.940> to<00:05:20.330> this<00:05:20.810> point<00:05:21.170> that<00:05:21.470> is<00:05:21.650> here<00:05:22.010> we

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
shredder to this point that is here we

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.140 
shredder to this point that is here we
started<00:05:22.610> to<00:05:22.790> look<00:05:23.690> a<00:05:23.810> bit<00:05:23.840> like<00:05:23.990> shredder<00:05:24.440> I

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
started to look a bit like shredder I

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.920 
started to look a bit like shredder I
started<00:05:26.150> using<00:05:26.300> the<00:05:26.690> flosser<00:05:27.230> tips<00:05:27.770> on<00:05:28.930> his

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
started using the flosser tips on his

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.980 
started using the flosser tips on his
shoulders<00:05:30.590> and<00:05:30.830> arms<00:05:31.340> here<00:05:31.780> before<00:05:32.780> the

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
shoulders and arms here before the

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.150 
shoulders and arms here before the
blades<00:05:33.260> you<00:05:33.650> can<00:05:34.100> see<00:05:34.520> I<00:05:35.740> attached<00:05:36.740> them<00:05:36.980> at

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
blades you can see I attached them at

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.970 
blades you can see I attached them at
the<00:05:37.340> right<00:05:37.730> angle<00:05:38.150> and<00:05:38.300> then<00:05:38.420> once<00:05:39.380> there<00:05:39.710> the

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980 
the right angle and then once there the

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.830 
the right angle and then once there the
superglue<00:05:40.400> I<00:05:40.460> say<00:05:40.760> it<00:05:40.880> and<00:05:41.060> everything<00:05:41.450> I<00:05:41.600> go

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
superglue I say it and everything I go

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.510 
superglue I say it and everything I go
in<00:05:41.990> and<00:05:42.200> start<00:05:42.470> to<00:05:42.650> shape<00:05:42.860> it<00:05:43.040> with<00:05:43.160> my<00:05:43.310> knife

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
in and start to shape it with my knife

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.470 
in and start to shape it with my knife
and<00:05:43.850> some<00:05:44.420> epoxy<00:05:44.810> to<00:05:45.200> get<00:05:45.350> that<00:05:45.470> smooth<00:05:45.920> curve

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
and some epoxy to get that smooth curve

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.720 
and some epoxy to get that smooth curve
that<00:05:47.480> they<00:05:47.660> have<00:05:47.870> in<00:05:48.230> the<00:05:48.710> comic<00:05:49.130> I<00:05:49.310> do<00:05:49.400> a<00:05:49.520> lot

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:49.730 
that they have in the comic I do a lot

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.420 
that they have in the comic I do a lot
of<00:05:49.760> post<00:05:50.120> sculpting<00:05:50.900> work<00:05:51.080> and<00:05:51.350> when<00:05:52.100> I<00:05:52.130> said

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
of post sculpting work and when I said

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.670 
of post sculpting work and when I said
that<00:05:52.460> I<00:05:52.610> meant<00:05:52.880> I<00:05:52.940> took<00:05:53.000> my<00:05:53.300> knife<00:05:53.540> after<00:05:53.900> I<00:05:54.410> had

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
that I meant I took my knife after I had

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.310 
that I meant I took my knife after I had
cured<00:05:54.980> the<00:05:55.250> epoxy<00:05:55.760> smoothed<00:05:56.510> off<00:05:56.780> used<00:05:57.170> all

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
cured the epoxy smoothed off used all

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.040 
cured the epoxy smoothed off used all
sandpaper<00:05:58.070> and<00:05:58.310> shaped<00:05:58.640> it<00:05:58.910> which<00:05:59.450> is<00:05:59.720> how<00:06:00.020> I

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
sandpaper and shaped it which is how I

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:09.850 
sandpaper and shaped it which is how I
can<00:06:00.770> get<00:06:01.010> quite<00:06:01.820> exact<00:06:04.720> shapes<00:06:06.910> there<00:06:08.680> on<00:06:09.680> his

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
can get quite exact shapes there on his

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.810 
can get quite exact shapes there on his
lower<00:06:10.100> legs<00:06:10.900> so<00:06:11.900> that's<00:06:12.080> me<00:06:12.430> scoring<00:06:13.430> my<00:06:13.580> knife

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
lower legs so that's me scoring my knife

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.090 
lower legs so that's me scoring my knife
along<00:06:14.210> the<00:06:14.270> side<00:06:14.660> you<00:06:14.990> know<00:06:15.169> once<00:06:15.440> the<00:06:15.650> epoxy

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:16.100 
along the side you know once the epoxy

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.950 
along the side you know once the epoxy
is<00:06:16.130> cured<00:06:16.520> I<00:06:16.640> just<00:06:16.850> take<00:06:17.060> the<00:06:17.240> blade<00:06:17.750> of<00:06:17.930> my

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
is cured I just take the blade of my

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.340 
is cured I just take the blade of my
knife<00:06:18.220> and<00:06:19.220> I<00:06:19.510> drag<00:06:20.510> it<00:06:20.660> long<00:06:20.810> and<00:06:21.050> it<00:06:21.140> just

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
knife and I drag it long and it just

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.640 
knife and I drag it long and it just
smoothing<00:06:22.160> the<00:06:22.340> edges<00:06:22.370> out<00:06:23.320> so<00:06:24.320> that<00:06:24.440> it<00:06:24.500> gives

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
smoothing the edges out so that it gives

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.850 
smoothing the edges out so that it gives
this<00:06:24.830> nice<00:06:25.540> finish<00:06:26.540> to<00:06:26.570> it<00:06:26.840> and<00:06:27.590> a<00:06:27.680> lot<00:06:27.830> of

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860
