00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
around I don't have to deal with him so

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.460 
around I don't have to deal with him so
I<00:02:54.519> jump<00:02:54.730> over<00:02:54.880> back<00:02:55.239> to<00:02:55.269> his<00:02:55.450> balcony<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:55.989> I<00:02:56.319> go

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470
