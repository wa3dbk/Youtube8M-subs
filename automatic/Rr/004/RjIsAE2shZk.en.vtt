00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
up one of these spring showerheads

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.390 
up one of these spring showerheads
it<00:00:08.040> has<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.280> really<00:00:08.940> long<00:00:09.269> 72<00:00:10.050> inch<00:00:10.290> or<00:00:10.559> six<00:00:11.010> foot

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
it has a really long 72 inch or six foot

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.640 
it has a really long 72 inch or six foot
holes<00:00:11.670> on<00:00:12.000> it<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.809> reason<00:00:12.960> we<00:00:13.290> wanted

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
holes on it and the reason we wanted

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.379 
holes on it and the reason we wanted
that<00:00:13.799> six<00:00:14.130> foot<00:00:14.370> hose<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.910> because<00:00:15.210> it

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
that six foot hose is because it

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.960 
that six foot hose is because it
stretched<00:00:15.809> all<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.710> way<00:00:16.859> past<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.460> fight<00:00:17.730> but

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
stretched all the way past the fight but

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.970 
stretched all the way past the fight but
back<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.960> way<00:00:19.080> we're<00:00:19.350> gonna<00:00:19.439> clean<00:00:19.800> it

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
back to the way we're gonna clean it

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.279 
back to the way we're gonna clean it
this<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.460> really<00:00:20.910> important<00:00:21.449> because<00:00:21.930> it's

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
this is really important because it's

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.529 
this is really important because it's
gonna<00:00:22.380> save<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:23.010> much<00:00:23.220> time<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.820> energy<00:00:24.119> and

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
gonna save so much time and energy and

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.060 
gonna save so much time and energy and
effort<00:00:24.750> it's<00:00:25.109> not<00:00:25.320> even<00:00:25.619> funny

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
effort it's not even funny

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.790 
effort it's not even funny
but<00:00:26.369> today<00:00:26.670> our<00:00:27.150> project<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.170> put<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.470> splash

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
but today our project is to put a splash

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.790 
but today our project is to put a splash
guard<00:00:29.189> on<00:00:29.519> both<00:00:29.910> ends<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.539> bathtub

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
guard on both ends of the bathtub

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.900 
guard on both ends of the bathtub
normally<00:00:31.800> we<00:00:32.009> would<00:00:32.160> use<00:00:33.620> some<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.739> our

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
normally we would use some of our

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.030 
normally we would use some of our
standard<00:00:35.910> splash<00:00:36.300> guards<00:00:36.840> but<00:00:37.590> for<00:00:37.920> this

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
standard splash guards but for this

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.860 
standard splash guards but for this
project<00:00:38.370> I'll<00:00:38.820> just<00:00:39.000> show<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.239> quickly<00:00:39.450> how

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
project I'll just show you quickly how

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.709 
project I'll just show you quickly how
these<00:00:40.260> installs<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.969> fact<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.300> when

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
these installs and the fact that when

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.810 
these installs and the fact that when
you<00:00:42.840> get<00:00:43.020> them<00:00:43.290> they're<00:00:43.500> straight<00:00:43.980> once<00:00:44.670> you

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
you get them they're straight once you

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.700 
you get them they're straight once you
get<00:00:45.000> them<00:00:45.210> home<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.780> bend<00:00:46.110> them<00:00:46.260> like<00:00:46.320> this

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
get them home you bend them like this

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.209 
get them home you bend them like this
and<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.309> fold<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.820> over<00:00:47.969> like<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:49.219> bring

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
and you fold it over like this and bring

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.660 
and you fold it over like this and bring
it<00:00:50.340> down<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.879> point<00:00:51.270> like<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.860> then

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
it down to a point like this and then

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.689 
it down to a point like this and then
you<00:00:54.090> peel<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.780> bit<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.289> adhesive<00:00:55.620> off<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.489> base

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
you peel a bit of adhesive off the base

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.750 
you peel a bit of adhesive off the base
you<00:00:57.690> put<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.770> grout<00:00:59.039> where<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.489> want

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
you put this in the grout where you want

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.689 
you put this in the grout where you want
it<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.180> lay<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.140> down<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.800> bring<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.399> up<00:01:02.520> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
it you lay it down and bring it up the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.260 
it you lay it down and bring it up the
side<00:01:02.940> but<00:01:03.449> we<00:01:04.049> can't<00:01:04.080> get<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:04.799> until<00:01:05.670> we

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
side but we can't get to that until we

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.480 
side but we can't get to that until we
clean<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.990> thoroughly<00:01:07.290> because<00:01:07.740> this

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
clean this thoroughly because this

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.200 
clean this thoroughly because this
adhesive<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.360> really<00:01:10.140> tacky<00:01:10.770> but<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.670> won't<00:01:12.000> go

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
adhesive is really tacky but it won't go

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.330 
adhesive is really tacky but it won't go
on<00:01:12.420> if<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:12.810> going<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> dirty<00:01:14.070> surface

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
on if it's going on to a dirty surface

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.480 
on if it's going on to a dirty surface
if<00:01:15.150> there's<00:01:15.450> soap<00:01:15.900> scum<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.500> here<00:01:16.860> or<00:01:17.159> anything

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
if there's soap scum on here or anything

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.999 
if there's soap scum on here or anything
on<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.850> top<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.479> toe<00:01:18.689> or<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.049> tile<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
on the top of the toe or the tile the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.710 
on the top of the toe or the tile the
adhesive<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.580> here<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:21.000> not<00:01:21.150> going<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.540> stick

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
adhesive on here is not going to stick

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.270 
adhesive on here is not going to stick
very<00:01:22.020> well<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.560> other<00:01:22.710> thing<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.130> might

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
very well the other thing you might

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.940 
very well the other thing you might
notice<00:01:23.549> sometimes<00:01:24.299> when<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.900> get<00:01:25.080> these<00:01:25.259> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
notice sometimes when you get these the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.999 
notice sometimes when you get these the
adhesive<00:01:26.490> isn't<00:01:27.000> stuck<00:01:27.330> right<00:01:27.990> around<00:01:28.409> here

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
adhesive isn't stuck right around here

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.609 
adhesive isn't stuck right around here
well<00:01:29.430> that's<00:01:29.610> because<00:01:29.790> when<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:30.479> make<00:01:30.720> them<00:01:30.990> we

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
well that's because when we make them we

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.950 
well that's because when we make them we
don't<00:01:31.860> put<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.729> same<00:01:32.939> amount<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.299> pressure<00:01:33.540> on

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
don't put the same amount of pressure on

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.319 
don't put the same amount of pressure on
here<00:01:34.439> as<00:01:34.710> we<00:01:34.979> do<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.520> rest<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.119> piece

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
here as we do in the rest of the piece

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.260 
here as we do in the rest of the piece
because<00:01:37.140> what<00:01:37.409> we<00:01:37.560> do<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:37.979> we<00:01:38.280> put<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.790> lot<00:01:39.210> more

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
because what we do is we put a lot more

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.410 
because what we do is we put a lot more
adhesive<00:01:40.049> around<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.950> corner<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:41.939> when

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
adhesive around this corner so that when

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.170 
adhesive around this corner so that when
we<00:01:42.600> bend<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.350> go<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.369> put<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:44.909> they'll

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
we bend it and go to put it in they'll

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.410 
we bend it and go to put it in they'll
still<00:01:45.479> be<00:01:45.509> lots<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.229> foam<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.920> adhesive<00:01:47.729> right

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
still be lots of foam and adhesive right

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.499 
still be lots of foam and adhesive right
down<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.320> critical<00:01:49.590> corner<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.729> don't<00:01:51.329> be

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
down in that critical corner so don't be

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.960 
down in that critical corner so don't be
alarmed<00:01:52.110> or<00:01:52.649> surprised<00:01:53.009> when<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.549> get<00:01:53.700> some

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
alarmed or surprised when you get some

splash<00:03:21.090> guards<00:03:21.540> we<00:03:21.690> had<00:03:21.840> some<00:03:22.110> requests<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:22.830> we

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
splash guards we had some requests so we

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.620 
splash guards we had some requests so we
were<00:03:23.489> doing<00:03:23.640> everything<00:03:23.910> we<00:03:24.330> could<00:03:24.570> to

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
were doing everything we could to

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.470 
were doing everything we could to
satisfy<00:03:25.380> those<00:03:25.620> that<00:03:25.980> ass<00:03:26.190> but<00:03:26.820> what<00:03:27.180> we<00:03:27.300> also

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
satisfy those that ass but what we also

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.840 
satisfy those that ass but what we also
realize<00:03:28.440> is<00:03:28.739> that<00:03:28.920> in<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.310> camera

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
realize is that in the camera

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.880 
realize is that in the camera
they<00:03:30.030> clear<00:03:30.690> ones<00:03:30.900> don't<00:03:31.170> show<00:03:31.380> up<00:03:31.560> very<00:03:31.830> well

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
they clear ones don't show up very well

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.270 
they clear ones don't show up very well

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
so I did a video the other day on how

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.400 
so I did a video the other day on how

some metallic pinstriping along this

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.199 
some metallic pinstriping along this
just<00:03:46.080> to<00:03:46.230> give<00:03:46.380> it<00:03:46.530> some<00:03:46.709> accent<00:03:47.250> in<00:03:47.519> my<00:03:47.760> pen

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
just to give it some accent in my pen

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.660 
just to give it some accent in my pen
striping<00:03:48.690> video<00:03:49.019> I<00:03:49.380> explained<00:03:50.250> that<00:03:50.430> you

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
striping video I explained that you

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.479 
striping video I explained that you
can't<00:03:51.209> turn<00:03:51.690> corners<00:03:52.320> with<00:03:52.530> pinstriping<00:03:53.160> so

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
can't turn corners with pinstriping so

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.940 
can't turn corners with pinstriping so
this<00:03:53.700> is<00:03:53.970> actually<00:03:54.420> something<00:03:54.690> this<00:03:55.500> design

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
this is actually something this design

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.130 
this is actually something this design
was<00:03:56.280> cut<00:03:56.519> out<00:03:56.549> of<00:03:56.820> a<00:03:56.910> flat<00:03:57.150> piece<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:57.810> but

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
was cut out of a flat piece and but

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.590 
was cut out of a flat piece and but
we're<00:03:58.440> gonna<00:03:58.560> mount<00:03:58.830> this<00:03:59.130> one<00:03:59.370> in<00:03:59.640> here<00:04:00.150> as<00:04:00.330> I

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
we're gonna mount this one in here as I

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.870 
we're gonna mount this one in here as I
said<00:04:00.660> earlier<00:04:01.590> we<00:04:02.430> bet<00:04:03.420> this<00:04:03.750> at<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.620> top<00:04:04.880> so

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
said earlier we bet this at the top so

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.220 
said earlier we bet this at the top so
then<00:04:06.090> it<00:04:06.180> will<00:04:06.269> flare<00:04:06.570> out<00:04:06.840> a<00:04:07.170> little

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
then it will flare out a little

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.869 
then it will flare out a little
think<00:04:08.410> back<00:04:08.620> that<00:04:08.770> up<00:04:08.920> you'll<00:04:09.340> see<00:04:09.550> exactly

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
think back that up you'll see exactly

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:11.760 
think back that up you'll see exactly
what<00:04:10.120> I'm<00:04:10.390> talking<00:04:10.810> about<00:04:11.110> but<00:04:11.319> I<00:04:11.349> think<00:04:11.650> I'll

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
what I'm talking about but I think I'll

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.670 
what I'm talking about but I think I'll
put<00:04:12.040> it<00:04:12.129> right<00:04:12.459> on<00:04:13.360> the<00:04:13.660> outside<00:04:14.200> of<00:04:14.470> this

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
put it right on the outside of this

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.379 
put it right on the outside of this
space<00:04:15.400> between<00:04:15.819> the<00:04:16.000> two<00:04:16.180> tiles<00:04:17.700> now<00:04:18.700> the

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
space between the two tiles now the

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.020 
space between the two tiles now the
large<00:04:19.630> splash<00:04:20.019> guards<00:04:20.530> go<00:04:20.739> on<00:04:20.799> exactly<00:04:21.760> the

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
large splash guards go on exactly the

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.180 
large splash guards go on exactly the
same<00:04:22.060> as<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.780> standard<00:04:23.050> one<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.800> only

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
same as the standard one the only

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.250 
same as the standard one the only
difference<00:04:24.610> is<00:04:24.790> they're<00:04:25.210> much<00:04:25.479> longer

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
difference is they're much longer

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.840 
difference is they're much longer
the<00:04:26.410> portion<00:04:26.889> that<00:04:26.919> goes<00:04:27.070> up<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.669> wall

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
the portion that goes up the wall

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.580 
the portion that goes up the wall
because<00:04:28.270> we<00:04:28.479> really<00:04:28.660> use<00:04:28.810> it<00:04:28.960> for<00:04:29.169> a<00:04:29.410> different

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
because we really use it for a different

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.490 
because we really use it for a different
purpose<00:04:29.979> or<00:04:30.490> an<00:04:30.729> additional<00:04:31.510> purpose<00:04:31.780> so<00:04:32.139> we

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
purpose or an additional purpose so we

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.320 
purpose or an additional purpose so we
do<00:04:32.650> it<00:04:32.770> the<00:04:32.860> same<00:04:32.889> the<00:04:33.490> short<00:04:33.729> piece<00:04:33.940> on<00:04:34.150> the

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
do it the same the short piece on the

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.080 
do it the same the short piece on the
bottom<00:04:34.450> always<00:04:35.080> goes<00:04:35.290> on<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.560> outside<00:04:35.710> and<00:04:36.460> so

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
bottom always goes on the outside and so

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.780 
bottom always goes on the outside and so
what<00:04:37.270> we<00:04:37.389> do<00:04:37.570> is<00:04:37.780> bring<00:04:38.050> that<00:04:38.229> in<00:04:38.470> and<00:04:39.400> fold<00:04:39.610> it

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
what we do is bring that in and fold it

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.570 
what we do is bring that in and fold it
into<00:04:39.940> the<00:04:40.510> area<00:04:41.229> that<00:04:41.410> we<00:04:41.530> want<00:04:41.710> yesterday

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
into the area that we want yesterday

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.140 
into the area that we want yesterday
we've<00:04:42.970> made<00:04:43.389> little<00:04:43.660> cuts<00:04:43.930> in<00:04:44.650> here<00:04:45.190> so<00:04:45.940> that

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
we've made little cuts in here so that

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.629 
we've made little cuts in here so that
we<00:04:46.479> can<00:04:46.660> actually<00:04:46.870> turn<00:04:47.350> this<00:04:47.710> at<00:04:48.070> the<00:04:48.250> bottom

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
we can actually turn this at the bottom

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.000 
we can actually turn this at the bottom
as<00:04:48.760> well<00:04:48.940> so<00:04:49.360> we're<00:04:49.750> gonna<00:04:49.870> turn<00:04:50.380> this<00:04:50.620> so<00:04:50.860> the

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
as well so we're gonna turn this so the

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.510 
as well so we're gonna turn this so the
water<00:04:51.610> will<00:04:51.940> flow<00:04:52.350> on<00:04:53.350> an<00:04:53.560> arc<00:04:53.770> back<00:04:54.040> into<00:04:54.400> the

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
water will flow on an arc back into the

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.370 
water will flow on an arc back into the
top<00:04:54.700> instead<00:04:55.090> of<00:04:55.150> just<00:04:55.389> straight<00:04:55.690> out<00:04:55.810> but

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
top instead of just straight out but

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.870 
top instead of just straight out but
that's<00:04:56.470> a<00:04:56.650> gay<00:04:56.800> you'll<00:04:56.979> see<00:04:57.190> so<00:04:57.550> the<00:04:57.669> first

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
thing we're gonna do is go straight on

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.219 
thing we're gonna do is go straight on
to<00:04:59.710> the<00:05:00.070> grout<00:05:00.400> in<00:05:00.729> the<00:05:00.850> bottom<00:05:01.180> corner<00:05:01.510> 3<00:05:01.810> and

to the grout in the bottom corner 3 and
we're<00:05:02.350> gonna<00:05:02.440> press<00:05:02.710> it<00:05:02.740> down<00:05:03.040> really<00:05:03.400> hard

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729
