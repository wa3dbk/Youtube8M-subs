00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:15.110
 because the forests are so valuable 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.690
 rivers the mountains the oceans as we 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.990
 benefit ecosystems when they 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.350
 degrade how it affects us let's know two 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.010
 concrete cases 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.630
 The Barú Volcano National Park in Panama 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.020
 and the mountain conservation area 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.330
 in el salvador forest ecosystems 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.489
 found in both areas contribute 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.400
 Innumerable benefits provide 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.370
 Foods medicines and wood help 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.309
 keep the water of the rivers 160,000 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.290
 people receive drinking water and water 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.290
 the sectors also benefit 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.600
 industrial and energy 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.420
 ecosystems also provide services 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.170
 that we do not see with the naked eye store the 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.820
 carbon dioxide regulate the climate 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.540
 prevent erosion and reduce 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.700
 risks to floods and storms 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.350
 agriculture and livestock in the region 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.540
 they could subsist without the services 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.840
 natural water drainage and 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.760
 soil fertilization and this is added 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.090
 the potential use of these 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.590
 areas for recreation and tourism 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.020
 all these services we get them 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.120
 thanks to the work done by species 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.850
 of plants and animals that interact 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.770
 harmonically with the physical environment and that 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.899
 they are essential for more than 85,000 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.420
 and who reside in the vicinity of the 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.700
 mountaineer and the barú volcano these 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.829
 services transcend borders and 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.500
 contribute to the welfare of the set of 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.539
 living beings and only in terms 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.429
 economic has been estimated that 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.189
 ecosystem services of the volcano 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.229
 barú and montañona generate benefits to 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.500
 the society that can reach up to 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.580
 about 550 and 90 million dollars 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.890
 annual respectively 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.140
 but overexploitation of resources 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.000
 of nature entails the loss of 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.340
 the services that are the basis of life 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.170
 on the planet the loss of 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.050
 ecosystems sometimes irreversible 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.230
 has significant effects on the short 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.330
 medium and long term an estimate in 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.310
 economic terms indicates that a 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.500
 eventual deterioration of ecosystems in 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.240
 The Barú Volcano National Park in Panama 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.460
 and in the conservation area the 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.220
 mountaineering in El Salvador- would mean 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.670
 approximate total cost of 1,200 million 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.610
 of dollars per year 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.860
 That is why it is essential that we conserve 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.930
 ecosystems we manage the areas 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.420
 protected in a sustainable way and 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.130
 let's establish new areas using 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.980
 mechanisms that allow its 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.260
 sustainability so that ours and the 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.380
 future generations enjoy the 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.510
 benefits offered by nature 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.370
 value ecosystem services 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.800
 It is a tool to keep them 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.900
 It is important that experiences like 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.330
 developed in Mesoamerica by the 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.330
 Spain Alliance of PNUMA in support of the 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.739
 initiative life web adapt and repeat 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.739
 in other places on the planet
