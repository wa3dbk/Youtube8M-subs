00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 expand living space afford far 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.100
 not everyone is much easier to increase 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.080
 number of rooms 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.219
 for example build a partition from 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.170
 drywall and odnushku can be done 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.910
 separate room need only put 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.070
 plasterboard wall 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.109
 You can breed it in any warm and 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.570
 dry room 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:23.250
 temperature should be where the style is 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.580
 degrees Celsius and above 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.609
 otherwise drywall will pick up moisture and 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.980
 warp first of all collect frame 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.360
 first on the floor mark up the place 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.520
 partition location 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.800
 then using a plumb and a million 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.290
 cord carry the border to the ceiling and 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.850
 walls 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.040
 a little trick we glue on 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.899
 metal slats rubberized tape 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.460
 in this case there will be no construction 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.410
 rattle after every step of 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.760
 the room 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.559
 then the profile is fastened around the perimeter 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.539
 markup put it on the dowel and screws 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.859
 attention between each other and reiki connect 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.320
 screws screws 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.539
 their point has the shape of a drill and therefore 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.110
 they easily pass through profile walls 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:10.380
 applied metal thickness from 04 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.650
 up to 0 6 millimeters it provides 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.490
 reliability of fastening of self-tapping screws in a profile 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.799
 case of use of thinner metal 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.530
 Screws scroll like in water 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.570
 so that the frame does not collapse and hold the sheets 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.740
 drywall securely in side profile 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.170
 insert timber one of the rooms will turn out 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.630
 deaf to daylight 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.759
 make a partition window for this 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.280
 back down from the ceiling 40 centimeters and 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.280
 fasten another horizontal 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.280
 guide 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.830
 and now in the rail insert profiles with 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:52.159
 pitch 40 centimeters so construction 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:53.990
 come out durable do frame under windows 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.970
 we will have their frames 2 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.430
 each 90 centimeters wide now with 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.220
 one side we sheathe frame 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:09.350
 drywall and already enshrined 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.520
 cut a hole in sheets like you can 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.250
 to lay between the slats 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.010
 thermal insulation material used 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.680
 mineral wool category ng 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.319
 that is, not supporting the burning but 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.450
 be sure to wear gloves otherwise 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.850
 skin irritation appear after 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.860
 the frame will be filled with cotton 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.550
 you can close the drywall with another 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.100
 parties to do everything correctly so 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.830
 the partition will last at least 70 years 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.100
 Vladimir verb or on the first Chechulina
