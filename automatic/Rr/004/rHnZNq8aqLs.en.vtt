00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
is a server rear end of the very first

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.550 
is a server rear end of the very first
episode<00:00:29.730> all<00:00:30.090> right<00:00:30.269> well<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.869> Zandi<00:00:31.380> of

again

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.940 
again
and<00:00:38.910> they<00:00:39.329> have<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.719> think<00:00:39.750> up<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.140> formula<00:00:40.469> and

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
and they have to think up a formula and

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.830 
and they have to think up a formula and
bubblegum<00:00:41.579> says<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.030> have<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.210> use<00:00:42.239> science

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
bubblegum says you have to use science

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.340 
bubblegum says you have to use science
so<00:00:43.489> Jake<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.600> Finn<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.800> was<00:00:48.320> yeah<00:00:49.320> I

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
so Jake and and Finn and I was yeah I

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.670 
so Jake and and Finn and I was yeah I
wasn't<00:00:49.980> must<00:00:50.219> say<00:00:50.309> LSD<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:51.449> goes<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:52.260> there

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
wasn't must say LSD it goes in there

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.799 
wasn't must say LSD it goes in there
and<00:00:52.829> they<00:00:53.579> all<00:00:53.699> work<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.090> formula<00:00:54.510> each

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
and they all work in a formula each

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.160 
and they all work in a formula each
formula<00:00:55.230> makes<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.739> situation<00:00:55.949> worse<00:00:56.370> and

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
formula makes the situation worse and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.779 
formula makes the situation worse and
they're<00:00:58.170> all<00:00:58.320> getting<00:00:58.770> bitten<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.309> finally

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
they're all getting bitten and finally

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.250 
they're all getting bitten and finally
Finn<00:01:00.000> figures<00:01:00.239> out<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.420> science<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.020> name

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
Finn figures out that science is a name

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.860 
Finn figures out that science is a name
of<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.530> little<00:01:01.680> candy<00:01:02.010> corn<00:01:02.219> rat<00:01:02.510> so<00:01:03.510> he<00:01:03.660> lets

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
of the little candy corn rat so he lets

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.460 
of the little candy corn rat so he lets
him<00:01:03.989> out<00:01:04.170> he's<00:01:04.559> fix<00:01:05.010> up<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.309> formula<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.470> saves

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
him out he's fix up a formula and saves

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.820 
him out he's fix up a formula and saves
the<00:01:07.650> day<00:01:07.680> um<00:01:09.590> opposed<00:01:10.590> was<00:01:10.740> gave<00:01:10.890> up<00:01:11.040> or

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
the day um opposed was gave up or

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.990 
the day um opposed was gave up or
honestly<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:14.070> like<00:01:14.159> there<00:01:14.610> are<00:01:14.700> definitely

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
honestly it's like there are definitely

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.219 
honestly it's like there are definitely
some<00:01:15.150> fight<00:01:15.360> scenes<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.720> like<00:01:15.930> how<00:01:16.049> all<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
some fight scenes I like how all the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.280 
some fight scenes I like how all the
formulas<00:01:16.890> make<00:01:17.310> them<00:01:17.610> worse<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.900> was<00:01:19.020> funny

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
formulas make them worse that was funny

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.190 
formulas make them worse that was funny
I<00:01:19.560> love<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.700> when<00:01:20.820> Jake<00:01:21.090> kids<00:01:21.360> bit<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.930> he

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
I love it when Jake kids bit and he

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.609 
I love it when Jake kids bit and he
tries<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.680> outrun<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.780> infection<00:01:25.470> he

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
tries to outrun the the infection he

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.590 
tries to outrun the the infection he
gets<00:01:25.950> his<00:01:26.070> arm<00:01:26.250> longer<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.820> long<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.180> mean<00:01:27.330> that

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
gets his arm longer and long I mean that

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.240 
gets his arm longer and long I mean that
was<00:01:27.750> great<00:01:27.990> that's<00:01:28.170> using<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.860> Bower<00:01:29.040> you

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
was great that's using the the Bower you

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.410 
was great that's using the the Bower you
can<00:01:29.430> do<00:01:29.549> um<00:01:30.680> and<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.829> fact<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.460> rat<00:01:33.119> was

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
can do um and the fact that the rat was

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.690 
can do um and the fact that the rat was
science<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.229> know<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.560> that's<00:01:34.770> cute<00:01:35.100> you

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
science you know that that's cute you

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.280 
science you know that that's cute you
know<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.970> lowly<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.390> know<00:01:36.540> now<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:36.990> get<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
know the lowly you know now it's get the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.380 
know the lowly you know now it's get the
award<00:01:37.560> Finn<00:01:37.950> will<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.579> get<00:01:38.909> out<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.270> way

award Finn will you get out of the way
now<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.259> science<00:01:41.450> that's<00:01:42.450> like<00:01:42.659> from<00:01:42.810> that's

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
now to science that's like from that's

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.710 
now to science that's like from that's
like<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.619> don't<00:01:44.549> know<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.299> maybe<00:01:45.479> if<00:01:45.600> it

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
like I don't know it's and maybe if it

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.800 
like I don't know it's and maybe if it
was<00:01:45.869> something<00:01:46.170> new<00:01:46.350> like<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.740> different<00:01:47.130> a

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
was something new like a different a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.030 
was something new like a different a
like<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> different<00:01:49.200> zombie<00:01:49.560> thing<00:01:49.799> or<00:01:50.009> a

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
like a different zombie thing or a

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.410 
like a different zombie thing or a
different<00:01:50.460> creator<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.090> something<00:01:51.360> else

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
different creator and something else

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.460 
different creator and something else
doing<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.689> but<00:01:51.810> when<00:01:51.899> it's<00:01:52.020> like<00:01:52.140> it's

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
doing it but when it's like it's

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.109 
doing it but when it's like it's
happening<00:01:52.950> again<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.310> we<00:01:53.880> gotta<00:01:54.060> make

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
how about the humor just seemed a touch

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.380
