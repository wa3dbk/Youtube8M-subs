00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.820
 bib with shallot then a piece of 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.429
 beef of the shallot and it's over 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.570
 almost shallots butter red wine 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.330
 we will go to the compote 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.680
 of shallots go hop it's gone go 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.480
 a little piece of butter that we have planned 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.080
 in the recipe 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.779
 I start the fire and I will start 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.220
 to melt the butter the butter is to 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.689
 just fade I'm going to add everything from 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.939
 following but shallots I especially do not want 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.439
 of coloring the simply make them 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.370
 sweat gently without staining 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.860
 we left to draw this one again 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.070
 little is left on one is June 7th 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.340
 minutes were going all sweet sweet 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.500
 here are my shallots are of course no 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.969
 nice and soft coloring now 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.969
 I add May 45 that binds wine 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.710
 we will bring to shudder 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.320
 so let's go 20 25 minutes fire all 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.640
 the evaporation of the 20 and 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.320
 30 years old mix on the end 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.630
 the seasoning as it will be taken on 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.760
 ends up in 20 minutes 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.530
 so it's been twenty minutes since it's cooked 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.030
 but shallots are completely red 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.270
 I'm going to let them cook another one 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.710
 little bit to evaporate the red wine 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.970
 to really make a confit of shallots I 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.320
 would add after that weight 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.210
 possibly a little sugar 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.729
 to compensate for the acidity of my wine 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.299
 red and it will be perfect 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:31.530
 go here sweet fire during this time you 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.750
 es season the meat with salt a 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.170
 fine fine fine fine film 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:41.509
 oil here it is hot go 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.509
 let's go we go 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.159
 so it's important to adapt the 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.200
 container size to quantity 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.420
 of food is sure it's important too 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.800
 almost touching must really leave him 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.869
 the time to take heat and 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.930
 well colored so bright fire 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:10.270
 the one here is not bad we will leave 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:13.220
 a little bit and we cook all that 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.580
 so after staining the meat I 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.290
 the nicely returns the steaks are 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.040
 well colored I'm going to season the other 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:25.190
 side and we will finish immediately the 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.380
 cooking then between blue and bleeding 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.880
 me it's perfect 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.170
 so we're going to take out the meat but not 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.790
 but it's a small number paul baysse 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.930
 made me love shallots in 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.739
 which I had a little bit of 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.440
 wine just now very quickly I 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.239
 pass them in there because it's okay 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.530
 to recover well the stups of 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:52.549
 meat to really taste and 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:55.670
 your products here is go my meat has 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.290
 well rested I go there pepper and 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.340
 now i've tasted a charles museum 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.830
 hotel ran out of salt and was missing the 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.030
 pepper but I will also add a 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.829
 little bit on because when the wine 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.829
 is a little acid is not very nice 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:15.769
 we are going to prepare a nice dish and then we go 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.000
 the shallots it's really we're on 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.040
 the bib with shallot so you do not have to 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.430
 cheating really needs we go on the 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.430
 tower charlots 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:36.480
 here are a few people buy 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.480
 to finish and at table it's before
