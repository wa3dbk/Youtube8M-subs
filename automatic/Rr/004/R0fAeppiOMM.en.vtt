00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.510
 his 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.970
 the good is the fit was the last bet 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.910
 of the blind in the world of the consoles was 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.520
 launched on November 27 , 1998 in the 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.070
 Japan and in the middle of 99 in the 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.080
 world the island in the beginning had great 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.120
 success in sales but to see 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.210
 few were losing market to the team 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.070
 and for the playstation 2 raider 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.540
 during the development of the 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.040
 sega that I two projects of 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.090
 each with a name 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.860
 different 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.710
 one was a black belt that was developed 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.770
 in America by harvesting together with 3 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.960
 of fix and the other is the project was dural 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.900
 which was a name of the game chief of the 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.280
 virtua fighter to is developed by 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:47.020
 Japanese sega along with nec and hitachi 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.850
 all companies produce the chips and 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.440
 graphics cards for the console 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.540
 but with the American dream he had a 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.220
 microsoft giant particularity 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.590
 is also involved in the development of 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.660
 the black belt operating system was 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.550
 very intuitive has an ease 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.740
 for those who wanted to develop and convert 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.740
 the console games to win 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.149
 However, it is some time later in the 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.000
 console building 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.650
 sega canceled the deal with the 3g fix 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.260
 also canceling the development of 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.900
 console black belt nobody knows inform 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.520
 because of canceling the console 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.180
 which was higher ahead 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.860
 compared to the Japanese consul but say 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.290
 that this was due to the costs 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.030
 that the project was blind and that in the 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.280
 Coming console with very high price 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.260
 salty for the consumer and in this 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.760
 time with Japanese soil now 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.370
 would make the one that the mow is 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.740
 producing the name "catana" and was 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.590
 officially announced that the rita would do 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.480
 the cpu of the console and anec the 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.880
 video of the machine that would be the 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.190
 power vr sÃ©rgio that was not very good 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.319
 not too bad but ran 125 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.970
 megawatt this already gave a great power 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.670
 graphic console and microsoft 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.500
 developed the operating system 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.200
 based on windows and want a system 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.530
 operating and palmtops and defendant says 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.650
 which were the smartphones of the time and 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.590
 finally in 1998 was announced in cash 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.580
 by sega dreamcast has collected more than 97 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.230
 million dollars only on the first day 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.480
 launched and sold more than 500 thousand 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.340
 units in the first two weeks in 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.500
 a month and a half console reached the mark of 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.120
 1 million units sold and all 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.740
 developers started focusing on the 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.770
 console that was a promise already for the 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.810
 future in Brazil was marketed by the 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.670
 tectoy who is the official representative of 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.650
 in Brazil and there was a certain 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.420
 campaign by tectoy to sell 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.460
 the product wants to find around 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.770
 150 reais in stores 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.830
 but as the nucleus of the southern flowers, 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.420
 tectoy minc ramelow and sold the polls 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.120
 in a product model modem 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.980
 and if comparing to the 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.320
 consumer to compare the price of 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.690
 console that was sold by tectoy with 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.850
 those of unofficial importers who 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.290
 They came with dem out much more affordable 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.300
 buy the console from one of 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.090
 importers by making part of the 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.840
 tectoy profit was diverted from that of 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.820
 I tect 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.830
 in the case of carriers however this has no 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.780
 much to see the dreamcast went very well 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.340
 I accept in Brazil and even you want 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.080
 watch now I doubt you've ever been 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.520
 those day care centers that were 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.010
 hypermarkets that had a video game 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.769
 extra type carrefour anyway if this 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.650
 video game was not 1 564 is johnny cash 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:21.019
 Here's the tip for you guys then dreamcast on 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.450
 very powerful console for 3d 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.550
 As for 2d it has thousands of 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.290
 conversions of arcade games in many 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.270
 times the conversion to the console was 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.130
 much better than the original game and 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.120
 You already played your car, so there you are. 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.980
 example 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.320
 and another amazing thing is that they 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.150
 are those infernal screens of loading 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.990
 dreamcast games at virtually no 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.240
 existed 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.580
 however is another blind slip was 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.870
 fill the accessory console by doing 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.150
 player to buy accessories for the 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.220
 console only to play a game or even play 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.950
 even to save the game I will talk now 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.960
 some accessories the dreamcast had 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.970
 Red team grows a mouse 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.310

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.370
 finally with various sales success 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.650
 companies involve developing games for 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.450
 including the very harvest that made the 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.050
 Most console successes among 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.190

 Troicki afternoon 

00:05:27.859 --> 00:05:32.479
 Finally, another nice feature in the 

00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:34.429
 friend of lili aimar developed 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:37.309
 especially for the media gedeon sega 

00:05:34.429 --> 00:05:39.619
 which is capable of 1 gig . 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:42.319
 storage this media 

00:05:39.619 --> 00:05:43.789
 has two sessions the first was as 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:46.369
 cd room normal than the computer 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:47.689
 recognizes and in the section looks only accessible 

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:49.999
 by pc 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:51.829
 usually has some game bonus 

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:53.359
 such as wallpaper and 

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:55.069
 nerds information 

00:05:53.359 --> 00:05:57.229
 already the second session was only 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:58.669
 accessible the dreamcast and has the data 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:01.159
 about the game 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.599
 But in 2000 it came to market 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:04.999
 would be the most innovative of all 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:06.889
 consoles or playstation 2 that despite the 

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:09.379
 strong market share survey 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:12.199
 not on the shoulders of the sega island 

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:14.209
 or two was a generation marked the 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:16.579
 world of video games not only by the 

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:18.589
 graphics and hardware but also by 

00:06:16.579 --> 00:06:20.539
 bring a new media games the dvd will 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:21.829
 making the console also a platform 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:23.839
 multimedia 

00:06:21.829 --> 00:06:27.049
 for you to see movies anyway you rest 

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:28.549
 already know in 2002 the sega gave up and 

00:06:27.049 --> 00:06:30.289
 announced that he was making a change 

00:06:28.549 --> 00:06:32.029
 plans across the enterprise 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:34.279
 they are still officially ricketts 

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:36.139
 in fact the sega was smart to make game 

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:37.789
 for playstation 2 it gave much more 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:39.889
 profit than to attack with one's own 

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:41.989
 console and still produce games for him 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:43.309
 also points out that it is already 

00:06:41.989 --> 00:06:45.649
 exceeded 

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:47.479
 good in 2007 sold more than 10 million 

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:49.789
 units has left a legion of fans 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:52.009
 today all over the world and many more 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:53.899
 require that mowing be re-made 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:56.419
 for dreamcast that had a very death 

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:58.099
 precocious and left a trauma in the 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:59.659
 famous series that today closed the doors 

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:02.149
 in the world of consoles 

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:03.559
 anyway the cars are just for us who 

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:05.629

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:07.219
 content with games emulators 

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:09.799
