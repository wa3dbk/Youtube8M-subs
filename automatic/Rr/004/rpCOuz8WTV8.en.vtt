00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.640
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.240
 murder notion today again not 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.040
 again a lesson 67 the first one 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.590
 glass metric I think so 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:19.130
 have imagined or imagine what can 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.720
 the new one can thrash 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.539
 At least he has no texture bugs 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.949
 the klaas logo again you will 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.920
 certainly a clear scanner if he 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:34.710
 certainly see it optically in principle 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.090
 nothing but a lexus 780 me 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.420
 I'm not sure if it's here 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.190
 the side part at the 780 also so high 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.989
 is or continues to go down but 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.430
 from the back he would have to believe me 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.719
 be identical because something is missing 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.300
 Fans and so on, I also have in 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.469
 The comments were not made smart 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.789
 have mature here in any case nice 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.860
 we have a reasonably acceptable 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.300
 texture that you can now 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.719
 really do not complain so much he has on 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.370
 every track crawler a twelve 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.550
 meter vario schneidwerk that is 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.690
 So that's a lot 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.769
 visually here then makes talk 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.479
 a really good impression 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.450
 of course, an annotated model of 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.920
 13 otherwise fits so you need 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.340
 really no longer wondering that 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.280
 something the times that nothing else 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.360
 we'll go in, we'll see, of course 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.670
 that we have to look at it first 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.170
 The nose is very exciting because we 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.439
 have been here a person inside the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.140
 can also steer quasi course only 15 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.409
 degree angle or something is a bit 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.360
 more maybe 45 degrees angle 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.810
 otherwise the animation l the to me 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.820
 the animation becomes the interior of the castle 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.079
 are not by default now 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.560
 play outstanding too 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.259
 not that we ask too much here yes 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.110
 not necessarily but the all-round lights 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.600
 are also very thin left 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.829
 do not work 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.240
 light works and it looks too 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.689
 that's good for everyone 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.070
 case what I notice driving ahead 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.350
 Of course, that logo is that 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.740
 work must work completely 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.390
 threshing out that works too 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.369
 Everything's great what else to do 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.349
 I expect optical from the model I think 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.040
 a very good model so if you have the 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.620
 look at it from behind 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.890
 side can be said is a good one 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.700
 So model already sees you to the topos 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.730
 Of course we can also do it with the tailor 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.510
 Adjust the height of the canopy and 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.569
 push the reel and the cutting mechanism 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.189
 and again away from the cutting work that has 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.689
 at least the sense of what the device 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.010
 Schneider is and we have to 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:35.200
 also increases expand 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.359
 because of the laser ok are right here 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.280
 So too, that's exciting too 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:42.310
 switched interests simply and times 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.540
 thresh times briefly for a while as the first 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.049
 negative is the speed 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.519
 which is utterly illogical at 20 km / h 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.409
 since then no idea or wanted 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.790
 it so I'm going down here right now 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:56.590
 at 8 km h this is a realistic saying 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.680
 I even if the already 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.209
 Reality is a bit fast though 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.220
 ansich reel turns works 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.909
 everything more often straw out we can do that 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.889
 certainly turn off right now 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.959
 the stop store should come just that 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:13.000
 also works fine sprinkle the 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.530
 complete width so visually I can 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.060
 do not notice any negative points here 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.760
 So what, at least, it is not now 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.799
 texture that is clear but in itself 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.349
 principle nothing else again 780 or 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.310
 speed as well as me 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.139
 I'm not sure if that 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.540
 he backpart he from the side also 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.349
 would have as high at 780 otherwise there 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.760
 be identical 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:37.120
 works because we look 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.569
 short in the shop around there is here in the 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.069
 shop as I said you see here the 77 780 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.739
 60 and you see nothing it will not be 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.709
 so it's the same thing 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:50.500
 From the price we have the problem here 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:54.400
 that the 780 costs 37,000 and 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.650
 Realistically, 760 are using its 370,000 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.299
 580 euro maintenance costs also the twelve 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.000
 mario meter cutters to that almost 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:03.129
 100,000 costs so a lot and 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.109
 the twelve-piece class of speed corn 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:07.840
 bitten for 58,000 euros 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:10.239
 picture and in the shop and on is everything 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.669
 13 I would say that offers something 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.509
 it should not have a minimum now 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.430
 overly much 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:17.199
 it is still nice if at one 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.759
 good and nice description 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.500
 a final picture and a nice logo 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.440
 in it, however, is more realistic 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.510
 Price and the ps 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.910
 number or performance whatever 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.190
 is specified depending on which machine 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.690
 Ultimately, I'm acting in front there again 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.510
 say thank you for watching i hope that 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.680
 fashion is a must for you 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.320
 at least once down is and looks 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.970
 We really like the opinion in the 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.100
 I would like to have comments 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.930
 no problem and we will meet again in 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.930
 the further engine position becomes at night
