00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.570
 the three red lights or the one called 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.670
 red circle of death was one of the 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.700
 main causes of the losses of xbox 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.200
 360 for a long period of time 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.270
 reaching such magnitude that the jefazos 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.919
 of Microsoft had to roll up their sleeves and 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.110
 get down to work to try 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.579
 overcome that embarrassing bump with the 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.160
 that so many users had to 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:36.070
 deal here server goes for his fifth 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.739
 replacement unit console 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.960
 microsoft assured that the xbox index 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.970
 360 defective in its first months of 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.730
 life was typical of any product 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.879
 electronic oscillating before 3 and 5 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.489
 percent in 2006 began to appear from 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.900
 recurrent and alarming way a problem 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.640
 that reported consoles in which 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.530
 freeze the image and that when returning to 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.090
 turn on the user was 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.410
 with that red signal that illuminated 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.199
 three-fourths of the button's length 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.670
 on those symptoms of noticed 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.140
 of a serious condition that is what I'm going to 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.780
 be operated in a technical center of 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.369
 microsoft places that little by little it 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.170
 assimilated to electronic cemeteries 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.210
 where pieces of 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.399
 consoles scrapped and in which 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.200
 the size of the problem was designed to create 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.289
 reconditioned machines as a solution 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.030
 in 2007 microsoft had to announce the 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.920
 extension of the warranty period for 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.630
 tranquility of the users though 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.340
 never made public the reason why 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.740
 they were dropping their xbox 360 like flies 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.929
 some sources linked to the development of 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.700
 console ensured that it was a 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.950
 architecture error a bad design 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.500
 pieces of questionable quality and a 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.600
 insufficient testing all in pursuit of 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.969
 manage to reduce costs and arrive on time 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.679
 to the Christmas campaign of 2005 for 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.240
 present to the innovative consumer the 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.340
 last and most sophisticated caprice in 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.229
 consoles some publications 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.179
 independents dared to 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.250
 investigate on their own and they pointed 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.009
 as guilty the graphic chip and the 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.069
 extended methodology in the welds 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.179
 in 2008 the squaretrade firm dedicated to 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:05.640
 after-sales services 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:09.060
 repair and guarantees practiced a test 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.269
 in the new xbox 360 of the thousand 40 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.900
 machines submitted 16.4 percent is 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:19.170
 say 171 failed a number 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.730
 quite far from the 68% rate that 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.319
 supposedly it came off one 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.769
 test done much earlier with the models 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.959
 old even with all a 16.4 percent 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.910
 it was an amount that also did not 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.400
 approached the fork of 35 by 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.560
 percent considered acceptable 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.599
 in that same year microsoft gave for 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.390
 settled the crisis although the problems 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.129
 of hardware persisted xbox 360 happened 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.930
 by successive revisions of hardware with 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.569
 different code names like 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.370
 sheffield falcon or hasper that included 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:51.060
 because hdmi lower power consumption 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:54.000
 better cooling or a 65 gpu 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.900
 nanometers still those of redmon 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.579
 they had to deal with problems 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.280
 related to power supplies 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.379
 the use of kinect seemed inappropriate in 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.909
 old consoles appeared discs 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.409
 scratched by the reader or flyers 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:08.010
 officers that overheated in 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:09.450
 excess recently peter moore one of 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.819
 the managers that was linked to the 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.370
 Xbox brand from the early years of Xbox 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.650
 360 as many will know as the uncle 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.480
 of the tattoo of grand theft auto 4 ha 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.859
 shed some light on how they lived 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.340
 internally that the bad drink in 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.340
 microsoft 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.220
 I quote textually peter moore 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.769
 we noticed that we had an incidence 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.780
 remember to approach robbie bach my boss 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.790
 and tell him he thought we were 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.849
 having a problem billion 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.470
 dollars was a truly matter 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.599
 challenging for our engineers and not 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.129
 we could imagine what it was about 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.560
 we knew that something that had to do with 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.660
 the heat 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.610
 the moment that I will never forget is when 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.890
 I told rivas that we had a meeting 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.440
 of business in building 34 with steve 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.120
 ballmer I explained to him that we had to 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.459
 tell steve what we were going to do 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.930
 send an empty fedex box to each 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.269
 consumer who had problems of 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.390
 red lights that returned us inside 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.739
 your console and that we would fix it on 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.540
 matter is that steve is a guy who 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.580
 I admire a lot but it is also a person 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.340
 that intimidates so I told steve 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:16.400
 to convince him the following if not 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.620
 we make this the brand is dead and I 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.019
 I wonder how much it would cost to take 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.620
 breath and I told him and without hesitation I 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.330
 answered later do it I calculated with the 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.970
 financial team that all this would be 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.310
 the thousand 150 million dollars and never 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.919
 I will forget that 240 million were just 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.940
 for fedex his actions must have 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.190
 shoot during the following 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.280
 weeks I thought ours would fall 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:43.040
 full but in fact nothing changed 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.780
 undoubtedly the one with the three red lights was 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.490
 one of the most shameful episodes of 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.710
 the last generation of consoles and the 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.600
 history of videogames a turned out 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.700
 incredible and a company of the caliber of 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.320
 microsoft put a date ahead 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.940
 of launching a product that 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.430
 comply with the minimum requirements of 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.040
 quality and that also cost hundreds of 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.930
 euros although with the perspective of 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.970
 time that maneuver to launch the 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.560
 console before Sony who swung 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.470
 quite with the price of the premiere of 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.450
 600 euros playstation3 can be vital 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.400
 for the xbox brand to become more 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.200
 common between the public and will reach 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.630
 technical sales tie at the end of the 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.950
 past console war a battle to 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.510
 the one that an arrogant sony was very 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.190
 confident while living that dream 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.190
 where I was in love with herself
