this video we wanted to give you an idea

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.069 
this video we wanted to give you an idea
of<00:00:38.370> what<00:00:38.699> it<00:00:38.820> would<00:00:38.909> be<00:00:39.059> like<00:00:39.089> to<00:00:39.449> engage<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
of what it would be like to engage the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:01:04.380 
of what it would be like to engage the
enemy<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.440> starship<00:00:41.010> combat

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.720 

the<00:01:04.840> most<00:01:05.020> basic<00:01:05.410> strategy<00:01:06.190> in<00:01:06.280> starship

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 
the most basic strategy in starship

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.970 
the most basic strategy in starship
combat<00:01:07.150> is<00:01:07.300> to<00:01:07.450> maneuver<00:01:07.900> your<00:01:07.960> ship<00:01:08.290> use<00:01:08.800> your

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:08.980 
combat is to maneuver your ship use your

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.610 
combat is to maneuver your ship use your
energy<00:01:09.160> weapons<00:01:09.940> to<00:01:10.120> bear<00:01:10.300> on<00:01:10.570> one<00:01:10.960> section<00:01:11.500> of

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
energy weapons to bear on one section of

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.890 
energy weapons to bear on one section of
your<00:01:11.770> enemy's<00:01:12.220> shields<00:01:12.760> knock<00:01:13.180> those<00:01:13.450> shields

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
your enemy's shields knock those shields

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.900 
your enemy's shields knock those shields
down<00:01:14.110> and<00:01:14.410> then<00:01:14.530> use<00:01:14.650> your<00:01:14.680> photon<00:01:15.280> torpedoes

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
down and then use your photon torpedoes

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:23.359 
down and then use your photon torpedoes
on<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:16.510> exposed<00:01:16.840> home

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.520 

so<00:01:23.850> there's<00:01:24.030> three<00:01:24.329> basic<00:01:24.899> types<00:01:25.079> of<00:01:25.320> ships

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
so there's three basic types of ships

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.870 
so there's three basic types of ships
that<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:25.950> get<00:01:26.100> an<00:01:26.250> Sto

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
that you can get an Sto

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.200 
that you can get an Sto
the<00:01:27.329> first<00:01:27.600> one<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.079> a<00:01:28.259> cruiser<00:01:29.060> cruisers<00:01:30.060> are

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
the first one is a cruiser cruisers are

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.059 
the first one is a cruiser cruisers are
really<00:01:30.600> tough<00:01:30.780> they<00:01:31.020> take<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> lot<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.530> damage

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:32.069 
really tough they take a lot of damage

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:33.260 
really tough they take a lot of damage
to<00:01:32.100> take<00:01:32.340> them<00:01:32.549> down<00:01:32.579> they<00:01:32.909> have<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.060> lot<00:01:33.240> of

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
to take them down they have a lot of

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.450 
to take them down they have a lot of
crew<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:33.840> they're<00:01:33.960> hard<00:01:34.109> to<00:01:34.259> disable<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:35.280> is

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
crew so they're hard to disable this is

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.620 
crew so they're hard to disable this is
really<00:01:35.909> good<00:01:36.060> for<00:01:36.270> tanking<00:01:38.119> second<00:01:39.119> time<00:01:39.329> is

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
really good for tanking second time is

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.289 
really good for tanking second time is
an<00:01:40.289> escort<00:01:40.679> escorts<00:01:41.369> are<00:01:41.459> really<00:01:41.759> fast

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
an escort escorts are really fast

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.120 
an escort escorts are really fast
they're<00:01:42.659> pretty<00:01:42.869> maneuverable<00:01:43.590> they<00:01:43.979> can

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
they're pretty maneuverable they can

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.429 
they're pretty maneuverable they can
dish<00:01:44.280> out<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.490> lot<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.939> damage<00:01:45.299> at<00:01:45.420> one<00:01:45.600> time<00:01:45.929> but

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
dish out a lot of damage at one time but

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.630 
dish out a lot of damage at one time but
they're<00:01:46.590> pretty<00:01:46.770> weak<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.310> they're<00:01:47.459> a<00:01:47.490> lot

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
they're pretty weak so they're a lot

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.870 
they're pretty weak so they're a lot
better<00:01:47.789> for<00:01:48.090> dealing<00:01:48.299> DPS<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.369> third<00:01:50.369> type<00:01:50.670> is

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
better for dealing DPS the third type is

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.819 
better for dealing DPS the third type is
a<00:01:50.969> science<00:01:51.359> ship<00:01:51.479> science<00:01:52.079> ships<00:01:52.259> are<00:01:52.409> really

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
a science ship science ships are really

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.770 
a science ship science ships are really
good<00:01:53.069> at<00:01:53.340> increasing<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.000> abilities<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.509> you

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
good at increasing the abilities of you

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.719 
good at increasing the abilities of you
and<00:01:54.929> your<00:01:55.020> teammates<00:01:55.409> we're<00:01:55.950> decreasing<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
and your teammates we're decreasing the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.399 
and your teammates we're decreasing the
abilities<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.329> enemy<00:01:57.630> they<00:01:58.020> do<00:01:58.170> crazy

abilities of the enemy they do crazy
stuff<00:01:58.799> like<00:01:58.920> bouncing<00:01:59.399> things<00:01:59.520> off<00:01:59.729> a

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
stuff like bouncing things off a

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.580 
stuff like bouncing things off a
deflector<00:02:00.270> dishes<00:02:00.599> or<00:02:00.780> scrambling<00:02:01.289> enemy

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
deflector dishes or scrambling enemy

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.499 
deflector dishes or scrambling enemy
sensors<00:02:02.039> it's<00:02:02.729> really<00:02:03.209> good<00:02:03.360> at<00:02:03.450> doing

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
sensors it's really good at doing

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.149 
sensors it's really good at doing
support

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.460 

so<00:02:07.729> one<00:02:07.939> of<00:02:07.969> the<00:02:08.119> additional<00:02:08.690> ways<00:02:08.899> you<00:02:09.289> can

so one of the additional ways you can

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.589 
so one of the additional ways you can
customize<00:02:09.950> your<00:02:09.979> ship<00:02:10.429> instead<00:02:11.300> of<00:02:11.390> just

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
customize your ship instead of just

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.780 
customize your ship instead of just
customizing<00:02:12.500> your<00:02:12.680> crew<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:13.400> can<00:02:13.550> also

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
customizing your crew you can also

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.580 
customizing your crew you can also
customize<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.630> components<00:02:15.230> that<00:02:15.349> are<00:02:15.440> on

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
customize the components that are on

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.220 
customize the components that are on
your<00:02:15.830> ship<00:02:16.069> so<00:02:16.280> for<00:02:16.849> example<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:17.900> I<00:02:17.959> may

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
your ship so for example you and I may

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.410 
your ship so for example you and I may
both<00:02:18.470> have<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.830> same<00:02:18.860> class<00:02:19.400> of<00:02:19.430> ship<00:02:19.849> but<00:02:20.300> the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
both have the same class of ship but the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.180 
both have the same class of ship but the
items<00:02:20.840> that<00:02:20.930> I'm<00:02:21.110> going<00:02:21.349> to<00:02:21.380> put<00:02:21.590> on<00:02:21.709> my<00:02:21.890> ship

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
items that I'm going to put on my ship

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.460 
items that I'm going to put on my ship
might<00:02:22.610> be<00:02:22.760> different<00:02:23.090> than<00:02:23.180> yours<00:02:23.470> for

might be different than yours for

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.890 
might be different than yours for
example<00:02:24.849> some<00:02:25.849> of<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.030> station<00:02:26.450> mods<00:02:26.630> that<00:02:26.780> I

example some of the station mods that I
put<00:02:27.170> on<00:02:27.200> my<00:02:27.440> ship<00:02:27.709> might<00:02:27.920> impact<00:02:28.310> my<00:02:28.519> phasers

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
put on my ship might impact my phasers

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.120 
put on my ship might impact my phasers
for<00:02:29.180> Michael<00:02:29.510> PTO's<00:02:29.840> there<00:02:30.440> might<00:02:30.650> even<00:02:30.680> be<00:02:31.010> a

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
for Michael PTO's there might even be a

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.740 
for Michael PTO's there might even be a
difference<00:02:31.519> in<00:02:31.670> our<00:02:31.819> deflector<00:02:32.300> dish<00:02:32.330> show
