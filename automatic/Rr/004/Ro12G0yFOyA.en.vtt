00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
do my own type of you know this is what

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.520 
do my own type of you know this is what
the<00:00:51.899> evolution<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.530> combat<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:54.050> so<00:00:55.050> doing<00:00:55.469> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the evolution of combat is so doing a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.750 
the evolution of combat is so doing a
slayer<00:00:55.770> task<00:00:56.039> right<00:00:56.340> now<00:00:56.690> bear<00:00:57.690> inspectors

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
slayer task right now bear inspectors

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.700 
slayer task right now bear inspectors
weakness<00:00:59.760> is<00:01:00.000> thrown<00:01:00.510> weapons<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.289> just

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
weakness is thrown weapons so I just

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.100 
weakness is thrown weapons so I just
assumed<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.219> they're<00:01:02.520> weak<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.329> range<00:01:03.870> in

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
assumed that they're weak to range in

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.160 
assumed that they're weak to range in
general<00:01:04.470> um<00:01:05.270> yeah<00:01:06.270> using<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> rapid-fire

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
general um yeah using the rapid-fire

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.440 
general um yeah using the rapid-fire
ability<00:01:07.799> right<00:01:07.979> now<00:01:08.189> pretty<00:01:08.700> amazing<00:01:09.420> um<00:01:11.450> yeah

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
ability right now pretty amazing um yeah

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.920 
ability right now pretty amazing um yeah
I<00:01:13.049> think<00:01:13.340> like<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.700> saw<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> video<00:01:15.810> earlier

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
I think like I saw a video earlier

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.440 
I think like I saw a video earlier
forget<00:01:16.619> what<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> guys<00:01:17.040> username<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.330> he

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450

forget what the guys username is but he
was<00:01:18.570> like<00:01:18.750> auto<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.229> system<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:19.890> unique

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
was like auto the system is so unique

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.200 
was like auto the system is so unique
you<00:01:20.790> know<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.920> totally<00:01:23.460> agree<00:01:23.640> with<00:01:24.000> him

just gonna you know do some range going

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.060 
just gonna you know do some range going
to<00:01:41.400> use<00:01:41.579> momentum<00:01:42.079> going<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.229> use<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.860> don't

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
to use momentum going to use the I don't

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.920 
to use momentum going to use the I don't
know<00:01:44.189> what<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.700> called<00:01:44.790> right<00:01:45.180> now<00:01:45.329> because

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
curses which I don't even have curses

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.850 
curses which I don't even have curses
because<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.430> again<00:03:11.850> fucking<00:03:12.239> up<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:13.320> likes<00:03:13.560> of

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
because I again fucking up the likes of

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.520 
because I again fucking up the likes of
right<00:03:14.400> there<00:03:14.670> man<00:03:15.000> um<00:03:16.970> so<00:03:17.970> yeah<00:03:18.239> right<00:03:18.299> now<00:03:18.540> I

right there man um so yeah right now I

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.199 
right there man um so yeah right now I
think<00:03:22.100> momentum<00:03:23.100> ability<00:03:23.459> is<00:03:23.700> just

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
think momentum ability is just

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.770 
think momentum ability is just
phenomenal<00:03:24.769> it<00:03:25.769> is<00:03:25.980> what<00:03:26.370> everyone<00:03:26.820> want<00:03:27.299> it

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
phenomenal it is what everyone want it

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.930 
phenomenal it is what everyone want it
is<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.140> old<00:03:28.350> combat<00:03:28.830> system<00:03:29.250> put<00:03:29.459> just<00:03:29.670> better

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
is the old combat system put just better

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.490 
is the old combat system put just better
look<00:03:30.239> you're<00:03:30.420> amped<00:03:30.780> up<00:03:30.900> doing<00:03:31.200> way<00:03:31.470> more

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
look you're amped up doing way more

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.690 
look you're amped up doing way more
damage<00:03:32.310> you<00:03:33.030> know<00:03:33.209> like<00:03:33.709> one<00:03:34.709> of<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:35.010> momentum

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
damage you know like one of the momentum

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.490 
damage you know like one of the momentum
abilities<00:03:36.090> or<00:03:36.390> one<00:03:36.660> of<00:03:36.690> them<00:03:36.840> went<00:03:37.019> to<00:03:37.110> attacks

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
abilities or one of them went to attacks

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.430 
abilities or one of them went to attacks
you<00:03:37.739> get<00:03:37.920> while<00:03:38.160> using<00:03:38.400> momentum<00:03:38.640> is<00:03:39.440> for

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
you get while using momentum is for

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.979 
you get while using momentum is for
range<00:03:40.739> is<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.340> fragmentation<00:03:42.180> ability<00:03:42.780> which

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
range is the fragmentation ability which

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.440 
range is the fragmentation ability which
is<00:03:43.140> damage<00:03:43.470> over<00:03:43.739> time<00:03:43.769> so<00:03:44.700> that<00:03:44.910> alone<00:03:45.209> is

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
is damage over time so that alone is

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.870 
is damage over time so that alone is
just<00:03:45.690> freaking<00:03:46.200> great<00:03:46.320> way<00:03:47.280> better<00:03:47.310> than<00:03:47.820> what

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
just freaking great way better than what
