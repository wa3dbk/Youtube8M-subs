try and land live I think it might be a
little<00:02:25.660> mail<00:02:25.959> hence<00:02:26.500> it's<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:27.010> voice<00:02:27.819> quite

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600

tent i just weighed in and he's two and

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.050 
tent i just weighed in and he's two and
a<00:05:31.770> half<00:05:31.979> pounds<00:05:32.340> exactly<00:05:33.300> so<00:05:34.169> nice<00:05:34.979> fish<00:05:35.400> um<00:05:35.729> i

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
a half pounds exactly so nice fish um i

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.210 
a half pounds exactly so nice fish um i
think<00:05:36.900> though<00:05:37.260> he<00:05:37.440> looks<00:05:37.620> a<00:05:37.710> bit<00:05:37.800> bigger<00:05:38.070> than

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
think though he looks a bit bigger than

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.600 
think though he looks a bit bigger than
the<00:05:38.280> answer<00:05:38.610> is<00:05:38.820> he<00:05:39.720> looks<00:05:39.900> about<00:05:40.139> three

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
the answer is he looks about three

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.210 
the answer is he looks about three
during<00:05:41.610> a<00:05:41.669> quarter<00:05:41.970> to<00:05:42.120> me<00:05:42.300> but<00:05:42.599> um<00:05:43.220> perhaps

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
during a quarter to me but um perhaps

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.969 
during a quarter to me but um perhaps
because<00:05:44.729> it's<00:05:44.909> just<00:05:45.210> turn<00:05:45.479> spring<00:05:45.990> hasn't<00:05:46.770> had

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
because it's just turn spring hasn't had

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:49.430 
because it's just turn spring hasn't had
enough<00:05:47.009> time<00:05:47.430> to<00:05:47.490> put<00:05:47.729> on<00:05:47.820> anyway<00:05:48.180> but<00:05:48.570> yeah<00:05:49.259> i

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
enough time to put on anyway but yeah i

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.719 
enough time to put on anyway but yeah i
also<00:05:49.680> had<00:05:49.830> a<00:05:49.860> nice<00:05:50.099> a<00:05:51.080> lot<00:05:52.080> of<00:05:52.169> Rudd<00:05:52.580> none<00:05:53.580> of

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
also had a nice a lot of Rudd none of

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.339 
also had a nice a lot of Rudd none of
any<00:05:53.909> good<00:05:54.090> size<00:05:54.419> but<00:05:54.840> a<00:05:55.139> very<00:05:55.800> typical<00:05:56.210> spring

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:57.349 
any good size but a very typical spring

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:05.120 
any good size but a very typical spring
