00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:14.680
 now you are setting up everything picked up by doc 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:17.000
 if you want you can make a mouse 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.390
 just scroll wheel up or 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.730
 down what house did i do on top and side 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.039
 and when you get it right I 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.150
 show just should be about 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:32.900
 it turns out the right so on dry 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:37.520
 to make it so we are only 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:41.059
 need to get you started 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.890
 scroll wheel forward on the mouse 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.680
 tom scene squeeze contra 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:51.530
 the keyboard and very quickly do it all 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.020
 on the mouse spun the first time or me 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.360
 skype and made icons rarely on forward 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.800
 contour and so on, that is, nothing else 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.430
 so that you can check how you have 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.880
 it turns out you after him holt 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.789
 We see another thing that you could have masked 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.340
 I get so here as in this situation 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:15.590
 because for beginners up was give 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.040
 It turns out I do not think about it 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.630
 everything turns out 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:25.630
 he is so breed 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.630
 and exactly the same 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.840
 now show you how to 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.710
 train you have my while 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.870
 create 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.030
 and starts avoiding the desirable to include 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.640
 and groups in order to find after all 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.540
 revise you learned you get 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.580
 that is, and live and eat, just take 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.270
 take take 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:49.040
 the thing is very good but we all 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.369
 use a pole that is to you not 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.390
 It helps or otherwise that is run and 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:58.550
 take 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.509
 everything is as if he is tired of running 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.160
 you can 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:06.200
 and unfold a little like that 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:10.009
 as well as if you want to 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.470
 opened a normal server 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.630
 it was filmed it was a test server 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.300
 which if what development will be if 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.459
 at least you have a normal server and where not 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.459
 there will be nothing extra then join 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.489
 group and post a similar post 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.769
 likes and e100 will be typed soon 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.410
 500 likes it will open normal 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.690
 a server where you can even be just 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.269
 play out admin and 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.299
 admin will be just fine not as 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.440
 happening now on other publics where 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:42.940
 simply can not understand what 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.940
 and without any problem
