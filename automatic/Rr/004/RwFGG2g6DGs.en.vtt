00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hi girls today no video tutorial e 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.150
 this tutorial compensated with a trick 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.550
 elegant I don't know if it's a shirt by 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.960
 jeans and therefore elegant there are not 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.190
 dressed but because it does not make you dress 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.849
 in short this is my concept of 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.290
 elegance 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.030
 that is, if I had to think of a trick 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.389
 elegant I'd like a thing of the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.910
 gender 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.279
 a kind of brown smokey like a lot 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.800
 delicate because he wants to try this 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.150
 lipstick as I also tell you the game 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.279
 of the video is that of el anni that I have 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.869
 found in this month's pcbox email 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.600
 which is the number 81 or r72 rust that 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.250
 still beautiful in my opinion I don't know if it is 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.989
 suitable for the summer mapper period 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.300
 autumn definitely a lot and it is 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.000
 opaque is the first time moment would be 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.789
 came out he thought of using it because 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.200
 in short, I love color and I love it 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.270
 nothing so I hope you enjoy the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.770
 tutorial I leave you to the photos I send you 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.640
 a browning and we go down to next 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.640
 we give bye bye 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.579
 objects that are 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.570
 both above and below private lakes always 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.910
 with the pays now I'm going to get the scoop 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.550
 different this one from murdoch and with 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.140
 the big brush I'm going to take the Hon 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.729
 a package and I go along it all 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.720
 mobile eyelid also coming below 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.720
 the eyebrow arch 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.320
 now I'm going to take it with a brush 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.770
 chubby I took this one store 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.750
 of signs of Chinese the Chinese naked 1 and 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.030
 I'm going to get it but that 's the color anymore 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.950
 dark opaque and I'm going to spread it over the 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:40.119
 movable eyelid shading even a little 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:41.560
 in the fold of the eye I clean a 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:47.560
 bit the brush from the excess product e 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.940
 it should be blended to shape well now 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.429
 in the outer corner always with the same 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.750
 brush I take some coffee numerone 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:54.130
 darker than the different one when 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.509
 while right in the outer corner for 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.509
 give a little more depth 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.130
 the low a little bit of the year from here 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:12.390
 under the eyebrow arch for 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:14.070
 blend even better than marroni and in 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.020
 lower part with a brush more 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.760
 this relationship is always small but these 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.750
 of the royal minutes for water and soap if 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.060
 I'm not mistaken 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.709
 I'm going to put the first one on the whole 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.150
 the lower rhyme leaving only book 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.840
 the weapon of the interior and then finally 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.840
 a bit of coffee 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.580
 in the internal rhyme but so this one 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.620
 pencil that is ending me that of the 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.569
 essence of the line from a lasting e 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.569
 this is 0287 the brown one 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.030
 and in the inner gorge always wind a 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.860
 little opaque with the same 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.570
 paintbrush just a pinch right for 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.570
 conclude the trick 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.140
 ok now i take the black pencil and i use 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.780
 this quick heal automatic rainer 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.660
 long lasting of trouble with 114 black la 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.310
 very simple automatic black pencil e 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.810
 I'm going to make my girlfriend from Elena e 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.160
 then he carries it a little outside with a 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.140
 small brush and I will use this 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.890
 fifteen m 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.890
 but I did this 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.460
 go mascara while this kiko here 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.750
 that to the sport proof that it is a mascara 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.730
 Once the point rocchi I really like 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.350
 because we say that you feel enough 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.810
 to eyelashes like decades and then I have it 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.770
 set above and below 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.750
 ok eye make-up here 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.550
 will go on to make the base show you 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.010
 even the laces are still the base 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.000
 they come in from home maybe in the piece 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.150
 intro you will see me settled for 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.380
 come out I hope and to lower when 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.210
 I don't feel like being too products 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.000
 because it's not too hot 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.200
 I present warm mm supplied libido I go to 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.860
 take my checker the gate e 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.810
 mapping calculation that is enough 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.160
 as light as texture I go to 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.070
 put a little on the hand but summer you 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.840
 I always remove the china pump and go to 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:14.500
 first of all under the glasses and 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:19.300
 on the various profits and what advances 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.190
 then I put it on the rest of the face lips 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.570
 that this brush that was a made 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.640
 part of a 7 thousand are in dialogue 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.640
 I do not remember which minisite anyway 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.120
 they are similar to the click trial and it is 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.120
 I'm going to fade 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.520
 you will probably see one now 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.750
 terrible break between neck and face because 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.260
 is a little bit so I understand now 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.290
 I'm going to put the foundation on top of it 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.210
 of Cuba this is the former primate of the number 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:05:00.130
 0 40 and knows how to put it on with the 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:03.360
 sponge in order to increase its size 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.360
 covering also the estate 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.700
 for they don't look like a corpse I'm going to give 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.010
 a shot of land even if this is not 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.960
 extremely writing and this of the f 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.300
 the author never has more than boxing 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.630
 802 always works with the power brace of 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.630
 s 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.710
 now how to really blush this here 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.330
 rinsing that instead a lot that the lo 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.860
 0 2 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.900
 and it is the one lightly on the edge 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:46.540
 the oval extends with the blush brush 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:48.100
 of tetris the other says I did this 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.760
 video this tutorial because i wanted 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.010
 use on the lips 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.920
 this lipstick that is of elan that 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.870
 it escapes it because I found it in the RAI 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.730
 beatbox light is seen in the latest videos 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.860
 and the evening landing told me mine 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.540
 before removing make-up, go home 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.300
 that is, I took home as I speak 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.770
 I came home after the release and I did 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.480
 are running too many let me try 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.950
 this lipstick that not only resulted in 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.570
 a hand, however, I don't have his hands yet 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.680
 lips and I loved it with the 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.070
 very particular that I personally 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.620
 I didn't have and isn't really a 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.270
 summer arrangement I can admit though it is 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.250
 very beautiful the very particular heart 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.290
 so flight let you see me not 7 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.730
 this will seem to you much more than 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.010
 because I repeat I have a light it really is 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:29.230
 therefore, a bari is almost dark 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:32.140
 my room very dark and i'm pro 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.460
 illuminated by a divine light way 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:37.380
 put these we take if the effect 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.380
 it's not with the full make-up okay 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.610
 and this is the final tone of my construction 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.870
 really like cancer is really 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.120
 particular 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.759
 I don't think it takes me as many as I do 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.240
 what i am i don't know which i don't have i 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:56.440
 very white teeth and therefore I cannot 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.050
 wanting miracles from a simple one 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.270
 lipstick to me sorry for the phone 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.710
 bet if I know it anyway me 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.259
 concrete result really like tonight 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:06.940
 I will go out if you have red skin but 

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:08.830
 nothing is just done with the little dye 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.590
 and yet monsieur I have not revived 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:14.050
 understand them so here is the beautiful color and 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.099
 indeed it is precisely if probably before 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.349
 this video I'll get the one up 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:19.330
 this this color therefore leaves 

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:20.919
 linked here if you care nothing 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:24.990
