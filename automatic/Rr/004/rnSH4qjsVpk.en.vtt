version<00:00:41.870> the<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.140> comes<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.440> two<00:00:43.590> different

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
version the it comes in two different

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.569 
version the it comes in two different
engines<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.989> 1.8<00:00:45.989> liter<00:00:46.290> double<00:00:47.100> overhead

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
engines the 1.8 liter double overhead

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.720 
engines the 1.8 liter double overhead
variable<00:00:48.390> valve<00:00:48.570> timing<00:00:48.690> with<00:00:49.200> intelligence

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
variable valve timing with intelligence

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.500 
variable valve timing with intelligence
and<00:00:50.730> basically<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:52.460> varies<00:00:53.460> both<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.120> intake

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
and basically it varies both the intake

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.080 
and basically it varies both the intake
and<00:00:54.810> the<00:00:54.989> exhaust<00:00:55.040> so<00:00:56.040> that<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.579> optimizes

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
and the exhaust so that it optimizes

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.910 
and the exhaust so that it optimizes
your<00:00:57.329> fuel<00:00:57.870> economy<00:00:58.280> and<00:00:59.280> also<00:01:00.590> it<00:01:01.590> gives<00:01:01.620> you

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
your fuel economy and also it gives you

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.789 
transmission the automatic transmission
is<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.440> four-speed<00:01:28.890> automatic<00:01:29.119> so<00:01:30.650> here<00:01:31.650> you

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
is a four-speed automatic so here you

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.320 
is a four-speed automatic so here you
have<00:01:32.689> the<00:01:33.689> cores<00:01:34.500> very<00:01:34.799> safe<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.100> drive<00:01:35.490> has

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
have the cores very safe to drive has

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.320 
have the cores very safe to drive has
front<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.020> rear<00:01:37.189> crumple<00:01:38.189> zones<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.180> it

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
front and rear crumple zones so it

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.870 
front and rear crumple zones so it
absorbs<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.990> energy<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:41.159> event<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.700> an

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
impact the engine does have mount so

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.480

the<00:02:46.350> force<00:02:46.590> limiters<00:02:46.830> so<00:02:47.640> basically<00:02:48.180> in<00:02:48.540> the

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
the force limiters so basically in the

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.840 
the force limiters so basically in the
event<00:02:49.110> of<00:02:49.290> an<00:02:49.470> accident<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:50.040> does<00:02:50.250> pull<00:02:50.519> you<00:02:50.700> in

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
and also and then it releases so that

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.009 
and also and then it releases so that
minimizes<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.040> force<00:02:56.280> on<00:02:56.489> your<00:02:56.610> chest<00:02:57.019> it

also comes with active head headrests

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.559 
also comes with active head headrests
here<00:03:00.989> so<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.769> minimizes<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.850> extent<00:03:03.239> of<00:03:03.450> any

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
here so that minimizes the extent of any

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.120 
here so that minimizes the extent of any
whiplash<00:03:04.050> damage<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.680> may<00:03:04.800> occur<00:03:06.980> let's<00:03:07.980> go

have to have access to the trunk and it

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.060 
have to have access to the trunk and it
just<00:03:53.940> folds<00:03:54.180> down<00:03:54.510> flat<00:03:54.870> gives<00:03:55.709> you<00:03:55.890> that
