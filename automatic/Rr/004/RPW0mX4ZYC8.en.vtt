00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
deadlifts last time I did this cycle we

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:48.599 
deadlifts last time I did this cycle we
started<00:00:47.320> with<00:00:47.410> 320<00:00:47.980> pounds<00:00:48.160> of<00:00:48.370> squats

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.609 
started with 320 pounds of squats

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:51.540 
started with 320 pounds of squats
because<00:00:49.480> of<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:49.839> new<00:00:49.989> PR<00:00:50.199> 425<00:00:51.100> we're<00:00:51.399> now

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
because of the new PR 425 we're now

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.630 
because of the new PR 425 we're now
beginning<00:00:51.760> with<00:00:52.030> for<00:00:53.190> 340<00:00:54.190> pounds<00:00:54.309> of<00:00:54.879> squats

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
beginning with for 340 pounds of squats

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.069 
beginning with for 340 pounds of squats
so<00:00:57.640> everyone<00:00:58.059> asked<00:00:58.210> twice<00:00:58.390> why<00:00:58.809> I<00:00:58.839> only

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
so everyone asked twice why I only

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.840 
so everyone asked twice why I only
switch<00:00:59.379> shoes<00:00:59.620> I'm<00:00:59.949> sure<00:01:00.370> most<00:01:00.519> of<00:01:00.699> you<00:01:00.819> know

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
switch shoes I'm sure most of you know

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.090 
switch shoes I'm sure most of you know
at<00:01:01.120> this<00:01:01.210> point<00:01:01.420> but<00:01:01.690> for<00:01:02.379> newer<00:01:02.589> subscribers

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
at this point but for newer subscribers

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.170 
at this point but for newer subscribers
that<00:01:03.190> aren't<00:01:03.370> aware<00:01:03.550> or<00:01:03.730> perhaps<00:01:03.879> newer

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
that aren't aware or perhaps newer

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.140 
that aren't aware or perhaps newer
lifters<00:01:04.570> these<00:01:05.500> Nike<00:01:05.800> Emilio's<00:01:06.400> are<00:01:06.580> specific

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
lifters these Nike Emilio's are specific

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.969 
lifters these Nike Emilio's are specific
Olympic<00:01:07.659> lifting<00:01:07.930> shoes<00:01:07.990> so<00:01:08.440> there<00:01:08.560> are<00:01:08.650> squat

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
Olympic lifting shoes so there are squat

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:10.860 
Olympic lifting shoes so there are squat
shoes<00:01:09.220> basically<00:01:09.430> the<00:01:10.270> for<00:01:10.450> all<00:01:10.570> sorts<00:01:10.810> of

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
shoes basically the for all sorts of

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.330 
shoes basically the for all sorts of
Olympic<00:01:11.140> lifts<00:01:11.380> but<00:01:11.500> obviously<00:01:11.830> squatting<00:01:12.250> is

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
Olympic lifts but obviously squatting is

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.500 
Olympic lifts but obviously squatting is
the<00:01:12.430> only<00:01:12.520> one<00:01:12.640> I<00:01:12.700> do

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
the only one I do

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.900 
the only one I do
they've<00:01:14.020> been<00:01:14.170> very<00:01:14.410> elevated<00:01:14.920> but<00:01:15.340> solid

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
they've been very elevated but solid

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.670 
they've been very elevated but solid
solid<00:01:16.120> heel<00:01:16.570> and<00:01:17.050> what<00:01:17.140> that<00:01:17.260> does<00:01:17.350> is<00:01:17.470> it<00:01:17.560> just

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
solid heel and what that does is it just

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.710 
solid heel and what that does is it just
pushes<00:01:17.920> your<00:01:18.130> heel<00:01:18.370> up<00:01:18.520> higher<00:01:18.760> to<00:01:19.510> give<00:01:19.660> you

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
pushes your heel up higher to give you

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.480 
pushes your heel up higher to give you
more<00:01:19.900> flexibility<00:01:20.590> and<00:01:20.740> mobility<00:01:20.860> in<00:01:21.430> your

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
more flexibility and mobility in your

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.820 
more flexibility and mobility in your
Achilles<00:01:22.060> tendon<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:23.170> basically<00:01:23.530> you<00:01:23.740> know

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
Achilles tendon so basically you know

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.020 
Achilles tendon so basically you know
your<00:01:24.010> Achilles<00:01:24.310> tendon<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.670> one<00:01:24.820> have<00:01:24.940> to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
your Achilles tendon the one have to

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.490 
your Achilles tendon the one have to
stretch<00:01:25.330> as<00:01:25.480> much<00:01:25.510> anymore<00:01:25.870> because<00:01:26.020> your

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
stretch as much anymore because your

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.470 
stretch as much anymore because your
heel<00:01:26.830> is<00:01:26.980> elevated<00:01:27.460> now<00:01:27.580> and<00:01:27.970> it<00:01:28.180> just<00:01:28.300> helps

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.480 
heel is elevated now and it just helps

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.610 
heel is elevated now and it just helps
to<00:01:28.510> kind<00:01:28.630> of<00:01:28.720> sit<00:01:28.960> into<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.200> squat<00:01:29.500> a<00:01:29.530> little

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
to kind of sit into the squat a little

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.640 
to kind of sit into the squat a little
bit<00:01:29.860> better<00:01:30.420> these<00:01:31.420> are<00:01:31.750> my<00:01:31.930> a<00:01:32.140> and<00:01:32.320> is<00:01:32.440> as

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
bit better these are my a and is as

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.500 
bit better these are my a and is as
nature<00:01:32.920> intended<00:01:33.370> and<00:01:33.550> they're<00:01:33.910> specifically

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
nature intended and they're specifically

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.930 
nature intended and they're specifically
a<00:01:34.630> powerlifting<00:01:35.260> shoe<00:01:35.470> great<00:01:36.310> for<00:01:36.550> deadlifts

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
a powerlifting shoe great for deadlifts

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.240 
a powerlifting shoe great for deadlifts
especially<00:01:37.450> they're<00:01:38.260> about<00:01:38.650> three<00:01:38.920> times

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
especially they're about three times

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.030 
especially they're about three times
thinner<00:01:39.730> than<00:01:39.850> chucks<00:01:40.300> the<00:01:40.930> actual<00:01:41.260> sole<00:01:41.650> is

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
thinner than chucks the actual sole is

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.530 
thinner than chucks the actual sole is
probably<00:01:42.610> about<00:01:42.730> that<00:01:43.060> thin<00:01:43.300> when<00:01:43.450> my

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
probably about that thin when my

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.080 
probably about that thin when my
thumbnail<00:01:43.900> is<00:01:44.110> it's<00:01:44.350> four<00:01:44.590> millimeters<00:01:45.160> and

they they're fit like an actual sock

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.870 
they they're fit like an actual sock
they're<00:01:47.950> meant<00:01:48.100> to<00:01:48.130> be<00:01:48.190> a<00:01:48.280> barefoot<00:01:48.640> shoe
