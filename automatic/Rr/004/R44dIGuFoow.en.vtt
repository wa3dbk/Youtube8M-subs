00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 in the usa today has the agrarian 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.290
 monsanto his numbers for the fourth 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.000
 Quarterly business is thriving 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.490
 but despite all economic 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.139
 The seed company remains successful in the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.059
 criticism now has the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.400
 environmental organization greenpeace the eu 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.920
 asked for possible imports of gene 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.930
 plants should at least temporarily become 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.100
 to stop 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.779
 two weeks ago, the study of the 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.880
 French scientist Sera Lee 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.699
 Never frightened the public at 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.529
 a long-term experiment with rats 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.460
 he came to the conclusion that he from 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.850
 large group monsanto distributed genmais 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.829
 be carcinogenic 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.719
 Meanwhile, the debate has the eu 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.129
 just reached from brussels caroline 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.329
 olivier and remondis ag the shock pictures 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.670
 went around the world 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.379
 rats with giant tumors according to the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.030
 French explorer never rally that 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.620
 result of a two-year feeding 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.020
 with corn from monsanto 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.090
 since then, a debate rages about whether 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.719
 his study is scientifically clean 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.699
 or not 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.820
 but a question arises in each 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.250
 why does not exist anymore 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.080
 long-term tests for gene plants what these 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.090
 makes it clear that there are gaps 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.680
 in the approval process of gene plants 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.900
 on European level 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.159
 the specifications are completely inadequate 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.080
 especially the investigation of 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.009
 long-term effects that will be affected 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.009
 not tested yet 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.710
 before a GMO plants on 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.820
 this must come from the european market 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.620
 european institute for 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.040
 food safety green light 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.350
 give 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.360
 this is only after a test of 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.610
 but not more than 90 days running 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.880
 to change no reason that you the 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.920
 european biotechnology lobby it 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.150
 is a procedure that works well 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.040
 they are the strictest 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.990
 admission conditions in the world and 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.310
 until today there was no reason this 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.230
 to question the procedure 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.940
 but at European level, it is growing 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.170
 pressure the commission has now 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.540
 institute for food safety 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.030
 commissioned the study of 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.320
 to investigate theraline 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.790
 yes the European Commission 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.770
 we realize that it is something new 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.030
 is in this study namely the 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.650
 fact that they are based on one 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.390
 period of two years 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.200
 We have to study this study now 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.270
 An interim report will be reviewed 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.680
 the day after tomorrow expected soon the 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.120
 However, the European Commission already 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.130
 decide on the next admission 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.870
 It's about a genious company 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.580
 syngenta becomes brussels 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.650
 most likely give a green light 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.600
 The 90 days tests are the argument 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.730
 Finally not yielded ground to 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.020
 doubt 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.180
 how devastating the cultivation of 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.950
 genetically engineered plants for 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.020
 nature and man can be 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.330
 the farmers had to bitter election 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.550
 India is experiencing it now 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.650
 report our correspondents david 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.540
 more entrepreneurial and miserable man from the 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.910
 State of Maharashtra in this village 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.100
 the american chemie wanted gigant 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.230
 monsanto and its indian branch 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.080
 Mariko her newly developed gene 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.130
 plant cotton like most 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.250
 Farmers in the Indian state 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.350
 Maharashtra had sandeep of the 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.800
 convincing the company's promises 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.750
 let them might have us their 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.340
 Cotton touted and said that 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.230
 we reap better with this seed 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.830
 would achieve and no more pesticides 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.840
 would need 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.290
 and they even promised us that 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.630
 we get rich fast but that 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.610
 Expected miracles stayed out instead 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.620
 started for these farmers a veritable 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:28.390
 Nightmare and sand and cheated on us 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.880
 this plant is sick and I have to 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.550
 use even more pesticides than before 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.050
 I lose everything one has lied to us 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.820
 and now we are in the trap 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.200
 the changed seed must be the 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.090
 farmers pay dearly 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.950
 and, on top of that, the goals 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.580
 and fertilizer in larger quantities than before 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.560
 to buy 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.270
 the inevitable debt has 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.610
 already many a sacrifice demanded and 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.250
 the suicide rate in the village at radja 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.170
 is only recently high on enemy high 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.700
 here fifteen farmers are killed 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.960
 because they no longer owe their debt 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.480
 could pay back 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:05.950
 one of them was the only 31-year-old 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.930
 sancho my husband has a bottle 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.080
 pesticide bought and drunk 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.480
 he died there has nike 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.020
 planted cotton but the seed is good 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.900
 Nothing 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.030
 so the debt must make pesticides 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.200
 to buy because our fields were 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.330
 full of parasites 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.110
 we had no money, he has 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.190
 killed because of the cotton 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.440
 although the connection between 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.990
 suicide and cotton are not in 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.910
 In any case, it was clearly banned 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.500
 authorities of the state of maharashtra 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.410
 Finally the sale of the monsanto 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.420
 cotton the company's our questions 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.700
 not wanted to answer is on top of that 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.490
 accused of having bad seed 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.300
 put on the market and through 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.820
 supply bottlenecks the prices in the 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.410
 height driven this dorfrat welcomes 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.060
 But the decision demands of the 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.910
 government a general gen seed 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.800
 booked it would be ridiculous just that 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.450
 to ban micro seed if that 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.400
 Government really wants to do something 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.080
 They are changing cotton at all 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.670
 prohibit natural seeds are found 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.080
 not at all today and therefore 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.160
 we are forced to go changed 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.660
 to buy cotton 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.400
 I am sure that the corporations 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.290
 otherwise they would bribe 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.600
 These products have long been 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.030
 forbidden 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.930
 India is the world's second largest 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.120
 cotton producer and mariko monsanto 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.190
 has a virtual monopoly on Indian 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.870
 Cottonseeds should have others 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.120
 federal states decide to ban 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.169
 That would make the US Group sensitive 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.340
 to meet 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.440
 detailed information to guide 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.690
 again from genetically engineered 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.530
 Seeds you will find in our 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.530
 Internet
