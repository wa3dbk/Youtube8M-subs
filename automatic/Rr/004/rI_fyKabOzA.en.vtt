much<00:00:10.920> into<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.250> intro<00:00:11.550> it's<00:00:11.759> not<00:00:12.000> really<00:00:12.420> that

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
much into the intro it's not really that

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.959 
much into the intro it's not really that
bad<00:00:12.780> but<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:13.500> went<00:00:13.860> in<00:00:14.040> not<00:00:14.250> knowing<00:00:14.460> at<00:00:14.790> all

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
bad but I went in not knowing at all

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.279 
bad but I went in not knowing at all
what<00:00:15.030> was<00:00:15.210> gonna<00:00:15.299> go<00:00:15.480> on<00:00:15.630> so<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:15.900> thought<00:00:16.170> I'd

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
what was gonna go on so I thought I'd

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.720 
what was gonna go on so I thought I'd
make<00:00:16.440> this<00:00:16.529> little<00:00:16.680> video<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:17.070> tell<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.520> what

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
make this little video to tell you what

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.660 
make this little video to tell you what
goes<00:00:17.940> on<00:00:17.970> in<00:00:18.420> those<00:00:18.930> magnetic<00:00:19.439> monsters<00:00:20.250> so

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
goes on in those magnetic monsters so

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.349 
goes on in those magnetic monsters so
from<00:00:20.820> what<00:00:20.970> I'm<00:00:21.029> told

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
from what I'm told

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.150 
from what I'm told
MRIs<00:00:21.750> can<00:00:22.020> take<00:00:22.230> arranged<00:00:22.680> different<00:00:22.980> times

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
MRIs can take arranged different times

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.310 
MRIs can take arranged different times
so<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.670> had<00:00:23.910> three<00:00:24.240> scans<00:00:24.660> on<00:00:24.900> three<00:00:25.170> different

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
so I had three scans on three different

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.290 
so I had three scans on three different
parts<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.680> my<00:00:25.740> body<00:00:25.890> which<00:00:26.730> took<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.150> little

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
parts of my body which took a little

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.259 
parts of my body which took a little
over<00:00:27.599> an<00:00:27.930> hour<00:00:28.490> that's<00:00:29.490> right<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.970> said<00:00:30.240> a

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
over an hour that's right I said a

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.260 
over an hour that's right I said a
little<00:00:30.480> over<00:00:30.869> an<00:00:31.140> hour<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.800> those<00:00:32.340> magnetic

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
little over an hour in those magnetic

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.880 
little over an hour in those magnetic
machines<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:35.120> magnets<00:00:36.350> so<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.380> got<00:00:37.530> down<00:00:37.710> there

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
machines of magnets so I got down there

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.560 
machines of magnets so I got down there
and<00:00:37.950> they're<00:00:38.219> like<00:00:38.340> strip<00:00:38.640> off<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.090> put<00:00:39.420> on

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
and they're like strip off and put on

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.810 
and they're like strip off and put on
one<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.840> our<00:00:39.960> beautiful<00:00:40.200> gowns<00:00:40.710> they<00:00:41.280> actually

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
one of our beautiful gowns they actually

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.090 
one of our beautiful gowns they actually
said<00:00:42.059> beautiful<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.440> then<00:00:43.649> they<00:00:43.770> asked<00:00:43.920> me<00:00:44.010> a

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
said beautiful and then they asked me a

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.260 
said beautiful and then they asked me a
bunch<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.340> questions<00:00:44.460> about<00:00:44.789> whether<00:00:45.000> had

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
bunch of questions about whether had

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.000 
bunch of questions about whether had
metal<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.719> me<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.079> said<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.469> was<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> little<00:00:46.800> more

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
metal in me I said I was a little more

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.650 
metal in me I said I was a little more
into<00:00:47.250> alternative<00:00:47.670> rock<00:00:47.910> they<00:00:48.360> didn't<00:00:48.570> get

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
into alternative rock they didn't get

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.170 
into alternative rock they didn't get
the<00:00:48.780> joke<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:49.410> moved<00:00:49.649> on<00:00:49.860> but<00:00:50.489> then<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.940> had

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
the joke and we moved on but then I had

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.880 
the joke and we moved on but then I had
to<00:00:51.300> make<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.660> hardest<00:00:52.050> decision<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
to make the hardest decision of the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.650 
to make the hardest decision of the
whole<00:00:53.070> experience<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.789> had<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.270> pick<00:00:54.480> what

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
whole experience I had to pick what

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.150 
whole experience I had to pick what
music<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.140> was<00:00:55.230> gonna<00:00:55.320> listen<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.649> while<00:00:56.010> it's

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
music I was gonna listen to while it's

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.560 
music I was gonna listen to while it's
all<00:00:56.250> going<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.610> which<00:00:56.910> was<00:00:57.059> pretty<00:00:57.390> much

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
all going on which was pretty much

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.150 
all going on which was pretty much
irrelevant<00:00:57.840> because<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.440> music<00:00:58.739> was<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.129> loud

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
irrelevant because the music was so loud

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.979 
irrelevant because the music was so loud
you<00:01:00.030> couldn't<00:01:00.300> even<00:01:00.390> hear<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.660> through<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
you couldn't even hear it through the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.110 
you couldn't even hear it through the
terrible<00:01:01.320> headphones<00:01:01.800> literally<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.879> worst

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
terrible headphones literally the worst

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.230 
terrible headphones literally the worst
headphones<00:01:03.690> I've<00:01:03.899> ever<00:01:04.140> used<00:01:04.820> but<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.939> be<00:01:06.030> fair

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
headphones I've ever used but to be fair

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.300 
headphones I've ever used but to be fair
they<00:01:07.049> do<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.439> pop<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.619> music<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.130> for

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
they do have to pop the music in for

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.700 
they do have to pop the music in for
achieve<00:01:08.700> because<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.479> can't<00:01:09.659> have<00:01:09.810> any<00:01:10.020> metal

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
achieve because you can't have any metal

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.310 
achieve because you can't have any metal
in<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.890> room<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.670> guess<00:01:12.390> it's<00:01:12.750> kind<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.080> fair

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
in the room so I guess it's kind of fair

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.810 
in the room so I guess it's kind of fair
enough<00:01:13.500> but<00:01:13.860> then<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.159> makes<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.490> sound<00:01:14.640> like

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
enough but then that makes it sound like

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.760 
enough but then that makes it sound like
a<00:01:14.939> wartime<00:01:15.479> radio<00:01:15.780> but<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.439> didn't<00:01:16.590> really

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
a wartime radio but that didn't really

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.230 
a wartime radio but that didn't really
work<00:01:16.890> out<00:01:17.009> too<00:01:17.070> bad<00:01:17.369> for<00:01:17.490> me<00:01:17.549> because<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.909> chose

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
work out too bad for me because I chose

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.149 
work out too bad for me because I chose

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
begins but just before that you're told

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.200

if you do or you just want to stop

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.050

half<00:01:44.430> an<00:01:44.579> hour<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.090> had<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.479> worst<00:01:45.780> itch

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
half an hour in I had the worst itch

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.810 
half an hour in I had the worst itch
just<00:01:46.170> here<00:01:46.649> under<00:01:46.829> my<00:01:46.920> nose<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.340> was<00:01:47.460> literally

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
just here under my nose it was literally

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.520 
just here under my nose it was literally
torture<00:01:48.360> they<00:01:48.540> warn<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:48.990> loud<00:01:49.170> but

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
torture they warn you it's loud but

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.990 
torture they warn you it's loud but
nothing<00:01:49.950> will<00:01:50.070> compare<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.670> actual

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
nothing will compare you to the actual

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.730 
nothing will compare you to the actual
sound<00:01:51.119> you're<00:01:51.390> gonna<00:01:51.509> hear<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.229> closest

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
sound you're gonna hear the closest

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.550 
sound you're gonna hear the closest
thing<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:52.979> think<00:01:53.159> imparity<00:01:53.700> would<00:01:53.970> be<00:01:54.119> like<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
thing I think imparity would be like the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.310 
thing I think imparity would be like the
dirtiest<00:01:55.850> heaviest<00:01:56.850> like<00:01:57.180> German<00:01:57.750> euro

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
dirtiest heaviest like German euro

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.820 
dirtiest heaviest like German euro
techno

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
techno

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.200 
techno
I've<00:02:01.830> got<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:01.980> rhythm<00:02:02.220> to<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.640> be<00:02:02.730> fair<00:02:02.970> but

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
I've got a rhythm to it to be fair but

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.030 
I've got a rhythm to it to be fair but
it's<00:02:03.450> definitely<00:02:03.750> not<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.110> nicest<00:02:04.320> sound<00:02:04.710> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
it's definitely not the nicest sound the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.290 
it's definitely not the nicest sound the
table<00:02:05.370> moves<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.790> out<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.090> change

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
table moves in and out you change

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.910 
table moves in and out you change
positions<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.720> bit<00:02:06.870> at<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.020> sound<00:02:07.260> changes<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
positions a bit at the sound changes the

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.770 
positions a bit at the sound changes the
scan<00:02:08.160> stop<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.580> start<00:02:08.759> that's<00:02:09.479> pretty<00:02:09.690> much

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
scan stop and start that's pretty much

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.840 
scan stop and start that's pretty much
it<00:02:10.020> if<00:02:10.290> you<00:02:10.440> do<00:02:10.590> have<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.860> have<00:02:11.009> an<00:02:11.130> MRI<00:02:11.340> it's

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
it if you do have to have an MRI it's

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.310 
it if you do have to have an MRI it's
not<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.240> bad<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:12.630> don't<00:02:12.750> worry<00:02:12.930> about<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:13.170> too

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
not that bad so don't worry about it too
