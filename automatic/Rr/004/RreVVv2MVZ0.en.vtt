00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
again to the mystical floor zone again

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.590 
again to the mystical floor zone again
like<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.579> said<00:00:59.640> you<00:01:00.000> can<00:01:00.120> go<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.300> whatever

like I said you can go to whatever

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.009 
like I said you can go to whatever
sprite<00:01:01.199> arch<00:01:01.410> if<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.710> want<00:01:02.010> but<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.420> recommend

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
sprite arch if you want but I recommend

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.250 
sprite arch if you want but I recommend
the<00:01:04.350> mystical<00:01:04.650> 4<00:01:04.830> zone<00:01:05.010> because<00:01:05.220> that's<00:01:05.250> what

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
the mystical 4 zone because that's what

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.320 
the mystical 4 zone because that's what
that's<00:01:07.260> where<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:08.369> can<00:01:08.520> get<00:01:08.670> sonic<00:01:08.970> sprites

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
that's where you can get sonic sprites

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.450 
that's where you can get sonic sprites
if<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.570> want<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.810> get<00:01:09.990> any<00:01:10.920> other<00:01:11.070> sprites

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
if you want to get any other sprites

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.330 
if you want to get any other sprites
because<00:01:11.729> it's<00:01:11.850> works<00:01:12.030> with<00:01:12.180> any<00:01:12.390> time<00:01:12.570> sprites

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
because it's works with any time sprites

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:24.649 
because it's works with any time sprites
type<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:18.439> writers<00:01:20.210> resource<00:01:21.979> come<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.670> it

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
type the writers resource come and it

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.090 
type the writers resource come and it
will<00:01:27.080> it's<00:01:28.080> not<00:01:28.170> supposed<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.590> take<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.890> there

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100

the<00:02:46.440> essential<00:02:46.950> sprites<00:02:47.360> my<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.840> best<00:02:49.080> thing

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
the essential sprites my the best thing

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.789 
the essential sprites my the best thing
to<00:02:49.890> do<00:02:50.160> is<00:02:50.400> separate<00:02:51.090> all<00:02:51.299> of<00:02:51.510> them<00:02:51.690> what<00:02:52.620> do<00:02:52.709> I

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
to do is separate all of them what do I

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.180 
to do is separate all of them what do I
mean<00:02:52.950> by<00:02:52.980> separate<00:02:53.610> ok<00:02:54.500> very<00:02:55.500> good<00:02:55.620> question

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
mean by separate ok very good question

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.270 
mean by separate ok very good question
you<00:02:56.489> go<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.959> special<00:02:58.560> folder<00:02:58.890> or<00:02:59.069> wherever

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
you go to a special folder or wherever

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.100 
you go to a special folder or wherever
where<00:02:59.670> you<00:02:59.790> have<00:02:59.970> your<00:03:00.090> sprites<00:03:00.450> for<00:03:00.780> example

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
where you have your sprites for example

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.380 
where you have your sprites for example
here<00:03:01.260> now<00:03:01.440> I'm<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.620> munag<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:02.190> did<00:03:02.940> something

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
here now I'm the munag I did something

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.720 
here now I'm the munag I did something
kind<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.440> smart<00:03:04.769> but<00:03:04.920> at<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.070> same<00:03:05.190> time<00:03:05.430> kind

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
kind of smart but at the same time kind

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.680 
kind of smart but at the same time kind
of<00:03:05.820> stupid<00:03:06.410> separating<00:03:07.410> into<00:03:07.980> folders<00:03:08.690> it's

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
of stupid separating into folders it's

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.330 
of stupid separating into folders it's
pretty<00:03:09.930> smart<00:03:10.170> because<00:03:10.380> then<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:10.920> don't<00:03:11.280> have

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
pretty smart because then you don't have

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.949 
pretty smart because then you don't have
to<00:03:11.430> be<00:03:11.609> looking<00:03:11.850> for<00:03:12.150> them<00:03:12.239> at<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.690> minute

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
to be looking for them at the minute

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.030 
to be looking for them at the minute
when<00:03:13.079> you<00:03:13.200> want<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.440> put<00:03:13.650> them<00:03:13.769> all<00:03:13.890> together

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
when you want to put them all together

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.759 
when you want to put them all together
for<00:03:14.370> example<00:03:14.549> look<00:03:15.049> do<00:03:16.049> you<00:03:16.170> know<00:03:16.790> georgina

lucky no onea Thundra those are like the

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.660 
lucky no onea Thundra those are like the
main<00:03:26.130> sprites<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:26.549> can<00:03:26.730> do<00:03:26.880> now<00:03:27.470> anyway<00:03:28.470> so

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670

black if not like make it for example
the<00:05:38.020> RBG<00:05:38.650> make<00:05:38.979> it<00:05:39.130> 1<00:05:39.400> 1<00:05:39.700> 1<00:05:40.510> not<00:05:40.840> leave<00:05:41.020> it<00:05:41.110> 0<00:05:41.320> 0<00:05:41.530> 0

the RBG make it 1 1 1 not leave it 0 0 0

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:46.620 
the RBG make it 1 1 1 not leave it 0 0 0
same<00:05:42.789> goes<00:05:43.060> for<00:05:43.090> the<00:05:43.419> eyes<00:05:43.660> and<00:05:45.300> the<00:05:46.300> gloves

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
same goes for the eyes and the gloves

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.480 
same goes for the eyes and the gloves
and<00:05:46.930> every<00:05:47.289> every<00:05:47.680> part<00:05:47.950> of<00:05:48.070> your<00:05:48.220> character

and every every part of your character
that's<00:05:48.669> white<00:05:49.000> don't<00:05:49.690> make<00:05:49.930> it<00:05:50.229> completely

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
that's white don't make it completely

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:55.440 
that's white don't make it completely
white<00:05:51.400> like<00:05:51.610> this<00:05:51.820> because<00:05:52.330> this<00:05:52.930> is<00:05:54.090> 255<00:05:55.090> the

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
white like this because this is 255 the

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.300 
white like this because this is 255 the
highest<00:05:55.750> number<00:05:55.960> all<00:05:56.169> of<00:05:56.350> them<00:05:56.500> so<00:05:57.100> make<00:05:57.250> it

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
highest number all of them so make it

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.550 
highest number all of them so make it
like<00:05:57.550> 254<00:05:58.510> or<00:05:58.570> something<00:05:58.930> to<00:05:59.260> make<00:05:59.380> it<00:05:59.410> look

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
like 254 or something to make it look

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.640 
like 254 or something to make it look
almost<00:05:59.889> completely<00:06:00.310> white<00:06:02.100> anyway<00:06:03.100> so<00:06:03.539> your

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
almost completely white anyway so your

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.900 
almost completely white anyway so your
your<00:06:05.650> background<00:06:06.070> is<00:06:06.190> supposed<00:06:06.490> to<00:06:06.520> be<00:06:06.669> any

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
your background is supposed to be any

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.440 
your background is supposed to be any
color<00:06:07.330> that's<00:06:07.900> why<00:06:08.200> sometimes<00:06:08.620> it<00:06:09.030> comes<00:06:10.030> in

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
color that's why sometimes it comes in

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.680 
color that's why sometimes it comes in
the<00:06:11.410> different<00:06:11.860> types<00:06:12.370> of<00:06:12.580> color<00:06:12.880> background

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
the different types of color background

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.439 
the different types of color background
like<00:06:14.640> green<00:06:15.640> or<00:06:16.000> blue

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:16.449 
like green or blue

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:19.830 
like green or blue
or<00:06:16.659> something<00:06:17.050> like<00:06:17.229> that<00:06:17.469> pink<00:06:18.340> so<00:06:19.150> they<00:06:19.779> do

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
or something like that pink so they do

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.540 
or something like that pink so they do
that<00:06:20.080> so<00:06:20.289> it's<00:06:20.559> easier<00:06:20.919> for<00:06:20.949> you<00:06:21.159> to<00:06:21.219> do<00:06:21.400> this

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
that so it's easier for you to do this

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.939 
that so it's easier for you to do this
put<00:06:22.539> it<00:06:22.629> in<00:06:22.749> paint<00:06:23.020> and<00:06:23.199> select<00:06:23.650> the

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:23.949 
put it in paint and select the

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:28.649 
put it in paint and select the
background<00:06:25.409> an<00:06:26.409> easier<00:06:27.279> thing<00:06:27.309> to<00:06:27.490> do<00:06:27.669> is<00:06:27.849> hold

00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:28.659 
background an easier thing to do is hold

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:31.200 
background an easier thing to do is hold
down<00:06:28.749> shift<00:06:29.199> and<00:06:29.499> then<00:06:30.159> click<00:06:30.729> the<00:06:30.849> background

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
down shift and then click the background

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.149 
down shift and then click the background
because<00:06:31.389> then<00:06:31.509> it<00:06:31.629> selects<00:06:32.110> all<00:06:32.259> the<00:06:32.319> color<00:06:32.889> in

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:33.159 
because then it selects all the color in

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:35.939 
because then it selects all the color in
that<00:06:33.219> area<00:06:33.729> now<00:06:34.509> if<00:06:34.809> you're<00:06:35.050> too<00:06:35.259> lazy<00:06:35.469> to<00:06:35.740> do

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:35.949 
that area now if you're too lazy to do

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:39.149 
that area now if you're too lazy to do
that<00:06:35.979> and<00:06:36.430> like<00:06:37.389> there's<00:06:37.689> another<00:06:38.020> area<00:06:38.379> if

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:39.159 
that and like there's another area if

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:41.719 
that and like there's another area if
you<00:06:39.789> like<00:06:39.999> do<00:06:40.300> control<00:06:40.809> or<00:06:41.050> something<00:06:41.349> and

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:41.729 
you like do control or something and

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:43.920 
you like do control or something and
there's<00:06:42.729> an<00:06:42.879> area<00:06:43.210> that's<00:06:43.300> very<00:06:43.419> similar<00:06:43.809> to

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
there's an area that's very similar to

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.929 
there's an area that's very similar to
that<00:06:44.110> color<00:06:44.409> then<00:06:44.680> just<00:06:44.889> go<00:06:45.219> to<00:06:45.279> tolerance<00:06:45.759> and

00:06:45.929 --> 00:06:45.939 
that color then just go to tolerance and

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:48.689 
that color then just go to tolerance and
put<00:06:46.089> it<00:06:46.180> in<00:06:46.419> zero<00:06:46.809> so<00:06:46.990> it's<00:06:47.110> easier<00:06:47.469> but<00:06:48.219> for

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:48.699 
put it in zero so it's easier but for

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:50.249 
put it in zero so it's easier but for
something<00:06:48.849> weight<00:06:49.210> is<00:06:49.389> you<00:06:49.509> just<00:06:49.689> put<00:06:49.960> hit

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:50.259 
something weight is you just put hit

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:54.510 
something weight is you just put hit
shift<00:06:50.680> and<00:06:50.949> select<00:06:51.819> it<00:06:52.120> all<00:06:52.889> so<00:06:53.889> now<00:06:54.099> you<00:06:54.159> just

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 
shift and select it all so now you just

00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:03.929 
shift and select it all so now you just
delete<00:06:55.150> it<00:06:55.180> and<00:06:55.870> there<00:06:56.020> you<00:06:56.050> go<00:06:59.490> and<00:07:00.490> then<00:07:02.939> you

00:07:03.929 --> 00:07:03.939 
delete it and there you go and then you

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:06.270 
delete it and there you go and then you
save<00:07:04.120> it
