00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.280
 The Twingo 'the city car of Renault' ... 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.000
 ... that time was just a very nice and funny cart with lots of colors. 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.059
 He has been running for 14 years and it was a huge success. 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.800
 Then came a somewhat right model, which we also showed in a review. 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.980
 And now in 2014 there will be a completely new Twingo. 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.380
 The biggest change is that the engine is now not in the front but in the back. 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.330
 There is no motorcycle under the very short nose of the new Twingo ... 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.790
 ... but there are only a few tanks to refill your liquid, a radiator and otherwise just an empty space. 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.350
 What is especially important: those are the wheel arches, because they are very wide ... 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.360
 ... what is the advantage? 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.760
 That you can almost turn on a stamp. 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.460
 That means that your turning circle has fallen from 10 meters with the previous one to 8.5 meters. 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.600
 It has become shorter than the previous 9 cm, which is reflected in the height of the roof. 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.640
 The wheelbase has really grown considerably. 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.400
 Unfortunately without good consequences for the interior, because the engine is still in the back. 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.230
 You never see that with a city car because it is a rear-wheel drive. 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.650
 It has 165 millimeter wide tires at the front and no less than 185 millimeters at the rear. 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.000
 In terms of styling, it has also become a bit different. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.090
 Because especially at the back you can see that it has become nice and wide here. 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.180
 It looks like a Renault 5 Turbo from the 80s. 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.780
 And here at the doors: 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.460
 First it was a 3 door and now you just have a 5 door. 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.760
 The really new thing about this car is of course that the engine compartment and the luggage compartment sit together. 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.210
 Below is the engine. 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.630
 This does mean that the floor of the luggage compartment has risen a little higher. 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.000
 Does not mean that you have received less luggage space. 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.530
 Because the previous one was 165 liters, now we have 220 liters. That is because this is quite deep. 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.169
 The safety level has risen sharply in the new Twingo. 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:13.759
 With the old one, the test showed that especially the knees and thighs had a chance of injury. 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:17.799
 That is much better with the new one. He only gets four out of five stars because ... 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.880
 ... which does not have an automatic emergency braking system as standard. 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.620
 What he has again is a lane assistant, who warns you if you cross the lane mark. 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:32.449
 The engine in the test car is the smallest gasoline version, which is a 1.0 liter, 3 cylinder with 70 hp. 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:37.929
 And we are not really satisfied with the performance, especially on the highway that misses a lot of torque. 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:42.379
 So you have to keep up your pace and switch to keep up with the traffic. 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:47.539
 If you want better performance, go for the 90 hp version. That is a 900c 3 cylinder. 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:49.789
 That we already know from the 'Clio' and the 'Captur'. 

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:51.249
 He performs very well. 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:53.579
 It is 2000 euros more expensive. 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.079
 The Twingo has not really become a tight steering car, but it is very safe in its handling. 

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:59.839
 This is mainly due to the long wheelbase. 

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:05.139
 And through the addition of two electronic systems, stability control and traction control. 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:09.239
 Just like then with the previous Twingo, I have now picked up the same fashion model. 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:12.449
 Bram is also a fairly sturdy guy and then we both sit in the front. 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:17.560
 Then we can show whether the interior width has increased a bit or not. 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.900
 Let's go. 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.300
 So you see it right away, the interior width has really increased. Because now the knees are less close together. 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.799
 But yes, the intimacy of the previous one has disappeared a bit. 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.149
 Fortunately, there are also many improvements in the area of ​​comfort. 

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:46.769
 We did have some criticism of the old one because of the noise of the rear axle. 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.239
 That made a big noise. 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.369
 But that is very simple now, there is an engine on top that is very well insulated. 

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:56.869
 So it's much quieter inside. 

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:11.099
 If you are going to use it as a double car then it is really spacious enough in the front. 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.139
 There is enough width at shoulder height ... 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.159
 ... you have enough legroom. 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:17.479
 You have enough headroom. But yes, if there are people in the back ... 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.029
 ... then the front seats really have to go forward. 

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:22.309
 Because just look ... 

00:04:22.309 --> 00:04:25.759
 How little space there is for the legs of a child. 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.839
 And with my 1.87m I really can't sit behind myself. 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.240
 The tank of the Twingo has become quite smaller. It was first 40 liters and now only 35 liters. 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:43.050
 But that is quite possible, because the consumption has of course dropped considerably. 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.080
 They promise about 1 in 23 and we get 1 in 16 with a lot of city traffic. 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.830
 The Twingo is available from € 10,600 including roadworthiness costs. 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.370
 But we recommend adding € 1000, then you have the Expression level. 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:02.930
 Then include: electric windows for steering height adjustment and an audio system with the so-called 'R &amp; GO system'. 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.659
 That is just your own smartphone on your deskboard. 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:10.319
 It contains a piece of Renault software. And then you can, for example, stream music ... 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:16.199
 ... operate your phone hands-free, but there is also simply a navigation system with a free map. 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:23.180
 And you have some systems, such as a revolution counter. That is in your smartphone but unfortunately not on your deskboard. 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:31.379
 There was apparently a bit of space on the deskboard because that 'R &amp; GO' system is therefore in front of the radio controls. 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:34.039
 What do we think of the new Twingo after a few days of sending? 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.400
 Fortunately, the safety level has risen considerably. 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:38.189
 The interior space unfortunately not. 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:44.529
 And the performance of the 70 hp gasoline engine, well that does not stop.
