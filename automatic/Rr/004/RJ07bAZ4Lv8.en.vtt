00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
inside which means you could probably

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
although I think the idea is just more

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.009 
although I think the idea is just more
that<00:04:00.380> they're<00:04:00.500> high<00:04:00.650> tops<00:04:00.920> so<00:04:01.760> anyway<00:04:02.000> I'm<00:04:02.900> a

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
that they're high tops so anyway I'm a
