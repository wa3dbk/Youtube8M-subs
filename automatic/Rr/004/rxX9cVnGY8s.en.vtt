here<00:00:06.240> we<00:00:06.360> are<00:00:06.390> with<00:00:06.660> a<00:00:06.720> 2014<00:00:07.560> Ram<00:00:07.860> heavy-duty

00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:08.749 
here we are with a 2014 Ram heavy-duty

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:11.270 
here we are with a 2014 Ram heavy-duty
beautiful<00:00:09.749> truck<00:00:10.110> we<00:00:10.349> love<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.679> styling<00:00:11.099> but

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
beautiful truck we love the styling but

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.159 
beautiful truck we love the styling but
what<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:11.969> really<00:00:12.360> want<00:00:12.539> to<00:00:12.599> talk<00:00:12.780> about<00:00:12.900> today

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:13.169 
what I really want to talk about today

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:16.939 
what I really want to talk about today
is<00:00:13.499> what's<00:00:13.829> under<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.190> hood<00:00:14.339> so<00:00:14.929> this<00:00:15.929> new<00:00:16.110> 6.4

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
is what's under the hood so this new 6.4

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.570 
is what's under the hood so this new 6.4
Hemi<00:00:17.189> offers<00:00:18.000> more<00:00:18.240> horsepower<00:00:18.840> more<00:00:19.410> torque

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
more payload and greater tow rating all

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.429 
more payload and greater tow rating all
at<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.609> same<00:00:23.789> time<00:00:23.990> improving<00:00:24.990> fuel<00:00:25.230> economy

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
at the same time improving fuel economy

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.730 
at the same time improving fuel economy
over<00:00:25.859> our<00:00:26.310> five-seven<00:00:26.820> gas<00:00:27.259> we've<00:00:28.259> done<00:00:28.529> that

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
over our five-seven gas we've done that

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.339 
over our five-seven gas we've done that
because<00:00:29.099> we<00:00:29.249> added<00:00:29.880> what<00:00:30.419> we<00:00:30.509> call<00:00:30.720> MDS

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
because we added what we call MDS

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.280 
because we added what we call MDS
multiple<00:00:32.040> displacement<00:00:32.730> system<00:00:33.120> or<00:00:33.330> our<00:00:33.870> fuel

another<00:00:41.640> great<00:00:41.880> output<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.720> increased

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
another great output of the increased

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.650 
another great output of the increased
torque<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.650> the<00:00:44.130> ability<00:00:44.400> to<00:00:44.610> reduce<00:00:44.970> axle

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
torque is the ability to reduce axle

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.990 
torque is the ability to reduce axle
ratios<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.590> with<00:00:46.740> lower<00:00:46.920> axle<00:00:47.340> ratios<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.850> get

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
ratios so with lower axle ratios you get

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.630 
ratios so with lower axle ratios you get
better<00:00:48.270> fuel<00:00:48.360> economy<00:00:48.720> yet<00:00:49.560> still<00:00:49.980> increased

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.510 
loaded in turns etc the other big thing
and<00:01:51.870> the<00:01:51.960> reason<00:01:52.140> why<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:52.710> better<00:01:52.950> for<00:01:53.190> ride

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
and the reason why it's better for ride

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.450 
and the reason why it's better for ride
is<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.330> a<00:01:54.810> leaf<00:01:55.020> spring<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.680> two<00:01:55.890> leaves<00:01:56.159> or

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
is in a leaf spring the two leaves or

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.280 
is in a leaf spring the two leaves or
leave<00:01:56.820> multiple<00:01:57.330> leaves<00:01:57.510> have<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.930> slide

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
leave multiple leaves have to slide

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.930 
leave multiple leaves have to slide
against<00:01:58.799> each<00:01:58.920> other<00:01:59.220> there's<00:01:59.670> friction

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
against each other there's friction
