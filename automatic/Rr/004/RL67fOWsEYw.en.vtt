00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.299
 beautiful boys as always yours 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.820
 because I speak to you today they are found on 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.000
 my channel is back more than anything 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.830
 after two weeks with a call of gap 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.719
 duty black ops 2 the interior of which 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.580
 I'll get a core 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.640
 using an assault rifle such as 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.500
 in 94 we say that in this game 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.689
 some regret remained in no 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.630
 as for only one gastric therefore for 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.220
 now the killing as you will see later 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.320
 maybe in a couple of minutes I'm not 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.989
 succeeded in achieving this goal 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.030
 in a single round but of what these 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.710
 they are very small details 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.840
 so nothing after this 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.550
 very small presentation now not 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.500
 let's talk to each other in so many chats let's go to 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.629
 treat the main theme of this 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.610
 commit a topic that many of you 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.920
 will have already understood the title here 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.680
 below or how to take a core up 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.559
 black hole two so very much 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.449
 simple premise that they try to give you 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.309
 to explain to you what I call i 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.350
 key points to achieve 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.379
 of this goal and above all I hope 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.479
 that here we say tomorrow can 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.409
 prove to be useful for your style 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.670
 game 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.409
 let us therefore analyze the first 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.350
 factor where we hold as a protagonist 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.400
 the weapon the utility and the choice of 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.970
 the latter guys believe me it's not from 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.640
 underestimate in what and on the title 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.680
 like this as a bank of 2 equip 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.530
 strong anama increases self-esteem as well 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.659
 player security personally 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.890
 I feel compelled to advise you 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.600
 here is the whole category of 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.610
 machine guns while regarding 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.829
 assault rifles 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.530
 I recommend a tar ska racca 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.600
 or as in my case an n 94 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.880
 then later we also find the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.009
 rewards also kills quests here 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.329
 let's say they play an important role 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.210
 no if not at all 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.009
 and 90 percent is essential 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.860
 of the nuclei, however, you see 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.479
 here on youtube they are forward goalkeepers 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.090
 are completed by themes with 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.649
 these rewards or with the web 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.420
 counterattack and visa torbi such those 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.790
 that most of the players define 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.320
 the support rewards advised against 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.540
 instead they are the rewards of Italy 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.840
 just like the vital means in the middle 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.250
 video excuse me the dogs and so on 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.260
 for the simple fact that the killings 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.269
 made by these rewards not 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.090
 they will decrease your climb 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.640
 towards the nuclear but they will put you in 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.830
 an even more complicated situation 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.560
 in third place with teramo instead of the bonuses 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.720
 the ones I say yes I strongly am 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.400
 anti-shatter and jackal two bonuses that me 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.709
 I've always kept in my list 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.030
 be so you can say two bonuses that you 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.590
 they have always helped a lot 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.360
 simple to take this goal 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.680
 so really guys 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.599
 try a moment to use them 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.870
 because they are very basic 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:44.209
 also the fourth factor is not important 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.760
 to be underestimated because in Verona good 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.890
 team at your disposal have a 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.840
 group of people who don't help you there 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.010
 will further facilitate the climb 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.410
 towards this goal 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.299
 if you also have a microphone for 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.220
 interact with them organize everything 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.560
 how much to use it because the 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.049
 communication on fps can do 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.730
 really the difference 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:07.099
 then we move on to the following point or 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.049
 the mode as far as I'm concerned 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.660
 I advise you to play on how to 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.010
 demolition domain or even up 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.450
 location choose here the one that most 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.569
 you like what you know best 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.269
 even at the level he has a deathmatch a 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.459
 teams I say that I do not recommend it in 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.959
 that it lasts a few will do 30 stomach 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.970
 in just a few minutes, guys, that's it 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.829
 really difficult so try 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.019
 massimina throw me on the three I have 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.730
 a few minutes factor listed 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.560
 management also remained on the subject 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.260
 of goals it is important to say that 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.060
 on how to domain 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.190
 I advise you to always take from 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.290
 flags in such a way as to revive 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.269
 so friends always only in one place 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.190
 fixed on the map and not scattered then 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.410
 you will also manage it better will be a 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.120
 little bit safer and would change 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.030
 even better the movements which is then go 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.829
 to do in seventh place then we find it 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.900
 shifting maybe not here looks like a 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.810
 this factor a little trivial 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.329
 but it is also very important to know 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.329
 move recognize the hot chicks 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:07.609
 of the map can really turn out syria 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.349
 turn out to be useful and useful for you 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.819
 you can't always stand on my sides 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.500
 now in the middle of the crowd 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.630
 unless in short, there is no view 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.400
 tactical that can really facilitate you 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.260
 the things 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.420
 eighth and final fact 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.100
 the drop shot accompanied by two jumps 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.200
 words that sum lately are being 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.210
 but feeling a lot in the corners 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.190
 maybe just jumping around 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.440
 in often and close up encounters 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.210
 will gladly save your life me is 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.890
 really happened so many times 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.930
 has helped many many occasions 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.760
 circumstances in fact or for this 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.190
 use the mode to give you what not 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.450
 the default one and maybe in other words you 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.280
 try a moment to do some tests 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.170
 initially both boys and a little bit 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.730
 however it is difficult to get used to 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.710
 question of time then you will see that too 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.060
 you will take the hand 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.460
 so nothing here is this 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.530
 this is what I recommend if 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.850
 you want to make a uterus even just a good one 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.190
 result we say that what I have you 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.660
 said it applies more for a 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.640
 look however also to make a good one 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.650
 they still act a few hundred more 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.090
 in short, you can also try it on all 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.250
 tips that put together can 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.960
 really help you so nothing 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.510
 guys this is what i owed you 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.980
 to say this is what I think it is then 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.200
 maybe if you think about other things if 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.750
 you have other opinions I do n't know other points 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.580
 that can be important maybe 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.310
 released a small comment 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.750
 I repeat I hope this video can 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.730
 have been to your liking the most 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.290
 what else I hope will help you that 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.760
 may make them maybe even improve the 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.410
 your style of play 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.940
 if so, in short, I remind you of 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.510
 leave the classic thumbs up 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.310
 because always a thank you in mine

 coming soon here on my channel with a 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.760
 new video and nothing samples
