00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
since moved on to the blue case which I

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.740

is the plan of five two three one on
Amazon<00:03:19.239> I<00:03:19.510> think<00:03:19.810> that's<00:03:20.170> what<00:03:20.319> the<00:03:20.440> model

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
Amazon I think that's what the model

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.550 
Amazon I think that's what the model
number<00:03:21.299> shows<00:03:22.299> on<00:03:22.660> Amazon<00:03:23.170> I<00:03:23.200> don't<00:03:23.410> know<00:03:23.500> if

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
number shows on Amazon I don't know if

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.259 
number shows on Amazon I don't know if
that's<00:03:23.709> actually<00:03:23.859> the<00:03:24.100> case<00:03:24.220> but<00:03:24.700> if<00:03:24.850> you<00:03:24.970> look

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
that's actually the case but if you look

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.539 
that's actually the case but if you look
on<00:03:25.389> Amazon<00:03:25.600> you'll<00:03:26.470> find<00:03:26.799> this<00:03:26.980> particular

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
on Amazon you'll find this particular

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.150 
on Amazon you'll find this particular
mono<00:03:28.510> model<00:03:29.019> five<00:03:29.200> two<00:03:29.410> three<00:03:29.650> one<00:03:29.859> I<00:03:29.889> think

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
mono model five two three one I think

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.890 
mono model five two three one I think
it's<00:03:30.250> like<00:03:30.370> ten<00:03:30.579> bucks<00:03:30.730> but<00:03:31.329> the<00:03:31.450> last<00:03:31.600> time<00:03:31.840> I

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
it's like ten bucks but the last time I

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.509 
it's like ten bucks but the last time I
checked<00:03:32.260> it<00:03:32.410> wasn't<00:03:32.620> in<00:03:32.799> stock<00:03:33.100> so<00:03:33.340> you<00:03:33.400> may

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
checked it wasn't in stock so you may

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.759 
checked it wasn't in stock so you may
have<00:03:33.639> to<00:03:33.819> wait<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:33.970> few<00:03:34.060> months<00:03:34.329> to<00:03:34.569> get<00:03:34.690> it<00:03:34.840> the

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
have to wait a few months to get it the
