00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the signal version the same I think it

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.149 
the signal version the same I think it
was<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> 22<00:01:12.210> they<00:01:12.900> had<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.260> macro<00:01:13.500> beat<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.950> -

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
was a 22 they had that macro beat you -

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
but it wasn't variation this was a

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.910 
but it wasn't variation this was a
sharpest<00:01:18.270> out<00:01:18.420> out<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:18.990> all<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.290> them<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.770> I

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
sharpest out out of all of them and I

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.050 
sharpest out out of all of them and I
would<00:01:20.400> recommend<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.570> found<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:22.710> one<00:01:23.060> this

able to get this off the beam age for
$50<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.770> it's<00:01:59.610> almost<00:01:59.850> better<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.270> go<00:02:00.390> through

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
$50 and it's almost better to go through

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.790 
$50 and it's almost better to go through
them<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.810> spent<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.200> little<00:02:01.259> more

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
them I spent a little more

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.720 
them I spent a little more
because<00:02:02.190> you<00:02:02.730> know<00:02:02.850> they<00:02:03.720> have<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:05.190> apartment

because you know they have the apartment

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.240 
because you know they have the apartment
so<00:02:05.940> with<00:02:06.510> a<00:02:06.810> bang<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.050> know<00:02:07.260> you<00:02:07.800> could<00:02:08.160> be

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
so with a bang you know you could be

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.640 
so with a bang you know you could be
buying<00:02:08.460> that<00:02:09.450> from<00:02:10.200> somebody<00:02:10.410> they<00:02:10.619> don't

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:10.650 
buying that from somebody they don't

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.500 
buying that from somebody they don't
know<00:02:10.920> anything<00:02:11.340> about<00:02:11.460> camera<00:02:12.000> since<00:02:12.240> its<00:02:12.390> of

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
know anything about camera since its of

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.620 
know anything about camera since its of
over<00:02:12.750> lands<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.260> my<00:02:13.320> Vincent<00:02:14.450> closet<00:02:15.450> might

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
over lands and my Vincent closet might

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.450 
over lands and my Vincent closet might
have<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.780> fungus<00:02:16.410> or<00:02:16.560> something<00:02:16.920> on<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.130> inside

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
have a fungus or something on the inside

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.550 
have a fungus or something on the inside
so<00:02:17.760> they<00:02:18.270> have<00:02:18.360> a<00:02:18.390> whole<00:02:18.600> rating<00:02:18.960> scale<00:02:19.260> there

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
so they have a whole rating scale there
