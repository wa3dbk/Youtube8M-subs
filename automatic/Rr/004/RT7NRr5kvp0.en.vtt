00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.700
 let's say that I always liked the 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.560
 Little football was typical of 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.080
 game men have to cross 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.940
 still several cultural barriers 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.710
 we have to cross machismo always 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.500
 visible in football is the day 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.080
 stigmatized as not the search 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.970
 when they want to achieve football 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.970
 men who are not going to play between 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.410
 nerves cheeks with everything always must 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.520
 and you do not help him to do why 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.520
 tell me to 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.650
 in the games usually are played 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.430
 with a lot of claws with a lot of desire and put 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.430
 eggs the word 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.640
 that has been amassed so much 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.540
 makes talents begin to emerge 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.159
 to play and that it is an entity 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.530
 that can live this that can not 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.369
 aspire to succeed in this as this is 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.369
 many players 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.970
 all right 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.879
 women have a greater 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.150
 call when there is a match or there 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:26.470
 some tournament come the parents 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.840
 the mother the grandfather the aunt the friends the 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.270
 boyfriend the whole family there is a lot of bloated 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.910
 and the people the truth 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.970
 accompanies much what is in tournament in 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.970
 general 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.430
 what happened to bring it here rosary and 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.310
 start doing something a little more if 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.350
 you want professional or you have to 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.420
 see with something more constant as you can 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.700
 playing every week is good as well 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.020
 came the theme of life you see in the 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.990
 tournament many teams that really 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.850
 they train that they have coach that 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.890
 they warm up they have talk 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.450
 technique and see how it is specializing 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.450
 it's not so much coming to 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.499
