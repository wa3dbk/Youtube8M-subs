this<00:00:31.189> is<00:00:31.429> a<00:00:31.480> game<00:00:32.480> that's<00:00:33.130> supposedly<00:00:34.130> an

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
this is a game that's supposedly an

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.270 
this is a game that's supposedly an
older<00:00:34.880> game<00:00:35.590> we're<00:00:36.590> gonna<00:00:36.710> we're<00:00:36.980> going<00:00:37.100> to<00:00:37.190> be

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
older game we're gonna we're going to be

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.670 
older game we're gonna we're going to be
nice<00:00:37.610> and<00:00:38.150> pretend<00:00:38.990> that's<00:00:39.170> true<00:00:39.470> but<00:00:39.650> I

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
nice and pretend that's true but I

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.590 
nice and pretend that's true but I
really<00:00:40.010> think<00:00:40.040> it's<00:00:40.370> a<00:00:40.460> newer<00:00:40.640> game<00:00:40.940> that<00:00:41.510> was

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
really think it's a newer game that was

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.410 
really think it's a newer game that was
based<00:00:41.900> on<00:00:42.050> an<00:00:42.200> older<00:00:42.560> some<00:00:43.400> older<00:00:43.700> ideas<00:00:44.120> but

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
based on an older some older ideas but

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.580 
based on an older some older ideas but
it's<00:00:44.870> a<00:00:45.080> abstract<00:00:46.010> strategy<00:00:46.580> game<00:00:46.820> which

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
it's a abstract strategy game which

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.260 
it's a abstract strategy game which
let's<00:00:48.590> describe<00:00:49.070> it<00:00:49.370> as<00:00:49.490> a<00:00:49.520> mix<00:00:49.940> between

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
let's describe it as a mix between

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.270 
let's describe it as a mix between
Chinese<00:00:51.230> checkers<00:00:51.940> chess<00:00:52.940> and<00:00:53.590> Yahtzee<00:00:54.590> ok

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
Chinese checkers chess and Yahtzee ok

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.590 
Chinese checkers chess and Yahtzee ok
that's<00:00:55.460> ridiculous<00:00:55.610> that's<00:00:56.090> really<00:00:56.420> not<00:00:56.540> what

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
that's ridiculous that's really not what

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.569 
that's ridiculous that's really not what
the<00:00:56.810> combination<00:00:57.410> is<00:00:57.560> I<00:00:57.770> can't<00:00:58.430> really

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
the combination is I can't really

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.280 
the combination is I can't really
describe<00:00:58.880> it<00:00:59.090> to<00:00:59.150> you<00:00:59.329> other<00:00:59.660> than<00:00:59.930> saying

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
describe it to you other than saying

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:16.590 
describe it to you other than saying
let's<00:01:01.070> look<00:01:01.340> at<00:01:01.550> it

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.630 

so<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:17.720> board<00:01:17.990> is<00:01:18.200> cough<00:01:18.650> as<00:01:18.920> you<00:01:19.040> can<00:01:19.190> see<00:01:19.400> and

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
so the board is cough as you can see and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.330 
so the board is cough as you can see and
it<00:01:19.850> comes<00:01:20.119> wrapped<00:01:20.540> up<00:01:20.780> inside<00:01:20.990> a<00:01:21.200> bag<00:01:21.530> now

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
it comes wrapped up inside a bag now

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.040 
it comes wrapped up inside a bag now
normally<00:01:22.550> I'm<00:01:22.820> not<00:01:22.850> a<00:01:22.970> real<00:01:23.090> big<00:01:23.240> fan<00:01:23.300> of<00:01:23.570> you

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
know alternative storage things boxes

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.060

are<00:01:26.240> good<00:01:26.450> thank<00:01:26.750> you<00:01:26.810> but<00:01:27.500> this<00:01:27.619> is<00:01:27.830> still

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
are good thank you but this is still

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.830 
are good thank you but this is still
easy<00:01:28.610> to<00:01:28.759> stick<00:01:29.000> on<00:01:29.119> a<00:01:29.210> shelf<00:01:29.420> or<00:01:29.570> somewhere

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
easy to stick on a shelf or somewhere

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.380 
easy to stick on a shelf or somewhere
it's<00:01:29.930> a<00:01:29.960> lot<00:01:30.110> easier<00:01:30.140> than<00:01:30.440> say<00:01:30.770> a<00:01:30.800> cylinder<00:01:31.610> so

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
it's a lot easier than say a cylinder so

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.030 
it's a lot easier than say a cylinder so
we<00:01:32.479> have<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.660> cloth<00:01:32.869> board<00:01:33.229> and<00:01:33.410> then<00:01:33.530> there

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
we have the cloth board and then there

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.300 
we have the cloth board and then there
are<00:01:34.070> sets<00:01:34.970> of<00:01:35.170> cubes<00:01:36.170> eight<00:01:36.410> cubes<00:01:36.860> and<00:01:37.130> four

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
are sets of cubes eight cubes and four

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.370 
are sets of cubes eight cubes and four
different<00:01:37.580> player<00:01:37.759> colors<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:38.420> you<00:01:39.110> can<00:01:39.229> see

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
different player colors and you can see

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.810 
different player colors and you can see
that<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:39.740> different<00:01:40.190> shapes<00:01:40.490> have<00:01:40.700> been

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
that the different shapes have been

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.760 
that the different shapes have been
burned<00:01:41.060> into<00:01:41.240> these<00:01:41.479> with<00:01:41.780> wood<00:01:42.080> burning

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
burned into these with wood burning

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.490 
burned into these with wood burning
materials<00:01:43.430> and<00:01:43.670> it's<00:01:44.180> okay<00:01:44.479> i<00:01:44.509> mean<00:01:44.810> it<00:01:45.200> has

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
materials and it's okay i mean it has

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.139 
materials and it's okay i mean it has
this<00:01:45.680> old<00:01:45.950> feeling<00:01:46.610> to<00:01:46.729> it<00:01:46.820> which<00:01:46.970> i<00:01:47.090> think

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
this old feeling to it which i think

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.270 
this old feeling to it which i think
they<00:01:47.390> were<00:01:47.450> going<00:01:47.690> to<00:01:47.810> with<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:48.470> game<00:01:48.649> feel

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
they were going to with the game feel

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.520 
they were going to with the game feel
like<00:01:49.430> a<00:01:49.520> point<00:01:49.729> i<00:01:49.789> would<00:01:49.850> have<00:01:50.090> is<00:01:50.300> that<00:01:50.530> some

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
like a point i would have is that some

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.380 
like a point i would have is that some
of<00:01:51.649> the<00:01:51.740> lighter<00:01:51.979> yellow<00:01:52.250> ones<00:01:52.610> and<00:01:52.970> some<00:01:53.270> of

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
of the lighter yellow ones and some of

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.609 
of the lighter yellow ones and some of
the<00:01:53.450> tan<00:01:53.690> ones<00:01:53.960> are<00:01:54.229> a<00:01:54.259> little<00:01:54.350> bit

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
the tan ones are a little bit

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.200 
the tan ones are a little bit
indistinguishable<00:01:55.100> from<00:01:55.460> each<00:01:55.670> other<00:01:55.880> I<00:01:56.090> mean

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
indistinguishable from each other I mean

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.430 
indistinguishable from each other I mean
it's<00:01:56.420> I<00:01:56.600> guess<00:01:56.960> when<00:01:57.080> you<00:01:57.170> look<00:01:57.289> at<00:01:57.410> them

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
it's I guess when you look at them

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.190 
it's I guess when you look at them
carefully<00:01:57.710> it's<00:01:58.070> easy<00:01:58.250> to<00:01:58.460> see<00:01:58.960> let's<00:01:59.960> open

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
carefully it's easy to see let's open

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.450 
carefully it's easy to see let's open
play<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.380> two-player<00:02:00.770> game<00:02:00.979> I<00:02:01.009> normally<00:02:01.340> play

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
play the two-player game I normally play

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.550 
play the two-player game I normally play
red<00:02:01.729> and<00:02:01.880> green<00:02:02.090> or<00:02:02.360> one<00:02:02.750> of<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:02.929> colors<00:02:03.110> and

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
red and green or one of the colors and

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.820 
red and green or one of the colors and
and<00:02:03.850> white<00:02:04.850> so<00:02:05.660> anyway<00:02:05.960> each<00:02:06.200> player<00:02:06.500> is<00:02:06.710> going

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
and white so anyway each player is going

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.080 
and white so anyway each player is going
to<00:02:06.920> start<00:02:07.160> with<00:02:07.310> eight<00:02:07.490> pieces<00:02:07.759> that<00:02:08.000> they're

to start with eight pieces that they're
going<00:02:08.209> to<00:02:08.269> put<00:02:08.450> in<00:02:08.539> their<00:02:08.690> home<00:02:08.869> row<00:02:09.140> you<00:02:10.130> have

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
going to put in their home row you have

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.259 
going to put in their home row you have
two<00:02:10.459> books<00:02:10.759> two<00:02:11.030> swords<00:02:11.890> two<00:02:12.890> trees<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.640> two

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.930 
flames now there are actually six sides
each<00:02:17.660> piece<00:02:17.959> there's<00:02:18.230> also<00:02:18.380> two<00:02:19.130> hat<00:02:19.430> pieces

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
each piece there's also two hat pieces

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.699 
each piece there's also two hat pieces
and<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:20.720> mean<00:02:20.900> there's<00:02:21.049> a<00:02:21.110> half<00:02:21.260> piece<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.620> an

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
and I mean there's a half piece and an

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.319 
and I mean there's a half piece and an
ear<00:02:21.860> piece<00:02:21.890> but<00:02:22.459> these<00:02:22.610> are<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.790> pieces<00:02:23.150> you

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329 
ear piece but these are the pieces you

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:24.520 
ear piece but these are the pieces you
start<00:02:23.660> with<00:02:23.780> you<00:02:23.900> can<00:02:24.019> put<00:02:24.140> them<00:02:24.260> in<00:02:24.320> any<00:02:24.440> order

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
start with you can put them in any order

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.250 
start with you can put them in any order
you<00:02:24.890> want<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.549> then<00:02:25.750> Plagueis<00:02:26.750> alternates

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
you want and then Plagueis alternates

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.319 
you want and then Plagueis alternates
between<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.709> players<00:02:27.920> on<00:02:28.190> my<00:02:28.220> turn<00:02:28.519> I<00:02:28.730> move

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
between the players on my turn I move

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.810 
between the players on my turn I move
one<00:02:29.570> of<00:02:29.660> my<00:02:29.750> pieces<00:02:30.019> now<00:02:30.549> pieces<00:02:31.549> move

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
one of my pieces now pieces move

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.590 
one of my pieces now pieces move
differently<00:02:32.209> so<00:02:32.980> let's<00:02:33.980> see<00:02:34.370> how<00:02:34.610> a<00:02:35.000> piece

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
differently so let's see how a piece

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.970 
differently so let's see how a piece
moves<00:02:36.350> here<00:02:36.739> a<00:02:37.120> sword<00:02:38.120> can<00:02:38.480> move<00:02:38.630> one<00:02:38.810> space

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
moves here a sword can move one space

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.520 
moves here a sword can move one space
diagonally<00:02:39.980> all<00:02:40.160> right<00:02:40.940> easy<00:02:41.209> a<00:02:41.540> book<00:02:42.500> can

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
diagonally all right easy a book can

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.690 
diagonally all right easy a book can
move<00:02:42.920> one<00:02:43.160> space<00:02:43.310> or<00:02:43.670> orthogonally<00:02:44.450> a<00:02:45.700> tree

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
move one space or orthogonally a tree

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.380 
move one space or orthogonally a tree
can<00:02:47.600> move<00:02:47.840> forward<00:02:48.320> diagonally<00:02:49.220> or<00:02:49.430> just

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
can move forward diagonally or just

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.110 
can move forward diagonally or just
straight<00:02:50.600> forward<00:02:51.049> or<00:02:51.430> a<00:02:52.430> tree<00:02:52.820> can<00:02:52.970> move

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
straight forward or a tree can move

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.650 
straight forward or a tree can move
backwards<00:02:53.690> one<00:02:54.440> space<00:02:54.799> that's<00:02:55.489> it<00:02:55.730> so<00:02:56.269> and<00:02:56.630> now

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
backwards one space that's it so and now

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.569 
backwards one space that's it so and now
it's<00:02:56.870> pretty<00:02:57.079> easy<00:02:57.140> to<00:02:57.260> minute<00:02:57.709> it<00:02:57.890> makes<00:02:58.340> the

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
it's pretty easy to minute it makes the

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.240 
it's pretty easy to minute it makes the
shape<00:02:59.030> of<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.239> tree<00:02:59.510> coming<00:03:00.200> it<00:03:00.709> just<00:03:00.950> makes<00:03:01.070> us

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
shape of a tree coming it just makes us

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.300 
shape of a tree coming it just makes us
anyway<00:03:02.030> hey<00:03:02.420> let's<00:03:03.140> see<00:03:03.290> a<00:03:03.320> flame<00:03:03.769> is<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.130> best

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
anyway hey let's see a flame is the best

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.940 
anyway hey let's see a flame is the best
piece<00:03:04.489> because<00:03:05.209> a<00:03:05.239> flame<00:03:05.510> can<00:03:05.780> go<00:03:05.959> one<00:03:06.709> space

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
piece because a flame can go one space

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.120 
piece because a flame can go one space
in<00:03:07.100> any<00:03:07.220> directions<00:03:07.670> hey<00:03:08.709> now<00:03:09.709> if<00:03:09.860> you<00:03:09.950> have<00:03:10.040> an

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
in any directions hey now if you have an

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.030 
in any directions hey now if you have an
earpiece<00:03:10.370> for<00:03:11.209> any<00:03:11.360> reason<00:03:11.750> earpiece<00:03:12.530> but

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
earpiece for any reason earpiece but

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.159 
earpiece for any reason earpiece but
anyway<00:03:13.280> if<00:03:13.549> you<00:03:13.790> have<00:03:13.880> an<00:03:13.970> ear<00:03:14.329> and<00:03:14.449> your<00:03:14.900> can't

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:15.169 
anyway if you have an ear and your can't

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:15.790 
anyway if you have an ear and your can't
move

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
move

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.580 
move
ah<00:03:15.860> so<00:03:16.760> when<00:03:17.150> all<00:03:17.270> of<00:03:17.360> the<00:03:17.450> year<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:18.470> other

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
ah so when all of the year and the other

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.010 
ah so when all of the year and the other
one<00:03:18.860> that<00:03:19.040> mentioned<00:03:19.610> was<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:20.060> hat<00:03:20.660> and<00:03:20.960> the

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
one that mentioned was the hat and the

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.710 
one that mentioned was the hat and the
hat<00:03:21.260> moves<00:03:21.650> just<00:03:22.130> like<00:03:22.250> a<00:03:22.400> knight<00:03:22.670> in<00:03:22.700> chess<00:03:23.060> so

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
hat moves just like a knight in chess so

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.640 
hat moves just like a knight in chess so
woo<00:03:24.050> or<00:03:24.560> woo<00:03:25.220> or<00:03:25.640> you<00:03:26.330> know<00:03:26.360> different<00:03:27.320> ways

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
woo or woo or you know different ways

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.060 
woo or woo or you know different ways
that<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.220> Hat<00:03:28.640> can<00:03:28.970> move<00:03:29.180> now<00:03:30.170> that's<00:03:30.770> not<00:03:30.920> the

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
that the Hat can move now that's not the

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.710 
that the Hat can move now that's not the
only<00:03:31.130> way<00:03:31.520> these<00:03:31.700> pieces<00:03:31.940> can<00:03:32.240> move<00:03:32.390> old<00:03:32.600> is

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
only way these pieces can move old is

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.720 
only way these pieces can move old is
the<00:03:32.840> only<00:03:32.960> way<00:03:33.110> they<00:03:33.230> can<00:03:33.290> move<00:03:33.530> but<00:03:33.860> if<00:03:34.100> you

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
the only way they can move but if you

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.490 
the only way they can move but if you
have<00:03:34.880> a<00:03:34.910> piece<00:03:35.210> and<00:03:35.450> there's<00:03:36.020> another<00:03:36.200> piece

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
have a piece and there's another piece

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.370 
have a piece and there's another piece
in<00:03:36.710> front<00:03:37.250> of<00:03:37.340> it<00:03:37.460> you<00:03:38.270> can<00:03:38.480> jump<00:03:38.870> over<00:03:39.140> that

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
in front of it you can jump over that

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.200 
in front of it you can jump over that
piece<00:03:39.680> as<00:03:39.920> long<00:03:40.130> as<00:03:40.280> it's<00:03:40.460> in<00:03:40.610> the<00:03:40.790> proper

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
piece as long as it's in the proper

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.180 
piece as long as it's in the proper
movement<00:03:41.390> direction<00:03:41.690> so<00:03:42.140> for<00:03:42.320> example<00:03:42.380> you

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
movement direction so for example you

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.530 
movement direction so for example you
know<00:03:43.220> book<00:03:43.580> and<00:03:43.760> go<00:03:43.850> one<00:03:44.060> space<00:03:44.270> in<00:03:44.420> any

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
know book and go one space in any

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.300 
know book and go one space in any
direction<00:03:44.690> well<00:03:45.440> he<00:03:45.560> wants<00:03:45.740> to<00:03:45.800> go<00:03:45.920> one<00:03:46.070> space

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
direction well he wants to go one space

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.440 
direction well he wants to go one space
in<00:03:46.490> this<00:03:46.580> direction<00:03:46.760> but<00:03:47.120> there's<00:03:47.300> someone

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
in this direction but there's someone

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.740 
in this direction but there's someone
here<00:03:47.690> so<00:03:47.870> he<00:03:48.020> can<00:03:48.170> jump<00:03:48.440> over<00:03:48.920> him<00:03:49.100> and<00:03:49.480> in<00:03:50.480> fact

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
here so he can jump over him and in fact

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.040 
here so he can jump over him and in fact
if<00:03:51.380> there<00:03:51.710> was<00:03:51.920> another<00:03:52.310> piece<00:03:52.670> there<00:03:53.480> he

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
if there was another piece there he

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.410 
if there was another piece there he
could<00:03:54.230> continue<00:03:54.620> his<00:03:55.040> jump<00:03:55.400> and<00:03:55.640> just<00:03:56.300> like

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
could continue his jump and just like

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.940 
could continue his jump and just like
Chinese<00:03:56.810> checkers<00:03:57.080> he<00:03:57.410> could<00:03:57.560> jump<00:03:57.740> all<00:03:57.920> the

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
Chinese checkers he could jump all the

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.980 
Chinese checkers he could jump all the
way<00:03:58.010> across<00:03:58.130> the<00:03:58.460> board<00:03:58.700> what<00:03:59.690> he's<00:03:59.840> done

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
way across the board what he's done

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.290 
way across the board what he's done
jumping<00:04:00.380> so<00:04:00.620> be<00:04:00.860> it<00:04:00.950> each<00:04:01.520> piece<00:04:01.940> that<00:04:02.180> was

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
jumping so be it each piece that was

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.170 
jumping so be it each piece that was
jumped<00:04:02.660> over<00:04:02.990> must<00:04:03.560> then<00:04:03.770> roll<00:04:04.130> to<00:04:04.460> see<00:04:04.940> what

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
jumped over must then roll to see what

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.050 
jumped over must then roll to see what
piece<00:04:05.450> they<00:04:05.690> are<00:04:05.870> now<00:04:06.110> ah<00:04:06.490> you<00:04:07.490> were<00:04:07.700> a<00:04:07.730> flame

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
piece they are now ah you were a flame

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.780 
piece they are now ah you were a flame
now<00:04:08.360> you<00:04:08.420> are<00:04:08.750> a<00:04:08.780> half<00:04:09.140> and<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:10.190> object<00:04:10.580> of<00:04:10.670> the

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
now you are a half and the object of the

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.080 
now you are a half and the object of the
game<00:04:10.820> is<00:04:11.240> to<00:04:11.510> get<00:04:11.780> all<00:04:12.050> your<00:04:12.320> pieces<00:04:12.620> into<00:04:13.460> the

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
game is to get all your pieces into the

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.170 
game is to get all your pieces into the
home<00:04:14.750> row<00:04:15.050> of<00:04:15.350> the<00:04:15.860> player<00:04:16.100> across<00:04:16.700> from<00:04:16.970> you

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
home row of the player across from you

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.330 
home row of the player across from you
now<00:04:17.989> you<00:04:18.049> can<00:04:18.440> see<00:04:18.650> that<00:04:18.859> this<00:04:18.980> will<00:04:19.190> make<00:04:19.280> a

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
now you can see that this will make a

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.890 
now you can see that this will make a
three-player<00:04:19.850> game<00:04:19.850> kind<00:04:20.390> of<00:04:20.480> awkward

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
three-player game kind of awkward

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.470 
three-player game kind of awkward
because<00:04:21.049> it<00:04:21.650> just<00:04:22.010> is<00:04:22.190> not<00:04:22.370> very<00:04:22.760> balanced<00:04:23.330> and

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
because it just is not very balanced and

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.060 
because it just is not very balanced and
one<00:04:24.050> player<00:04:24.260> are<00:04:24.380> going<00:04:24.560> to<00:04:24.680> the<00:04:24.770> other<00:04:24.890> side

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
one player are going to the other side

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.460 
one player are going to the other side
and<00:04:25.520> it<00:04:25.790> also<00:04:26.240> means<00:04:26.630> that<00:04:26.780> a<00:04:26.810> two<00:04:27.020> player<00:04:27.230> game

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
and it also means that a two player game

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.840 
and it also means that a two player game
plays<00:04:27.740> very<00:04:27.980> differently<00:04:28.580> than<00:04:28.820> a

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
plays very differently than a

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.490 
plays very differently than a
four-player<00:04:29.419> game<00:04:29.450> because<00:04:30.320> of<00:04:30.350> the

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
four-player game because of the

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.600 
four-player game because of the
four-player<00:04:30.919> game<00:04:30.950> there's<00:04:31.340> lots<00:04:31.520> more

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
four-player game there's lots more

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.970 
four-player game there's lots more
pieces<00:04:32.060> in<00:04:32.180> the<00:04:32.270> middle<00:04:32.540> but<00:04:33.380> it<00:04:33.530> does<00:04:33.740> offer

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
pieces in the middle but it does offer

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.430 
pieces in the middle but it does offer
some<00:04:34.160> interesting<00:04:34.790> strategy<00:04:35.330> results<00:04:36.290> here

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
some interesting strategy results here

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.980 
some interesting strategy results here
for<00:04:36.770> example<00:04:37.000> you<00:04:38.000> can<00:04:38.240> jump<00:04:38.510> all<00:04:38.660> waycross

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
for example you can jump all waycross

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.150 
for example you can jump all waycross
aboard<00:04:39.320> well<00:04:39.440> that's<00:04:39.590> just<00:04:39.710> like<00:04:39.830> Chinese

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
aboard well that's just like Chinese

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.530 
aboard well that's just like Chinese
checkers<00:04:40.370> but<00:04:40.730> you<00:04:40.850> want<00:04:41.060> to<00:04:41.150> set<00:04:41.330> your<00:04:41.480> own

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
checkers but you want to set your own

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.840 
checkers but you want to set your own
pieces<00:04:41.900> up<00:04:42.220> sometimes<00:04:43.220> you<00:04:43.370> have<00:04:43.400> a<00:04:43.520> really

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
pieces up sometimes you have a really

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.820 
pieces up sometimes you have a really
good<00:04:44.060> jump<00:04:44.419> but<00:04:44.570> it<00:04:44.690> involves<00:04:45.200> jumping<00:04:45.260> over

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
good jump but it involves jumping over

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.350 
good jump but it involves jumping over
one<00:04:46.010> of<00:04:46.130> your<00:04:46.250> flames<00:04:46.610> and<00:04:46.910> you<00:04:47.000> don't<00:04:47.180> know

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
one of your flames and you don't know

one of your flames and you don't know
that<00:04:47.570> you<00:04:47.690> may<00:04:47.870> just<00:04:48.140> rule<00:04:48.410> an<00:04:48.530> ear<00:04:48.830> this<00:04:49.790> is<00:04:49.970> an

that you may just rule an ear this is an

that you may just rule an ear this is an

abstract strategy game but at the same
time<00:04:52.669> there<00:04:52.940> is<00:04:52.970> less<00:04:53.270> whenever<00:04:53.570> you<00:04:53.720> roll

them<00:05:03.410> just<00:05:04.010> slow<00:05:04.280> him<00:05:04.520> down<00:05:04.810> these<00:05:05.810> hats<00:05:06.230> are

them just slow him down these hats are
pretty<00:05:06.710> powerful<00:05:07.010> pieces<00:05:07.340> they<00:05:07.610> can<00:05:07.790> move

pretty powerful pieces they can move

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.659 
pretty powerful pieces they can move
like<00:05:08.150> a<00:05:08.180> knight<00:05:08.480> and<00:05:09.380> so<00:05:09.800> by<00:05:09.980> themselves<00:05:10.520> they

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
like a knight and so by themselves they

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:12.820 
like a knight and so by themselves they
can<00:05:10.910> move<00:05:11.090> pretty<00:05:11.300> far<00:05:11.720> but<00:05:12.230> at<00:05:12.350> the<00:05:12.470> same<00:05:12.650> time

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
can move pretty far but at the same time

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.620 
can move pretty far but at the same time
you<00:05:12.950> just<00:05:13.220> got<00:05:13.400> to<00:05:13.490> keep<00:05:13.610> an<00:05:13.760> eye<00:05:13.940> on<00:05:13.970> the<00:05:14.360> whole

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
you just got to keep an eye on the whole

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.450 
you just got to keep an eye on the whole
board<00:05:14.960> and<00:05:15.169> make<00:05:15.590> sure<00:05:15.620> not<00:05:15.950> leaving<00:05:16.310> one

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
board and make sure not leaving one

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.070 
board and make sure not leaving one
piece<00:05:16.700> behind<00:05:16.910> because<00:05:17.300> he<00:05:17.480> may<00:05:17.630> have<00:05:17.780> to<00:05:17.900> run

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
piece behind because he may have to run

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.630 
piece behind because he may have to run
across<00:05:18.169> the<00:05:18.470> board<00:05:18.710> by<00:05:18.860> himself<00:05:19.220> at<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:19.520> end

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
across the board by himself at the end

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.580 
across the board by himself at the end
it's<00:05:20.240> better<00:05:20.480> to<00:05:20.660> jump<00:05:20.900> over<00:05:21.140> your<00:05:21.260> own<00:05:21.320> pieces

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
it's better to jump over your own pieces

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.860 
it's better to jump over your own pieces
or<00:05:21.950> better<00:05:22.190> yet<00:05:22.460> jump<00:05:22.910> over<00:05:23.180> your<00:05:23.330> opponent's

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
or better yet jump over your opponent's

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.409 
or better yet jump over your opponent's
it's<00:05:24.470> a<00:05:24.500> very<00:05:24.710> simple<00:05:25.190> game<00:05:25.250> but<00:05:26.150> there's<00:05:26.300> a

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
it's a very simple game but there's a

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.540 
it's a very simple game but there's a
lot<00:05:26.630> of<00:05:26.660> different<00:05:27.229> strategies<00:05:27.440> in<00:05:27.860> it

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
lot of different strategies in it

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.450 
lot of different strategies in it
I<00:05:29.050> really<00:05:30.050> went<00:05:30.260> into<00:05:30.470> this<00:05:30.590> game<00:05:30.830> expecting

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
I really went into this game expecting

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.000 
I really went into this game expecting
to<00:05:31.700> not<00:05:31.910> like<00:05:32.240> it<00:05:32.270> I<00:05:32.660> really<00:05:33.440> went<00:05:33.650> into<00:05:33.890> it

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
to not like it I really went into it

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.820 
to not like it I really went into it
thinking<00:05:34.040> uh<00:05:34.700> you<00:05:35.660> know<00:05:35.810> i'm<00:05:36.050> not<00:05:36.440> sure<00:05:36.800> that

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
thinking uh you know i'm not sure that

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.800 
thinking uh you know i'm not sure that
you<00:05:37.160> know<00:05:37.280> didn't<00:05:37.850> look<00:05:38.120> that<00:05:38.420> spectacular

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
you know didn't look that spectacular

you know didn't look that spectacular
old<00:05:39.770> wooden<00:05:40.130> pieces<00:05:40.460> reminds<00:05:41.270> me<00:05:41.360> of<00:05:41.450> the

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
stuff you see at cracker barrel and i

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.760 
stuff you see at cracker barrel and i
just<00:05:43.820> thought<00:05:44.030> uh<00:05:44.060> you<00:05:44.660> know<00:05:44.780> but<00:05:45.290> it<00:05:45.500> was<00:05:45.740> a

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
just thought uh you know but it was a

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.460 
just thought uh you know but it was a
fun<00:05:46.280> game<00:05:46.640> I<00:05:46.940> hey<00:05:47.720> hey<00:05:48.910> hey<00:05:50.230> Chinese<00:05:51.230> checkers

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
fun game I hey hey hey Chinese checkers

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.080 
fun game I hey hey hey Chinese checkers
but<00:05:52.010> this<00:05:52.100> one<00:05:52.250> I<00:05:52.280> liked<00:05:52.550> because<00:05:52.820> there's

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
but this one I liked because there's

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.540 
but this one I liked because there's
just<00:05:53.240> it<00:05:53.390> seems<00:05:53.900> more<00:05:54.050> interesting<00:05:54.590> jump<00:05:55.250> over

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
just it seems more interesting jump over

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.790 
just it seems more interesting jump over
a<00:05:55.580> piece<00:05:55.820> then<00:05:56.270> you<00:05:56.420> reroll<00:05:57.110> that<00:05:57.260> piece<00:05:57.500> and

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
a piece then you reroll that piece and

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.890 
a piece then you reroll that piece and
you<00:05:58.100> know<00:05:58.220> so<00:05:58.370> you<00:05:58.400> have<00:05:58.550> to<00:05:58.700> to<00:05:59.240> mix<00:05:59.600> and<00:05:59.750> match

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
you know so you have to to mix and match

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.320 
you know so you have to to mix and match
that<00:06:00.140> strategy<00:06:00.500> why<00:06:00.770> jump<00:06:01.130> over<00:06:01.400> pieces<00:06:01.610> so

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
that strategy why jump over pieces so

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.120 
that strategy why jump over pieces so
that<00:06:02.360> I<00:06:02.540> can<00:06:02.750> force<00:06:03.230> that<00:06:03.350> person<00:06:03.680> to<00:06:03.740> reroll

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
that I can force that person to reroll

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.800 
that I can force that person to reroll
here's<00:06:04.670> a<00:06:04.730> great<00:06:04.970> move<00:06:05.180> for<00:06:05.210> me<00:06:05.480> but<00:06:05.510> when<00:06:05.780> I

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
here's a great move for me but when I

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.300 
here's a great move for me but when I
jump<00:06:06.050> over<00:06:06.110> all<00:06:06.320> my<00:06:06.410> pieces<00:06:06.620> they<00:06:06.890> turn<00:06:07.160> into

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
jump over all my pieces they turn into

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.880 
jump over all my pieces they turn into
ears<00:06:07.730> I'm<00:06:08.570> so<00:06:08.900> curious<00:06:09.080> where<00:06:09.380> the<00:06:09.500> thing

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:09.890 
ears I'm so curious where the thing

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.410 
ears I'm so curious where the thing
comes<00:06:10.010> behind<00:06:10.250> the<00:06:10.490> ear<00:06:10.670> piece<00:06:10.910> doesn't<00:06:11.180> move

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.420 
comes behind the ear piece doesn't move

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.590 
comes behind the ear piece doesn't move
but<00:06:11.750> whatever<00:06:12.460> all<00:06:13.460> in<00:06:13.820> all<00:06:13.970> it's

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
but whatever all in all it's

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.120 
but whatever all in all it's
entertaining<00:06:15.140> and<00:06:15.320> it<00:06:15.470> certainly<00:06:15.680> will<00:06:15.920> fit

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
entertaining and it certainly will fit

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.450 
entertaining and it certainly will fit
into<00:06:16.280> my<00:06:16.610> games<00:06:17.600> of<00:06:17.780> logic<00:06:18.260> which<00:06:18.860> I<00:06:19.160> is<00:06:19.220> a

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
into my games of logic which I is a

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.220 
into my games of logic which I is a
special<00:06:20.000> collection<00:06:20.150> of<00:06:20.450> games<00:06:20.690> that<00:06:20.810> I<00:06:20.930> keep

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.230 
special collection of games that I keep

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.650 
special collection of games that I keep
and<00:06:21.470> use<00:06:21.710> when<00:06:22.580> I<00:06:22.610> teach<00:06:22.730> geometry<00:06:23.210> I'm<00:06:23.510> a<00:06:23.570> high

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660 
and use when I teach geometry I'm a high

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.360 
and use when I teach geometry I'm a high
school<00:06:23.690> math<00:06:23.930> teacher<00:06:24.110> I<00:06:24.500> teach<00:06:24.590> geometry<00:06:25.040> and

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
school math teacher I teach geometry and

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.760 
school math teacher I teach geometry and
I<00:06:25.460> often<00:06:25.760> use<00:06:26.090> games<00:06:26.390> like<00:06:26.690> this<00:06:26.900> one<00:06:27.140> and<00:06:27.320> this

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
I often use games like this one and this

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.260 
I often use games like this one and this
is<00:06:27.980> one<00:06:28.160> that's<00:06:28.340> going<00:06:28.430> to<00:06:28.520> make<00:06:28.640> the<00:06:28.790> list<00:06:28.940> yes

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
is one that's going to make the list yes

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.750 
is one that's going to make the list yes
there's<00:06:29.570> luck<00:06:29.840> involved<00:06:30.350> than<00:06:30.770> this<00:06:30.920> one<00:06:31.220> but

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:31.760 
there's luck involved than this one but

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.670 
there's luck involved than this one but
like<00:06:31.910> I<00:06:32.060> said<00:06:32.120> before<00:06:32.420> it's<00:06:32.870> controlled<00:06:33.410> look

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
like I said before it's controlled look

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.610 
like I said before it's controlled look
so<00:06:34.040> check<00:06:34.970> it<00:06:35.000> out<00:06:35.210> and<00:06:35.510> hey<00:06:35.810> look<00:06:36.170> this<00:06:36.350> bag

so check it out and hey look this bag

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.320 
so check it out and hey look this bag
could<00:06:36.770> fit<00:06:36.980> anywhere<00:06:37.250> I<00:06:37.310> can<00:06:37.400> stick<00:06:37.970> it<00:06:38.090> up<00:06:38.180> in

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330 
could fit anywhere I can stick it up in

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.810 
could fit anywhere I can stick it up in
here<00:06:38.860> tell<00:06:39.860> you<00:06:39.980> it's<00:06:40.070> so<00:06:40.190> much<00:06:40.340> better<00:06:40.490> than<00:06:40.610> a

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 
here tell you it's so much better than a

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.220
