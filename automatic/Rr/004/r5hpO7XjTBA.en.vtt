you're gonna get it I don't know how
this<00:01:54.810> fight<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.170> going<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.560> end<00:01:55.740> because<00:01:56.670> this

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
this fight is going to end because this

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.760 
this fight is going to end because this
fight<00:01:57.869> was<00:01:58.079> epic<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:59.119> it<00:02:00.119> looks<00:02:00.390> like<00:02:00.770> I'm

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
fight was epic and it looks like I'm

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.399 
fight was epic and it looks like I'm
worried<00:02:02.280> because<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.850> looks<00:02:03.119> like<00:02:03.360> Marc<00:02:04.170> Gill

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
worried because it looks like Marc Gill

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.059 
worried because it looks like Marc Gill
is<00:02:04.619> putting<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:06.090> amount<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.540> effort

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
is putting in this amount of effort

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.020 
is putting in this amount of effort
versus<00:02:08.069> what<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.310> spirit<00:02:08.610> king<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:08.879> doing

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
versus what the spirit king is doing

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.420 
versus what the spirit king is doing
granted<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.080> looks<00:02:10.229> like<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.830> spirit<00:02:11.160> king<00:02:11.310> is

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
granted it looks like the spirit king is

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.820 
granted it looks like the spirit king is
making<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:12.360> vast<00:02:12.569> majority<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.319> moves

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
making the vast majority of the moves

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.860 
making the vast majority of the moves
but<00:02:14.310> then<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.610> moves<00:02:14.880> that<00:02:15.030> Marc<00:02:15.390> Gill<00:02:15.630> made

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
but then the moves that Marc Gill made

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.470 
but then the moves that Marc Gill made
with<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.740> thorn<00:02:17.070> magic<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.940> didn't<00:02:18.300> even

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
with the thorn magic that didn't even

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.990 
with the thorn magic that didn't even
like<00:02:18.780> scratch<00:02:19.380> like<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.070> pierced<00:02:20.370> through<00:02:20.550> the

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
like scratch like it pierced through the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.930 
like scratch like it pierced through the
spirit<00:02:21.780> King<00:02:21.960> and<00:02:22.170> then<00:02:22.680> he<00:02:22.890> just<00:02:23.160> breaks<00:02:23.730> it

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
spirit King and then he just breaks it

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.190 
spirit King and then he just breaks it
all<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.330> doesn't<00:02:24.540> even<00:02:24.570> look<00:02:24.810> like<00:02:24.870> he's

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
all and it doesn't even look like he's

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.890 
all and it doesn't even look like he's
scratched<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:26.520> I<00:02:26.910> don't<00:02:27.090> know<00:02:27.240> how<00:02:27.420> this<00:02:27.630> fight

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
scratched so I don't know how this fight

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.010 
scratched so I don't know how this fight
is<00:02:28.020> going<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.440> work<00:02:28.590> because<00:02:28.800> it's<00:02:29.250> insane<00:02:30.020> the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
is going to work because it's insane the

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.530 
is going to work because it's insane the
next<00:02:31.350> um<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:32.730> next<00:02:32.850> chapter<00:02:33.240> I<00:02:33.270> think<00:02:33.330> it's

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
next um the next chapter I think it's

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.810 
next um the next chapter I think it's
like<00:02:33.690> Galaxia<00:02:34.290> blade<00:02:34.710> or<00:02:35.340> something<00:02:35.700> like

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
like Galaxia blade or something like

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.560 
like Galaxia blade or something like
that<00:02:35.880> so<00:02:36.270> I'm<00:02:36.360> assuming<00:02:36.630> that<00:02:37.370> I'm<00:02:38.370> I'm<00:02:39.210> really

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
that so I'm assuming that I'm I'm really

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.030 
that so I'm assuming that I'm I'm really
actually<00:02:39.840> I'm<00:02:40.110> not<00:02:40.200> sure<00:02:40.260> whether<00:02:40.590> it's<00:02:40.800> still

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
actually I'm not sure whether it's still

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.340 
actually I'm not sure whether it's still
Lucy<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.460> still<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.850> spirit<00:02:42.450> King<00:02:42.660> I<00:02:42.840> want<00:02:43.290> to

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
Lucy is still the spirit King I want to

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.020 
Lucy is still the spirit King I want to
say<00:02:43.470> it's<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.220> spirit<00:02:44.520> King<00:02:44.670> because<00:02:44.820> he's

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
say it's the spirit King because he's

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.350 
say it's the spirit King because he's
using<00:02:45.240> his<00:02:45.450> sword<00:02:45.980> in<00:02:46.980> this<00:02:47.370> in<00:02:47.730> this<00:02:48.120> fight

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
using his sword in this in this fight

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.630 
using his sword in this in this fight
and<00:02:48.950> neither<00:02:49.950> one<00:02:50.220> of<00:02:50.250> them<00:02:50.430> are<00:02:50.550> really

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
and neither one of them are really

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.270 
and neither one of them are really
getting<00:02:50.940> any<00:02:51.060> damage<00:02:51.390> in<00:02:51.570> so<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.770> can<00:02:53.010> be<00:02:53.250> a

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
getting any damage in so it can be a

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.940 
getting any damage in so it can be a
toss-up<00:02:53.990> again<00:02:54.990> the<00:02:55.140> only<00:02:55.290> reason<00:02:55.680> why<00:02:55.770> I'm<00:02:55.860> a

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
toss-up again the only reason why I'm a

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.360 
toss-up again the only reason why I'm a
little<00:02:55.980> bit<00:02:56.370> afraid<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:58.830> spirit<00:02:59.160> king

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
little bit afraid of the spirit king

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.390 
little bit afraid of the spirit king
losing<00:03:00.030> is<00:03:00.180> because<00:03:00.540> we<00:03:00.810> just<00:03:01.050> got<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:02.070> demon

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
losing is because we just got the demon

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.800 
losing is because we just got the demon
king<00:03:03.320> we<00:03:04.320> just<00:03:04.530> got<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.770> king<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:05.010> Hades<00:03:05.370> and

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
king we just got the king of Hades and

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.000 
king we just got the king of Hades and
this<00:03:06.810> is<00:03:06.960> the<00:03:07.110> most<00:03:07.260> we've<00:03:07.440> seen<00:03:07.620> him<00:03:07.800> fight

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
this is the most we've seen him fight

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.080 
this is the most we've seen him fight
and<00:03:08.340> we<00:03:09.300> already<00:03:09.600> know<00:03:09.750> how<00:03:09.990> amazing<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:11.250> well

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
and we already know how amazing the well

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.460 
and we already know how amazing the well
actually<00:03:12.240> really<00:03:12.600> don't<00:03:12.750> this<00:03:12.840> is<00:03:12.990> the<00:03:13.290> first

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
actually really don't this is the first

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.610 
actually really don't this is the first
time<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:13.650> seen<00:03:13.890> either<00:03:14.100> of<00:03:14.340> them<00:03:14.490> fight<00:03:14.730> but<00:03:15.620> the

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
time I seen either of them fight but the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.620 
time I seen either of them fight but the
demon<00:03:16.950> king<00:03:17.160> guards<00:03:17.460> the<00:03:17.790> soul<00:03:18.060> of<00:03:18.239> hate<00:03:18.450> of

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
demon king guards the soul of hate of

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.680 
demon king guards the soul of hate of
end<00:03:18.959> so<00:03:19.590> maybe<00:03:20.310> it's<00:03:20.520> a<00:03:20.580> bigger<00:03:20.940> deal<00:03:21.330> for<00:03:21.360> him

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
end so maybe it's a bigger deal for him

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.010 
end so maybe it's a bigger deal for him
to<00:03:21.810> lose<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:22.080> don't<00:03:22.350> know<00:03:22.470> I<00:03:23.150> really<00:03:24.150> don't<00:03:24.239> I'm

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
time I mean you can say she's having

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.070 
time I mean you can say she's having
Aquarius<00:04:42.000> helper<00:04:42.270> because<00:04:42.540> last<00:04:42.720> time<00:04:42.930> she

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
Aquarius helper because last time she

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.930 
Aquarius helper because last time she
had<00:04:43.110> jiminey<00:04:43.530> helper<00:04:43.860> and<00:04:44.070> she<00:04:44.639> didn't<00:04:44.820> even

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
had jiminey helper and she didn't even

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
know how she did it last time because I

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.670 
know how she did it last time because I
think<00:04:48.030> it<00:04:48.150> was<00:04:48.240> a<00:04:48.270> becky<00:04:48.630> who<00:04:48.780> gave<00:04:48.960> her<00:04:49.260> the

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
think it was a becky who gave her the

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.490 
think it was a becky who gave her the
ability<00:04:49.889> to<00:04:50.220> use<00:04:50.610> it<00:04:50.790> and<00:04:51.169> it<00:04:52.169> was<00:04:52.320> like<00:04:52.410> a

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
ability to use it and it was like a

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.200 
ability to use it and it was like a
one-time<00:04:52.919> deal<00:04:53.190> and<00:04:53.490> she<00:04:53.639> used<00:04:53.820> it<00:04:54.000> and<00:04:54.120> then

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
one-time deal and she used it and then

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.300 
one-time deal and she used it and then
she<00:04:54.330> didn't<00:04:54.540> even<00:04:54.630> know<00:04:54.780> how<00:04:54.960> she<00:04:54.990> did<00:04:55.380> it<00:04:55.500> this

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
she didn't even know how she did it this

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.940 
she didn't even know how she did it this
time<00:04:56.419> she<00:04:57.419> knows<00:04:57.630> and<00:04:57.990> this<00:04:58.530> time<00:04:58.680> I<00:04:58.710> think

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
time she knows and this time I think

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.890 
time she knows and this time I think
she's<00:04:59.070> gonna<00:04:59.190> remember<00:04:59.729> I<00:04:59.880> think<00:05:00.570> she's<00:05:00.780> gonna

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
she's gonna remember I think she's gonna

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.070 
she's gonna remember I think she's gonna
keep<00:05:01.229> her<00:05:01.410> own<00:05:01.620> Demetria<00:05:02.100> I<00:05:02.630> don't<00:05:03.630> think

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
keep her own Demetria I don't think

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.490 
keep her own Demetria I don't think
she's<00:05:04.290> going<00:05:04.500> to<00:05:04.860> keep<00:05:05.070> the<00:05:05.400> Aquarius<00:05:05.850> ability

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
she's going to keep the Aquarius ability

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.260 
she's going to keep the Aquarius ability
namely<00:05:07.500> because<00:05:07.919> of<00:05:08.100> Julia<00:05:08.460> I<00:05:08.669> think<00:05:08.760> it'll<00:05:09.120> be

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
namely because of Julia I think it'll be

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.610 
namely because of Julia I think it'll be
odd<00:05:09.479> having<00:05:10.050> to<00:05:10.320> water<00:05:10.560> mages<00:05:11.100> and<00:05:12.620> unless

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
odd having to water mages and unless

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.930 
odd having to water mages and unless
this<00:05:13.919> is<00:05:14.100> like<00:05:14.250> the<00:05:14.400> beginning<00:05:14.580> of<00:05:14.820> her

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
this is like the beginning of her

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.620 
this is like the beginning of her
somehow<00:05:15.210> getting<00:05:15.660> the<00:05:16.410> powers<00:05:16.830> of<00:05:17.070> all<00:05:17.669> of<00:05:18.360> her

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
somehow getting the powers of all of her

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.650 
somehow getting the powers of all of her
celestial<00:05:19.110> spirits<00:05:19.590> in<00:05:20.310> which<00:05:20.700> case<00:05:21.000> she<00:05:21.630> is

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
celestial spirits in which case she is

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.450 
celestial spirits in which case she is
going<00:05:21.990> to<00:05:22.050> be<00:05:22.169> freaking<00:05:22.650> overpowered<00:05:23.250> by<00:05:23.400> the

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
going to be freaking overpowered by the

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.400 
going to be freaking overpowered by the
time<00:05:23.669> this<00:05:23.880> series<00:05:24.060> in<00:05:24.360> this<00:05:24.510> if<00:05:25.169> she's
