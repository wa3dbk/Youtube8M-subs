his backyard for quite a while and I
believe<00:00:12.389> it<00:00:12.509> did<00:00:12.599> run<00:00:12.900> kind<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.410> sort<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.710> in

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
believe it did run kind of sort of in

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.700 
believe it did run kind of sort of in
part<00:00:14.420> whatever<00:00:15.420> issues<00:00:15.780> it<00:00:15.929> may<00:00:16.080> have<00:00:16.199> had<00:00:16.440> I

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
part whatever issues it may have had I

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.500 
part whatever issues it may have had I
have<00:00:17.070> not<00:00:17.630> been<00:00:18.630> improved<00:00:18.990> upon<00:00:19.260> by<00:00:19.590> time<00:00:20.510> so

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
have not been improved upon by time so

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.540 
have not been improved upon by time so
it's<00:00:21.810> pretty<00:00:22.020> much<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.260> parts<00:00:22.590> machine<00:00:22.680> it's<00:00:23.310> I

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
it's pretty much a parts machine it's I

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.189 
it's pretty much a parts machine it's I
don't<00:00:23.609> think<00:00:23.730> I'll<00:00:24.090> ever<00:00:24.390> be<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> sled<00:00:25.080> again

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
don't think I'll ever be a sled again

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.900 
don't think I'll ever be a sled again
now<00:00:25.619> without<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> ton<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.250> work<00:00:26.550> just<00:00:26.820> because

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
now without a ton of work just because

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.900 
now without a ton of work just because
it's<00:00:27.210> just<00:00:28.080> really<00:00:28.289> rotted<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.980> death<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.760> if

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
it's just really rotted to death and if

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.560 
it's just really rotted to death and if
you<00:00:30.090> look<00:00:30.269> at<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.630> it's<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:32.570> pretty

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
you look at it it's a pretty

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.790 
you look at it it's a pretty
structurally<00:00:34.760> weakened<00:00:36.410> skis<00:00:37.410> don't<00:00:37.620> even

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
structurally weakened skis don't even

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.860 
structurally weakened skis don't even
pointed<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> same<00:00:38.760> direction<00:00:38.969> anymore

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
pointed in the same direction anymore

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.770 
pointed in the same direction anymore
you<00:00:40.140> know<00:00:40.230> it's<00:00:40.410> just<00:00:41.480> probably<00:00:42.480> nothing

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
you know it's just probably nothing

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.830 
you know it's just probably nothing
holding<00:00:42.960> them<00:00:43.079> together<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.559> plastic<00:00:44.840> you

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
holding them together is the plastic you

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.619 
holding them together is the plastic you
know<00:00:46.610> so<00:00:48.680> my<00:00:49.680> thought<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.910> use<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> motor<00:00:51.390> for

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
know so my thought is to use a motor for

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.630 
know so my thought is to use a motor for
a<00:00:51.660> project<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.640> a<00:00:54.860> lot<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:56.039> guys<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.489> to

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
a project and a lot of guys like to

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.540 
a project and a lot of guys like to
watch<00:00:57.170> the<00:01:00.590> things<00:01:01.590> get<00:01:01.800> started<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.250> or<00:01:02.430> try

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
watch the things get started on or try

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.070 
watch the things get started on or try
to<00:01:02.609> get<00:01:02.789> started<00:01:03.090> on<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.390> figured<00:01:03.750> I'd<00:01:03.870> pop

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
to get started on so I figured I'd pop

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.080 
to get started on so I figured I'd pop
the<00:01:04.260> camera<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.920> into<00:01:05.820> yet<00:01:06.479> real<00:01:06.810> quick

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
the camera on into yet real quick

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.090 
the camera on into yet real quick
Masen<00:01:09.090> doesn't<00:01:09.330> look<00:01:09.420> terrible<00:01:09.979> and<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
Masen doesn't look terrible and the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.679 
Masen doesn't look terrible and the
track<00:01:11.400> doesn't<00:01:11.729> actually<00:01:11.820> look<00:01:12.090> too<00:01:12.240> bad<00:01:12.450> not

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
track doesn't actually look too bad not

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.840 
track doesn't actually look too bad not
that<00:01:12.750> I've<00:01:12.930> had<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.170> up<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.530> air<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.979> don't

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
that I've had it up in the air I don't

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.070 
that I've had it up in the air I don't
know<00:01:14.909> how<00:01:14.970> many<00:01:15.030> miles<00:01:15.330> are<00:01:15.570> on<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.900> believe

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
know how many miles are on I believe

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.570 
know how many miles are on I believe
it's<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> 500<00:01:16.710> CC<00:01:16.920> liquid-cooled<00:01:22.340> upside<00:01:23.340> down

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
it's a 500 CC liquid-cooled upside down

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.780 
it's a 500 CC liquid-cooled upside down
game<00:01:24.240> on

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
game on

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.569 
game on
thanks<00:01:26.790> whatever<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.450> says<00:01:27.659> four<00:01:28.549> hours<00:01:29.549> of

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
thanks whatever that says four hours of

sparkplug ratchet and a little bottle of

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.280 
sparkplug ratchet and a little bottle of
fuel<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:39.360> what<00:01:39.509> I'll<00:01:39.600> do<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.840> let's<00:01:39.990> put<00:01:40.170> my

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
fuel and what I'll do is let's put my

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.899 
fuel and what I'll do is let's put my
spark<00:01:40.590> plug<00:01:40.619> checker<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.220> there<00:01:41.369> first<00:01:41.640> and

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
spark plug checker on there first and

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.100 
spark plug checker on there first and
we'll<00:01:42.000> give<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.270> tug<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.750> we'll<00:01:42.840> see<00:01:43.020> if

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
we'll give it a tug and we'll see if

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.319 
we'll give it a tug and we'll see if
it's<00:01:43.200> got<00:01:43.320> any<00:01:43.380> spark<00:01:43.860> if<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.670> does<00:01:44.820> have<00:01:44.970> spark

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
it's got any spark if it does have spark

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.609 
it's got any spark if it does have spark
then<00:01:45.509> we'll<00:01:45.630> move<00:01:45.750> forward<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.170> try<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.380> dump<00:01:46.500> a

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
then we'll move forward to try to dump a

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.039 
then we'll move forward to try to dump a
little<00:01:46.710> bit<00:01:46.829> gas<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.399> see<00:01:47.610> if<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:48.049> does

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
little bit gas in it and see if it does

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.139 
little bit gas in it and see if it does
some<00:01:49.229> popping<00:01:49.560> noises<00:01:51.320> let<00:01:52.320> me<00:01:52.409> know<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.619> the

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
some popping noises let me know that the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.249 
some popping noises let me know that the
wealth<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.270> good<00:01:54.360> motor<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.780> work<00:01:54.810> with<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.200> to

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
wealth of good motor to work with so to

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.539 
wealth of good motor to work with so to
speak

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.840

it lights up salt light get tight there

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:57.720 
it lights up salt light get tight there
we<00:02:44.660> go

sputter<00:06:55.240> right<00:06:56.240> there<00:06:56.450> but<00:06:56.630> two<00:06:56.750> strokes

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:56.990

don't like yeah dumping gas down the
throat<00:07:00.020> like<00:07:00.170> a<00:07:00.230> four-stroke<00:07:00.860> does<00:07:01.990> so<00:07:02.990> I

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:04.810 
throat like a four-stroke does so I

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.920
