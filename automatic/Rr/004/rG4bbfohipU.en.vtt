 especially high paper properties and 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.749
 lies in the possibility of it 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:15.609
 sharing 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.559
 side mixes with almost all herbicides 

00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:20.129
 Cabinet of drugs and remedies 

00:00:20.129 --> 00:00:21.120
 of plants 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.739
 and mineral fertilizers 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:24.709
 it manifests itself synergistic 

00:00:24.709 --> 00:00:26.759
 action papers with these drugs 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.399
 this is because the molecules 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:29.430
 amino acids thousand 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.300
 characterized by the presence of 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.780
 functional groups such as carmack 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.350
 strong phenolic today these plans 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.320
 amine 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.910
 and it enables the papers then 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.590
 form silat adherence 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.890

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.390
 the formation of insoluble her 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.260
 elements being mastered by plants and

 continuous support connections 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.570
 fully digested plants 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.570
 and they are toxic

 paper consumption rate when used in 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.680
 shooting 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.680
 for presowing seed treatment 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.170
 bails feeding 500 millimeters per one

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.070
 with representatives of the family of Muhammad 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.650
 pathogen pressure increases 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.130
 microorganisms figuratively on

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.770
 mineral elements 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.480
 provide superior nutrition 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.560
 similar 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.180
 when using cyrillic valuable 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.130
 paper reduces and levels stress 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.640
 major crops are toxic 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.270
 exposure to herbicides that 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.460
 especially important when using 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.479
 complex side mix of several 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.939
 drugs aimed at getting hard 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.540
 complex deficiency 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.810
 judges entirely and also relieves stress 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.820
 iskander culture and in doing so enhances 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.220
 action of the fungicide due to the fact that the papers 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.009
 is good attractive 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:15.499
 when sharing with 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:16.979
 mineral fertilizer papers in 

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:19.059
 increases the effect of nutrient removal 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:21.329
 substances by plants from these fertilizers 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.259
 also reduces the leaching of stalin 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:24.609
 mineral fertilizers due to 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:27.609
 structuring their climate in the soil 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:30.189
 especially important to apply joint 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:32.119
 primates herbicides glyphosate medium 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:33.449
 discharged from 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:35.729
 at the same time there is an increase in destruction 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:37.939
 weeds with the acceleration of their budding 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:38.619
 by stimulating 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:40.769
 kidney microorganisms 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.919
 soil fertility also increases 1050

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:49.819
 after harvesting plowed straw with 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.459
 using the urges containing 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.749
 fertilizer traditionally 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:54.479
 used to execute balance 

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:56.469
 organic matter 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:58.459
 given agropriems count the more 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:59.629
 effective when sharing 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.809
 using paper and nitrogen containing 

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:03.579
 fertilizer with a decrease in the rate 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.269
 making the last two times that will allow 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.779
 save money and 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:09.759
 accelerate the process of decomposition of the cabin
