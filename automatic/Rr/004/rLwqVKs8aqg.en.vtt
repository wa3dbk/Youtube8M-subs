00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 I still have not seen any passage that 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.750
 sell in bolivars what one has to 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.780
 do in the conversion now you have 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.519
 said something very important there is no passage 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.500
 when there are no tickets because they have already 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.170
 bought everything will find you a quota in 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.029
 any airline from here to everything 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.460
 this year for any part of the world 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.810
 and he has to do magic because all 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.340
 the tickets are sold so there are 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.050
 an important purchasing power between 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.109
 the Venezuelans who can buy that 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.970
 Now I do what I say to travel 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.220
 the dollar that is the dollar 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.129
 what you have to buy through a 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.110
 auction or through the agencies of 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.199
 trips or that maneuver that has always been 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.090
 fact is not now as now what there is 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.710
 a big difference that the government of 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.260
 the fourth republic in recent years 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.660
 people did not travel and the planes were going 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.730
 totally empty now practically 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.980
 you have to fight to get a quota 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.510
 because they are totally full assembly 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.400
 national deputies thinking of doing some 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.199
 investigation to determine how by 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.019
 example after two weeks there is no 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:05.439
 dollars for good of course 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:07.900
 There is a situation that has been generating 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:10.030
 for everything that has happened over the years in 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.979
 this year and because of the low prices 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.630
 oil people who generate the currency 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.369
 for all Venezuelans in any 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.710
 part of the world they have an income that 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.530
 are the ones that allow in the currency but 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.330
 this is going to be regularized because 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.909
 course in a situation like that 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.890
 we were doing this opening in what 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.320
 which is the exchange market and for 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.439
 course it will lead to all the 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.080
 world go to it at the same time 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.970
 but the moment that especially the 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.720
 small begin to get their currencies 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.460
 they do not have what 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.170
 more that they are not industrial that are not 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.080
 entrepreneurs who are going to be 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.940
 there regularly buying currency that 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.100
 it's going to normalize and of course it's going to 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.210
 lower the dollar not to the dollar this body 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.010
 a net that you know is the one 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.170
 put the dollar there is still a bit of 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.640
 Venezuelan bobo and businessmen 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.110
 Venezuelans who go out to buy the dollar 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.960
 agree as they put it there when it 's 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.230
 a destabilization that I call the 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.240
 baptized from the foreign exchange market 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.160
 because if we really well 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.530
 that plays an important role 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.690
 fedecámarás said good not that can not 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.520
 be a reference of a man 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.180
 terrorist of a person who would temporarily 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.340
 from the same boss of the head of this channel 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.390
 like Mr. Ravel who puts the dollar 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.090
 finish the price you want 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.970
 so I go out a bit to say that is the 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.709
 price of the dollar for today is 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.660
 indicated an analysis of the point of view 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.160
 financial executed analysis from the 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.810
 economic point of view simply 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.840
 that come to that that has created a 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.540
 destabilization important because the 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.700
 most of those who buy the currencies 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.020
 precisely one sector of the opposition and 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.660
 they have registered there they have been 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.080
 truly the harmed ones I believe 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.890
 What is it 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.420
 we enter with a climate of normality 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.010
 We can acquire the confidence that is 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.170
 necessary to have a market 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.330
 truly stable exchange rate this 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.980
 year 2015 loving deputy is in the 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.810
 last year of the management of you I say 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.160
 for this period before the assembly 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.080
 national is going to make the election 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.880
 of parliament yesterday the president with 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.400
 the mature said it rains thunder or 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.190
 I flashed this year there will be elections 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.320
 to renew the national assembly and the 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.180
 cn approved dates for primaries both 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.690
 of the psoe as of the unit table 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.010
 democratic the table the days has the 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.460
 biggest unit is talking talked about 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.200
 primary in 38 be a ridiculous or a 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.790
 you lie what they are of the 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.070
 opposition have to realize that they 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.230
 they are making fun of you again 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.550
 us in the weight of the reduction 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.470
 let's go to primary in all the 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:37.240
 circuits there are you list like crazy 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.050
 not the list is something else the list 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.660
 it's a decision of the party but the 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:48.070
 circuits all go absolutely everything 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.310
 they're going to be the subject of a primary that's 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.440
 a serious party 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.599
 it's a match that truly 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.900
 speak clearly to his militancy now well 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.400
 you say that the opposition is going to 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.440
 accept this deception that is making you 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.080
 that table of days for ones and for 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.769
 others not what ridiculous is that is more 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.330
 ridiculous is to accept that situation 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.459
 irregular of the unit table that does not 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.010
 goes to primary speak to me about elementary school 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.780
 we do not talk to me about Primary 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.790
 opposition that is a farce is a 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.109
 lie deputies in a recent study 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.280
 of internal is the pollster 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.230
 Interclases talks about seven of each 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.570
 ten Venezuelans consider the country 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.550
 goes astray however there are 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.080
 sectors for example the pcv the 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.610
 president nicolás mature the president 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.070
 of parliament the deputy goddaughter 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.110
 hair they assure that the chavism goes to 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.450
 raze in the next election of 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.880
 renewal of the national parliament that 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.950
 he likes that there really are the votes 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.330
 for this is the popular intention for 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.650
 that the chavismo is done with a majority 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.800
 developing what we have 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.180
 Completely fulfilled in the assembly 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.760
 national we are responsible deputies 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.160
 we are deputies that we can present 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.200
 our credentials our assistance 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.520
 before the National Assembly and all 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.610
 debates we have been 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.919
 if parliament is measured of course 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.560
 as in all countries of the world and not 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.210
 it happens to an irregular situation that 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.520
 may have the country at this time 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.680
 conjunctural this I think we 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.860
 we have all the credentials that 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.050
 are going to participate in these processes 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.229
 Inmates returning to parliament 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.879
 national and of course the weight that is 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.289
 the united socialist party venezuela the 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:23.330
 Chávez's party has all that 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.919
 oiled machinery to earn this 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.750
 choice as we have won all the 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.909
 elections except one with the 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.530
 convenient president hugo chávez and with 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:32.210
 that legacy of casting because we have 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.889
 won after election we are not doing 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:38.169
 then until started loving deputy 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:38.169
 a brief commercial break to the king
