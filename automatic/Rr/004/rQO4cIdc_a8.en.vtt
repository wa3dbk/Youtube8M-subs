00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.690 
milk we're not going to worry about
technique<00:01:41.229> right<00:01:41.439> now<00:01:41.650> we're<00:01:42.310> going<00:01:42.400> to<00:01:42.490> steam

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
technique right now we're going to steam

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.520 
technique right now we're going to steam
them<00:01:42.820> out<00:01:42.970> and<00:01:43.270> I'm<00:01:43.540> going<00:01:43.750> to<00:01:43.780> shut<00:01:44.020> it<00:01:44.080> off<00:01:44.290> at

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
them out and I'm going to shut it off at

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.219 
them out and I'm going to shut it off at
a<00:01:44.619> point<00:01:44.860> where<00:01:45.640> I<00:01:45.670> know<00:01:45.909> that<00:01:46.150> it's<00:01:46.990> going<00:01:47.170> to

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
a point where I know that it's going to

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.260 
a point where I know that it's going to
stop<00:01:47.650> in<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.009> red<00:01:48.220> zone

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.160 

alright<00:01:52.270> so<00:01:52.509> I'm<00:01:52.600> going<00:01:52.750> to<00:01:52.780> do<00:01:52.869> is<00:01:52.960> I'm<00:01:53.140> going

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
alright so I'm going to do is I'm going

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.020 
alright so I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:01:53.470> get<00:01:53.619> up<00:01:53.740> to<00:01:53.950> about<00:01:54.070> 125<00:01:56.070> 130<00:01:57.070> degrees<00:01:57.430> right

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
to get up to about 125 130 degrees right

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.749 
to get up to about 125 130 degrees right
in<00:01:58.150> that<00:01:58.299> range<00:01:58.659> and<00:01:59.130> then<00:02:00.130> we<00:02:00.159> go<00:02:00.400> ahead<00:02:00.520> and

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
in that range and then we go ahead and

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.210 
in that range and then we go ahead and
stop<00:02:01.119> it<00:02:05.040> perfect

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
stop it perfect

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.370 
stop it perfect
now<00:02:06.490> what<00:02:07.180> I<00:02:07.210> did<00:02:07.479> is<00:02:07.630> I<00:02:07.810> stopped<00:02:08.140> the

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
now what I did is I stopped the

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.000 
now what I did is I stopped the
thermometer<00:02:09.009> at<00:02:09.220> about<00:02:09.640> 130<00:02:10.479> degrees

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
thermometer at about 130 degrees

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.930 
thermometer at about 130 degrees
realizing<00:02:12.010> that<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.280> temperature<00:02:12.790> is<00:02:12.850> still

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
realizing that the temperature is still

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.880 
realizing that the temperature is still
going<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.269> rise<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.840> doesn't<00:02:14.170> keep<00:02:14.290> rising<00:02:14.590> a

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
going to rise it doesn't keep rising a

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.500 
going to rise it doesn't keep rising a
lot<00:02:15.100> of<00:02:15.220> degrees<00:02:15.340> but<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.760> just<00:02:16.060> have<00:02:16.269> to<00:02:16.390> be

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
lot of degrees but you just have to be

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.789 
lot of degrees but you just have to be
aware<00:02:16.750> of<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:17.019> I<00:02:17.079> think<00:02:17.140> that's<00:02:17.470> one<00:02:17.680> mistake

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
aware of it I think that's one mistake

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.069 
aware of it I think that's one mistake
people<00:02:18.040> make<00:02:18.340> with<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.760> thermometers<00:02:19.329> if<00:02:19.600> you

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.079 
people make with the thermometers if you

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.949 
people make with the thermometers if you
shut<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.320> off<00:02:20.560> at<00:02:20.769> 155<00:02:21.579> 160<00:02:22.299> what<00:02:22.450> happens<00:02:22.810> your

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:23.850 
shut it off at 155 160 what happens your
mouth<00:02:23.109> is<00:02:23.290> going<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.500> be<00:02:23.590> real

mouth is going to be real

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.400 
mouth is going to be real
-<00:02:24.070> hot<00:02:24.340> so<00:02:25.150> you're<00:02:25.270> going<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.420> scald<00:02:25.780> it<00:02:25.960> the

circulating<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.820> right<00:02:52.000> way<00:02:52.150> so<00:02:52.180> you<00:02:52.450> don't

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
circulating the right way so you don't

want it spilling over the tops it makes

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.160 
want it spilling over the tops it makes
a<00:02:54.040> heck<00:02:54.190> of<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.400> mess<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:55.240> second<00:02:55.660> thing<00:02:55.810> is<00:02:55.990> the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
a heck of a mess the second thing is the

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.360 
a heck of a mess the second thing is the
milk<00:02:56.350> is<00:02:56.500> going<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.680> crease<00:02:56.950> in<00:02:57.130> Vine

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
milk is going to crease in Vine

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.980 
milk is going to crease in Vine
particularly<00:02:57.970> for<00:02:58.120> steaming<00:02:58.390> cappuccino

bubbles<00:05:28.270> certainly<00:05:29.140> not<00:05:29.320> microphone<00:05:29.980> and<00:05:30.670> the

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
bubbles certainly not microphone and the

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.060 
bubbles certainly not microphone and the
other<00:05:31.210> thing<00:05:31.540> is<00:05:31.690> the<00:05:31.870> melts<00:05:32.140> not<00:05:32.320> circulating

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070

properly<00:05:33.480> I'm<00:05:34.480> so<00:05:34.810> tempted<00:05:35.050> to<00:05:35.290> go<00:05:35.410> down<00:05:35.590> and

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
properly I'm so tempted to go down and

properly I'm so tempted to go down and
fix<00:05:35.950> it<00:05:36.190> but<00:05:36.340> I<00:05:36.370> won't<00:05:36.640> okay<00:05:37.410> there<00:05:38.410> so<00:05:41.010> if<00:05:42.010> your

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110
