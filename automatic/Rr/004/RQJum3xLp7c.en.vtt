00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.280
 uai 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.099
 guys there I think you have always +1 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.560
 million audience commented and one more video 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.480
 about taiwan hungry just forgot about today 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.240
 The channel has already released a video about the game. 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.550
 first live game play yes give a 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.199
 on the channel and in that second video 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.380
 I want to talk to you about a weapon. 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.390
 in the game specific a pistol to 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.009
 be more exact and I think you should 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.540
 have heard of it in some 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.800
 other videos or suddenly in forums 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.809
 out there because it has been very successful 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.280
 the smart piston that pistol 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.170
 they simply have the chance to 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.210
 so she was aiming at the head of his 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.789
 opponent you only have the job of 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.340
 shoot are watching some 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.960
 gameplay background I captured in the beta of 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.690
 brain or playing on the pc 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.039
 Okay, and I want to make a video to talk. 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.600
 a little more about it because the 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.239
 first impression so she is 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.460
 extremely over power but there are some 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.719
 balances that balance it at least one 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.640
 not sure 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.010
 How do you guys know how to dance? 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.490
 titans the paralamas who are the players 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.330
 nor the humans and the big ones in the 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.369
 boys the big ones are the boys are 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.409
 boxes then controlled by intelligence 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.080
 artificial and not real teachers 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.939
 it does not happen they are much easier 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.640
 kill then we'll see paranÃ¡ gameplay 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.130
 that every time they block in one of them 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.020
 is that my gun there it hangs on the head 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.060
 of one of the big boys 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.880
 killed him with a shot, only one shot is 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.530
 always in her head always give the boat 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.979
 in the head itself is not simply 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.439
 hit the head shot and continue killing 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.180
 have in common are players on the stump 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.479
 more shots are more or less three or 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.280
 four shots and the loc to lock the 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.229
 your opponent takes a little longer is 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.820
 something good around I do not know the time 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.560
 should be something around two or 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.360
 three seconds but it makes a difference 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.280
 It's incredible because that time the guy is going 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.049
 shoot you and you can die 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.329
 so it is extremely effective 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.369
 against the minions that give much less 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.560
 point when you kill but she also 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.270
 can be useful against players as a 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.800
 two parents 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.030
 It only takes a lot more expensive store 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.010
 so then she is good she 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.580
 very strong if you go to see the skill 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.260
 Her special but it's to kill players. 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.360
 You're still better off with the 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.280
 anger or smoking assault more common than 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.260
 you will have more advantage because until 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.560
 you the loc to your enemy you hit 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.010
 In front of him are you going to die in 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.690
 Another thing is an ok from her has a range 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.340
 so if you are far away she 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.630
 will not store it will not catch 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.390
 media on your enemy you have to have 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.550
 a considerable proximity there to 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.319
 this lot does not have to be so 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.810
 close so you have why maps of the 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.370
 of the title false big mean they are well 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.140
 open a lot because of the titles 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.810
 space for movement 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.120
 So it's not that close so it's not a 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.560
 cloud thing surrenders total more from afar 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.150
 where a top from one building to another 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.140
 building you will hardly be able to 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.030
 make the shot is the local gun on the head 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.650
 of the opponent but any form it has 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.510
 considerable index and it works very 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.489
 against the miners already against the 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.790
 players is a bit more complicated then 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.580
 it is basically a weapon that works 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.320
 It's for those who like to put many 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.820
 enemies because if you are 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.640
 different concluded common word that you 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.900
 You will get screwed because he will die he 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.950
 It will kill you before you get 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.510
 locate it 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.489
 so if you can get the payments 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.620
 by the side then you will be able to 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.570
 kill with certain ease but if you 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.489
 had a common weapon and also 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.260
 would be with some ease then not 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.790
 I know how advantageous you are. 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.890
 using root more difficult suddenly 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.600
 For more rookie guys in the game and only for 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.850
 that it is a primary weapon 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.799
 so if you select the next class 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.739
 with it is one of the three available places 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:50.260
 in beta you give up having a weapon 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.359
 primary an assault area ie you 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.709
 gets two pistols in case it the 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.799
 smart what your primary and a 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.390
 pistol as a secondary weapon then 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.940
 this is basically how it works. 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.620
 nice also the one that gives bonuses of 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.170
 headshot is because she always kills with 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.760
 head shot a shot gives a rubbish bonus then 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.980
 you will you will be has always been the 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.690
 faster and finally a relationship 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.310
 interesting quite different from everything 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.569
 that we have already seen 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.250
 he is bringing a video to explain 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.959
 It's better for you, it's just basically this. 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.730
 I hope you will like this video if 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.560
 Did you not forget to leave your 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.690
 limit and if your favorite is 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.730
 on the channel whom many have visited listening 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:30.540
 I'm going to stay here a hug to 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.540
 everybody stay with god and it's even more
