okay<00:00:01.079> so<00:00:01.140> today<00:00:01.500> we'll<00:00:01.650> be<00:00:01.740> unboxing<00:00:01.770> the

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
okay so today we'll be unboxing the

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.809 
okay so today we'll be unboxing the
Arctic<00:00:03.000> cooling<00:00:03.330> freezer<00:00:03.629> 7<00:00:04.170> pro<00:00:04.500> Rev<00:00:05.190> -<00:00:05.549> so

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
Arctic cooling freezer 7 pro Rev - so

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.089 
Arctic cooling freezer 7 pro Rev - so
what<00:00:06.000> does<00:00:06.120> Rev<00:00:06.390> 2<00:00:06.690> mean<00:00:06.899> well<00:00:07.170> for<00:00:07.770> one<00:00:07.890> thing

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
what does Rev 2 mean well for one thing

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.580 
what does Rev 2 mean well for one thing
it's<00:00:08.250> got<00:00:08.400> a<00:00:08.429> black<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:08.910> white<00:00:09.030> fan<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:09.780> for

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
it's got a black and white fan and for

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.049 
it's got a black and white fan and for
another<00:00:10.800> thing<00:00:11.070> it<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.429> compatible<00:00:11.790> with

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
another thing it is compatible with

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.650 
another thing it is compatible with
Intel<00:00:12.660> LGA<00:00:13.219> 1156<00:00:14.219> so<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.179> means<00:00:15.420> we've<00:00:15.630> got

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
Intel LGA 1156 so that means we've got

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.019 
Intel LGA 1156 so that means we've got
support<00:00:16.049> for<00:00:16.500> all<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.710> latest<00:00:16.920> Core<00:00:17.250> i5<00:00:17.430> and

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
support for all the latest Core i5 and

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.160 
support for all the latest Core i5 and
core<00:00:18.060> i7<00:00:18.949> processors<00:00:19.949> on<00:00:20.189> LGA<00:00:20.939> 1156<00:00:21.539> now<00:00:21.930> I

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
core i7 processors on LGA 1156 now I

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.540 
core i7 processors on LGA 1156 now I
like<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.470> way<00:00:22.560> they've<00:00:22.740> done<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:23.070> packaging

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
like the way they've done this packaging

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.000 
like the way they've done this packaging
it's<00:00:23.699> like<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.880> little<00:00:24.380> Darth<00:00:25.380> Vader<00:00:25.680> mask

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
it's like a little Darth Vader mask

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.859 
it's like a little Darth Vader mask
style<00:00:26.640> thing<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.180> want<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.359> click<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.660> from

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
style thing you want to click it from

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.529 
style thing you want to click it from
the<00:00:27.990> back<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.410> then<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.220> can<00:00:29.490> pull<00:00:29.760> out<00:00:29.789> the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
the back and then you can pull out the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.650 
the back and then you can pull out the
actual<00:00:30.900> heatsink<00:00:31.529> itself<00:00:32.279> if<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.730> can<00:00:33.180> get<00:00:33.510> it

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
actual heatsink itself if you can get it

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.810 
actual heatsink itself if you can get it
out<00:00:33.780> there<00:00:34.170> we<00:00:34.260> go<00:00:34.410> ok<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.309> let's<00:00:35.489> have<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.670> look

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
out there we go ok so let's have a look

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.700 
out there we go ok so let's have a look
at<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.030> heatsink<00:00:36.450> itself<00:00:36.989> first<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.500> there's

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
at the heatsink itself first so there's

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.380 
at the heatsink itself first so there's
a<00:00:37.770> bunch<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:38.100> accessories<00:00:38.399> falling<00:00:39.059> out<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.210> it

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
a bunch of accessories falling out of it

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.560 
a bunch of accessories falling out of it
so<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.920> three<00:00:41.340> heat<00:00:41.700> pipe<00:00:41.910> design<00:00:42.180> and

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
so this is a three heat pipe design and

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.930 
so this is a three heat pipe design and
they're<00:00:42.930> all<00:00:43.079> bent<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.620> u<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:44.309> can<00:00:44.520> see<00:00:44.730> that

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
they're all bent in a u you can see that

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.880 
they're all bent in a u you can see that
the<00:00:45.149> 80<00:00:45.329> millimeter<00:00:45.809> fan<00:00:46.079> blows<00:00:46.440> air<00:00:46.620> through

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the 80 millimeter fan blows air through

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.229 
the 80 millimeter fan blows air through
the<00:00:47.010> fins<00:00:47.219> I'm<00:00:47.460> actually<00:00:47.579> going<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.879> turn<00:00:48.120> it

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
the fins I'm actually going to turn it

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.580 
the fins I'm actually going to turn it
around<00:00:48.300> for<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.750> cameraman<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.260> have<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> look

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
around for the cameraman to have a look

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.740 
around for the cameraman to have a look
at<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.800> back<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.730> heat<00:00:50.879> pipes<00:00:51.120> carry<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
at the back so the heat pipes carry the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.080 
at the back so the heat pipes carry the
heat<00:00:51.899> away<00:00:52.079> from<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.500> CPU<00:00:52.829> itself<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.460> up

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
heat away from the CPU itself and up

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.119 
heat away from the CPU itself and up
through<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.360> fins<00:00:54.629> now<00:00:54.899> then<00:00:55.140> on<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.980> bottom

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
through the fins now then on the bottom

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.889 
through the fins now then on the bottom
you<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.579> see<00:00:56.730> we've<00:00:56.879> actually<00:00:57.000> got<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> very

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
you can see we've actually got a very

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.920 
you can see we've actually got a very
very<00:00:58.410> small<00:00:58.800> contact<00:00:59.460> area<00:00:59.820> now<00:01:00.059> what<00:01:00.780> this

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
very small contact area now what this

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.969 
very small contact area now what this
means<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.559> guess<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:03.320> cost<00:01:04.320> reduction<00:01:04.559> for

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
means is I guess a cost reduction for

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.530 
means is I guess a cost reduction for
Arctic<00:01:05.159> cooling<00:01:05.640> but<00:01:05.820> B<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.210> means<00:01:06.330> you're

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
Arctic cooling but B it means you're

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.840 
Arctic cooling but B it means you're
focusing<00:01:07.110> all<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.380> your<00:01:07.500> cooling<00:01:07.890> right<00:01:08.490> where

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
focusing all of your cooling right where

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.700 
focusing all of your cooling right where
the<00:01:09.150> actual<00:01:09.420> heat<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.810> being<00:01:09.960> produced<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
the actual heat is being produced on the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.770 
the actual heat is being produced on the
CPU<00:01:11.130> die<00:01:11.340> now<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.939> way<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.270> mounting<00:01:12.630> system

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
CPU die now the way the mounting system

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.270 
CPU die now the way the mounting system
works<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.530> see<00:01:13.680> we've<00:01:13.860> got<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.040> couple

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
works you can see we've got a couple

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.520 
works you can see we've got a couple
different<00:01:14.520> mounting<00:01:15.000> systems<00:01:15.330> here<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:16.020> AMD

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
different mounting systems here the AMD

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.520 
different mounting systems here the AMD
one<00:01:16.770> uses<00:01:17.549> two<00:01:17.790> screws<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.450> two<00:01:19.080> little<00:01:19.350> clips

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
one uses two screws and two little clips

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.219

motherboards now for Intel you can see

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.550 
motherboards now for Intel you can see
we've<00:01:32.820> actually<00:01:33.000> got<00:01:33.450> I'm<00:01:33.780> just<00:01:34.259> going<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.409> put

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
we've actually got I'm just going to put

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.580 
we've actually got I'm just going to put
this<00:01:34.680> down<00:01:34.920> for<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.189> minute<00:01:35.280> we've<00:01:35.939> got<00:01:36.210> a

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
this down for a minute we've got a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.289 
this down for a minute we've got a
bracket<00:01:37.590> here<00:01:37.890> that's<00:01:38.100> compatible<00:01:38.549> with<00:01:38.790> LGA

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
bracket here that's compatible with LGA

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.780 
bracket here that's compatible with LGA
775<00:01:40.790> 1156<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.710> 1366<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.250> then<00:01:44.430> we've<00:01:44.579> got<00:01:44.759> a
