all of this so set the egg mixture to

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.330 
all of this so set the egg mixture to
aside<00:02:44.560> for<00:02:44.890> later<00:02:44.920> on<00:02:46.110> at<00:02:47.110> this<00:02:47.380> point<00:02:47.739> to<00:02:48.190> go

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
aside for later on at this point to go

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
you get to that texture you really don't

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.170 
you get to that texture you really don't
need<00:02:55.720> any<00:02:55.989> more<00:02:56.110> liquid<00:02:56.500> so<00:02:56.980> set<00:02:57.910> that<00:02:57.940> aside
