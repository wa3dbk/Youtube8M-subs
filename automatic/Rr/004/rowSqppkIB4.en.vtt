cameras it's very important that you use
a<00:00:05.850> good<00:00:06.210> lens<00:00:06.480> and<00:00:06.839> whatever<00:00:07.620> lens<00:00:08.069> you<00:00:08.309> use

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.640 
a good lens and whatever lens you use
make<00:00:09.000> sure<00:00:09.300> you're<00:00:09.660> using<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:10.080> optimum

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
make sure you're using the optimum

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
make sure you're using the optimum

several<00:00:15.089> things<00:00:15.500> the<00:00:16.500> most<00:00:16.650> obvious<00:00:17.220> is

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
several things the most obvious is

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.170 
several things the most obvious is
exposure<00:00:18.090> if<00:00:18.710> you<00:00:19.710> open<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.250> iris<00:00:20.430> too<00:00:20.910> wide

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
exposure if you open the iris too wide

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.870

and<00:00:21.570> let<00:00:21.990> too<00:00:22.230> much<00:00:22.410> light<00:00:22.680> in<00:00:22.730> then<00:00:23.730> you'll

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
and let too much light in then you'll

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.420 
and let too much light in then you'll
overload<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.630> image<00:00:24.930> sensors<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.680> end<00:00:26.220> up

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
overload the image sensors and end up

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.870 
overload the image sensors and end up
with<00:00:26.699> an<00:00:26.820> overexposed<00:00:27.720> image<00:00:28.550> close<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.730> iris

down<00:00:30.269> too<00:00:30.599> far<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.289> you'll<00:00:31.920> have<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> dark
