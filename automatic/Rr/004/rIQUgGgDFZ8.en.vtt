who wants to go anywhere else I mean

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.009 
who wants to go anywhere else I mean
this<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:01.550> better<00:01:02.550> than<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:02.940> building<00:01:03.750> a

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
this is it better than this building a

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.899 
this is it better than this building a
natural<00:01:04.439> stone<00:01:04.710> waterfall<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.580> fairly

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
natural stone waterfall is fairly

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.359 
natural stone waterfall is fairly
straightforward<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.470> does<00:01:07.799> require<00:01:08.220> a

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
straightforward but it does require a

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.570 
straightforward but it does require a
strong<00:01:08.970> back<00:01:09.409> our<00:01:10.409> first<00:01:10.799> step<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.280> define

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
strong back our first step is to define

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.880 
strong back our first step is to define
the<00:01:11.820> perimeter<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.720> pond<00:01:12.990> using<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.530> stick

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
the perimeter of the pond using a stick

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.030 
the perimeter of the pond using a stick
to<00:01:14.130> trace<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.580> outline<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.390> dirt<00:01:16.040> then

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
to trace the outline in the dirt then

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.920 
to trace the outline in the dirt then
we'll<00:01:17.280> plan<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.729> contours<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.630> height<00:01:18.900> of

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
we'll plan the contours and height of

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.780 
we'll plan the contours and height of
the<00:01:19.110> stone<00:01:19.439> wall<00:01:19.710> which<00:01:20.159> will<00:01:20.340> be<00:01:20.490> stacked

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
the stone wall which will be stacked

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.539 
the stone wall which will be stacked
right<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.360> front<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> existing<00:01:22.560> wall<00:01:22.799> tape

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
right in front of the existing wall tape

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.789 
right in front of the existing wall tape
works<00:01:23.909> best<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.509> experiment<00:01:25.259> with<00:01:25.380> various

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
works best to experiment with various

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.010 
works best to experiment with various
Heights<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.520> you've<00:01:26.939> drawn<00:01:27.270> your<00:01:27.420> outline<00:01:27.869> in

just<00:03:36.330> take<00:03:36.630> it<00:03:36.780> out<00:03:36.900> of<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.080> other<00:03:37.410> wilderness

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
just take it out of the other wilderness

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.310 
just take it out of the other wilderness
but<00:03:38.640> we've<00:03:38.940> laid<00:03:39.180> all<00:03:39.450> of<00:03:39.600> these<00:03:39.720> rocks<00:03:40.050> out

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
but we've laid all of these rocks out

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.350 
but we've laid all of these rocks out
here<00:03:40.350> like<00:03:40.739> we<00:03:40.920> have<00:03:41.190> because<00:03:41.760> we<00:03:41.880> want<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.239> get

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
here like we have because we want to get

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.810 
here like we have because we want to get
a<00:03:42.390> good<00:03:42.630> look<00:03:42.930> at<00:03:43.110> each<00:03:43.320> one<00:03:43.739> we're<00:03:44.610> going<00:03:44.760> to

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
a good look at each one we're going to

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.180 
a good look at each one we're going to
have<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.090> select<00:03:45.300> these<00:03:45.690> individually<00:03:46.620> one<00:03:46.980> by

is going to go picking the rocks is a
little<00:03:53.430> bit<00:03:53.610> like<00:03:53.820> piecing<00:03:54.390> together<00:03:54.540> a

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
little bit like piecing together a

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.410 
little bit like piecing together a
puzzle<00:03:55.170> you<00:03:55.620> look<00:03:56.130> for<00:03:56.370> stones<00:03:56.640> with<00:03:56.970> similar

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
puzzle you look for stones with similar

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.600 
puzzle you look for stones with similar
width<00:03:57.720> and<00:03:58.020> thickness<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:58.739> edges<00:03:59.190> that<00:03:59.370> will

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
width and thickness and edges that will

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.850 
width and thickness and edges that will
fit<00:03:59.910> well<00:04:00.150> together<00:04:00.390> oh<00:04:00.810> this<00:04:01.470> is<00:04:01.620> I<00:04:01.739> thought

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
fit well together oh this is I thought

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.699 
fit well together oh this is I thought
the<00:04:02.010> Dean<00:04:02.190> was<00:04:02.370> gonna<00:04:02.550> know<00:04:03.540> I<00:04:03.570> knew<00:04:04.019> this

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
the Dean was gonna know I knew this

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:11.860 
the Dean was gonna know I knew this
number<00:04:06.709> one<00:04:06.920> that<00:04:07.610> would<00:04:07.730> work<00:04:10.569> you<00:04:11.569> did<00:04:11.750> all

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
number one that would work you did all

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.360 
number one that would work you did all
the<00:04:12.019> digging<00:04:12.260> we'll<00:04:12.620> do<00:04:12.739> all<00:04:12.890> the<00:04:13.010> right<00:04:13.190> carry

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
the digging we'll do all the right carry

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.830 
the digging we'll do all the right carry
because<00:04:16.370> these<00:04:16.609> rocks<00:04:16.910> are<00:04:17.180> not<00:04:17.209> perfectly

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
because these rocks are not perfectly

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.830 
because these rocks are not perfectly
flat<00:04:17.959> we<00:04:18.859> sometimes<00:04:19.160> need<00:04:19.699> to<00:04:19.820> use<00:04:20.000> a<00:04:20.030> shim<00:04:20.570> to

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
flat we sometimes need to use a shim to

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.870 
flat we sometimes need to use a shim to
level<00:04:21.139> them<00:04:21.290> the<00:04:21.829> shims<00:04:22.160> are<00:04:22.400> just<00:04:22.610> thin

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
level them the shims are just thin

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.030 
level them the shims are just thin
pieces<00:04:23.210> of<00:04:23.389> rock<00:04:23.720> that<00:04:23.750> we<00:04:24.139> insert<00:04:24.650> under<00:04:24.919> a

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
pieces of rock that we insert under a

behind<00:04:31.010> the<00:04:31.220> stones<00:04:31.580> to<00:04:32.030> what<00:04:32.240> will

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
behind the stones to what will

behind the stones to what will
eventually<00:04:32.690> be<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.530> top<00:04:33.919> of<00:04:34.160> the<00:04:34.250> waterfall<00:04:34.580> a

well<00:04:43.280> we've<00:04:43.430> take<00:04:43.639> a<00:04:43.669> little<00:04:43.880> break<00:04:44.180> here<00:04:44.210> to

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
well we've take a little break here to

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.629 
well we've take a little break here to
kind<00:04:44.750> of<00:04:44.810> check<00:04:45.080> our<00:04:45.289> progress<00:04:45.590> and<00:04:46.190> this<00:04:46.490> is<00:04:46.610> a

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
kind of check our progress and this is a

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.159 
kind of check our progress and this is a
good<00:04:46.910> time<00:04:47.120> to<00:04:47.300> point<00:04:47.479> out<00:04:47.690> some<00:04:47.990> of<00:04:48.020> the

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
good time to point out some of the

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:49.659 
good time to point out some of the
things<00:04:48.380> that<00:04:48.470> we've<00:04:48.710> done<00:04:48.919> that<00:04:49.130> may<00:04:49.400> not<00:04:49.610> be

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
things that we've done that may not be

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.000 
things that we've done that may not be
obvious<00:04:50.120> we've<00:04:50.990> tried<00:04:51.289> to<00:04:51.320> keep<00:04:51.620> the<00:04:51.800> wall

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
obvious we've tried to keep the wall

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.920 
obvious we've tried to keep the wall
level<00:04:52.490> from<00:04:52.729> left<00:04:53.000> to<00:04:53.090> right<00:04:53.360> but<00:04:53.780> we've

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
level from left to right but we've

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.020 
level from left to right but we've
actually<00:04:54.139> put<00:04:54.590> a<00:04:54.620> slight<00:04:54.949> tilt<00:04:55.310> from<00:04:55.729> back<00:04:56.000> to

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
actually put a slight tilt from back to

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.390 
actually put a slight tilt from back to
front<00:04:56.479> and<00:04:56.870> that's<00:04:57.500> because<00:04:57.949> I<00:04:58.070> want<00:04:58.220> the

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
front and that's because I want the

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.980 
front and that's because I want the
water<00:04:58.550> to<00:04:58.729> run<00:04:58.880> off<00:04:58.940> the<00:04:59.150> front<00:04:59.600> edge<00:04:59.750> of<00:04:59.870> these

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
water to run off the front edge of these

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.110 
water to run off the front edge of these
rocks<00:05:00.320> onto<00:05:00.650> the<00:05:00.949> next<00:05:01.190> one<00:05:01.310> and<00:05:01.550> eventually

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
rocks onto the next one and eventually

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.450 
rocks onto the next one and eventually
into<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:02.389> pond<00:05:02.660> and<00:05:03.020> one<00:05:03.680> other<00:05:03.800> thing<00:05:04.100> where

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
into the pond and one other thing where

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.490 
into the pond and one other thing where
possible<00:05:05.180> we've<00:05:05.389> tried<00:05:05.690> to<00:05:05.870> stagger<00:05:06.350> the

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
possible we've tried to stagger the

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.560 
possible we've tried to stagger the
joints<00:05:06.530> like<00:05:07.039> right<00:05:07.250> here<00:05:07.520> on<00:05:07.669> top<00:05:08.300> of<00:05:08.479> this

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
joints like right here on top of this

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.600 
joints like right here on top of this
joint<00:05:08.840> we've<00:05:09.050> got<00:05:09.229> a<00:05:09.260> full<00:05:09.620> rock<00:05:09.919> now<00:05:10.550> we

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
joint we've got a full rock now we

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.580 
joint we've got a full rock now we
haven't<00:05:11.150> been<00:05:11.210> able<00:05:11.360> to<00:05:11.510> do<00:05:11.750> that<00:05:11.930> everyplace

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
haven't been able to do that everyplace

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.440 
haven't been able to do that everyplace
and<00:05:12.800> I<00:05:12.830> wouldn't<00:05:13.160> want<00:05:13.460> to<00:05:13.550> do<00:05:13.700> it<00:05:13.729> every<00:05:14.060> place

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
and I wouldn't want to do it every place

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:15.760 
and I wouldn't want to do it every place
because<00:05:14.810> they<00:05:14.900> don't<00:05:15.080> want<00:05:15.260> the<00:05:15.410> wall<00:05:15.560> to<00:05:15.650> look

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
because they don't want the wall to look
