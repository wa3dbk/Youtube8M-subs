00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
the topic of teaching a young horse to

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.300 
the topic of teaching a young horse to
move<00:00:20.210> their<00:00:20.449> haunches<00:00:20.840> and<00:00:21.260> to<00:00:21.920> move<00:00:22.100> their

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
move their haunches and to move their

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.880 
move their haunches and to move their
shoulders<00:00:22.520> so<00:00:23.360> this<00:00:24.050> is<00:00:24.230> a<00:00:24.260> question<00:00:24.710> that<00:00:24.740> I

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
shoulders so this is a question that I

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.550 
shoulders so this is a question that I
actually<00:00:25.310> get<00:00:25.490> pretty<00:00:25.640> frequently<00:00:26.210> is<00:00:26.500> how<00:00:27.500> to

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
actually get pretty frequently is how to

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.460 
actually get pretty frequently is how to
start<00:00:28.490> these<00:00:28.640> movements<00:00:29.210> and<00:00:29.360> start<00:00:30.289> them

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
start these movements and start them

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.900 
start these movements and start them
with<00:00:30.500> a<00:00:30.650> horse<00:00:30.950> that<00:00:31.190> doesn't<00:00:31.400> really<00:00:31.730> know

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
with a horse that doesn't really know

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.970 
with a horse that doesn't really know
them<00:00:32.119> so<00:00:32.570> I<00:00:32.599> thought<00:00:32.840> that<00:00:33.079> laddie<00:00:33.289> would<00:00:33.829> be<00:00:33.949> a

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
them so I thought that laddie would be a

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.040 
them so I thought that laddie would be a
good<00:00:34.219> one<00:00:34.399> to<00:00:34.730> help<00:00:35.149> me<00:00:35.239> do<00:00:35.360> this<00:00:35.480> video<00:00:35.750> for

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
good one to help me do this video for

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.380 
good one to help me do this video for
you<00:00:36.170> so<00:00:36.400> usually<00:00:37.400> what<00:00:37.579> I<00:00:37.610> start<00:00:38.000> with<00:00:38.060> is

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
you so usually what I start with is

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.840 
you so usually what I start with is
moving<00:00:39.140> the<00:00:39.350> hindquarters<00:00:39.950> that<00:00:40.370> just<00:00:40.640> tends

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
moving the hindquarters that just tends

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.670 
moving the hindquarters that just tends
to<00:00:40.970> be<00:00:41.060> the<00:00:41.239> easiest<00:00:41.690> to<00:00:41.989> get<00:00:42.110> the<00:00:42.260> horse<00:00:42.440> to

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
to be the easiest to get the horse to

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.680 
to be the easiest to get the horse to
move<00:00:42.710> and<00:00:43.570> the<00:00:44.570> idea<00:00:44.930> behind<00:00:45.760> this<00:00:46.760> behind

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
move and the idea behind this behind

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.600 
move and the idea behind this behind
training<00:00:48.140> this<00:00:48.290> and<00:00:48.590> really<00:00:48.860> behind<00:00:49.220> a<00:00:49.399> lot<00:00:49.579> of

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
training this and really behind a lot of

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.210 
training this and really behind a lot of
the<00:00:49.790> things<00:00:50.030> that<00:00:50.149> we<00:00:50.510> train<00:00:50.840> is<00:00:51.800> that<00:00:51.950> we<00:00:52.040> want

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
the things that we train is that we want

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.400 
the things that we train is that we want
to<00:00:52.280> find<00:00:52.460> a<00:00:52.670> way<00:00:52.790> to<00:00:52.820> set<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.329> horse<00:00:53.510> up<00:00:53.750> that

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
to find a way to set the horse up that

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.069 
to find a way to set the horse up that
they're<00:00:55.160> going<00:00:55.489> to<00:00:55.760> offer<00:00:56.149> the<00:00:56.780> correct

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
they're going to offer the correct

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.799 
they're going to offer the correct
response<00:00:57.399> most<00:00:58.399> easily<00:00:58.790> and<00:00:59.270> then<00:00:59.660> of<00:00:59.780> course

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
response most easily and then of course

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.450 
response most easily and then of course
we're<00:01:00.200> going<00:01:00.320> to<00:01:00.380> release<00:01:00.770> whatever<00:01:01.130> pressure

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
we're going to release whatever pressure

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.670 
we're going to release whatever pressure
we're<00:01:01.850> using<00:01:02.090> when<00:01:03.050> they<00:01:03.170> do<00:01:03.230> offer<00:01:03.530> that

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
we're using when they do offer that

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.560 
we're using when they do offer that
correct<00:01:04.309> response<00:01:04.729> then<00:01:05.030> we<00:01:05.149> could<00:01:05.299> also<00:01:05.420> use

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
correct response then we could also use

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.469 
correct response then we could also use
a<00:01:05.750> reward<00:01:06.259> or<00:01:06.530> in<00:01:06.890> this<00:01:07.340> case<00:01:07.610> today<00:01:07.850> I'm<00:01:08.270> just

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
a reward or in this case today I'm just

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.599 
a reward or in this case today I'm just
going<00:01:08.689> to<00:01:08.780> praise<00:01:09.439> laddie<00:01:09.709> and<00:01:10.039> release<00:01:10.459> the

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:10.609 
going to praise laddie and release the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:12.099 
going to praise laddie and release the
pressure<00:01:10.789> of<00:01:11.030> my<00:01:11.149> leg<00:01:11.389> when<00:01:11.659> he<00:01:11.689> does<00:01:11.929> the

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:12.109 
pressure of my leg when he does the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:15.520 
pressure of my leg when he does the
correct<00:01:12.380> movement<00:01:12.950> I<00:01:13.329> also<00:01:14.329> like<00:01:14.689> to<00:01:14.719> use<00:01:15.170> the

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
correct movement I also like to use the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.679 
correct movement I also like to use the
fence<00:01:15.770> line<00:01:16.039> because<00:01:16.549> what<00:01:16.789> that<00:01:16.819> does<00:01:16.999> is<00:01:17.539> it

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
fence line because what that does is it

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.480 
fence line because what that does is it
just<00:01:17.719> helps<00:01:18.109> set<00:01:18.499> him<00:01:18.649> up<00:01:18.770> a<00:01:18.920> little<00:01:19.069> bit<00:01:19.280> more

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
just helps set him up a little bit more

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.090 
just helps set him up a little bit more
to<00:01:20.149> give<00:01:20.600> me<00:01:20.779> the<00:01:20.929> correct<00:01:21.139> response<00:01:21.469> sooner

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
to give me the correct response sooner

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.550 
to give me the correct response sooner
by<00:01:22.579> kind<00:01:22.819> of<00:01:22.880> taking<00:01:22.939> out<00:01:23.479> one<00:01:23.959> option<00:01:24.439> of

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
by kind of taking out one option of

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.410 
by kind of taking out one option of
movement<00:01:24.979> so<00:01:25.159> this<00:01:25.549> can<00:01:25.759> be<00:01:25.850> a<00:01:25.880> little<00:01:26.149> bit

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
movement so this can be a little bit

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.760 
movement so this can be a little bit
more<00:01:26.539> difficult<00:01:27.079> just<00:01:27.289> starting<00:01:27.649> out

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
more difficult just starting out

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.340 
more difficult just starting out
sometimes<00:01:28.310> into<00:01:28.609> open<00:01:28.939> because<00:01:29.840> they've<00:01:30.170> got

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
sometimes into open because they've got

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.879 
sometimes into open because they've got
a<00:01:30.380> few<00:01:30.649> more<00:01:30.859> options<00:01:31.399> for<00:01:32.170> movement<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:33.619> for

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:33.889 
a few more options for movement and for

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:35.980 
a few more options for movement and for
directions<00:01:34.369> they<00:01:34.520> can<00:01:34.700> move<00:01:34.819> that<00:01:35.090> way<00:01:35.209> so

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
directions they can move that way so

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.690 
directions they can move that way so
what<00:01:36.170> I'm<00:01:36.259> going<00:01:36.409> to<00:01:36.439> do<00:01:36.619> here<00:01:36.979> is<00:01:37.099> I'm<00:01:37.579> going

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
what I'm going to do here is I'm going

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.629 
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to<00:01:37.789> start<00:01:38.029> by<00:01:38.270> asking<00:01:38.479> laddie<00:01:39.109> to<00:01:39.770> move<00:01:40.310> his

00:01:40.629 --> 00:01:40.639 
to start by asking laddie to move his

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:43.300 
to start by asking laddie to move his
hindquarters<00:01:41.450> away<00:01:42.349> from<00:01:42.649> the<00:01:42.770> rail<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:43.219> I'm

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
hindquarters away from the rail so I'm

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.239 
hindquarters away from the rail so I'm
going<00:01:43.459> to<00:01:43.490> be<00:01:43.670> using<00:01:44.179> my<00:01:44.599> right<00:01:45.049> leg<00:01:45.319> and<00:01:45.619> I'm

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:47.419 
going to be asking him to move his

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:50.199 
going to be asking him to move his
hindquarters<00:01:47.779> this<00:01:48.349> way<00:01:48.819> so<00:01:49.819> what<00:01:49.999> I'm<00:01:50.090> going

00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:50.209 
hindquarters this way so what I'm going

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:52.989 
hindquarters this way so what I'm going
to<00:01:50.240> do<00:01:50.419> to<00:01:50.539> start<00:01:50.840> this<00:01:51.139> is<00:01:51.520> I'm<00:01:52.520> just<00:01:52.549> going<00:01:52.909> to

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
can usually just be patient especially

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.100 
can usually just be patient especially
when<00:03:10.490> they're<00:03:10.640> thinking<00:03:10.880> about<00:03:11.120> it<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:11.660> kind

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
when they're thinking about it and kind

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.780 
when they're thinking about it and kind
of<00:03:12.170> give<00:03:12.440> them<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.800> time<00:03:13.010> to<00:03:13.340> think<00:03:13.670> it

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
of give them the time to think it

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.160 
of give them the time to think it
through<00:03:13.820> that's<00:03:14.570> what<00:03:14.750> it's<00:03:14.840> going<00:03:14.930> to<00:03:14.990> work

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
through that's what it's going to work

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.650 
through that's what it's going to work
best<00:03:15.410> so<00:03:16.100> I<00:03:16.340> can't<00:03:16.670> ask<00:03:16.820> him<00:03:17.000> to<00:03:17.090> move<00:03:17.240> any<00:03:17.450> more

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
best so I can't ask him to move any more

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.390 
best so I can't ask him to move any more
this<00:03:17.840> way<00:03:18.080> because<00:03:18.710> that<00:03:18.860> would<00:03:18.980> be<00:03:19.040> asking

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
this way because that would be asking

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.580 
this way because that would be asking
him<00:03:19.490> to<00:03:19.610> move<00:03:19.730> into<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:20.060> fence<00:03:20.300> and<00:03:20.570> he's<00:03:21.410> not

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
him to move into the fence and he's not

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.479 
him to move into the fence and he's not
going<00:03:21.710> to<00:03:21.770> want<00:03:21.860> to<00:03:21.920> do<00:03:22.040> that<00:03:22.190> he's<00:03:22.310> going<00:03:22.430> to

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
going to want to do that he's going to

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:23.860 
going to want to do that he's going to
move<00:03:22.640> something<00:03:22.880> else<00:03:23.180> so<00:03:23.480> I'm<00:03:23.540> going<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.750> move

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
move something else so I'm going to move

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.520 
move something else so I'm going to move
him<00:03:24.050> back<00:03:24.170> off<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:24.530> other<00:03:24.680> leg<00:03:26.110> so<00:03:27.110> now<00:03:27.380> in

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.380 
him back off the other leg so now in
this<00:03:27.650> case<00:03:27.709> I'm<00:03:28.310> taking<00:03:28.790> a<00:03:29.000> little<00:03:29.239> bit<00:03:29.330> of

shoulders it's going to be at the girth
and<00:05:08.900> I'm<00:05:09.050> going<00:05:09.200> to<00:05:09.260> think<00:05:09.470> about<00:05:09.560> just<00:05:09.980> kind

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
and I'm going to think about just kind

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.060 
and I'm going to think about just kind
of<00:05:10.250> shifting<00:05:10.700> my<00:05:10.850> weight<00:05:10.880> in<00:05:11.240> that<00:05:11.510> direction

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
of shifting my weight in that direction

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.840 
of shifting my weight in that direction
good<00:05:13.070> boy<00:05:13.340> and<00:05:13.840> even<00:05:14.840> a<00:05:15.220> weight<00:05:16.220> shift<00:05:16.610> that

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
good boy and even a weight shift that

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.150 
good boy and even a weight shift that
way<00:05:17.090> I<00:05:17.360> like<00:05:17.870> to<00:05:18.020> release<00:05:18.260> on<00:05:18.500> so<00:05:18.680> look<00:05:18.890> for<00:05:19.070> the

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
way I like to release on so look for the

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.820 
way I like to release on so look for the
smallest<00:05:19.520> things<00:05:19.940> that<00:05:20.090> you<00:05:20.330> can<00:05:20.540> release<00:05:20.780> on

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:34.960 

good<00:05:24.830> boy<00:05:30.370> good<00:05:31.370> boy<00:05:32.830> so<00:05:33.830> we<00:05:34.010> want<00:05:34.310> little

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
good boy good boy so we want little

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.060 
good boy good boy so we want little
correct<00:05:35.390> steps<00:05:35.690> more<00:05:36.110> than<00:05:36.290> lots<00:05:36.800> of

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
correct steps more than lots of

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.580 
correct steps more than lots of
incorrect<00:05:37.580> movement<00:05:38.090> with<00:05:38.630> maybe<00:05:38.990> the<00:05:39.140> right

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
incorrect movement with maybe the right

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:40.900 
incorrect movement with maybe the right
things<00:05:39.860> thrown<00:05:40.130> in<00:05:40.250> there<00:05:40.370> somewhere<00:05:40.640> because

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
things thrown in there somewhere because

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.040 
things thrown in there somewhere because
I<00:05:41.000> feel<00:05:41.240> it's<00:05:41.390> easier<00:05:41.690> for<00:05:41.750> them<00:05:41.900> to

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
I feel it's easier for them to

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.050 
I feel it's easier for them to
understand<00:05:42.500> this<00:05:42.680> when<00:05:42.920> they<00:05:43.010> think<00:05:43.610> about<00:05:43.850> it

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
understand this when they think about it

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.430 
understand this when they think about it
and<00:05:44.240> then<00:05:44.360> slowly<00:05:44.780> move<00:05:45.110> in<00:05:45.230> the<00:05:45.320> right

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
and then slowly move in the right

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.380 
and then slowly move in the right
direction<00:05:45.590> and<00:05:46.340> you<00:05:46.400> say<00:05:46.700> yep<00:05:46.910> that's<00:05:47.180> good

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390 
direction and you say yep that's good

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.150 
direction and you say yep that's good
and<00:05:47.690> then<00:05:47.870> as<00:05:48.020> they<00:05:48.140> get<00:05:48.290> more<00:05:48.350> coordinated

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
and then as they get more coordinated

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.710 
and then as they get more coordinated
you<00:05:49.610> could<00:05:49.790> start<00:05:50.030> to<00:05:50.120> make<00:05:50.240> it<00:05:50.360> look<00:05:50.510> a<00:05:50.600> little

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
you could start to make it look a little

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.910 
you could start to make it look a little
bit<00:05:50.900> better<00:05:51.050> and<00:05:51.290> be<00:05:51.410> a<00:05:51.440> little<00:05:51.650> bit<00:05:51.800> more

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:51.920 
bit better and be a little bit more

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.650 
bit better and be a little bit more
rhythmic<00:05:52.310> so<00:05:52.760> we're<00:05:53.000> just<00:05:53.150> going<00:05:53.270> to<00:05:53.300> take<00:05:53.510> him

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
rhythmic so we're just going to take him

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.640 
rhythmic so we're just going to take him
back<00:05:53.690> this<00:05:54.200> way<00:05:54.440> so<00:05:56.170> now<00:05:57.170> I'm<00:05:57.290> going<00:05:57.440> to<00:05:57.500> take

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
back this way so now I'm going to take

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.340 
back this way so now I'm going to take
both<00:05:57.800> my<00:05:57.860> hands<00:05:58.280> to<00:05:58.460> the<00:05:58.550> right<00:05:58.870> left<00:05:59.870> leg<00:06:00.140> at

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
both my hands to the right left leg at

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.370 
both my hands to the right left leg at
the<00:06:00.620> girth<00:06:01.180> notice<00:06:02.180> I'm<00:06:02.360> not<00:06:02.510> moving<00:06:03.080> things

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
the girth notice I'm not moving things

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.740 
the girth notice I'm not moving things
far<00:06:03.800> the<00:06:04.460> more<00:06:05.180> you<00:06:05.420> try<00:06:05.660> to<00:06:05.690> move<00:06:06.050> and<00:06:06.500> pull

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
far the more you try to move and pull

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.290 
far the more you try to move and pull
good<00:06:08.750> boy<00:06:09.110> and<00:06:09.640> pull<00:06:10.640> them<00:06:10.820> into<00:06:10.970> where<00:06:11.210> you

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
want them usually the harder it is to

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.780 
want them usually the harder it is to
actually<00:06:15.500> get<00:06:15.950> what<00:06:16.100> you're<00:06:16.250> looking<00:06:16.280> for<00:06:16.670> the

actually get what you're looking for the

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.730 
actually get what you're looking for the
more<00:06:16.880> you<00:06:17.000> can<00:06:17.120> just<00:06:17.180> stay<00:06:17.480> soft<00:06:17.810> give<00:06:18.500> them<00:06:18.680> a

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
more you can just stay soft give them a

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.250 
more you can just stay soft give them a
little<00:06:19.130> bit<00:06:19.250> of<00:06:19.520> a<00:06:19.730> little<00:06:20.330> movement<00:06:20.540> really

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260 
little bit of a little movement really

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.750 
little bit of a little movement really
think<00:06:21.590> about<00:06:21.830> where<00:06:22.010> you<00:06:22.100> want<00:06:22.220> them<00:06:22.340> and<00:06:22.580> kind

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 
think about where you want them and kind

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.220

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.230 
of give them time to figure that out the

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.260 
of give them time to figure that out the
better<00:06:24.410> it<00:06:24.530> goes<00:06:24.680> we're<00:06:25.640> going<00:06:25.790> to<00:06:25.850> do<00:06:26.090> one

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
better it goes we're going to do one

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.290 
better it goes we're going to do one
more<00:06:26.300> step<00:06:26.690> here<00:06:27.520> we're<00:06:28.520> almost<00:06:28.640> to<00:06:28.970> the<00:06:29.000> fence

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 
more step here we're almost to the fence

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
more step here we're almost to the fence
good<00:06:29.720> boy<00:06:30.760> good<00:06:31.760> boy<00:06:33.370> okay<00:06:34.370> so<00:06:34.400> that<00:06:34.850> is<00:06:35.320> the

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:42.890 
basic idea of how I use my cues and kind

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.490

of the sum of the X
sizes<00:06:45.860> that<00:06:45.980> I<00:06:46.010> use<00:06:46.250> or<00:06:46.430> some<00:06:46.610> of<00:06:46.700> the<00:06:46.820> ways

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:49.070 
that I set up the exercise using the

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.520 
that I set up the exercise using the
