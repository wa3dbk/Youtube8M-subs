00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
I used a wraparound spine so that the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.080 
I used a wraparound spine so that the
edges<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> paper<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.579> staples<00:01:03.000> are

going to show you how first I'm going to

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.929 
going to show you how first I'm going to
measure<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.560> die<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.010> know<00:01:14.130> how<00:01:14.490> big<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
measure the die so I know how big the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.359 
measure the die so I know how big the
notebook<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.479> be<00:01:15.689> I'll<00:01:16.500> be<00:01:16.560> using<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> die<00:01:17.310> to

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
notebook can be I'll be using the die to

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.789 
notebook can be I'll be using the die to
stitch<00:01:17.759> across<00:01:17.939> three<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.659> four<00:01:18.900> sides<00:01:19.200> so

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
stitch across three of the four sides so

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.399 
stitch across three of the four sides so
it<00:01:19.920> has<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.250> extend<00:01:20.640> all<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.850> way<00:01:21.060> across<00:01:21.409> it's
