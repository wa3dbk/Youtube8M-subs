00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello people i would like to enter today 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.490
 Talk about my sleep range 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.380
 which I have relatively new since two 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.150
 three weeks I believe in the meantime and 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.650
 already tested extensively since then little 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.179
 eyeshadow using currently actually 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.980
 only from the palette because I the 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.470
 I think it's beautiful and the questions are already so 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.730
 Spring is like that but no matter what I want 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.320
 actually just the little review or 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.090
 to give to say I think this 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.769
 that's the good thing about us 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:35.850
 Today it will be the talk 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:37.350
 special from the spot that's the one with these 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.510
 But I am coming in friendly pink tones 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.489
 I'll start again 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.730
 with the packaging comes in one 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.100
 small plastic box is just the matte 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.690
 lettering from it is brilliant looks 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.550
 Overall, I have to say very noble 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.710
 and also relatively well processed 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.239
 she gets relatively easy on what yes 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.940
 It is always an advantage if some 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.550
 You have to destroy things almost like that 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.890
 to open them has a nice 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.670
 Great player who is perfect for getting in it 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.010
 make-up 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.600
 In addition , a protective film is where 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.250
 the names of the individual eyeshadows 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.430
 stand on it and it comes also one 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.680
 Applicator in it on both sides 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.240
 looks the same and I actually 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.250
 I have already used it though 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.140
 with applicators actually not so 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.740
 I do not know what to do anymore 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.250
 In any case, the quality is in 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.670
 order for an applicator so i do 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:37.189
 my ticket here away otherwise flies 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:39.799
 but in by the edge exactly the colors 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.479
 are just so girlish pink shades of brown 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.040
 I already have enough brown 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:48.590
 but I really like those pink tones 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.280
 and that is where I am not 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.820
 do more 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.950
 seven mats and five in there then 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.520
 I also think so in total 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.930
 as a selection quite good because he often in 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.090
 Such pallets are very much glittering 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.920
 inside is and me and this mega glitter 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.850
 not quite so the fan then to 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.950
 Quality pigmentation is at the 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.750
 Most sound 1a so the swimmer 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.980
 are very well pigmented anyway 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.840
 mostly so that they already bring that 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.819
 are and also the mats are good 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.400
 I am particularly impressed by the 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.780
 Matt Black I was already on anyway 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.640
 looking for the beautiful matt 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.350
 black drugstore areas was like that 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.790
 a bit difficult and I wanted 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.049
 not even 100 billion euros for 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.220
 give up the black eyeshadow 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:28.910
 that's why I'm very happy with this 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.459
 satisfied 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.110
 two of the dull tones are not 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.180
 that's how excited it is 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.540
 very light and then this light brew 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.160
 but they are not going to be back 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.200
 mega crass otherwise it is a pretty 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:47.000
 good cut for the palette i dazzle 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.680
 I have not found it yet 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.570
 that one of the colors somehow special 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.820
 crumbles or otherwise in the order 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.920
 difficult behaves but I have too 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.480
 not all intensively used which 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.329
 is currently very much like to be used 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.769
 that bright pink down there what to believe 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.120
 I currently do in camera 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.359
 I'm not sure 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.459
 this shabby brown and for the inside 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:10.400
 Angle that shabby light pink up there 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.930
 and that knows and this dark brown 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.940
 for the eyelet fold, these are the colors 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.410
 which I tested extensively and there 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.010
 I honestly can not 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.200
 complain 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.549
 the crumbs do not have that so 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.380
 dark does not have any yet 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.239
 fallout produced as me only 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.530
 I do not know exactly why 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.079
 I said that not too much 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.139
 used but I guess that 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:32.959
 it does not turn out quite differently 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:36.200
 Yes cost the good piece 10 euros 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.880
 you get in the internet especially in 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.420
 Germany every year 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.190
 a British drugstore brand is it and 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.630
 there are a few make up shops in 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.770
 Germany I distribute the 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.540
 now from tales of pink 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.730
 All in all, I am with this 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.410
 palette extremely satisfied and finds that 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.310
 with good conscience ten euros for 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.440
 can spend 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.870
 The pigmentation is good the quality 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.370
 is good the color selection is great and 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.900
 I do not think that will be mine 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.580
 have remained single song palette 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.080
 Currently, so a bit on the 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.400
 storm but I think that will one more 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.240
 take a while to see you in mine 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.530
 closet holds 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.030
 I hope I could give you a little bit 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.860
 help if he so far with the 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.480
 thoughts have played a palette 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.250
 not even looking at us if you 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.140
 The money is worth it to everyone 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.220
 case 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.780
 and if not, it's worth it 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.070
 save or look at clothes 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.720
 there's gyro down there and then with 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.330
 pallets then just needed 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.530
 but there is enough in it who should 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.920
 all this eyeshadow all 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.870
 do 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.210
 I have never in my life to the 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.770
 turn all embossed 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.730
 then I'll show you yet I do not know 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.990
 If I'm marching next to it 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.180
 have cut or if I now it 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.410
 I will do my current one 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.290
 eye make-up incl 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:42.350
 oh yes, to the durability still 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.030
 I have if I use a base yet 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.650
 No problems with that was very 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.020
 I get into the lid fold 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.480
 little cool songs that means that 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.890
 chance is there relatively high but that went 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.860
 I'm wearing it right now, I think 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:05:01.370
 the make-up for hours or so and you 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:03.200
 can look it looks like yes 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.330
 as I said I hope indeed entertaining 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.440
 and exciting and wish you one more 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.440
 Have you had a nice day 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:28.940
 no, I am kicking as a video
