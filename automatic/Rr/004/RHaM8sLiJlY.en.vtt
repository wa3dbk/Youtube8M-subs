00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
for things that's the primary job of the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.130 
for things that's the primary job of the
dog<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.850> if<00:01:47.970> he's<00:01:48.119> highly<00:01:48.479> driven<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.930> search

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
dog so if he's highly driven to search

dog so if he's highly driven to search
for<00:01:49.350> things<00:01:49.560> he's<00:01:50.040> probably<00:01:50.220> going<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.490> make<00:01:50.610> a
