00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
head like this you really struggle

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.120 
head like this you really struggle
moving<00:02:06.049> the<00:02:06.200> arm<00:02:06.409> so<00:02:06.650> you<00:02:06.710> have<00:02:06.799> to<00:02:06.890> make<00:02:07.010> sure

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
moving the arm so you have to make sure

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.979 
moving the arm so you have to make sure
that<00:02:07.159> the<00:02:07.400> head<00:02:07.580> is<00:02:07.729> completely<00:02:08.420> straight<00:02:08.689> and

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
that the head is completely straight and

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.899 
that the head is completely straight and
then<00:02:09.739> you<00:02:09.769> can<00:02:10.069> rotate<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.459> arms<00:02:10.700> all<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:10.849> way

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:10.909 
then you can rotate the arms all the way

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:14.320 
then you can rotate the arms all the way
around<00:02:11.209> and<00:02:12.049> he<00:02:12.290> also<00:02:12.409> has<00:02:13.120> articulation<00:02:14.120> or

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.000 
around and he also has articulation or
he<00:02:14.480> has<00:02:14.629> movement<00:02:15.319> in<00:02:15.560> his<00:02:16.310> legs<00:02:17.920> colouring<00:02:18.920> is

on<00:03:56.330> the<00:03:56.450> stone<00:03:56.720> that<00:03:57.880> multitudes<00:03:58.880> of

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
on the stone that multitudes of

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.580 
on the stone that multitudes of
different<00:03:59.390> Grey's<00:03:59.660> there's<00:04:00.260> probably<00:04:00.500> about

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
different Grey's there's probably about

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.530 
different Grey's there's probably about
three<00:04:01.010> Gray's<00:04:01.280> in<00:04:01.489> total<00:04:01.880> and<00:04:02.090> then<00:04:02.209> we've<00:04:02.360> got

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
three Gray's in total and then we've got

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.830 
three Gray's in total and then we've got
some<00:04:03.019> of<00:04:03.200> that<00:04:03.230> diamond<00:04:03.890> color<00:04:04.720> taken<00:04:05.720> from

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
some of that diamond color taken from

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.140 
some of that diamond color taken from
his<00:04:05.989> armor<00:04:06.320> it's<00:04:06.860> also<00:04:07.010> in<00:04:07.250> here<00:04:07.489> as<00:04:07.670> well<00:04:07.850> so

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
his armor it's also in here as well so

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.410 
his armor it's also in here as well so
it<00:04:08.480> it<00:04:08.900> has<00:04:09.049> that<00:04:09.079> same<00:04:09.440> coloring<00:04:10.180> but<00:04:11.180> again

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
it it has that same coloring but again

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.090 
it it has that same coloring but again
like<00:04:11.570> it's<00:04:11.750> lights<00:04:12.079> there's<00:04:12.440> there's<00:04:12.920> not<00:04:13.070> a

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
like it's lights there's there's not a

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.100 
like it's lights there's there's not a
lot<00:04:13.310> of<00:04:13.340> weight<00:04:13.670> to<00:04:14.090> this<00:04:14.209> block<00:04:14.540> at<00:04:14.750> all<00:04:14.900> you

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
lot of weight to this block at all you

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.479 
lot of weight to this block at all you
can't<00:04:15.320> open<00:04:15.470> it<00:04:15.739> you<00:04:15.829> can't<00:04:16.010> do<00:04:16.100> anything<00:04:16.340> with

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
can't open it you can't do anything with

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.849 
can't open it you can't do anything with
it<00:04:16.519> it's<00:04:16.820> just<00:04:17.030> a<00:04:17.180> a<00:04:17.450> piece<00:04:18.109> that<00:04:18.140> you<00:04:18.530> can<00:04:18.560> put

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
it it's just a a piece that you can put

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.020 
it it's just a a piece that you can put
along<00:04:19.250> with<00:04:19.579> the<00:04:19.850> Minecraft<00:04:20.510> figures<00:04:21.109> I<00:04:22.030> do

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
along with the Minecraft figures I do

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.790 
along with the Minecraft figures I do
like<00:04:23.330> that<00:04:23.450> they<00:04:23.600> incorporate<00:04:24.200> these<00:04:24.440> as

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
like that they incorporate these as

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.140 
like that they incorporate these as
opposed<00:04:25.130> to<00:04:25.190> just<00:04:25.370> having<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.760> outright

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
opposed to just having the outright

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.060 
opposed to just having the outright
characters<00:04:26.660> on<00:04:26.810> their<00:04:26.990> own<00:04:27.140> this<00:04:27.530> is<00:04:27.590> a<00:04:27.860> nice

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
characters on their own this is a nice

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.830 
characters on their own this is a nice
touch<00:04:28.310> to<00:04:28.370> include<00:04:28.940> these<00:04:29.150> with<00:04:29.840> them<00:04:30.020> also<00:04:31.840> if

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
touch to include these with them also if

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.390 
touch to include these with them also if
you're<00:04:33.020> certainly<00:04:33.290> a<00:04:33.320> fan<00:04:33.500> of<00:04:33.650> Minecraft<00:04:34.100> the

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
play a lot of Minecraft that still only

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.460 
play a lot of Minecraft that still only
played<00:04:43.160> about<00:04:43.340> three<00:04:43.580> or<00:04:43.669> four<00:04:43.880> times

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470

I<00:04:45.500> do<00:04:45.590> really<00:04:45.860> like<00:04:46.130> the<00:04:46.460> look<00:04:46.880> of<00:04:47.030> the

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
I do really like the look of the

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.460 
I do really like the look of the
characters<00:04:47.510> because<00:04:47.750> it<00:04:47.870> really<00:04:48.050> brings<00:04:48.200> me

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
characters because it really brings me

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.340 
characters because it really brings me
back<00:04:48.500> to<00:04:48.740> when<00:04:49.550> I<00:04:49.580> was<00:04:49.730> younger<00:04:49.940> when<00:04:50.720> things

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
back to when I was younger when things

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.870 
back to when I was younger when things
didn't<00:04:52.070> have<00:04:52.280> to<00:04:52.490> be

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
didn't have to be

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.780 
didn't have to be
well<00:04:53.180> things<00:04:53.450> weren't<00:04:54.400> pixelized<00:04:55.400> for<00:04:55.700> the

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
well things weren't pixelized for the

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.250 
well things weren't pixelized for the
sake<00:04:56.000> of<00:04:56.030> making<00:04:56.360> the<00:04:56.630> pixel<00:04:56.930> eyes<00:04:57.020> that's

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.450 
sake of making the pixel eyes that's
just<00:04:57.440> the<00:04:57.530> way<00:04:57.620> they<00:04:57.770> were<00:04:57.830> back<00:04:58.100> then<00:04:58.310> that's
