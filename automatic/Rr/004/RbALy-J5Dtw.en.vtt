00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
just put it here because we need their

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.709 
just put it here because we need their
original<00:00:39.270> chips<00:00:39.660> have<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.649> be<00:00:40.890> installed<00:00:41.340> here

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
original chips have to be installed here

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:49.729 
original chips have to be installed here
to<00:00:42.719> make<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.020> recognize<00:00:45.170> and<00:00:48.110> we<00:00:49.110> have<00:00:49.260> one

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
to make it recognize and we have one

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:57.509 
to make it recognize and we have one
more

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:08.679

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
like that and get the scotch tape and

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.880 
like that and get the scotch tape and
then<00:01:09.080> wrap<00:01:09.740> around<00:01:11.350> this<00:01:12.350> is<00:01:12.560> a<00:01:12.590> rubber

then wrap around this is a rubber

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:27.249 
then wrap around this is a rubber
pumping<00:01:13.759> system<00:01:14.210> but<00:01:14.570> wrap<00:01:14.810> around<00:01:15.140> it<00:01:26.170> do<00:01:27.170> the

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
pumping system but wrap around it do the

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:28.749 
pumping system but wrap around it do the
same<00:01:27.470> thing<00:01:27.679> with<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:27.950> other<00:01:28.069> colors<00:01:28.550> I

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
same thing with the other colors I

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.120 
same thing with the other colors I
already<00:01:29.210> prepared<00:01:29.860> to<00:01:30.860> get<00:01:31.039> this<00:01:31.159> the<00:01:31.310> same

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
already prepared to get this the same

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:42.560 
already prepared to get this the same
pattern

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.170 

like<00:01:43.570> that

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.279

and
prepare<00:01:49.009> some<00:01:49.039> kind<00:01:49.430> of<00:01:49.490> paper<00:01:49.729> because<00:01:50.570> we

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
prepare some kind of paper because we

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.330 
prepare some kind of paper because we
want<00:01:51.409> to<00:01:51.500> close<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.770> sensor<00:01:52.450> when<00:01:53.450> you<00:01:54.219> put<00:01:55.219> it

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
want to close the sensor when you put it

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.910 
want to close the sensor when you put it
inside<00:01:55.520> here<00:01:56.180> you'll<00:01:57.170> recognize<00:01:57.710> as<00:01:58.039> the<00:01:58.250> door

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
inside here you'll recognize as the door

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.069 
inside here you'll recognize as the door
this<00:02:00.920> door<00:02:00.979> is<00:02:01.369> closed<00:02:01.759> so<00:02:02.719> you<00:02:02.750> don't

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
this door is closed so you don't

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.219 
this door is closed so you don't
actually<00:02:03.500> have<00:02:03.799> to<00:02:03.950> close<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.429> door<00:02:04.700> but<00:02:05.539> to

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
actually have to close the door but to

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.130 
actually have to close the door but to
make<00:02:06.409> it<00:02:06.560> a<00:02:06.590> little<00:02:06.649> more<00:02:06.799> neat<00:02:07.810> get<00:02:08.810> a<00:02:08.840> scotch

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
make it a little more neat get a scotch

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.790 
make it a little more neat get a scotch
tape

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.940 

let's<00:02:16.340> wrap<00:02:16.610> around<00:02:17.000> it<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:18.290> as<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:18.650> can<00:02:18.770> see

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
let's wrap around it and as you can see

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.250 
let's wrap around it and as you can see
gives<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.580> little<00:02:19.850> more<00:02:20.090> room<00:02:20.300> don't<00:02:20.750> close<00:02:21.020> it

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
gives a little more room don't close it

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.730 
gives a little more room don't close it
too<00:02:21.410> hard<00:02:21.650> because<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:23.030> blocks<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.690> hose<00:02:24.440> and

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
too hard because it blocks the hose and

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.280 
too hard because it blocks the hose and
they<00:02:25.190> need<00:02:25.400> some<00:02:25.580> little<00:02:28.540> some<00:02:29.540> room<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:30.110> make

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
they need some little some room to make

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.680 
they need some little some room to make
a<00:02:30.320> little<00:02:30.560> more<00:02:30.800> smooth<00:02:31.160> flow<00:02:31.640> on<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.510> hose

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
a little more smooth flow on the hose

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.080 
a little more smooth flow on the hose
and<00:02:34.270> unlike<00:02:35.270> other<00:02:35.590> CISS<00:02:36.590> systems<00:02:37.070> when<00:02:37.970> you

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
and unlike other CISS systems when you

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
and unlike other CISS systems when you
can<00:02:38.270> if<00:02:39.110> as<00:02:39.350> you<00:02:39.530> can<00:02:39.740> see<00:02:39.950> our<00:02:40.670> ink<00:02:41.030> has<00:02:41.360> maybe

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
can if as you can see our ink has maybe

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.160 
can if as you can see our ink has maybe
about<00:02:42.680> two<00:02:43.280> times<00:02:43.610> more<00:02:43.880> than<00:02:44.090> other<00:02:44.330> CISF

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
about two times more than other CISF

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.680 
about two times more than other CISF
system<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.190> these<00:02:46.640> are<00:02:46.850> all<00:02:47.030> imported<00:02:47.420> from

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
system and these are all imported from

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.650 
system and these are all imported from
Korea<00:02:48.080> handmade<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:50.710> the<00:02:51.710> ink<00:02:51.950> that<00:02:52.190> we<00:02:52.370> have

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
Korea handmade and the ink that we have

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.620 
Korea handmade and the ink that we have
are<00:02:53.660> also<00:02:54.440> imported<00:02:55.220> from<00:02:55.310> Korea<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:56.030> then

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
are also imported from Korea and then

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.540 
are also imported from Korea and then
they<00:02:56.900> are<00:02:57.110> one<00:02:57.380> of<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.560> highest<00:02:57.800> qualities<00:02:58.520> of

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
they are one of the highest qualities of

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.600 
they are one of the highest qualities of
ink<00:02:58.940> and<00:02:59.120> then<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.080> ink<00:03:00.320> determines<00:03:01.160> the

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
ink and then the ink determines the

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.510 
ink and then the ink determines the
quality<00:03:01.850> of<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:02.570> CIA<00:03:02.900> system<00:03:03.470> so<00:03:03.740> make<00:03:04.490> sure

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
quality of the CIA system so make sure

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.990 
quality of the CIA system so make sure
you<00:03:04.970> use<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.360> top<00:03:05.600> quality<00:03:06.250> otherwise<00:03:07.250> you

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
you use the top quality otherwise you

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.890 
you use the top quality otherwise you
can<00:03:08.270> ruin<00:03:08.720> your<00:03:08.930> printhead<00:03:09.590> which<00:03:10.520> is

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
can ruin your printhead which is

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.920 
can ruin your printhead which is
installed<00:03:11.900> around<00:03:12.320> here<00:03:12.680> so<00:03:13.520> without<00:03:14.000> having

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
installed around here so without having

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.070 
installed around here so without having
a<00:03:15.230> good<00:03:16.060> ink<00:03:17.060> you<00:03:17.480> can<00:03:17.510> damage<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.440> printhead

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
a good ink you can damage the printhead

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.040 
a good ink you can damage the printhead
and<00:03:21.080> that's<00:03:21.860> it
