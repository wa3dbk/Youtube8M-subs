00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.360
 video today a prospect who but not yet finished this super 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.229
 content 

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:16.229
 it was very fast but I made the order at 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.800
 but kate tells me he was I made them 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.199
 in croatia i know more friday it was the 5th or 6th cycle 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.090
 56 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.330
 Friday and went back to the one before 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.330
 and 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.060
 and then I got alain this morning 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.340
 so I'm going to show you the three colors 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.900
 I am relieved 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.820
 I do not do what I write 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.810
 I know that defeat against time 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.250
 that's then 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.330
 I would have liked to 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.110
 m hard 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.110
 So everything goes with the state of mind with delivery charges 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.840
 so I have 23 dollars a year which is about 18 euros 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.340
 and after I explained you two three things I want to give little tips 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.750
 if you want to buy the decree rewritten to know 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.040
 the colors because for his 6th equalize and it's not the Elysee and hop 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.330
 glossy or matte 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.420
 I will explain after 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.509
 so make him evolve his recipes to write 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.640
 so I'm happy 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.180
 I was talking about it in the video just to eat I will not need it anymore 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.270
 to open the brand to work the dough 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.850
 the 4th quarter when we breastfeed like the color is great then 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.570
 that may seem what I liked because the time is not very 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.500
 good 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.500
 you do not know if you like it or not 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.750
 but percent when we see this year sixteen party cream 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.840
 but it's very clear I have a private contract the army why paradox is 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.980
 really light 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.850
 after i took m 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.630
 so in fact maybe it's like that it's the color that will be celebrating 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.280
 so high I do not know how to say but I always did it better 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:14.290
 he dies the powers in place with the Palestinians we will start his 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.329
 carouge long career because there I have caused 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:21.199
 the most advanced statutes December base I do not believe it anymore 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.170
 so this is the neighborhood begins to break his most fervent series 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:28.209
 number so this is this central 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.209
 epi is the 32 his partners 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.409
 at their relay 3 1% and 3 these are matches 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:39.799
 it is very good 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.679
 now that steyn germania 

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:46.249
 only a small hour a little bit from home chemical 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.109
 but I am disappointed because 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.769
 the color that's about 5 I wanted something really young john 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.739
 jones times of prayer 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.569
 Narbonne was not lacking 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.529
 so it was nothing done 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:01.239
 after some hunters I prepare my mom 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.239
 so show 

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:07.129
 then art 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.129
 I would do it again after douala sanctions 

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:14.839
 so there he was dead 

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:17.789
 it's really clear it's really what I was looking for so the subway on the 

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:19.569
 eyelid 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.419
 we are on the water finally to finish 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:25.429
 the cei for his club that would mess up m 

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.429
 eliminated 

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:30.429
 and the peak and the fastest in the golden world 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:34.699
 - avi I'll give you a little trick then 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:38.269
 for enemies and pharnext can be done on multiple sites for them 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.929
 two more known his shoes in the cultures and therefore on a playful handicap 

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:46.679
 knowing that on them the social struggles and culture 

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:47.679
 they are cheaper 

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:50.689
 which are at $ 3 99 euros 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:53.309
 Funny $ 10m 50 

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:56.219
 afp the call price 6 $ 50 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:01.109
 and on the four graduates a few clicks they are in paca 98 that's back 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.999
 to say that 60 dollars 

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:06.459
 to tell the truth yes to his darling and on the cultures are recharging that 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.379
 this lady in the hat the lighthouse 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:13.189
 but the shipping costs they are knowing more expensive too so percent me I 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:14.519
 prefers to pay 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.819
 finally the product a dollar more 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:19.370
 but percent 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.540
 I'm still not the site the loser 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.610
 on the pre the shipping costs 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.639
 since 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.990
 when jerry culture that can predict 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.039
 $ 11 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.839
 and if we are able but who said that this time choice I did what 

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:37.809
 I could I ordered in the nose and gifts the fifteen a lot of objects 

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:38.759
 as well 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:42.270
 for them it's enough of boxing that is about 4 euros 50 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:45.070
 why the calculation is quickly done 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.030
 and in addition the good to punish all affected by the company are 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.469
 set in any case mechanical every time it's not more than ten days 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:54.989
 it's still fast enough knowing that in the meantime there was a day 

00:04:54.989 --> 00:05:00.009
 holiday so here is that this comedy of roger prayer the three there 

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:02.330
 while every hour 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.680
 safarova so that on the few clicks the payers 4 dollars 98 years 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:08.960
 and odette typically 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.820
 who wants and still strong - in my body I do not have the basics 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:14.740
 a saloon 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.270
 it is the country of the first race that sends to the 67 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.360
 and the headlights 3 ar 3 0 70 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:26.610
 then for 100 euros 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.289
 tron and that's the little thing I did not say the title I'll tell you is that 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.309
 to buy so she took 

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:36.059
 the colors I wanted e so I start on the public 

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:37.699
 I think you understood 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:41.009
 but I was looking at colors in cultures because if you go on the 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:44.369
 site of this waste culture m il nie 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:48.279
 10% lighthouses and armed this without match 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:51.309
 six in the league they wanted to write you write so counting you 

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:56.449
 know% you can differentiate them% on pc screens you 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:59.150
 may not have been discovered near the site 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.680
 while on the captives we can not differentiate just give the name of the 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.529
 color and that's it 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:04.569
 So here is 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:07.580
 I'm looking for crops, she's in charge 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.580
 mechanical relationship that's how I am sure I have 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:14.569
 to see the colors for that i want before i wanted to do i wanted some 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:16.879
 rather low colors 

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:22.099
 m thanks to them remain guarded times it's a gesture of the title sees itself back 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:25.369
 May last what I expect a copy at 10% I'm comfortable 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:29.550
 so here I can tell you I started the same day but I'm preparing 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:30.180
 as well 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.460
