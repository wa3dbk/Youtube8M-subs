00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.200
 many garden plots give water 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.179
 graphics so gardeners have to 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.700
 I myself most often with the help 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.939
 metal tanks 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.420
 but the trouble is that the metal cube on 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.150
 winter 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.910
 need to drain the water and come in the spring 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.550
 there is no water 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.529
 option 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.619
 plastic pond at cup his yeshiva land 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.200
 he creates a very beautiful design there 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.079
 still there to put a fountain it will be 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.079
 great place to stay but it's the same 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.530
 time for the gardener is a very useful thing 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.440
 so that water can be collected in the fall and 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.690
 leave for the whole winter the only thing 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.200
 need to throw a couple of plastic bottles 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.200
 so that it is not too swollen and all 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.620
 in the spring you come to the adapter for gardeners 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.720
 for the whole spring until the water is given for the sake of 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.290
 it means water for irrigation 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.510
 the pool 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.329
 a few years ago artificial 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.799
 pond autodoc were a rarity 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:12.060
 today will be able to afford to install 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:16.310
 even the pensioner I set it all myself 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.889
 for this, a hole is dug around the perimeter 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.679
 bottom sand to pool this 

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:24.270
 it is established exactly we align couple 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:26.939
 the level is already here 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.369
 the junction will be in one direction then 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.399
 it is necessary the party will be full other not 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.639
 align the pool level and 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:39.420
 fill with water and all summer with some water 

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:41.819
 water heats up used water 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.459
 they gave me a pool again and again 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:45.749
 used the most common 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:48.149
 the shape of the reservoir in the suburban areas 

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:50.759
 is exactly plastic ponds 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.189
 whose size and shape varies in 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.200
 depending on the style of the landscape and means 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.539
 host 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.820
 selling design is different for some reason 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.930
 I will say because this pond 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.350
 for example he 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.540
 Here is the form of deepening 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.050
 into this recess when installing this 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.869
 pond 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.090
 here it is covered with sand or 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.770
 gravel and this part 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:19.060
 the truth is landing 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:21.520
 marsh plants and here they grow 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.970
 decorate about another design true 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:29.540
 Make a well and fine 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:32.480
 small plot small plot allows 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:37.069
 at this place set a cascade of 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.689
 stones let water and water water therefore 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.030
 the cascade will descend but will not 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:44.379
 leave the territory will be saved 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.730
 that is, the various forms of ponds they and 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:49.189
 allow you to make various options 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.260
 plastic pond decoration very 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:53.090
 easy to operate it does not require 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.359
 some special care from draining water 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.799
 for the winter and most importantly durable and 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:03:02.299
 plastic container this material is 20 years old 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.780
 preserve the chemical properties of it all 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:09.379
 color and but the same plasticity 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.739
 I am 35 the same Elena frost her not 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.739
 heat 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.510
 besides the pond in the garden you can arrange a stream 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.519
 fight waterfall or any other 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.379
 composition including a variety of 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:29.510
 water elements in any body of water 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:32.720
 promotes suggests something to us 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.709
 need to organize a fountain fountain selection 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.620
 . 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:40.040
 interconnected height and jet interconnected 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.409
 with a mirror of water that is if you 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.360
 want to make a tall fountain given 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:46.730
 If you meet a pond, you need a large 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.129
 because the water that circulates in 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.950
 pond and should not be splashed out 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:55.519
 outside and therefore in open areas 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.680
 where secret weather high jet can 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.750
 just be to go beyond the pond on 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.870
 the street therefore usually count 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.150
 height pit no more than half 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.099
 pond diameter if you take ponds 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.390
 there is a meter and a half that is 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:13.489
 the height of the jet there is 78 meters to revive 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.030
 the appearance of the pond does not interfere with decorative 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.070
 backlight 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.989
 as well as other additional mechanisms 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.349
 to keep the reservoir in excellent 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.150
 condition such as a pump when 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:25.190
 choosing a pump that is installed 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.639
 water 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.449
 mothers should consider what they want 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.479
 we need to install 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:36.090
 just sprayed it work up 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:39.000
 case will be 1 pump power 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.090
 and if people want to do as a source 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.500
 or cascade and here's connect some 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.430
 decoration for the pond water catalog 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.229
 brings you gonna going on 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.100
 nozzles but there is a regulator 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:54.960
 which sends water and 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.729
 sprinklers well some kind of like 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.979
 to make a brand depends on your 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:02.220
 preferences it can be original 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:05.280
 aquatic plants or ordinary fish are very 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.600
 comfortable and very beautiful so I banned 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.560
 your pool 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:14.580
 yes let me up with. 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:17.010
 or is it my genitals here I plan for the summer 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.840
 there Karasik run and you can 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.960
 even sit and fish without leaving 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.790
 garden plot 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.790
