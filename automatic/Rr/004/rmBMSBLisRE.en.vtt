00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:07.720
 foto kn 2012 and to have here the new one 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.190
 canon asics 50h it is in our hand 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.190
 of course made a very nice 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.349
 new power shop model is 50 years old 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.000
 optical zoom at 12.1 megapixels 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.160
 that's immense, that's why it looks 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.480
 camera a bit emails out but 50 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.820
 There was no optical zoom 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.380
 too often especially in the size of the 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.849
 failed ever larger objective but 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.730
 of course that's really it 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:30.160
 practically we have up here, of course 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.509
 the regular settings 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.070
 We can also blitz you too 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.350
 let it be when the device is on 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.660
 So it's not a hardware flash 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.550
 short but software flash button then 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.320
 we still have two microphones here 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.730
 but they are not closer 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.379
 we are described but we are really 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.109
 two holes we can of course 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.100
 specially lightning then on top of the 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:50.350
 have an optical viewfinder and on the 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.359
 could yes my fancy 3 inch display 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.370
 that really nice sharp is unfortunately 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:57.500
 count as well a beautiful rams 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.450
 built around so synonymous no touchscreen 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.310
 On the side we have a battery 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.720
 in it just over stream 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.339
 this is of course also operated 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.080
 always nice that you can use something like that 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.090
 and of course we can do digital as well 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.290
 still a hundred times buzz or 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.660
 we also have external hdmi output here 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.180
 no usb connection and a remote 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.210
 So no headphone district one 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.369
 Microphone connection here on this camera 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.600
 otherwise there are some in front here 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:28.490
 to make buttons and not macro mode 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.200
 We liked to hang around this time 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.090
 Just get started watching it 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.040
 what can you do it will of course 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.890
 Go straight on here and I'll show now 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.840
 just the complete 1200 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.950
 millimeters we can let off steam here 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.869
 I realized that is really great 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.860
 fast 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.770
 so I can really quickly so 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.770
 far out and so far has chosen 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.630
 coinciding with the other hand is the 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.640
 digital zoom comes the digital zoom 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.850
 so let's start over we have here 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.320
 So the camera 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.790
 and up there on the platform we have 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.619
 many people and now want us 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.230
 So these people are watching 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.150
 both founders idol the camera 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.800
 and of course, mine has to do that now 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.530
 Camera here also happen on the 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.420
 camera here 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.130
 which of course is not happening right now 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.110
 but in any case we can each one of us 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.750
 there is behind and see sharp 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.750
 and shoot our cooperation 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.400
 some out of sleep at least 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.719
 that's how people really notice that behind it 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.980
 standing there is not that close 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:34.540
 off as very back 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.989
 and yes, we can be fast too 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.989
 look at 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.910
 and yet that is already sharp enough 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.440
 for being here then on side 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.490
 3 or on the first page in the picture 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.170
 can imagine as a woman that was here 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.900
 the short first impression of the new 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.980
 powershot sx 50h it until next time 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.980
 finances to look down and
