00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 emil at your exit from the field 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.010
 and the whole bentegodi was very strong 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.679
 in walking and standing you have closed the 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.219
 great this season I'm happy 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.840
 for my performance but also a pity 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.859
 as a result because if we won there 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.859
 we could have scored again 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.670
 the impression was the one that really 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.820
 physically maybe you were is enough 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.529
 drain enough to the ground or maybe 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.329
 is what happened in Rome with 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.530
 mazzoleni really cut his legs off 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.690
 I don't know this today even there was that hot 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.360
 according to me lowered the pace a little 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.329
 of the match 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:49.469
 I don't know maybe it was a bit low but there 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:53.190
 is when it is worth 20 but as mentioned that 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.289
 a pity of the draw to amy duff 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.570
 missing a player to throw in 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.039
 speed on the right there was no iturbe 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.110
 you have suffered this absence is one 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.130
 blind punished if that if we did not 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.189
 a good race 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:14.289
 when one is qualified or not another 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:15.810
 in place of vile we are we have one 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.369
 good rose 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.090
 according to me provided a good race 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:24.070
 on Saturday at 18.00 almost 23 thousand 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.009
 spectators at bentegodi to give 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.229
 goodbye in series to al verona e ti 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.909
 always as surprised as when you see one 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.100
 stadium so these fans who do not 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:44.170
 never leave 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:47.979
 we have the last game will be a 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.990
 naples empty stadium without fans you have to 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.450
 try perhaps to close at best 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.549
 this season is a game in short 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.229
 that you run the risk of being underestimated 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.869
 since now the games for Europe 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.490
 they are practically done but we go there 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.579
 to do our race we are where it is not 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.590
 I don't know that we're going to party 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.590
 maybe this week we are a bit 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.030
 particular but let's go there 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.599
 let's do our channel then let's go 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.230
 everyone on vacation gives the second goal in 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.069
 championship 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.360
 even today the joy of faults is from 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.300
 pay tribute to all the people that it is 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.790
 come to see me certainly always nice to do 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.500
 goals 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.760
 I want to dedicate this heart to my father 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.760
 that yesterday sanda
