00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 one fascinating thing is that we have 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.750
 today is the question of the work of beauty 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.750
 through medicine 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.730
 one of the things we have today for 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.400
 example are numerous techniques for making 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:25.109
 someone more beautiful then to build the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.599
 Beautiful this is always relative but is it 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.550
 follows some patterns then one thing that 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.910
 we try a lot in medicalization 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:37.219
 is to rejuvenate and leave want some 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:40.140
 problems for example the person is 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.989
 more drawn Let's just say it but she 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.809
 was scarlett ized then that there not 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.219
 was simply to produce 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.800
 beauty of the people they were 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.980
 stigmatized by this procedure 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.480
 so what was it that we as doctors and 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.980
 exams we always want 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.050
 Chase 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.309
 So we try to understand why 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.250
 that happened 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.119
 and started working this we can 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.939
 also create beauty with new situations 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.040
 with these ideals many new ideals 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.500
 times they are created by the media 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.930
 one of the principles of medicine governing 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.330
 first is democratic principle by 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.140
 example to say that we should not 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.220
 Hurt 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.860
 then how come we will not hurt if 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.430
 we determine what is good what 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.100
 is bad 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.170
 then it depends on the population and it is 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.689
 that's why we have advanced so much 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.970
 because we do not have people power 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.740
 decide for themselves what is good 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.900
 for them and what is bad 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.579
 another issue regarding medicalization 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.640
 of beauty is that today we have is market 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.460
 beauty so not so we are 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:55.020
 countless techniques that fulfill a desire 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:58.850
 of the population of juveniles and to become 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.740
 more beautiful more attractive to attend 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.469
 demands of a market is the demand of the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.469
 market and of the person himself or 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.229
 Let's say a model that would like to 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:13.950
 make you more successful in your career but 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.020
 also the patient to model 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.980
 even we are subject to an issue 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.530
 market because these are other forms of 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.300
 to work beauty she imposes herself too 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:30.000
 for one is a matter of marketing 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.010
 of these new products is obviously that 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.530
 these products are generated from 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.220
 a demand but also often 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.230
 they create a new demand so this is 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.209
 the question of medicalized beauty is 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.420
 extremely complex 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.599
 It's how people live the most. 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.810
 increasing demand and has attracted 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:55.790
 of people who are doctors are 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.769
 stacks you're trying to provide is 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.349
 possibilities for us to become 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:04.730
 more beautiful 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.730
