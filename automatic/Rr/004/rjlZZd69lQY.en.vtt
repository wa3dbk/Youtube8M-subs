the<00:02:02.030> morning<00:02:02.450> I<00:02:02.719> don't<00:02:03.470> know<00:02:03.530> it's<00:02:03.740> just<00:02:03.860> good

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
the morning I don't know it's just good

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:05.830 
the morning I don't know it's just good
for<00:02:04.069> you<00:02:04.340> I<00:02:04.580> think<00:02:04.880> it<00:02:04.939> has<00:02:05.090> like<00:02:05.299> anti

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
for you I think it has like anti

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.249 
for you I think it has like anti
antioxidants<00:02:06.380> in<00:02:07.009> it<00:02:07.069> or<00:02:07.220> something

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
antioxidants in it or something

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.270 
antioxidants in it or something
so<00:02:09.259> that's<00:02:09.470> another<00:02:09.739> thing<00:02:09.979> to<00:02:10.190> consider

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
so that's another thing to consider

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.530 
so that's another thing to consider
basically<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:13.340> just<00:02:13.400> tap<00:02:13.880> it<00:02:14.090> see<00:02:14.299> mine<00:02:14.510> is

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
basically you just tap it see mine is

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.949 
basically you just tap it see mine is
now<00:02:15.519> it's<00:02:16.519> getting<00:02:16.849> warm<00:02:17.209> again<00:02:17.480> it's<00:02:17.690> not<00:02:17.780> as

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
now it's getting warm again it's not as

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.600 
now it's getting warm again it's not as
cold<00:02:18.230> anymore<00:02:20.620> so<00:02:21.620> another<00:02:21.920> tip<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.489> can

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
cold anymore so another tip that you can

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.900 
cold anymore so another tip that you can
do<00:02:23.090> is<00:02:23.360> to<00:02:24.079> use<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:24.500> spoon<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.280> put<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.790> spoon

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
do is to use a spoon and put the spoon

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.030 
do is to use a spoon and put the spoon
in<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.329> freezer<00:02:26.630> for<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.410> couple<00:02:27.769> of<00:02:27.860> minutes

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
in the freezer for a couple of minutes

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.550 
in the freezer for a couple of minutes
let<00:02:28.670> it<00:02:28.700> get<00:02:28.880> really<00:02:28.910> really<00:02:29.360> cold<00:02:29.630> and<00:02:29.930> also

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
let it get really really cold and also

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.080 
let it get really really cold and also
place<00:02:30.950> that<00:02:31.190> under<00:02:31.459> your<00:02:31.489> eye<00:02:31.610> I'm<00:02:31.849> going<00:02:32.000> to

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
place that under your eye I'm going to

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.280 
place that under your eye I'm going to
show<00:02:32.239> you<00:02:32.299> how<00:02:32.510> to<00:02:32.540> do<00:02:32.750> that<00:02:32.900> right<00:02:33.079> now

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
show you how to do that right now

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.410 
show you how to do that right now
now<00:02:33.769> this<00:02:33.980> one<00:02:34.160> is<00:02:34.310> probably<00:02:34.489> more<00:02:35.000> easier

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
now this one is probably more easier

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.120 
now this one is probably more easier
than<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.690> tea<00:02:35.870> bag<00:02:36.079> because<00:02:36.440> it<00:02:36.620> takes<00:02:36.829> less

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
than the tea bag because it takes less

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.520 
than the tea bag because it takes less
time<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.430> freeze<00:02:37.910> as<00:02:38.209> you<00:02:38.329> can<00:02:38.480> see<00:02:38.660> I<00:02:38.690> just<00:02:39.079> put

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
time to freeze as you can see I just put

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.740 
time to freeze as you can see I just put
it<00:02:39.769> in<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:40.130> it's<00:02:40.220> already<00:02:40.400> frozen<00:02:40.850> it's

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
it in and it's already frozen it's

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.559 
it in and it's already frozen it's
really<00:02:42.019> foggy<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:43.100> all<00:02:43.310> of<00:02:43.430> that<00:02:43.459> so<00:02:43.880> what
