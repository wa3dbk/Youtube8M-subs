thunder for fire blasts it's 85 which is
a<00:02:38.070> bit<00:02:38.250> higher<00:02:38.460> and<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:42.000> other<00:02:42.150> one<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.450> forgot

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
a bit higher and the other one I forgot

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.600 
a bit higher and the other one I forgot
what<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:45.120> other<00:02:45.330> one<00:02:45.540> which<00:02:45.600> is

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
what it is the other one which is

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.520 
what it is the other one which is
blizzard<00:02:47.610> I'm<00:02:47.970> pretty<00:02:48.600> sure<00:02:48.750> it's<00:02:48.870> also<00:02:49.020> 70

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
blizzard I'm pretty sure it's also 70

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.860
