this<00:00:05.680> is<00:00:05.800> a<00:00:05.830> sea<00:00:06.040> lamprey<00:00:06.460> this<00:00:06.640> is<00:00:06.790> the<00:00:06.970> focus

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:07.930 
this is a sea lamprey this is the focus

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.759 
this is a sea lamprey this is the focus
of<00:00:08.309> one<00:00:09.309> of<00:00:09.429> the<00:00:09.490> foci<00:00:09.910> of<00:00:09.970> this<00:00:10.540> study<00:00:10.809> and<00:00:11.470> we

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:11.769 
of one of the foci of this study and we

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:13.290 
of one of the foci of this study and we
just<00:00:11.950> happen<00:00:12.220> to<00:00:12.250> catch<00:00:12.430> one<00:00:12.700> in<00:00:12.790> our<00:00:12.880> electro

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:13.300 
just happen to catch one in our electro

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.850 
just happen to catch one in our electro
fishing<00:00:13.450> site<00:00:13.840> but<00:00:14.080> normally<00:00:14.470> we<00:00:14.500> go<00:00:14.679> on<00:00:14.830> a

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
fishing site but normally we go on a

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.210 
fishing site but normally we go on a
lamprey<00:00:15.760> Safari<00:00:16.179> and<00:00:16.510> walk<00:00:17.019> most<00:00:17.679> or<00:00:17.919> all<00:00:17.949> the

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
lamprey Safari and walk most or all the

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:25.460 
lamprey Safari and walk most or all the
stream<00:00:18.489> each<00:00:18.730> day<00:00:18.939> and<00:00:19.179> capture<00:00:20.050> them

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.249 

and<00:00:26.009> we<00:00:26.099> tag<00:00:26.340> them<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.599> follow<00:00:27.630> them<00:00:28.080> and

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:28.259 
and we tag them and I follow them and

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.439 
and we tag them and I follow them and
try<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.560> recapture<00:00:28.949> as<00:00:29.189> many<00:00:29.369> as<00:00:29.519> we<00:00:29.640> can<00:00:29.820> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
try to recapture as many as we can the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.520 
try to recapture as many as we can the
biggest<00:00:31.289> question<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.780> just<00:00:33.780> how<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.110> dam

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
biggest question is just how the dam

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.189 
biggest question is just how the dam
removal<00:00:35.340> has<00:00:35.699> affected<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.750> lamprey

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
removal has affected the lamprey

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:39.170 
removal has affected the lamprey
population<00:00:37.829> over<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.100> years<00:00:38.430> they're

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
population over the years they're

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.119 
population over the years they're
naturally<00:00:40.110> here<00:00:40.559> but<00:00:40.739> when<00:00:40.829> we<00:00:40.890> put<00:00:41.040> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
naturally here but when we put the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.530 
naturally here but when we put the
damned<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.519> we<00:00:41.610> block<00:00:41.850> them<00:00:42.030> off<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.420> they

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
damned in we block them off so they

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.970 
damned in we block them off so they
haven't<00:00:42.690> been<00:00:42.930> here<00:00:43.140> for<00:00:43.199> however<00:00:43.589> long<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
haven't been here for however long the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.829 
haven't been here for however long the
dam<00:00:44.190> spin<00:00:44.489> up<00:00:44.610> but<00:00:44.820> now<00:00:44.909> the<00:00:44.970> dams<00:00:45.300> down<00:00:45.510> there

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:45.839 
dam spin up but now the dams down there

dam spin up but now the dams down there
slowly<00:00:46.079> being<00:00:46.409> there<00:00:47.190> slowly<00:00:47.370> coming<00:00:47.699> back<00:00:47.790> up

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
slowly being there slowly coming back up

this<00:01:18.969> is<00:01:19.090> my<00:01:19.210> first<00:01:19.539> field<00:01:19.929> job<00:01:20.200> so<00:01:20.380> it's<00:01:20.500> like

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
this is my first field job so it's like

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.380 
this is my first field job so it's like
really<00:01:20.950> it's<00:01:21.280> a<00:01:21.340> lot<00:01:21.490> of<00:01:21.579> new<00:01:21.670> experiences<00:01:22.060> for

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
really it's a lot of new experiences for

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.359 
really it's a lot of new experiences for
me<00:01:22.600> I<00:01:22.780> know<00:01:23.170> on<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:23.619> days<00:01:23.770> where<00:01:23.950> we<00:01:23.979> get<00:01:24.130> to<00:01:24.219> go

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
me I know on the days where we get to go

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.999 
me I know on the days where we get to go
out<00:01:24.579> we<00:01:24.759> normally<00:01:25.060> work<00:01:25.719> long<00:01:26.110> days<00:01:26.380> like<00:01:26.860> at

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
out we normally work long days like at

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.999 
out we normally work long days like at
least<00:01:27.159> eight<00:01:27.369> hours<00:01:27.399> maybe<00:01:28.030> longer<00:01:28.799> but<00:01:29.799> like

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
least eight hours maybe longer but like

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:31.020 
least eight hours maybe longer but like
you<00:01:30.130> don't<00:01:30.159> really<00:01:30.369> notice<00:01:30.670> it<00:01:30.909> because

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
you don't really notice it because

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.099 
you don't really notice it because
you're<00:01:31.299> always<00:01:31.479> working<00:01:31.689> you're<00:01:31.960> always

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:32.109 
you're always working you're always

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:33.809 
you're always working you're always
doing<00:01:32.289> this<00:01:32.530> or<00:01:32.859> that<00:01:33.039> you<00:01:33.280> know<00:01:33.369> setting<00:01:33.700> up

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:33.819 
doing this or that you know setting up

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:37.669 
doing this or that you know setting up
net<00:01:34.060> or<00:01:34.299> electro<00:01:34.719> fishing<00:01:34.929> or<00:01:35.439> counting<00:01:36.219> nests

net or electro fishing or counting nests

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:40.980 
net or electro fishing or counting nests
there<00:01:38.679> are<00:01:38.770> these<00:01:38.860> guys<00:01:39.360> don't<00:01:40.360> have<00:01:40.509> true

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
there are these guys don't have true

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.510 
there are these guys don't have true
jaws<00:01:41.819> but<00:01:42.819> instead<00:01:43.209> they've<00:01:44.079> got<00:01:44.380> this<00:01:45.189> sort

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
jaws but instead they've got this sort

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.510 
jaws but instead they've got this sort
of<00:01:45.579> sucker<00:01:46.060> disk<00:01:46.390> and<00:01:46.689> inside<00:01:47.619> there<00:01:48.490> are

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
of sucker disk and inside there are

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.999 
of sucker disk and inside there are
these<00:01:48.700> concentric<00:01:49.209> rows<00:01:49.509> of<00:01:49.899> carrot<00:01:50.829> not

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
these concentric rows of carrot not

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.039 
these concentric rows of carrot not
keratinized<00:01:51.610> productions<00:01:52.239> no<00:01:52.750> teeth

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
keratinized productions no teeth

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.740 
keratinized productions no teeth
basically<00:01:53.709> so<00:01:54.369> a<00:01:54.399> combination<00:01:54.729> of<00:01:55.239> those

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
basically so a combination of those

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.199 
basically so a combination of those
teeth<00:01:56.140> and<00:01:56.380> that<00:01:56.470> rasping<00:01:56.950> tongue<00:01:57.220> they<00:01:58.030> use

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209 
teeth and that rasping tongue they use

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:00.149 
teeth and that rasping tongue they use
to<00:01:58.390> feed<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:59.079> parasitize<00:01:59.679> other<00:01:59.890> fish

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
to feed the parasitize other fish

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.190 
to feed the parasitize other fish
they're<00:02:00.700> really<00:02:01.060> sort<00:02:01.630> of<00:02:01.689> like<00:02:01.840> a<00:02:01.869> living

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
they're really sort of like a living

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.870 
they're really sort of like a living
fossil<00:02:02.349> they're<00:02:02.709> very<00:02:02.950> ancient<00:02:03.189> group<00:02:05.880> we

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
fossil they're very ancient group we

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.479 
fossil they're very ancient group we
also<00:02:07.090> just<00:02:07.649> try<00:02:08.649> and<00:02:08.709> answer<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:09.099> few<00:02:09.310> other

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
also just try and answer a few other

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.910 
also just try and answer a few other
questions<00:02:09.670> like<00:02:10.209> when<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:10.959> lamprey<00:02:11.709> are

questions like when the lamprey are
spotting<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:12.970> kind<00:02:13.180> of<00:02:13.269> turning<00:02:13.599> up<00:02:13.690> all<00:02:13.870> the

spotting and kind of turning up all the
sediment<00:02:14.170> like<00:02:14.620> how<00:02:15.340> does<00:02:15.519> that<00:02:15.640> affect<00:02:16.030> other

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
organisms in the stream and we've been

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.440 
organisms in the stream and we've been
kind<00:02:20.349> of<00:02:20.379> picking<00:02:20.680> through<00:02:21.030> drift<00:02:22.030> samples

the lamprey as opposed to that would

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.160 
the lamprey as opposed to that would
just<00:02:30.549> float<00:02:30.760> down<00:02:30.940> naturally<00:02:31.180> we've<00:02:31.959> seen
