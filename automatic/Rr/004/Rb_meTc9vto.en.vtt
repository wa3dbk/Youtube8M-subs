00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.800
 ready friend since it is tight 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.800
 please 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.820
 Remember that you will not do it anymore 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.320
 once you have to do it 1 2 3 4 5 and 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:20.130
 then we will do the same in the 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.130
 connecting rods since the tightening is loosened 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.100
 which if we do the same 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.030
 we are fine the screws appear and 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:47.230
 we are going to use them 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:51.820
 to have them as support to be able 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.820
 hit that we grab 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:01.110
 it is already removed it serves as it was there 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.110
 marked 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:11.780
 truth and what we do 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:15.289
 let's check you should be inside 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.540
 the tolerance here comes the measurement we go 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:22.530
 Let's see 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:25.290
 here is 2 thousandths here would be this 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:32.479
 you see here are the whites that 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.479
 will be point 0 0 15 11 and a half thousandth 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.450
 light or space that space that is 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:44.610
 it covers the oil remember that the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:47.310
 oil is what prevents metal from colliding 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.450
 with goals and puts the oil very thick not 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.270
 it happens if they put very thin oil that does not 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.990
 cover well and start hitting true 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.740
 now as we remove it by any 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.740
 solvent
