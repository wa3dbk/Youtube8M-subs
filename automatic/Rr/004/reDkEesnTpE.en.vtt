wouldn't<00:00:09.240> it<00:00:09.269> be<00:00:09.330> completely<00:00:09.900> awesome<00:00:10.260> it

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
wouldn't it be completely awesome it

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.499 
wouldn't it be completely awesome it
just<00:00:10.830> seamlessly<00:00:11.370> it<00:00:11.700> was<00:00:11.820> automatically

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
just seamlessly it was automatically

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:22.220

strong across our desk we're eliminating
with<00:00:32.250> one<00:00:32.520> technology<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.390> that's<00:00:33.540> why<00:00:33.719> I

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
with one technology and that's why I

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.260 
with one technology and that's why I
let's<00:00:34.050> take<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> bit<00:00:34.440> not<00:00:35.010> only<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.399> amazingly

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
let's take a bit not only a amazingly

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.690 
let's take a bit not only a amazingly
secure<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.170> also<00:00:37.500> localized<00:00:38.070> connection<00:00:38.610> so

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
secure and also localized connection so

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.280 
secure and also localized connection so
you<00:00:38.790> can<00:00:38.940> use<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.329> high<00:00:39.480> dense<00:00:39.719> areas<00:00:40.110> like

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
you can use it in high dense areas like

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.430 
you can use it in high dense areas like
an<00:00:40.410> office<00:00:40.770> but<00:00:41.340> also<00:00:41.910> extremely<00:00:42.750> fast<00:00:43.290> and

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
an office but also extremely fast and

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.529 
an office but also extremely fast and
high-performing<00:00:44.129> over<00:00:44.460> three<00:00:44.910> times<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
high-performing over three times the

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.080 
high-performing over three times the
performance<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:46.230> today's<00:00:46.469> Wi-Fi<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.489> while

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
performance of today's Wi-Fi so while

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.819 
performance of today's Wi-Fi so while
that's<00:00:48.329> really<00:00:48.629> cool<00:00:48.809> we<00:00:49.110> still<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.530> one

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
that's really cool we still have one

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.680 
that's really cool we still have one
more<00:00:49.980> cord<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.489> we<00:00:50.610> have<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:50.879> our<00:00:50.969> bag<00:00:51.180> and

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
more cord that we have in our bag and

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.049 
more cord that we have in our bag and
let's<00:00:51.899> get<00:00:52.079> rid<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.559> ditch<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.129> break<00:00:53.820> I

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
let's get rid of it ditch that break I

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.670 
let's get rid of it ditch that break I
guess<00:00:54.390> would<00:00:54.510> be<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.899> one<00:00:55.140> we<00:00:55.260> want<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.530> talk

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
guess would be the one we want to talk

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.500 
guess would be the one we want to talk
about<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.670> last<00:00:56.940> thing<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.300> weightless

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
about so that last thing this weightless

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.450 
about so that last thing this weightless
down<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.050> wireless<00:00:58.590> power<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.129> just<00:00:59.309> like

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
down is wireless power and just like

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.479 
down is wireless power and just like
Kurt<00:00:59.699> said<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:01.500> ease<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.980> use<00:01:02.219> and

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
Kurt said the ease of use and

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.130 
Kurt said the ease of use and
installation<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.270> we<00:01:03.390> have<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.780> really

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
installation that we have is really

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.320 
installation that we have is really
going<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.439> be<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> huge<00:01:05.369> advantage<00:01:05.580> for<00:01:05.909> rehab

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
going to be a huge advantage for rehab

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.760 
going to be a huge advantage for rehab
and<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.600> residents<00:01:07.080> technology<00:01:07.590> we're

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
and the residents technology we're

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.039 
and the residents technology we're
talking<00:01:08.100> about<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.420> installed<00:01:09.869> in

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
talking about so I have installed in

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.080 
talking about so I have installed in
just<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.380> standard<00:01:10.770> wooden<00:01:11.490> table<00:01:11.909> and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
just the standard wooden table and

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.179 
just the standard wooden table and
transmitter<00:01:12.900> underneath<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.710> table<00:01:14.070> and

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
transmitter underneath the table and

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.830 
transmitter underneath the table and
we're<00:01:14.369> actually<00:01:14.549> able<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.030> go<00:01:15.240> up<00:01:15.360> through<00:01:15.600> 2

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
we're actually able to go up through 2

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.570 
we're actually able to go up through 2
inches<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.409> material<00:01:16.500> by<00:01:17.070> using<00:01:17.310> this

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
inches of material by using this

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.810 
inches of material by using this
technology<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.869> when<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:19.890> go<00:01:20.159> ahead<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.640> move

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
technology so when I go ahead and move

earpiece I want to go ahead and put down
a<00:01:39.750> couple<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.560> bones<00:01:40.860> but<00:01:41.610> also<00:01:41.850> what<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.360> think

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
a couple of bones but also what we think

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.940 
a couple of bones but also what we think
is<00:01:42.659> really<00:01:42.810> cool<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.320> technology<00:01:43.860> it

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
is really cool is this technology it

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.530 
is really cool is this technology it
doesn't<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.490> be<00:01:44.610> built-in<00:01:45.060> do<00:01:45.240> we<00:01:45.360> have

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
doesn't have to be built-in do we have

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.200 
doesn't have to be built-in do we have
it<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:45.840> seamlessly<00:01:46.470> integrated<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.820> small

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
it so seamlessly integrated and so small

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.760 
it so seamlessly integrated and so small
and<00:01:48.390> simple<00:01:48.600> we<00:01:48.869> can<00:01:48.899> actually<00:01:49.380> have<00:01:49.560> this

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
and simple we can actually have this

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.350 
and simple we can actually have this
retrofitted<00:01:50.610> into<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> cases<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.869> we

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
retrofitted into the cases that we

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.420 
retrofitted into the cases that we
our<00:01:52.450> devices<00:01:52.750> carrying<00:01:53.200> around<00:01:53.320> it<00:01:53.710> so<00:01:54.190> just

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
our devices carrying around it so just

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.010 
our devices carrying around it so just
like<00:01:54.640> that<00:01:54.670> when<00:01:55.060> I<00:01:55.090> go<00:01:55.270> ahead<00:01:55.570> and<00:01:55.660> put<00:01:55.840> him

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
like that when I go ahead and put him

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.880 
like that when I go ahead and put him
down<00:01:57.570> he's<00:01:58.570> gonna<00:01:58.750> go<00:01:58.960> ahead<00:01:59.110> and<00:01:59.290> blink<00:01:59.710> up

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
down he's gonna go ahead and blink up

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.410 
down he's gonna go ahead and blink up
there<00:02:00.160> and<00:02:00.340> then<00:02:00.490> I'll<00:02:00.640> I<00:02:00.670> know<00:02:00.940> he's<00:02:01.120> getting

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
there and then I'll I know he's getting

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.970 
there and then I'll I know he's getting
it<00:02:01.540> charged<00:02:01.900> and<00:02:02.170> I<00:02:02.200> can<00:02:02.380> also<00:02:02.530> do<00:02:02.860> these

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
it charged and I can also do these

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.370 
it charged and I can also do these
multiple<00:02:03.550> devices<00:02:03.820> here<00:02:04.150> well<00:02:04.420> but<00:02:04.660> we<00:02:05.260> don't

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
multiple devices here well but we don't

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.600 
multiple devices here well but we don't
want<00:02:05.650> to<00:02:05.710> stop<00:02:06.040> there

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
want to stop there

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.200 
want to stop there
I<00:02:06.640> can<00:02:06.910> also<00:02:07.180> charge<00:02:07.690> with<00:02:07.930> enough<00:02:08.229> power<00:02:09.210> all

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
I can also charge with enough power all

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.210 
I can also charge with enough power all
my<00:02:10.450> devices<00:02:10.660> all<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.320> way<00:02:11.410> up<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:11.740> laptop

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
my devices all the way up to the laptop

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.220 
my devices all the way up to the laptop
so<00:02:12.520> charging<00:02:13.650> now<00:02:14.650> charging<00:02:15.160> charging<00:02:16.230> not

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
so charging now charging charging not

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:25.690 
so charging now charging charging not
charge<00:02:17.560> this<00:02:17.740> is<00:02:17.890> really<00:02:18.190> super<00:02:18.580> simple

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.910 

after<00:02:26.120> meeting<00:02:26.270> developers<00:02:26.870> out<00:02:27.050> there<00:02:27.080> this

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
after meeting developers out there this

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.700 
after meeting developers out there this
is<00:02:28.100> how<00:02:28.220> simple<00:02:28.670> it<00:02:28.790> is<00:02:28.820> we<00:02:29.570> have<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.960> red<00:02:30.560> that

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
is how simple it is we have the red that

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.900 
is how simple it is we have the red that
receiver<00:02:31.130> that<00:02:31.400> you're<00:02:31.490> going<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.640> put<00:02:31.820> in

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
receiver that you're going to put in

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.610 
receiver that you're going to put in
your<00:02:32.000> client<00:02:32.300> devices<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:33.200> here's<00:02:33.440> how

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
your client devices and here's how

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.260 
your client devices and here's how
you're<00:02:33.800> going<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:33.980> make<00:02:34.160> your<00:02:34.340> docks<00:02:34.580> so<00:02:34.910> we

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
you're going to make your docks so we

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.000 
you're going to make your docks so we
can't<00:02:35.480> wait<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.870> see<00:02:36.080> when<00:02:36.290> your<00:02:36.470> innovation

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
can't wait to see when your innovation

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.860 
can't wait to see when your innovation
and<00:02:37.160> creativity<00:02:37.580> is<00:02:38.210> going<00:02:38.300> to<00:02:38.480> be<00:02:38.630> able<00:02:38.720> to

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
and creativity is going to be able to

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.330 
and creativity is going to be able to
create<00:02:39.080> this<00:02:39.320> last<00:02:39.620> mile<00:02:40.010> through<00:02:40.280> this
