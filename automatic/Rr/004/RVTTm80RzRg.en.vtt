00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
look one-off like this when the stairs

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.690 
look one-off like this when the stairs
went<00:03:43.590> off<00:03:43.680> they<00:03:43.890> kind<00:03:44.100> of<00:03:44.130> give<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.310> a<00:03:44.489> rough

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
went off they kind of give it a rough

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.110 
went off they kind of give it a rough
feeling<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.840> it's<00:03:46.019> how<00:03:46.170> I<00:03:46.200> did<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.530> roof

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
feeling and it's how I did the roof

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.490 
feeling and it's how I did the roof
these<00:03:48.120> are<00:03:48.269> wooden<00:03:48.450> planks<00:03:48.930> right<00:03:49.049> here<00:03:49.350> and

these are wooden planks right here and

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.319 
these are wooden planks right here and
then<00:03:49.620> it<00:03:50.280> was<00:03:50.400> basically<00:03:50.730> build<00:03:51.000> wooden

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
then it was basically build wooden

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.569 
then it was basically build wooden
stairs<00:03:51.540> going<00:03:51.780> up<00:03:52.049> and<00:03:52.350> then<00:03:53.250> put<00:03:53.400> wooden

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
stairs going up and then put wooden

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.000 
stairs going up and then put wooden
planks<00:03:53.910> down<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.150> middle<00:03:54.530> let<00:03:55.530> me<00:03:55.620> jump<00:03:55.829> off

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010
