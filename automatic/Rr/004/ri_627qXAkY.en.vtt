00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:13.569
 the 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:17.419
 the animal 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.020
 he is with his chest what is good for me and can I go there myself 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.480
 certainly say also comes from seeing 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.440
 valverde orie have fallen off fine I have you put food with me that's true 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:35.100
 this video about food and food is important but above all very tasty 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.380
 some people who watch what they eat 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.510
 and that's good but some people a little indoor that is 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.820
 not good from this region eighth groups is on 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.930
 now it is natural 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.400
 the substance 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.470
 possible 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.470
 groningen and friesland when I'm doing 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.550
 I only have 9 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.550
 cycling team where the republicans socialize 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.040
 what I try to say is that it is only purely biologically responsible 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.299
 I know that it is purely biologically responsible regional transport 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.299
 Yes please 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.950
 but 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.950
 adoboli candy 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.900

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.789
 mh 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.520
 I was killed by the stress that you have of watching what you stand 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.520
 of the actual eating maybe i'm very superficial but 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.490
 I hope for a better you must of course 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.300
 but of course you have to eat everything in moderation, although some people do 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.550
 know more than others because they just have a better combustion there 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.800
 they become less fat if they eat more 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.800

 walter food 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.109
 therefore has 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:14.279
 the conclusion that I just wanted as much space on the offer from each other picked up 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:17.279
 it was already possible to put it back on its feet 

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:21.909
 happiness as I have not been the only thing I did for a long time 7 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.559
 it does 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:24.420
 as 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.659
 pay attention to the present you have to eat healthy but 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:32.650
 little color taste chairs and added things year is in it and 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.519
 you have to be a bit careful but 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.519
 you don't have to 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:42.650
 it should not be the only one that deals in life all you the 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:44.549
 have children 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.199
 Gertjan Verbeek is being lengthened being investors look at it 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:49.960
 not properly guaranteed in the past 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.040
 ella 5 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.959
 what is trackbacken 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.870
 I can make this period I would like to be able to log in I was 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.649

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:03.089
 yes i was necessary were this week going to work then can namely also 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:04.949
 no rules according to 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:06.959
 for the first moment of the year 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.729
 the figures are thus the explanation of the way there were 

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:13.729
 we attach 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:18.099
 if i really great that this effective 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.820
 now we are talking about a press release after one year 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.470
 that led to a parody of such interest 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:29.900
 The cost of this is that this video cannot be displayed correctly but 

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:33.430
 gradually consider what will become fairly new video in the coming weeks 

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:34.309
 sympathetic 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:35.319
 I'm going on

 it doesn't come in 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.100
 afterwards that is clear from the question where 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.599
 so yes I do 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.809
 if I like what you think leaves a comment and not all I would 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:03.719
 say come on and not posted either 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:07.899
 I too have been excluded here from all 27 eu countries that you 

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:10.859
 All of them were not paid would put providers arguing for this in this video 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:15.159
 for a very meaningful also very nice to make and then I am going to the 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:16.629
 video from the tradition 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:19.629
