00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.599
 as Ukrainian by their actions 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.330
 the government performs Minsk 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.310
 arrangements do you mean 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.600
 concrete actions before application 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.270
 heavy artillery 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.830
 shelling residential areas where do you 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.960
 happening in the vicinity of Donetsk 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.779
 doesn't it happen you want 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.550
 say it doesn't happen i just 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.290
 I asked because of course I had 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.790
 place horrible incidents i wanted 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.860
 clarify whether you specifically 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.899
 ask but already a few days on 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.379
 bus stop in Donetsk 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.050
 There are shelling in Donetsk this morning 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.879
 ok keep up the attitude 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.770
 of today's incident at the stop in 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.140
 Donetsk mission searches carried out 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.870
 investigation and of course we call 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.820
 all parties to promote this process 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.559
 we know that representatives of both i 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.899
 visited the scene and 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.390
 submit your report when installed 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.150
 all the facts and this confirms again 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.560
 the need for speedy execution 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.570
 agreements reached yesterday on 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.299
 meeting in norman format in berlin 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.640
 with the participation of representatives of Russia Ukraine 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.560
 France and Germany I would say that 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.210
 violates the agreement mainly 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.700
 the Russian side is separatists 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.799
 Supported Russia, I say for example 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.430
 about moving artillery and military 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.350
 technology 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.110
 I want to remind you that events are happening 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.299
 in the territory of Ukraine which protects 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.470
 their land also has a lot of political 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.930
 prisoners 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.000
 that is, the Russian side and the separatists 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.869
 supported Russia must take 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 a series of steps 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.560
 but we certainly look forward to doing 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.810
 arrangements from both parties 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.790
 I am not talking only about this one 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.689
 the incident shelling is going now 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.549
 several days 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.210
 do these actions match 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.890
 requirements of the Minsk agreements if 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.049
 just do not generalize and it is always dangerous 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.570
 when it is not about any 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.159
 specific actions in general, Russia 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.110
 that is, the separatists supported 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.170
 Russia illegally enter the territory 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.090
 Ukraine including Donetsk Ukraine has 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.459
 obligations and of course the right to 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.410
 protection of our land no doubt we expect 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.860
 implementation of the Minsk agreements from 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.840
 both sides in reality we are from 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.060
 we are not observing from the Russian side yet 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.810
 we see only words not confirmed 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.430
 by actions 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.530
 if you want to discuss more 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.230
 concrete actions I would love to 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.420
 I will answer you and ask specifically about 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.880
 the actions of the Ukrainian authorities tell them 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.890
 comply with the Minsk agreements you do not 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.570
 ask about specific incidents 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.570
 so I will limit the above said 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.600
 no confirmation but ready to confirm 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.400
 something like this commented 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.440
 representative of the us state department 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.570
 the Ukrainian president about how in his 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.350
 The country is 9 thousand Russian 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.450
 military 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.370
 At the same time, Jen psaki noted that 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.500
 washington see rising violence on 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.120
 East Ukraine and responsibility for this 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.850
 separatists who according to her 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:03.260
 capture all new territories we 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.300
 have seen the message that Russia 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.370
 sent 2 tactical to Ukraine 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.660
 battalion we have no extra 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.760
 information or independent 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.860
 confirmation but we certainly saw 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.989
 this and we can confirm the move 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.610
 tank armored vehicles artillery shells and 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.530
 other military equipment in punta 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.450
 basing near the borders of Russia Ukraine 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.860
 from where it transports for transfer 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.860
 pro-Russian separatists
