00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
sure it's a little bit dangerous isn't

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.810 
sure it's a little bit dangerous isn't
it<00:01:30.390> with<00:01:30.659> blades<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.530> reindeer<00:01:32.009> up<00:01:32.250> there<00:01:32.460> now

it with blades and reindeer up there now

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.550 
it with blades and reindeer up there now
you're<00:01:33.090> pretty<00:01:33.210> safe<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.960> reindeer<00:01:34.259> rely<00:01:34.530> on

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
you're pretty safe the reindeer rely on

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.109 
you're pretty safe the reindeer rely on
their<00:01:34.860> lead<00:01:35.070> reindeer<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.640> guide<00:01:35.850> them<00:01:36.030> in

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
through the back of the turbine so they

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.749 
through the back of the turbine so they
don't<00:01:37.590> get<00:01:37.710> help<00:01:37.890> or<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.100> blades<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.610> it
