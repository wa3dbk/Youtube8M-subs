00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.690 

one<00:02:02.420> just<00:02:02.750> wasn't<00:02:03.110> enough<00:02:03.290> for<00:02:03.560> me<00:02:03.680> so<00:02:04.640> I

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
one just wasn't enough for me so I

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.250 
one just wasn't enough for me so I
bumped<00:02:05.030> it<00:02:05.120> up<00:02:05.210> a<00:02:05.330> little<00:02:05.450> bit<00:02:05.690> now<00:02:05.960> I'm<00:02:06.080> doing

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
bumped it up a little bit now I'm doing

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.760

good

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
good

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.460

to<00:02:07.670> control<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.210> amps<00:02:08.630> that's<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:09.050> only

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
to control the amps that's the only

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.410 
to control the amps that's the only
reason<00:02:09.830> I'm<00:02:09.950> using<00:02:10.160> a<00:02:10.369> pulse<00:02:10.610> width<00:02:10.850> modifier

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.330 
reason I'm using a pulse width modifier
is<00:02:12.170> to<00:02:12.380> control<00:02:12.710> the<00:02:12.770> amps<00:02:13.250> get<00:02:13.790> you<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:13.970> 30<00:02:14.420> amp

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
is to control the amps get you a 30 amp

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.030 
is to control the amps get you a 30 amp
pulse<00:02:16.340> width<00:02:16.610> modifier<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:18.260> want<00:02:18.770> something

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
pulse width modifier you want something

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.540 
pulse width modifier you want something
that<00:02:19.130> can<00:02:19.160> run<00:02:19.430> continuously<00:02:19.670> up<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.920> these<00:02:21.920> 25

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
that can run continuously up to these 25

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.790 
that can run continuously up to these 25
amps<00:02:23.680> 20<00:02:24.680> amps<00:02:24.980> will<00:02:25.070> do<00:02:25.280> but<00:02:26.020> 30<00:02:27.020> amp<00:02:27.260> maxing

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
amps 20 amps will do but 30 amp maxing

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.590 
amps 20 amps will do but 30 amp maxing
this<00:02:27.980> is<00:02:28.160> what<00:02:28.310> they<00:02:28.430> call<00:02:28.640> them<00:02:28.790> but<00:02:28.970> this<00:02:29.390> one

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
this is what they call them but this one

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
this is what they call them but this one
around<00:02:29.900> 30<00:02:30.140> amps<00:02:30.410> continuous<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:32.320> 30<00:02:33.320> amp

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
around 30 amps continuous and 30 amp

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.370 
around 30 amps continuous and 30 amp
inline<00:02:34.010> fuse<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:35.450> protect<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:35.900> pulse<00:02:36.110> width

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
inline fuse to protect the pulse width

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.780 
inline fuse to protect the pulse width
modifier<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.160> all<00:02:37.280> that<00:02:37.460> stuff<00:02:37.700> your<00:02:38.480> relay

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
modifier and all that stuff your relay

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.330 
modifier and all that stuff your relay
so<00:02:40.790> there<00:02:41.510> you<00:02:41.630> go<00:02:41.810> 70<00:02:42.470> bucks<00:02:42.680> get<00:02:43.040> rid<00:02:43.160> of<00:02:43.250> that

so there you go 70 bucks get rid of that

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.830 
so there you go 70 bucks get rid of that
