Jolteon set that I really enjoy using
and<00:00:09.010> think<00:00:09.370> has<00:00:09.550> a<00:00:09.580> lot<00:00:09.820> of<00:00:09.849> potential<00:00:10.300> in<00:00:10.630> the

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
let's get to looking at its typing

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.439 
let's get to looking at its typing
ability<00:00:15.670> and<00:00:15.880> stats<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:18.279> first<00:00:18.490> off<00:00:18.699> Jolteon

ability and stats so first off Jolteon
is<00:00:19.659> the<00:00:19.960> mono<00:00:20.349> electric<00:00:20.980> evolution<00:00:21.820> that's

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:22.419 
is the mono electric evolution that's

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.870 
is the mono electric evolution that's
been<00:00:22.659> around<00:00:22.749> since<00:00:23.289> generation<00:00:24.099> 1<00:00:24.310> and<00:00:24.550> has

overall it gets the abilities volt
absorb<00:00:29.919> and<00:00:30.159> quick<00:00:30.489> feet<00:00:30.730> and<00:00:31.110> the<00:00:32.110> first<00:00:32.410> one

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.560 
absorb and quick feet and the first one

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.439 
absorb and quick feet and the first one
volt<00:00:32.770> absorb<00:00:33.130> is<00:00:33.310> an<00:00:33.520> excellent<00:00:33.820> ability<00:00:34.120> to

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449 
volt absorb is an excellent ability to

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:36.389 
volt absorb is an excellent ability to
have<00:00:34.660> because<00:00:35.289> it<00:00:35.469> gives<00:00:35.649> you<00:00:35.769> an<00:00:35.890> immunity<00:00:36.309> to

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
have because it gives you an immunity to

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.720 
have because it gives you an immunity to
electric<00:00:37.000> moves<00:00:37.239> and<00:00:37.510> also<00:00:38.140> recovers<00:00:38.670> 25%<00:00:39.670> of

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
electric moves and also recovers 25% of

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.400 
electric moves and also recovers 25% of
her<00:00:39.789> health<00:00:40.000> every<00:00:40.480> time<00:00:40.690> you<00:00:40.840> would<00:00:41.019> be<00:00:41.079> hit

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
her health every time you would be hit

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.560 
her health every time you would be hit
by<00:00:41.590> an<00:00:41.739> electric<00:00:42.100> attack<00:00:42.219> which<00:00:43.179> is<00:00:43.210> really

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
by an electric attack which is really

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.400 
by an electric attack which is really
great<00:00:43.809> because<00:00:44.399> Jolteon<00:00:45.399> really<00:00:45.670> isn't<00:00:45.850> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
great because Jolteon really isn't the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.900 
great because Jolteon really isn't the
most<00:00:47.410> offensive<00:00:47.739> pokemon<00:00:48.339> in<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:48.550> world<00:00:48.730> it

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
most offensive pokemon in the world it

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.060 
most offensive pokemon in the world it
doesn't<00:00:49.210> really<00:00:49.629> have<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:49.899> highest<00:00:50.079> HP<00:00:50.410> ever

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
doesn't really have the highest HP ever

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.520 
doesn't really have the highest HP ever
it's<00:00:51.370> more<00:00:51.550> of<00:00:51.579> an<00:00:51.699> attacker<00:00:52.030> so<00:00:52.660> any<00:00:53.019> type<00:00:53.499> of

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
it's more of an attacker so any type of

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.709 
it's more of an attacker so any type of
immunity<00:00:54.100> you<00:00:54.339> can<00:00:54.519> have<00:00:54.699> on<00:00:54.879> it<00:00:55.059> as<00:00:55.210> well<00:00:55.539> as

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
immunity you can have on it as well as

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:57.479 
immunity you can have on it as well as
being<00:00:56.079> able<00:00:56.170> to<00:00:56.289> recover<00:00:56.530> life<00:00:56.859> from<00:00:57.100> it<00:00:57.309> is

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
being able to recover life from it is

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.209 
being able to recover life from it is
really<00:00:57.850> excellent<00:00:58.179> ability<00:00:58.780> to<00:00:58.870> have<00:00:59.019> as<00:00:59.679> for

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
really excellent ability to have as for

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:01.979 
really excellent ability to have as for
its<00:01:00.339> dribbled<00:01:00.670> ability<00:01:00.969> quick<00:01:01.210> feet<00:01:01.390> it's

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
its dribbled ability quick feet it's

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.049 
its dribbled ability quick feet it's
really<00:01:02.230> not<00:01:02.320> as<00:01:02.530> usable<00:01:02.920> on<00:01:03.070> Jolteon<00:01:03.550> mainly

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
really not as usable on Jolteon mainly

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.310 
really not as usable on Jolteon mainly
because<00:01:04.210> of<00:01:04.360> the<00:01:04.510> fact<00:01:04.750> that<00:01:04.870> it's<00:01:05.110> just

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
because of the fact that it's just

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.610 
because of the fact that it's just
incredibly<00:01:05.920> fast<00:01:06.220> as<00:01:06.460> it<00:01:06.670> is<00:01:07.020> 130<00:01:08.020> base<00:01:08.260> speed

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
incredibly fast as it is 130 base speed

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.230 
incredibly fast as it is 130 base speed
is<00:01:08.800> one<00:01:08.950> of<00:01:09.040> the<00:01:09.130> highest<00:01:09.490> in<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.670> game<00:01:09.940> and

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
is one of the highest in the game and

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.810 
is one of the highest in the game and
even<00:01:11.200> without<00:01:11.440> the<00:01:11.770> quick<00:01:12.010> feed<00:01:12.370> ability

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
even without the quick feed ability

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.920 
even without the quick feed ability
you're<00:01:13.030> pretty<00:01:13.270> much<00:01:13.450> going<00:01:13.630> to<00:01:13.690> be<00:01:13.750> out

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
you're pretty much going to be out

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.990 
you're pretty much going to be out
speeding<00:01:14.350> a<00:01:14.680> lot<00:01:15.040> of<00:01:15.220> things<00:01:15.460> that<00:01:15.700> you<00:01:15.850> run

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
speeding a lot of things that you run

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.590 
speeding a lot of things that you run
into<00:01:16.920> while<00:01:17.920> quick<00:01:18.190> feet<00:01:18.400> could<00:01:18.610> be<00:01:18.640> usable<00:01:19.360> to

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
into while quick feet could be usable to

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.960 
into while quick feet could be usable to
be<00:01:20.050> ridiculously<00:01:21.010> fast<00:01:21.310> and<00:01:21.640> basically

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
be ridiculously fast and basically

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.420 
be ridiculously fast and basically
nothing<00:01:22.450> out<00:01:22.570> speed<00:01:22.840> you<00:01:22.990> at<00:01:23.110> all<00:01:23.290> fold<00:01:24.040> absorb

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
nothing out speed you at all fold absorb

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.100 
nothing out speed you at all fold absorb
is<00:01:24.610> my<00:01:24.820> opinion<00:01:25.240> is<00:01:25.390> a<00:01:25.420> lot<00:01:25.630> better<00:01:25.870> just

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
is my opinion is a lot better just

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.450 
is my opinion is a lot better just
because<00:01:26.320> it<00:01:26.440> gives<00:01:26.590> you<00:01:26.680> that<00:01:26.770> immunity<00:01:27.160> and

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
because it gives you that immunity and

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.760 
because it gives you that immunity and
that<00:01:27.730> chance<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.300> recover<00:01:28.630> HP<00:01:28.900> when<00:01:29.530> you<00:01:29.620> can

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
that chance to recover HP when you can

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.470 
that chance to recover HP when you can
come<00:01:29.980> in<00:01:30.160> on<00:01:30.340> a<00:01:30.400> predictive<00:01:30.940> electric<00:01:31.300> type

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
come in on a predictive electric type

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.830 
come in on a predictive electric type
attack<00:01:31.840> but<00:01:32.830> as<00:01:32.920> for<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.190> stats<00:01:33.540> overall<00:01:34.540> it's

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
attack but as for the stats overall it's

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.930 
attack but as for the stats overall it's
basically<00:01:35.260> meant<00:01:35.530> to<00:01:35.680> be<00:01:35.830> a<00:01:35.860> speedy<00:01:36.400> special

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
basically meant to be a speedy special

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.470 
basically meant to be a speedy special
attacker<00:01:37.240> with<00:01:38.080> 65<00:01:38.620> HP<00:01:38.830> 60<00:01:39.550> defense<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:40.150> 95

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
attacker with 65 HP 60 defense and 95

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.510 
attacker with 65 HP 60 defense and 95
special<00:01:40.900> defense<00:01:41.170> it's<00:01:41.770> certainly<00:01:42.040> the<00:01:42.190> most

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
special defense it's certainly the most

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.060 
special defense it's certainly the most
offensive<00:01:42.820> Pokemon<00:01:43.390> ever<00:01:43.540> and<00:01:43.840> with<00:01:44.350> only<00:01:44.500> 65

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
offensive Pokemon ever and with only 65

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.350 
offensive Pokemon ever and with only 65
attack<00:01:45.460> you're<00:01:45.760> really<00:01:45.970> not<00:01:46.060> going<00:01:46.210> to<00:01:46.300> be

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
attack you're really not going to be

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.000 
attack you're really not going to be
doing<00:01:46.510> a<00:01:46.690> ton<00:01:46.870> of<00:01:46.930> damage<00:01:47.380> from<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.590> physical

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.670 
doing a ton of damage from the physical
side<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:49.450> as<00:01:49.600> for<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:49.930> special<00:01:50.110> attack<00:01:50.470> and

side but as for the special attack and

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.970 
side but as for the special attack and
speed<00:01:50.800> being<00:01:51.520> at<00:01:51.700> 110<00:01:52.330> and<00:01:52.600> 130<00:01:53.020> respectively

you<00:01:54.550> can<00:01:54.700> see<00:01:54.850> that<00:01:55.000> Jolteon<00:01:55.450> is<00:01:55.690> just<00:01:55.900> a

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
you can see that Jolteon is just a

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.250 
you can see that Jolteon is just a
blazingly<00:01:56.620> fast<00:01:57.030> special<00:01:58.030> attacker<00:01:58.330> with<00:01:58.930> a

lot<00:01:59.920> of<00:02:00.100> power<00:02:00.280> behind<00:02:00.580> all<00:02:00.940> of<00:02:01.120> the<00:02:01.210> moves

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
lot of power behind all of the moves

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.030 
lot of power behind all of the moves
that<00:02:01.660> I<00:02:01.690> can<00:02:01.870> use<00:02:02.050> because<00:02:02.320> of<00:02:02.470> that<00:02:02.650> really<00:02:02.920> my

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
that I can use because of that really my

that I can use because of that really my
special<00:02:03.460> attack<00:02:03.700> which<00:02:04.360> makes<00:02:04.570> Jolteon<00:02:05.020> just

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
special attack which makes Jolteon just

today<00:02:13.390> that<00:02:13.510> I<00:02:13.720> think<00:02:13.810> is<00:02:14.080> really<00:02:14.260> useful<00:02:14.680> for

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
today that I think is really useful for

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.750 
today that I think is really useful for
jolting<00:02:15.220> uh

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
jolting uh

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.670 
jolting uh
and<00:02:15.849> one<00:02:16.300> that<00:02:16.480> kind<00:02:16.720> of<00:02:16.870> gives<00:02:17.409> it<00:02:17.560> a

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
and one that kind of gives it a

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.440 
and one that kind of gives it a
different<00:02:17.890> role<00:02:18.280> than<00:02:18.610> it<00:02:18.760> normally<00:02:19.209> has

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
different role than it normally has

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.110 
different role than it normally has
while<00:02:20.230> also<00:02:20.409> maintaining<00:02:20.799> its<00:02:21.430> really<00:02:21.879> good

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
while also maintaining its really good

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.509 
while also maintaining its really good
ability<00:02:23.049> to<00:02:23.290> deal<00:02:23.799> a<00:02:23.860> lot<00:02:23.980> of<00:02:24.159> special

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
ability to deal a lot of special

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.210 
ability to deal a lot of special
attacking<00:02:25.120> damage<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:25.720> be<00:02:25.900> really<00:02:26.140> fast<00:02:26.409> so

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
attacking damage and be really fast so

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.309 
attacking damage and be really fast so
let's<00:02:27.519> take<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.700> look<00:02:27.819> at<00:02:27.940> that<00:02:28.080> so<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.170> nature

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
let's take a look at that so the nature

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.289 
let's take a look at that so the nature
print<00:02:29.620> of<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.739> set<00:02:29.950> can<00:02:30.310> either<00:02:30.459> be<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.700> modest

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
print of the set can either be a modest

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.270 
print of the set can either be a modest
or<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.569> timid<00:02:31.870> one<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.709> modest<00:02:33.010> one<00:02:33.160> will

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
or a timid one the modest one will

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.530 
or a timid one the modest one will
increase<00:02:33.400> your<00:02:33.760> special<00:02:34.060> attack<00:02:34.269> can<00:02:34.450> though

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
increase your special attack can though

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.420 
increase your special attack can though
your<00:02:34.720> physical<00:02:35.080> attack<00:02:35.349> whereas<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.160> tip<00:02:36.310> in

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
your physical attack whereas the tip in

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.800 
your physical attack whereas the tip in
nature<00:02:36.640> will<00:02:36.790> increase<00:02:37.090> your<00:02:37.269> speed<00:02:37.569> and

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
nature will increase your speed and

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.990 
nature will increase your speed and
lower<00:02:37.959> your<00:02:38.140> physical<00:02:38.500> attack<00:02:38.769> I<00:02:39.010> personally

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
lower your physical attack I personally

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.880 
lower your physical attack I personally
prefer<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.269> modest<00:02:40.690> one<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:41.290> get<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.650> greater

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
prefer the modest one to get the greater

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.039 
prefer the modest one to get the greater
power<00:02:42.160> because<00:02:42.910> you're<00:02:43.060> fast<00:02:43.329> enough<00:02:43.510> as<00:02:43.810> it

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
power because you're fast enough as it

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.839 
power because you're fast enough as it
is<00:02:44.079> but<00:02:44.829> if<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.010> want<00:02:45.099> to<00:02:45.310> be<00:02:45.400> out<00:02:45.519> speeding

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
is but if you want to be out speeding

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.640 
is but if you want to be out speeding
everything<00:02:46.299> that<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:46.599> should<00:02:46.959> and<00:02:47.200> can<00:02:47.440> be

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
everything that you should and can be

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.680 
everything that you should and can be
able<00:02:47.769> to<00:02:47.980> you<00:02:48.579> would<00:02:49.060> want<00:02:49.299> to<00:02:49.360> go<00:02:49.450> with<00:02:49.569> the

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
able to you would want to go with the

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.270 
able to you would want to go with the
timid<00:02:49.989> nature<00:02:50.079> so<00:02:50.560> that's<00:02:50.680> something<00:02:50.950> like<00:02:51.160> an

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
timid nature so that's something like an

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.890 
timid nature so that's something like an
Alakazam<00:02:51.819> wouldn't<00:02:52.209> be<00:02:52.269> out<00:02:52.390> speeding<00:02:52.780> you

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
Alakazam wouldn't be out speeding you

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.809 
Alakazam wouldn't be out speeding you
but<00:02:53.890> I'll<00:02:53.980> see<00:02:54.069> the<00:02:54.160> ability<00:02:54.340> we're<00:02:54.640> going<00:02:54.760> to

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
but I'll see the ability we're going to

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.520 
but I'll see the ability we're going to
go<00:02:54.940> with<00:02:55.030> volt<00:02:55.269> absorb<00:02:55.660> which<00:02:55.989> like<00:02:56.170> I<00:02:56.290> said<00:02:56.319> is

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
go with volt absorb which like I said is

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.589 
go with volt absorb which like I said is
probably<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.160> superior<00:02:57.640> ability<00:02:58.060> regardless

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
probably the superior ability regardless

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.199 
probably the superior ability regardless
on<00:02:58.840> Jolteon<00:02:59.290> and<00:02:59.530> it<00:03:00.010> also<00:03:00.160> has<00:03:00.459> an<00:03:00.760> added

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
on Jolteon and it also has an added

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.020 
on Jolteon and it also has an added
bonus<00:03:01.690> effect<00:03:02.230> in<00:03:02.500> competitive<00:03:03.370> play<00:03:03.400> because

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
bonus effect in competitive play because

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.300 
bonus effect in competitive play because
if<00:03:04.329> your<00:03:04.569> opponents<00:03:05.079> are<00:03:05.200> choiced<00:03:05.560> in<00:03:05.859> any<00:03:06.099> way

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
if your opponents are choiced in any way

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.860 
if your opponents are choiced in any way
like<00:03:06.489> a<00:03:06.549> choice<00:03:06.819> scarf<00:03:07.120> choice<00:03:07.359> bandit<00:03:07.750> or

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
like a choice scarf choice bandit or

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.809 
like a choice scarf choice bandit or
specs<00:03:08.230> they're<00:03:08.920> going<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.099> be<00:03:09.190> locked<00:03:09.430> in<00:03:09.640> on

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
specs they're going to be locked in on

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.670 
specs they're going to be locked in on
an<00:03:09.910> electric<00:03:10.329> move<00:03:10.480> that<00:03:10.690> you<00:03:10.840> might<00:03:11.049> switch

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
an electric move that you might switch

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.039 
an electric move that you might switch
guilty<00:03:12.040> on<00:03:12.160> on<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.549> forcing<00:03:13.450> them<00:03:13.599> to<00:03:13.629> have<00:03:13.870> to

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
guilty on on to forcing them to have to

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.449 
guilty on on to forcing them to have to
switch<00:03:14.230> out<00:03:14.410> because<00:03:14.709> obviously<00:03:14.890> they're<00:03:15.400> not

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
switch out because obviously they're not

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.400 
switch out because obviously they're not
going<00:03:15.640> to<00:03:15.670> stay<00:03:15.879> in<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.239> keep<00:03:16.390> recovering<00:03:17.230> your

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
health because of your immunity so

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.759 
health because of your immunity so
that's<00:03:19.420> an<00:03:19.510> added<00:03:19.629> bonus<00:03:20.079> of<00:03:20.260> just<00:03:20.500> having

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
that's an added bonus of just having

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.580 
that's an added bonus of just having

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
this ability but as to the Eevee's you

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.470 
this ability but as to the Eevee's you
can<00:03:23.709> put<00:03:23.829> four<00:03:24.069> into<00:03:24.280> defense<00:03:24.579> two<00:03:25.150> fifty-two

can put four into defense two fifty-two
into<00:03:25.900> Special<00:03:26.230> Attack<00:03:26.319> to<00:03:26.709> give<00:03:26.829> us<00:03:26.950> your<00:03:27.310> max

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
into Special Attack to give us your max

into Special Attack to give us your max
special<00:03:28.060> attack<00:03:28.269> possible<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:28.930> then<00:03:29.500> 250<00:03:29.769> to

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
special attack possible and then 250 to

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.289 
special attack possible and then 250 to
Eve<00:03:30.130> using<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.459> speed<00:03:30.700> to<00:03:30.880> give<00:03:31.030> us<00:03:31.150> your

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
Eve using the speed to give us your

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.539 
Eve using the speed to give us your
highest<00:03:31.540> speed<00:03:31.720> possible<00:03:31.980> now<00:03:32.980> so<00:03:33.069> the<00:03:33.250> item

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
highest speed possible now so the item

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:34.949 
highest speed possible now so the item
we<00:03:33.880> could<00:03:34.030> either<00:03:34.150> go<00:03:34.389> with<00:03:34.540> an<00:03:34.660> air<00:03:34.810> balloon

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
we could either go with an air balloon

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.170 
we could either go with an air balloon
or<00:03:35.290> leftovers<00:03:35.950> both<00:03:36.310> of<00:03:36.459> which<00:03:36.579> have<00:03:36.849> kind<00:03:37.090> of

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
or leftovers both of which have kind of

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.479 
or leftovers both of which have kind of
a<00:03:37.269> similar<00:03:37.569> role<00:03:37.870> in<00:03:37.900> maintaining<00:03:38.459> Jolteon<00:03:39.459> x'

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
a similar role in maintaining Jolteon x'

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.729 
a similar role in maintaining Jolteon x'
health<00:03:39.790> in<00:03:40.000> a<00:03:40.060> way<00:03:40.090> air<00:03:40.959> balloon<00:03:41.349> is<00:03:41.500> great

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
health in a way air balloon is great

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:42.990 
health in a way air balloon is great
because<00:03:42.040> it<00:03:42.160> gives<00:03:42.310> you<00:03:42.430> an<00:03:42.519> immunity<00:03:42.849> to

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
because it gives you an immunity to

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.390 
because it gives you an immunity to
ground<00:03:43.239> which<00:03:43.540> is<00:03:43.569> your<00:03:43.840> only<00:03:44.109> weakness<00:03:44.400> so

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
ground which is your only weakness so

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.949 
ground which is your only weakness so
then<00:03:45.579> you<00:03:45.669> have<00:03:45.790> technically<00:03:46.209> two<00:03:46.480> immunities

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
then you have technically two immunities

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.509 
then you have technically two immunities
until<00:03:47.290> you<00:03:47.380> get<00:03:47.560> hit<00:03:47.769> in<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:47.980> balloon<00:03:48.280> pops

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
until you get hit in the balloon pops

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.759 
until you get hit in the balloon pops
and<00:03:48.849> it<00:03:49.419> also<00:03:49.599> is<00:03:49.870> great<00:03:50.019> because<00:03:50.440> it<00:03:50.590> makes

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
and it also is great because it makes

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.349 
and it also is great because it makes
you<00:03:50.919> immune<00:03:51.190> to<00:03:51.280> things<00:03:51.549> like<00:03:51.639> spikes<00:03:52.120> and

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
you immune to things like spikes and

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:53.849 
you immune to things like spikes and
toxic<00:03:52.810> spikes<00:03:53.019> because<00:03:53.319> you're<00:03:53.590> floating

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
toxic spikes because you're floating

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:56.069 
toxic spikes because you're floating
above<00:03:54.220> them<00:03:54.400> which<00:03:55.000> is<00:03:55.209> kind<00:03:55.450> of<00:03:55.540> key<00:03:55.780> for<00:03:56.049> a

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
above them which is kind of key for a

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.599 
above them which is kind of key for a
set<00:03:56.319> like<00:03:56.440> this<00:03:56.500> because<00:03:57.040> we're<00:03:57.220> going<00:03:57.250> to<00:03:57.430> be

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
set like this because we're going to be

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.339 
set like this because we're going to be
forcing<00:03:58.000> a<00:03:58.060> lot<00:03:58.150> of<00:03:58.299> switches<00:03:58.690> and<00:03:58.720> switching

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
forcing a lot of switches and switching

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.159 
forcing a lot of switches and switching
out<00:03:59.470> a<00:03:59.500> lot<00:03:59.769> so<00:04:00.370> any<00:04:00.700> reduced<00:04:01.359> damage<00:04:01.660> that<00:04:02.019> you

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.169 
out a lot so any reduced damage that you

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.170 
out a lot so any reduced damage that you
can<00:04:02.290> take<00:04:02.530> is<00:04:02.769> excellent<00:04:03.430> which<00:04:03.910> is<00:04:04.030> why<00:04:04.120> you

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
can take is excellent which is why you

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.849 
can take is excellent which is why you
also<00:04:04.419> might<00:04:04.690> want<00:04:04.720> to<00:04:04.900> go<00:04:04.989> with<00:04:05.019> leftovers<00:04:05.650> to

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
also might want to go with leftovers to

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.250 
also might want to go with leftovers to
recover<00:04:06.190> any<00:04:06.459> HP<00:04:06.910> lost<00:04:07.629> from<00:04:07.959> things<00:04:08.169> like

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
recover any HP lost from things like

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.470 
recover any HP lost from things like
stealth<00:04:08.650> rock<00:04:08.859> and<00:04:09.190> other<00:04:09.849> things<00:04:10.239> of<00:04:10.359> that

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
stealth rock and other things of that

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.849 
stealth rock and other things of that
nature

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
nature

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.439 
nature
but<00:04:12.190> for<00:04:12.459> the<00:04:12.549> moves<00:04:12.730> the<00:04:13.000> first<00:04:13.209> one<00:04:13.359> that

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:13.449 
but for the moves the first one that

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:15.150 
but for the moves the first one that
we're<00:04:13.599> going<00:04:13.629> to<00:04:13.750> make<00:04:13.930> use<00:04:14.139> of<00:04:14.169> is<00:04:14.530> yawn<00:04:14.859> and

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
we're going to make use of is yawn and

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.400 
we're going to make use of is yawn and
this<00:04:15.970> is<00:04:16.120> excellent<00:04:16.539> because<00:04:16.959> it's<00:04:17.109> a<00:04:17.199> hundred

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
this is excellent because it's a hundred

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.319 
this is excellent because it's a hundred
percent<00:04:17.829> guaranteed<00:04:18.340> sleep<00:04:18.699> move<00:04:18.910> if<00:04:19.090> your

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
percent guaranteed sleep move if your

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.599 
percent guaranteed sleep move if your
opponent<00:04:19.810> stays<00:04:20.019> in<00:04:20.289> but<00:04:20.919> obviously<00:04:21.370> why

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
opponent stays in but obviously why

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.010 
opponent stays in but obviously why
would<00:04:21.789> your<00:04:21.940> opponent<00:04:22.330> stay<00:04:22.510> in<00:04:22.690> when<00:04:22.900> they

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
would your opponent stay in when they

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.740 
would your opponent stay in when they
could<00:04:23.229> be<00:04:23.260> put<00:04:23.590> to<00:04:23.710> sleep<00:04:23.740> so<00:04:24.669> if<00:04:25.000> they<00:04:25.180> do<00:04:25.240> stay

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
could be put to sleep so if they do stay

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.690 
could be put to sleep so if they do stay
in<00:04:25.900> they<00:04:26.289> go<00:04:26.409> to<00:04:26.469> sleep<00:04:26.740> if<00:04:26.979> they<00:04:27.099> don't<00:04:27.400> they

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
in they go to sleep if they don't they

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.200 
in they go to sleep if they don't they
have<00:04:27.789> this

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
have this

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.150 
have this
doubt<00:04:28.389> to<00:04:28.870> which<00:04:29.050> you<00:04:29.259> can<00:04:29.440> use<00:04:29.650> volt<00:04:29.979> switch

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
doubt to which you can use volt switch

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.070 
doubt to which you can use volt switch
and<00:04:30.580> thus<00:04:30.910> gain<00:04:31.180> a<00:04:31.210> switch<00:04:31.539> initiative

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
and thus gain a switch initiative

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.499 
and thus gain a switch initiative
against<00:04:32.889> that<00:04:33.039> and<00:04:33.430> that's<00:04:34.060> really<00:04:34.150> cool

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:34.509 
against that and that's really cool

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:37.620 
against that and that's really cool
because<00:04:34.569> of<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.169> fact<00:04:35.410> that<00:04:36.330> Jolteon<00:04:37.330> is<00:04:37.479> one

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
because of the fact that Jolteon is one

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.089 
because of the fact that Jolteon is one
of<00:04:37.720> the<00:04:37.810> only<00:04:37.990> Pokemon<00:04:38.560> that<00:04:38.830> can<00:04:38.949> basically

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
of the only Pokemon that can basically

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.189 
of the only Pokemon that can basically
force<00:04:39.759> switches<00:04:40.270> and<00:04:40.509> game<00:04:40.840> switch

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
force switches and game switch

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.230 
force switches and game switch
initiative<00:04:41.680> at<00:04:41.860> the<00:04:42.069> exact<00:04:42.490> same<00:04:42.699> time<00:04:42.970> and

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
initiative at the exact same time and

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.809 
initiative at the exact same time and
this<00:04:44.080> is<00:04:44.289> really<00:04:44.319> amazing<00:04:44.889> because<00:04:45.490> I

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:45.819 
this is really amazing because I

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:48.420 
this is really amazing because I
honestly<00:04:46.599> like<00:04:47.110> it's<00:04:47.440> such<00:04:47.680> a<00:04:47.710> good<00:04:47.919> strategy

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
honestly like it's such a good strategy

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.980 
honestly like it's such a good strategy
and<00:04:48.460> a<00:04:48.789> lot<00:04:48.910> of<00:04:49.030> people<00:04:49.240> don't<00:04:49.389> make<00:04:49.599> use<00:04:49.750> of<00:04:49.780> it

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
and a lot of people don't make use of it

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.360 
and a lot of people don't make use of it
because<00:04:50.169> it's<00:04:50.319> really<00:04:50.530> annoying<00:04:50.889> to<00:04:51.069> deal

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
because it's really annoying to deal

your electrocute moves and other things
that<00:05:33.039> also<00:05:33.340> might<00:05:34.210> want<00:05:34.419> to<00:05:34.720> not<00:05:35.620> take<00:05:35.860> an

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:35.949 
that also might want to not take an

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:38.100 
that also might want to not take an
electric-type<00:05:36.310> attack<00:05:36.759> though<00:05:37.479> Gliscor<00:05:37.990> is

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
electric-type attack though Gliscor is

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.689 
electric-type attack though Gliscor is
another<00:05:38.349> common<00:05:38.770> thing<00:05:38.979> that<00:05:39.009> might<00:05:39.370> come<00:05:39.550> in

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
another common thing that might come in

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:42.149 
another common thing that might come in
so<00:05:39.940> that's<00:05:40.060> where<00:05:40.300> empower<00:05:40.930> ice<00:05:41.229> is<00:05:41.590> also<00:05:42.130> a

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:42.159 
so that's where empower ice is also a

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:43.890 
so that's where empower ice is also a
better<00:05:42.460> choice<00:05:42.759> so<00:05:43.180> it's<00:05:43.300> really<00:05:43.479> up<00:05:43.659> to<00:05:43.810> you

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
better choice so it's really up to you

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.909 
better choice so it's really up to you
which<00:05:44.050> one<00:05:44.169> you<00:05:44.289> think<00:05:44.440> you're<00:05:44.620> going<00:05:44.740> to<00:05:44.800> be

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
which one you think you're going to be

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:46.589 
which one you think you're going to be
using<00:05:45.250> more<00:05:45.430> or<00:05:45.669> which<00:05:45.849> one<00:05:46.060> you'll<00:05:46.210> need<00:05:46.389> for

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599 
using more or which one you'll need for

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:48.930 
using more or which one you'll need for
your<00:05:46.719> team<00:05:46.979> but<00:05:47.979> the<00:05:48.099> last<00:05:48.250> move<00:05:48.490> slot<00:05:48.759> is

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
your team but the last move slot is

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.089 
your team but the last move slot is
basically<00:05:49.360> also<00:05:49.780> a<00:05:49.810> filler<00:05:50.139> move<00:05:50.440> you<00:05:50.979> could

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:51.099 
basically also a filler move you could

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:52.709 
basically also a filler move you could
either<00:05:51.219> go<00:05:51.430> with<00:05:51.580> Shadow<00:05:51.849> Ball<00:05:52.060> or<00:05:52.120> signal

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:52.719 
either go with Shadow Ball or signal

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:54.810 
either go with Shadow Ball or signal
beam<00:05:52.900> Shadow<00:05:53.710> Ball<00:05:53.860> is<00:05:54.039> really<00:05:54.310> good<00:05:54.550> because

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
beam Shadow Ball is really good because

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.209 
beam Shadow Ball is really good because
of<00:05:55.479> a<00:05:55.659> pokémon<00:05:56.080> like<00:05:56.349> Jellison<00:05:56.889> that<00:05:57.099> you

00:05:57.209 --> 00:05:57.219 
of a pokémon like Jellison that you

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:59.279 
of a pokémon like Jellison that you
might<00:05:57.400> want<00:05:57.639> to<00:05:57.699> switch<00:05:57.820> into<00:05:58.240> um<00:05:58.630> since<00:05:59.199> you

00:05:59.279 --> 00:05:59.289 
might want to switch into um since you

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:00.600 
might want to switch into um since you
might<00:05:59.469> not<00:05:59.650> want<00:05:59.860> to<00:05:59.889> switch<00:06:00.130> out<00:06:00.340> with<00:06:00.370> your

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
might not want to switch out with your

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.040 
might not want to switch out with your
electric<00:06:00.940> type<00:06:01.060> move<00:06:01.240> right<00:06:01.449> away<00:06:01.570> you<00:06:01.750> can

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
electric type move right away you can

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.420 
electric type move right away you can
still<00:06:02.259> hit<00:06:02.409> it<00:06:02.469> pretty<00:06:02.770> hard<00:06:03.009> with<00:06:03.130> Shadow

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
still hit it pretty hard with Shadow

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.700 
still hit it pretty hard with Shadow
Ball<00:06:03.669> and<00:06:03.940> this<00:06:04.630> could<00:06:04.780> also<00:06:04.930> work<00:06:05.229> against

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
Ball and this could also work against

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.249 
Ball and this could also work against
other<00:06:05.919> ghost<00:06:06.280> types<00:06:06.580> like<00:06:07.150> a<00:06:07.210> gengar<00:06:07.719> that<00:06:08.139> you

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:08.259 
other ghost types like a gengar that you

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:10.230 
other ghost types like a gengar that you
might<00:06:08.409> run<00:06:08.560> into<00:06:08.889> and<00:06:09.219> even<00:06:09.729> with<00:06:09.820> the<00:06:09.909> modest

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
might run into and even with the modest

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.790 
might run into and even with the modest
nature<00:06:10.509> you<00:06:10.630> will<00:06:10.659> still<00:06:11.020> out<00:06:11.139> speed<00:06:11.380> Gengar

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
nature you will still out speed Gengar

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.770 
nature you will still out speed Gengar
this<00:06:12.520> could<00:06:12.669> also<00:06:12.789> be<00:06:12.940> really<00:06:13.270> good<00:06:13.300> to<00:06:13.599> hit

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
this could also be really good to hit

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.659 
this could also be really good to hit
latias<00:06:14.139> or<00:06:14.440> latias<00:06:14.740> for<00:06:15.190> a<00:06:15.219> super<00:06:15.520> effective

more base power but also you could go

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 
with signal beam as a way to deal damage

power less than Shadow Ball but signal

beam<00:06:30.130> is<00:06:30.310> also<00:06:30.490> really<00:06:30.789> great<00:06:31.090> against<00:06:31.539> the

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
beam is also really great against the

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.050 
beam is also really great against the
pokémon<00:06:32.080> like<00:06:32.380> Celebi<00:06:33.039> which<00:06:33.370> could<00:06:33.909> also

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
pokémon like Celebi which could also

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.760 
pokémon like Celebi which could also
potentially<00:06:34.479> be<00:06:34.810> a<00:06:34.840> common<00:06:35.349> switching

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770 
potentially be a common switching

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.250 
potentially be a common switching
against<00:06:36.070> a<00:06:36.159> Jolteon<00:06:36.580> because<00:06:36.969> it<00:06:37.089> is<00:06:37.260> really

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:38.260 
against a Jolteon because it is really

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.180 
against a Jolteon because it is really
bulky<00:06:38.650> naturally<00:06:39.310> and<00:06:39.580> also<00:06:39.880> has<00:06:40.180> that

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190 
bulky naturally and also has that

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.280 
bulky naturally and also has that
to<00:06:41.550> your<00:06:41.670> electric-type<00:06:42.150> attacks<00:06:42.510> where<00:06:43.260> a

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:43.290 
to your electric-type attacks where a

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.960 
to your electric-type attacks where a
single<00:06:43.770> beam<00:06:43.920> is<00:06:44.100> a<00:06:44.130> four-time<00:06:44.460> super

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:44.970 
single beam is a four-time super

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.000 
single beam is a four-time super
effective<00:06:45.420> move<00:06:45.600> against<00:06:45.990> Celebi<00:06:46.470> so<00:06:46.740> that'll

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.010 
effective move against Celebi so that'll

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.040 
effective move against Celebi so that'll
be<00:06:47.130> something<00:06:47.160> to<00:06:47.550> surprise<00:06:47.790> it<00:06:48.000> with<00:06:48.300> and<00:06:48.600> it

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
be something to surprise it with and it

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.960 
be something to surprise it with and it
pretty<00:06:49.500> much<00:06:49.590> will<00:06:49.980> take<00:06:50.190> out<00:06:50.370> the<00:06:50.550> Celebi

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:50.970 
pretty much will take out the Celebi

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.200 
pretty much will take out the Celebi
regardless<00:06:51.570> of<00:06:51.780> its<00:06:52.440> investment<00:06:52.980> after

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.210 
regardless of its investment after

regardless of its investment after
stealth<00:06:54.210> rock<00:06:54.420> damage<00:06:54.930> is<00:06:55.080> taken<00:06:55.380> into

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.530 
stealth rock damage is taken into

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.980 
stealth rock damage is taken into
consideration<00:06:55.710> if<00:06:56.430> you<00:06:56.580> have<00:06:56.730> that<00:06:56.910> up<00:06:57.060> but

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:57.990 
consideration if you have that up but

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.510 
consideration if you have that up but
overall<00:06:58.260> this<00:06:58.560> is<00:06:58.620> just<00:06:58.740> a<00:06:59.010> really<00:06:59.280> solid

00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 
overall this is just a really solid

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.870 
overall this is just a really solid
phasing<00:07:00.180> set<00:07:00.420> for<00:07:00.840> Jolteon<00:07:01.830> and<00:07:02.100> something

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 
phasing set for Jolteon and something

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.580 
phasing set for Jolteon and something
that<00:07:03.390> could<00:07:03.570> be<00:07:03.690> really<00:07:04.020> annoying<00:07:04.110> for<00:07:04.500> your

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:04.590 
that could be really annoying for your

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.080 
that could be really annoying for your
opponent<00:07:04.920> to<00:07:04.980> deal<00:07:05.190> with<00:07:05.400> due<00:07:05.670> to<00:07:05.760> the<00:07:05.850> fact

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.090 
opponent to deal with due to the fact

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.820 
opponent to deal with due to the fact
that<00:07:06.210> you're<00:07:06.480> constantly<00:07:06.930> causing<00:07:07.260> switches

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:07.830 
that you're constantly causing switches

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.800 
that you're constantly causing switches
and<00:07:08.010> constantly<00:07:08.910> switching<00:07:09.180> out<00:07:09.420> to<00:07:09.630> gain

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:09.810 
and constantly switching out to gain

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.540 
and constantly switching out to gain
switch<00:07:09.990> initiative<00:07:10.590> on<00:07:10.770> whatever<00:07:11.010> they<00:07:11.370> might

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:11.550 
switch initiative on whatever they might

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.120 
switch initiative on whatever they might
switch<00:07:11.820> to<00:07:12.030> so<00:07:12.840> that's<00:07:13.290> pretty<00:07:13.500> much<00:07:13.620> it<00:07:13.800> that

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.130 
switch to so that's pretty much it that

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:15.710 
switch to so that's pretty much it that
I<00:07:14.160> have<00:07:14.400> for<00:07:14.640> this<00:07:14.730> video<00:07:14.880> I<00:07:15.240> think<00:07:15.600> it's

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720 
I have for this video I think it's

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.080 
I have for this video I think it's
really<00:07:15.960> good<00:07:16.470> set<00:07:17.070> and<00:07:17.340> something<00:07:17.730> that<00:07:17.880> a<00:07:17.910> lot

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:18.090 
really good set and something that a lot

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:19.760 
really good set and something that a lot
of<00:07:18.240> people<00:07:18.540> should<00:07:18.660> try<00:07:18.900> out<00:07:19.080> and<00:07:19.290> I

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:19.770 
of people should try out and I

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.010 
of people should try out and I
personally<00:07:20.220> enjoy<00:07:20.460> using<00:07:20.640> it<00:07:20.820> myself<00:07:21.020> but

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.020 
personally enjoy using it myself but

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.870 
personally enjoy using it myself but
that's<00:07:22.170> it<00:07:22.350> for<00:07:22.650> this<00:07:22.710> video<00:07:22.860> everyone<00:07:23.430> so<00:07:23.760> as
