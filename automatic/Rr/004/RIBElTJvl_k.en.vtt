00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
and it is a flip so even if it's flipped

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.859

and not bowel do you still going to

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.510 
and not bowel do you still going to
search<00:01:46.200> her<00:01:46.380> rather<00:01:46.979> than<00:01:47.130> eating<00:01:47.250> something

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
I run the three heat waves because this

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.900 
I run the three heat waves because this
is<00:03:02.720> a<00:03:02.750> majority<00:03:03.349> set<00:03:03.650> deck<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.190> you<00:03:04.459> can<00:03:04.640> set

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
is a majority set deck and you can set

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.729

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
when heat wave is played meaning that

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.110 
when heat wave is played meaning that
your<00:03:06.860> opponent<00:03:07.280> won't<00:03:07.519> be<00:03:07.700> getting<00:03:07.910> a<00:03:07.970> very

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
strong turnout the next turn so it keeps

the car which made this deck strong in
the<00:04:06.019> first<00:04:06.170> place<00:04:06.470> really<00:04:07.430> useful<00:04:07.880> another

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
the first place really useful another

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:09.879 
the first place really useful another
and<00:04:08.900> it's<00:04:08.989> also<00:04:09.139> great<00:04:09.380> in<00:04:09.500> this<00:04:09.590> format

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:09.889 
and it's also great in this format

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:11.740 
and it's also great in this format
because<00:04:10.010> it's<00:04:10.310> chainable<00:04:10.700> another<00:04:11.450> chainable

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
because it's chainable another chainable

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.199 
because it's chainable another chainable
trap<00:04:11.989> is<00:04:12.290> offering<00:04:13.220> still<00:04:13.459> snake<00:04:13.670> deity<00:04:13.849> which

trap is offering still snake deity which

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:15.559 
trap is offering still snake deity which
I<00:04:14.330> run<00:04:14.480> three<00:04:14.659> others<00:04:14.870> what

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
I run three others what

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.870 
I run three others what
really<00:04:16.229> useful<00:04:16.380> especially<00:04:17.220> because<00:04:17.639> your

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
really useful especially because your

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.819 
really useful especially because your
target<00:04:18.269> doesn't<00:04:18.389> have<00:04:18.540> to<00:04:18.630> be<00:04:18.690> face-up<00:04:18.930> and<00:04:19.290> if

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
target doesn't have to be face-up and if

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.800 
target doesn't have to be face-up and if
your<00:04:20.040> opponent<00:04:20.729> flips<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.209> target<00:04:21.540> this

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
your opponent flips the target this

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.780 
your opponent flips the target this
fizzles<00:04:22.260> you<00:04:22.470> don't<00:04:22.650> lose<00:04:22.860> you<00:04:23.010> too<00:04:23.190> you<00:04:23.580> don't

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
fizzles you don't lose you too you don't

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.600 
fizzles you don't lose you too you don't
lose<00:04:23.910> your<00:04:23.970> tribute<00:04:24.449> so<00:04:25.229> it's<00:04:25.380> really<00:04:25.650> useful

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.150 

again<00:04:29.610> my<00:04:29.970> one<00:04:30.240> off<00:04:30.419> is<00:04:30.720> safe<00:04:31.530> zone<00:04:31.800> and

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
again my one off is safe zone and

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.529 
again my one off is safe zone and
threatening<00:04:32.610> or<00:04:32.789> threatening<00:04:33.180> rule<00:04:33.330> because

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
threatening or threatening rule because

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:34.909 
threatening or threatening rule because
there's<00:04:33.690> a<00:04:33.750> chainable<00:04:34.050> anti<00:04:34.440> battle<00:04:34.710> card

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
there's a chainable anti battle card

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.260 
there's a chainable anti battle card
which<00:04:35.130> is<00:04:35.160> in<00:04:35.520> my<00:04:35.699> opinion<00:04:36.000> better<00:04:36.120> than

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
which is in my opinion better than

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.270 
which is in my opinion better than
mirror<00:04:36.479> force<00:04:36.750> at<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:36.930> moment<00:04:37.199> and<00:04:37.380> safe<00:04:38.070> zone

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
mirror force at the moment and safe zone

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.100 
mirror force at the moment and safe zone
because<00:04:38.580> if<00:04:38.729> your<00:04:38.850> opponent<00:04:39.180> it's<00:04:39.630> useful<00:04:39.990> for

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
because if your opponent it's useful for

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.270 
because if your opponent it's useful for
protecting<00:04:40.229> your<00:04:40.530> own<00:04:40.590> monsters<00:04:41.010> especially

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
protecting your own monsters especially

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.580 
protecting your own monsters especially
warm<00:04:41.820> links<00:04:42.210> in<00:04:42.330> this<00:04:42.449> deck<00:04:42.630> but<00:04:43.380> if<00:04:43.440> your

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
warm links in this deck but if your

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.230 
warm links in this deck but if your
friend<00:04:43.770> MST<00:04:44.190> is<00:04:44.250> it<00:04:44.400> you<00:04:44.550> can<00:04:44.699> equip<00:04:44.910> it<00:04:45.030> to<00:04:45.060> one

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
friend MST is it you can equip it to one

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.430 
friend MST is it you can equip it to one
of<00:04:45.330> their<00:04:45.449> monsters<00:04:45.870> and<00:04:46.080> then<00:04:46.260> they're

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
of their monsters and then they're

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.500 
of their monsters and then they're
destroyed<00:04:46.770> so<00:04:47.699> it's<00:04:47.850> really<00:04:48.030> useful<00:04:48.210> choice

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
destroyed so it's really useful choice

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.150 
destroyed so it's really useful choice
I'd<00:04:48.810> recommend<00:04:49.289> it<00:04:49.410> in<00:04:49.530> most<00:04:49.740> acts<00:04:49.979> in<00:04:50.100> the

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
I'd recommend it in most acts in the

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.760 
I'd recommend it in most acts in the
moment<00:04:50.460> and<00:04:50.990> then<00:04:51.990> next<00:04:52.229> up<00:04:52.410> around<00:04:52.650> the

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770
