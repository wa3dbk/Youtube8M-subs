00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:23.400

 Of course it is difficult to not very convenient for 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:41.520
 studying so I chose another for myself 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.800
 the way i taught there is a video on youtube just 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.440
 those who like me passed the tests they take off 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.360

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.000
 Initially already video test samples and by 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.940
 this example of tests to teach the question here 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.809
