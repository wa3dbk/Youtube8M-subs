00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
we want to figure out how exactly we

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.660 
we want to figure out how exactly we
could<00:01:33.750> put<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.140> our<00:01:34.229> game<00:01:34.439> right<00:01:34.740> right

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670

could put this in our game right right
so<00:01:36.270> let's<00:01:36.479> do<00:01:36.689> that

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
so let's do that

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.140 
so let's do that
we're<00:01:37.619> gonna<00:01:37.710> go<00:01:37.890> ahead<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.189> close<00:01:38.759> out<00:01:38.970> our

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
we're gonna go ahead and close out our

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.969 
we're gonna go ahead and close out our
game<00:01:39.390> I'm<00:01:40.170> gonna<00:01:40.350> bring<00:01:40.650> up<00:01:40.860> my<00:01:40.979> monitor<00:01:41.340> here

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
game I'm gonna bring up my monitor here

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.410 
game I'm gonna bring up my monitor here
go<00:01:43.979> ahead<00:01:44.100> make<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.399> little<00:01:44.790> bit<00:01:44.909> larger

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
go ahead make that a little bit larger

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.080 
go ahead make that a little bit larger
so<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:46.590> get<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.009> as<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.700> said<00:01:47.909> you're<00:01:48.000> gonna
