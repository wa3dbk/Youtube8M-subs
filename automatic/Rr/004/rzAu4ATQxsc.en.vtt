00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
excellent sound quality and speakers

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.730 
excellent sound quality and speakers
that<00:00:15.070> come<00:00:15.100> from<00:00:15.760> this<00:00:16.119> little<00:00:16.660> device<00:00:16.930> first

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
that come from this little device first

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.220 
that come from this little device first
of<00:00:17.920> all<00:00:18.039> let's<00:00:18.670> have<00:00:18.910> a<00:00:18.939> look<00:00:19.180> at<00:00:19.390> the<00:00:19.689> physical

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
of all let's have a look at the physical

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.190 
of all let's have a look at the physical
position<00:00:20.980> of<00:00:21.310> the<00:00:21.400> speakers<00:00:21.850> on<00:00:22.030> the<00:00:22.750> iPad

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.200 
position of the speakers on the iPad

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.490 
position of the speakers on the iPad
Mini<00:00:23.410> there<00:00:24.039> on<00:00:24.250> the<00:00:24.640> side<00:00:25.180> of<00:00:25.210> the<00:00:25.570> device<00:00:25.960> at

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
Mini there on the side of the device at

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.240 
Mini there on the side of the device at
the<00:00:26.560> bottom<00:00:26.710> here<00:00:27.280> and<00:00:27.700> we<00:00:27.820> have<00:00:28.030> two<00:00:28.510> speakers

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
the bottom here and we have two speakers

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.459 
the bottom here and we have two speakers
now<00:00:30.250> this<00:00:30.640> is<00:00:31.030> certainly<00:00:31.570> a<00:00:31.660> step<00:00:31.960> up<00:00:32.169> from

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:32.469 
now this is certainly a step up from

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:34.590 
now this is certainly a step up from
most<00:00:32.829> tablets<00:00:33.340> which<00:00:33.520> have<00:00:33.699> speakers<00:00:34.149> on<00:00:34.390> the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
most tablets which have speakers on the

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.110 
most tablets which have speakers on the
back<00:00:35.020> of<00:00:35.050> a<00:00:35.289> tablet<00:00:35.710> which<00:00:36.309> is<00:00:36.460> always<00:00:36.670> a<00:00:36.850> bit

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
back of a tablet which is always a bit

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.110 
back of a tablet which is always a bit
idiotic<00:00:37.980> when<00:00:38.980> you're<00:00:39.190> watching<00:00:39.460> a<00:00:39.730> tablet

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
idiotic when you're watching a tablet

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.790 
idiotic when you're watching a tablet
the<00:00:40.210> sound<00:00:40.420> is<00:00:40.569> always<00:00:40.839> going<00:00:41.019> away<00:00:41.260> from<00:00:41.679> the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
the sound is always going away from the

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.009 
the sound is always going away from the
user<00:00:42.039> but<00:00:42.399> now<00:00:42.729> it's<00:00:43.059> coming<00:00:43.420> out<00:00:43.569> of<00:00:43.600> a<00:00:43.780> side

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019 
user but now it's coming out of a side

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:46.590 
user but now it's coming out of a side
of<00:00:44.140> a<00:00:44.199> tablet<00:00:44.589> which<00:00:45.159> is<00:00:45.429> getting<00:00:45.940> better<00:00:46.239> I

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
of a tablet which is getting better I

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.209 
of a tablet which is getting better I
would<00:00:46.780> still<00:00:46.989> like<00:00:47.140> to<00:00:47.170> see<00:00:47.440> more<00:00:47.829> tablets

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
would still like to see more tablets

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.040 
would still like to see more tablets
where<00:00:48.399> the<00:00:48.489> speakers<00:00:48.879> are<00:00:49.059> somehow<00:00:49.300> built

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
where the speakers are somehow built

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.430 
where the speakers are somehow built
into<00:00:50.499> the<00:00:50.620> front<00:00:51.190> of<00:00:51.399> the<00:00:51.550> device<00:00:52.149> but<00:00:53.139> maybe

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
into the front of the device but maybe

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.770 
into the front of the device but maybe
it's<00:00:53.920> a<00:00:54.280> design<00:00:54.670> issue<00:00:54.850> you<00:00:55.089> only<00:00:55.210> make<00:00:55.479> the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
it's a design issue you only make the

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.259 
it's a design issue you only make the
tablet<00:00:56.260> ugly<00:00:56.530> which<00:00:56.799> I<00:00:56.920> know<00:00:56.979> is<00:00:57.339> a<00:00:57.850> bigger

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
tablet ugly which I know is a bigger

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.469 
tablet ugly which I know is a bigger
point<00:00:58.569> for<00:00:58.870> apple-designed<00:00:59.530> devices

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:00.479 
point for apple-designed devices

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:03.750 
point for apple-designed devices
secondly<00:01:01.479> the<00:01:01.959> sound<00:01:02.260> clarity<00:01:02.589> is<00:01:03.039> excellent

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
secondly the sound clarity is excellent

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.969 
secondly the sound clarity is excellent
and<00:01:03.969> more<00:01:04.629> impressively<00:01:05.290> is<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.740> actual

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
and more impressively is the actual

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.219 
and more impressively is the actual
volume<00:01:06.670> of<00:01:06.909> VM<00:01:08.700> speakers<00:01:09.700> on<00:01:09.939> the<00:01:10.180> iPad<00:01:10.990> Mini

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
volume of VM speakers on the iPad Mini

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.539 
volume of VM speakers on the iPad Mini
which<00:01:11.710> are<00:01:12.180> phenomenal<00:01:13.180> especially<00:01:14.549> compared

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
which are phenomenal especially compared

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.240 
which are phenomenal especially compared
to<00:01:15.939> other<00:01:16.360> tablet<00:01:16.869> devices<00:01:17.170> now<00:01:17.950> this<00:01:18.189> is

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
to other tablet devices now this is

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.980 
to other tablet devices now this is
going<00:01:18.460> to<00:01:18.640> be<00:01:18.820> a<00:01:19.000> bit<00:01:19.299> of<00:01:19.390> a<00:01:19.450> difficult

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
going to be a bit of a difficult

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.660 
going to be a bit of a difficult
demonstration<00:01:20.590> because<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.979> sound<00:01:21.219> is<00:01:21.460> only

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
demonstration because the sound is only

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.819 
demonstration because the sound is only
going<00:01:21.880> to<00:01:22.000> be<00:01:22.090> as<00:01:22.119> good<00:01:22.390> as<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:23.020> microphone<00:01:23.619> on

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
going to be as good as the microphone on

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:25.830 
going to be as good as the microphone on
this<00:01:23.979> camera<00:01:24.310> but<00:01:24.969> i'm<00:01:25.060> going<00:01:25.210> to<00:01:25.270> play<00:01:25.539> the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
this camera but i'm going to play the

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.499 
this camera but i'm going to play the
sound<00:01:26.229> on<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:26.680> device<00:01:27.009> anyway<00:01:27.549> just<00:01:28.299> so<00:01:28.450> you

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
sound on the device anyway just so you

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.099 
sound on the device anyway just so you
can<00:01:28.689> hear<00:01:29.049> how<00:01:29.229> loud<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.659> volume<00:01:31.659> is<00:01:31.810> on<00:01:31.840> a

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:32.109 
can hear how loud the volume is on a

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:33.870 
can hear how loud the volume is on a
video<00:01:32.560> i'm<00:01:32.829> going<00:01:32.979> to<00:01:33.070> play<00:01:33.280> something<00:01:33.640> from

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
video i'm going to play something from

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.330 
video i'm going to play something from
the<00:01:33.939> BBC<00:01:34.240> I've<00:01:34.630> got<00:01:35.289> it<00:01:35.380> on<00:01:35.469> full<00:01:35.770> volume<00:01:35.799> so

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
the BBC I've got it on full volume so

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.700 
the BBC I've got it on full volume so
just<00:01:36.549> listen<00:01:36.700> to<00:01:36.909> it<00:01:36.939> analogous<00:01:37.539> volume<00:01:38.020> as<00:01:38.170> we

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
just listen to it analogous volume as we

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.120 
just listen to it analogous volume as we
go<00:01:38.890> through<00:01:39.219> the<00:01:39.369> news<00:01:39.939> report<00:01:40.979> what's<00:01:41.979> wrong

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
go through the news report what's wrong

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.859 
go through the news report what's wrong
with<00:01:42.189> us<00:01:42.490> well<00:01:43.060> I<00:01:43.090> think<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.359> clay<00:01:43.509> position

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
with us well I think the clay position

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.779 
with us well I think the clay position
is<00:01:44.079> that<00:01:44.229> if<00:01:44.289> you<00:01:44.469> want<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:44.920> put<00:01:45.100> an<00:01:45.340> extension

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
is that if you want to put an extension

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.520 
is that if you want to put an extension
on<00:01:45.850> your<00:01:45.909> property<00:01:46.179> then<00:01:47.079> the<00:01:47.170> first<00:01:47.380> thing

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
on your property then the first thing

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.810 
on your property then the first thing
you<00:01:47.619> do<00:01:47.770> is<00:01:47.799> you<00:01:48.009> talk<00:01:48.219> to<00:01:48.340> your<00:01:48.429> neighbors<00:01:48.789> and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
you do is you talk to your neighbors and

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.940 
you do is you talk to your neighbors and
say<00:01:49.119> is<00:01:49.270> this<00:01:49.390> ok<00:01:49.749> then<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:50.409> second<00:01:50.770> thing<00:01:50.920> you

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
say is this ok then the second thing you

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.499 
say is this ok then the second thing you
do<00:01:51.159> is<00:01:51.280> to<00:01:51.369> make<00:01:51.490> sure<00:01:51.549> that<00:01:52.210> you've<00:01:52.299> got<00:01:52.359> an
