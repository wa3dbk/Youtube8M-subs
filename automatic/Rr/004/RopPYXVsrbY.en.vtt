00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.840
 ah 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.580
 welcome to a new video not seen 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.360
 Today we are going to present the new pedal 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.090
 electronic test that is the milestone for two 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:21.119
 is the new version of the classic looper 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.240
 of good aldito electronics has been 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.280
 a series of additions or improvements regarding 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.590
 to the first 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:32.020
 The most important thing is that as you can see 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.020
 two buttons separately 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.540
 the good option to control itself what 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.560
 which are the two buttons to control 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:44.080
 what would be the activation of the play doh 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:47.830
 normal replay of normal rite 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.590
 of very like buttons and the second would be or 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.730
 would be controlled by this mini switch 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.130
 what do you see here 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.570
 for the enjoyment that you see here the 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.690
 function that it has is that when you 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.540
 activate the position of fx with the second 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.510
 button depends as you select the 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.390
 minister the looper who has recorded in 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:12.090
 engraved lucas can be made or formed 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:16.140
 reverse that would be backward or upside down 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.770
 to me the speed of your recording or 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.609
 would convert the second button the fx in the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:28.069
 typical stop ok this would be the functions 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:31.690
 major then also have included 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:34.220
 the search download back in tracks 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.710
 of the central anthrax 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.420
 known 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.670
 the page where you can download everything 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.439
 type of suntracs of various styles 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.350
 if you want to do and a quick test 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.869
 so you can see how it works and 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.630
 we will try a clean rhythm or 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.280
 we will return to the distortion to see is 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.409
 more or less with functions looper the 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.159
 I say is a very quick way for 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.159
 see more or less 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.229
 and not 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.940
 and not 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.129
 do not 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.129
 one 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.150
 ah 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.120
 Hello 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 now 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.910
 and no no 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.910
 if we wanted 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.030
 no no 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.010
 we add our look and if we go back 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.010
 to give here it would sound again 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.950
 i 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.050
 i 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.920
 i 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:42.530
 ok this would be the basic function of the 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.260
 programs your phrase to improvise 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.049
 to learn also and I took important 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.939
 you also have a usb entry that is 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.069
 for the whole issue of the import of 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:55.310
 asian tracks 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:58.159
 and be able to import or export in this case 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.989
 our recordings made of the group at 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:02.900
 computer that is also interesting 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.459
 import or export ok 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.680

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:10.689
