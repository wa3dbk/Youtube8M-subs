00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.739
 we have little business with marseille 

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:05.850
 teamwork and occupying a lot 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:06.460
 of time 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.830
 mud rests with difficulty and beyond that 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.360
 on the surface of the car 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.039
 scratches appear 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:14.499
 other unpleasant owners of things 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:16.859
 how much should be strengthened to put 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.179
 straight 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:20.499
 if any means allow 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:22.069
 solve these problems 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:24.039
 yes such a tool to her 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.110
 it completely removes dirt 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:26.869
 Moreover 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.099
 worth not taking 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:29.839
 only once every three years your car 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:32.839
 will be like new 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.410
 Brand new composition allows for 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.500
 three years forget applauded save 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.500
 polymer processing 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.590
 this amazing year turned out 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.590
 official and sparkling raindrops 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.430
 he has a risk feature which 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.440
 distinguishes it from other similar 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.770
 products and you 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.770
 people see this for themselves 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.250
 and carolina form clarid hardness 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.950
 shell on the car body 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.430
 what is vitreous 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.380
 shell 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.000
 ordinary polishing paste 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.460
 consist of such organic 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.350
 solvents like tar oil 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.659
 damage occurs 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.860
 mastering the pass from the surface of the body 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.650
 so that's the thing 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.480
 so dirt gets 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.530
 directly above it 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.920
 but hurts him 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.920
 so dangerous 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.620
 leaders does not contain organic 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.730
 compounds and one hundred percent consists of 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.740
 glass thanks to this coating for a long time 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.020
 does not collapse and continues 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.610
 effectively protect your car on 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.789
 over three years 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:39.759
 among the products available on the market only 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.560
 who is capable of such 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.560
 it is very interesting 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.350
 let's test it out of film 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.350
 ordinary napkin completely misses 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.350
 water so it probably should be 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.860
 and here napkins covered film 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.509
 picard them 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.099
 does not miss the water great dense 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.250
 glass coating holds it yes 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.250
 really 

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:21.299
 it is this glass film and will protect 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.719
 your car squads more dirt 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.629
 sticks to this coating much worse 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.629
 and washed off much easier 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.219
 that's not drawn water soluble 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:33.369
 martin to side processed with 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:35.129
 with the help of picard it is enough to apply 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.129
 system or asia no longer remains 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:41.619
 one has only to spend on this place 

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:44.479
 a towel and you immediately feel the difference 

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:46.199
 the question of the visit is the means and you 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:47.449
 greatly facilitate and yourself 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:50.029
 cleaning the surface of the glass film is 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:51.859
 wonderful thing st 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.459
 now let's get a real car 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.089
 let's see how this tool 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:57.249
 complicates pollution 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:59.039
 surface and we work right 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:02.039
 half year using peak paradise 

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:08.859
 what are you going to do now we 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.049
 let's put a layer of dirt on the car 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.389
 hurt cars 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.499
 don't worry all right look 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:15.839
 this surface is pre 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:17.599
 processed by picard them dirt 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.799
 runs off quickly which means that 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.689
 the surface will be badly polluted 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.359
 it can really be seen even in color 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.889
 body leave everything as is and spend 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.889
 next experiment let's 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:46.730
 check how easily dirt is removed 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.860
 the help of this powerful machine that my 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.840
 look the most important thing under high pressure 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.840
 plain water 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.019
 see how quickly the dirt disappears under 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:01.879
 jets most ordinary water 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.190
 what is necessary 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.420
 the difference between the right and left sides 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.890
 such dirt is not so easily crushed 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.890
 plain water 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.259
 but we water all the cars 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:29.689
 counterweight for a period of five days 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:31.569
 the hood looks perfect on all sides 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:32.750
 different 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.450
 feel the difference after treatment 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.620
 surfaces using fume play 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.720
 appears bad in a glass jar when 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.529
 easily washed off with water 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:41.969
 this is truly a revolution in 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:44.069
 car wash river ray securely 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:45.900
 protects your favorite car 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.590
 now let's test coverage on 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.889
 the strength of the beer we know whether it protects against 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.889
 scratching 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.240
 we miss a car several times 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.199
 processed by picard eat through 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.139
 powerful apparatus and see what of 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.830
 This will be after giving scratches after washing 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.490
 cars are especially noticeable 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.490
 but can not protect against them 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.949
 garbage is quite aggressive 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.440
 missed one more time it will be the fifth 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.919
 income 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.789
 the car went through the car wash five times 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:38.659
 are released they don't have everything exactly the same as 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:41.309
 It was 

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:43.459
 in the glass shell figaro and reliably 

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:46.459
 protects the cost of washing year 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:52.849
 now let's check it for stability 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:55.740
 acid number of authors so for this 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.159
 how am I a little salyana acid on the body 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:00.059
 by the way if some language of the statue on 

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:03.059
 Aluminum wheels are not necessary 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.669
 but if he is a strong salt 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:22.410
 acid on car body 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:23.620
 for our experiment we 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.670
 We use the year this car usr 360 and 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.870
 models and maybe not better 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.870
 so how does a suburb protect our ferrari 

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:35.939
 try rarely and apply salt 

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:38.409
 acid on her body it surprised that all 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:41.409
 will be ok 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:51.090
 wait a bit and programs this place 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.850
 a towel 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.729
 look what we did 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:55.000
 no trace 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 I can not believe that there was salt 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.390
 acid state what does it mean that we donâ€™t 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.330
 scary acid rains I'm in it 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.330
 made sure 

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:12.909
 glass order created by gregorai 

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:15.080
 reliably protects your favorite car from 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:15.550
 water 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.510
 mud and even acid rain 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.310
 wall research 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.840
 industrial laboratories of the city 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:21.530
 osago 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.270
 testify what action is 

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.400
 orders and lasts for three 

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.550
 years old 

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:27.770
 just great
