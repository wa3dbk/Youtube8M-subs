00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:02.960
 early dressing one lay that 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.040
 in the scent of the big wide 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.150
 even today rather with the smell of Peru 7 or much worse and 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.910
 more dangerous with steaming and lighting maybe they have love 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.599
 Spectators when they took the Easter break away were given that experience over the years 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.830
 tell us now former stewardesses they report from 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.450
 Symptoms of poisoning on board caused by engine in Geneva 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.450
 will be able to bring in the interior of the Campione 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:32.739
 while Lufthansa is on the road again and again finds Beijing is a 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.040
 Experience operated ensures 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.340
 so Lufthansa has the beautiful world of flying in a something 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.559
 wrote and contained bitter works 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.650
 iridescent colorful 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.910
 a dream over the clouds though 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.630
 possible would be a dream there is a possibility that passengers and 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.450
 Crew of this season in the cabin inhaling air 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.090
 and they could probably make you really sick, especially if you're more likely 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.550
 flies 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.770
 the aircraft drove safely as Trox 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.100
 on her own body, the agile Infante experienced the 42-year-old 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.330
 Chief stewardess at Lufthansa 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.300
 Eleven years has flown meanwhile she can chronically refer to air filters 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.720
 do not love anymore 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.760
 Flight unable and highly poisoned 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.350
 Aurelia removed is sure the poisoning has come up 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.300
 undisputed he is that has been poisoned 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.480
 and Sarah 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.820
 the proof in the end there is also something in the case law anyway 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.240
 the circumstantial procedure and all the evidence that you put together over the years 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.770
 I collected doctors as well as myself 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.740
 prove that I'm vaccinating myself for flying through my job 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.450
 have been poisoned 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.030
 the causes see experts in a dangerous cocktail in the hand the 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.100
 give them off that the Tina and venomous ones 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.830
 In addition, one type of aircraft is the breathing air for the cabin to the 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.630
 Tapped engines 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.810
 Changes the seal are defect or the engines can be badly maintained 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.259
 killing a heated engine, especially on violent shocks 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.630
 Erich Mielke enters the cabin unfiltered 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.069
 Doctors say that dangerous synthetic substances that the authorities 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.109
 be approved 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:11.609
 the teams are allowed 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:15.769
 Rainer Frenzel Legs environmental physician and former professor at the University of Bremen 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:16.529
 White 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:19.569
 how dangerous the substances are 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.569
 the CP 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:28.699
 Westerwelle himself wants his nerve poison and that works acute 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:33.149
 So the percent of this tower immediately say that one percent 

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:37.009
 got all the notes and Silvio can do this longer 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:39.849
 by 50 steps and 2 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.629
 on the whole organism not only on the nervous system taken up farmers 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.989
 Nations and that's why it's super 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.369
 may also be bandage for carcinogenesis 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:53.849
 there is a lot about it and there is no possibility for passengers 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.579
 penetrating fumes protect the oxygen masks in the cabin 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.260
 also partially supplied with cabin air 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.199
 relaxed again white by colleagues No the DM connects 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:07.639
 for example that they say so many passengers started to 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:08.500
 Vomit 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.370
 Nausea has started a headache after the perception of a smell 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.340
 Percentage so Rourke similar to vomit like a wet bean too 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.340
 Almost every one of us says we've got a contest 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.819
 there also talked to other stewardesses 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.159
 many confirm the statements 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:32.949
 like this still active flight attendant who does not want to be named out of yore 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:35.729
 an unclear location 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:39.949
 an incident was very concrete it was clear with the plane something is not right and we 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:40.949
 have stated 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:44.990
 that something quit a colleague and I had coughing fits 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.130
 after landing Dinges and very bad we could not score 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.229
 saying goodbye 

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.689
 we reported the incident to the captain but the pilot wanted it 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:54.319
 do not report he said 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.839
 8 will not be so bad but we said it is bad and are 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:59.779
 went to the clinic 

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:03.329
 There were 15 reports last year because of the engine fumes in 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:04.150
 Germany 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.079
 but the under-number is highly critical of aviation experts like 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.799
 Hartmut Beckmann from Verdi 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.439
 because many incidents would not be reported to the aviation authorities 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:17.159
 If you ask the authority then what is on this day on this 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:18.169
 Flight happened 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.029
 that does not happen 

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.620
 in the sense of the citizen then becomes more and more clearly wanted 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.370
 the water happens something like that will not change 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.539
 possibly 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:30.460
 or so it matters and for a reason percent is great that the tank 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.330
 Chen 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.819
 which is conspicuous and which should be investigated 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:37.629
 and that's what they are 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:39.029
 speaks for itself 

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:43.049
 The airlines, however, say all incidents are reported as well 

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:46.409
 they would take all precautions Â»against the invasion of the fight 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:47.469
 cabins 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:49.279
 admits Lufthansa 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:53.019
 Engine management can be under certain unfavorable circumstances 

00:04:53.019 --> 00:04:56.629
 come that this provision does not work to 100% 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:59.990
 In this case, traces of oil or hydraulic fluid can be left 

00:04:59.989 --> 00:05:02.989
 prove temporarily in the cabin air 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.850
 from their point of view, however, the toxic substance PCP has never been in the cabins 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.419
 reaches 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.389
 many stewardesses are unsure 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.389
 left alone by their employer 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.909
 The relationship of trust is disturbed because you feel at liberty 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:22.659
 someone did more than you did yourself 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:25.629
 he uses the 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:29.079
 Aida Infante appeals to Explorer, too 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.819
 it is the duty of each case a passenger 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:35.969
 to inform that thus toxic Allofs 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:40.520
 This information does not take place Dr and 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:46.080
 except with saving on francs to poison people and finally too 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.259
 as an employer to take the duty of care 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:53.169
 offensive against the possible poisoning danger in the aircraft 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.339
 continue fighting for yourself and for others because she knows many colleagues went it 

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:58.360
 similar goes 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.620
 Vienna
