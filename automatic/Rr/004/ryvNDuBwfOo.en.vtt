00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello guys how are you welcome to a 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.000
 new chapter of the dribbling tutorial and 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.200
 today I bring you a special episode 5000 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.390
 subscribers 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.849
 I wanted to thank all the likes 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.010
 favorite comments all the support that 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.980
 you give me day to day and well listen 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.900
 one of the requests that you make me 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.539
 and is that many times you see me use 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.180
 this combo of two dribbles the ball roll and 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.800
 the tail of cow and well then finally 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.350
 I bring you the video explaining how 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.090
 do it and in what situations you can 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.460
 take advantage of it so nothing will we go 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.999
 already with the skill that is this that you see 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.379
 now the ball roll to one side and the 

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:39.839
 cow tail to the opposite side 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:42.960
 to get fired is made of the 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:44.339
 next way we press l 2 or lt up 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.649
 the end of the movement you have to 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:48.510
 keep it and then we would stick 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.239
 right to make the ball roll towards a 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.789
 side and then shotgun ie shot 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.049
 more pass and the left stick towards the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.469
 opposite to the one you have done the 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:01:00.719
 ball roll to come out in advantage as 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.889
 You see, it's that movement that does 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.719
 There are times that can come well 

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:05.549
 even to haggle the goalie goal roll 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.540
 to the side and with the cow to the 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.450
 other 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.910
 to see him already in play I go with asad and in the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.680
 area I make the ball roll towards that side 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.410
 then I intuit that the defense will go to 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.880
 cover that gap and I leave with the tail of 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.340
 cow towards the other as you see he left 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.410
 totally broken and I have the full advantage 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.660
 to throw the door now you are going to see the 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.310
 repetition flew to one side with that of 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.670
 cow towards the other and I was left 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.000
 practically alone 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.860
 you will see more examples very similar 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.689
 because it goes very well in these 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.490
 situations when we are entering 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.210
 the area and we want to face goal then 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.990
 it looks great then you can use it 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.360
 practically anywhere in the 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.220
 field as you see here I do it with tram 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.229
 from the parallel to the goal and remains 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.890
 pretty good and good one thing to have 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.220
 in account is that 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.380
 depending on how much pressure as 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.900
 time pressures the shotgun is going 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.790
 to leave in the queue of cow more or less 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.080
 long here in this example with quintero 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.440
 you've seen a cow tail come out 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.170
 more closed more movement and good nothing 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.970
 more guys this is episode 4 of 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.100
