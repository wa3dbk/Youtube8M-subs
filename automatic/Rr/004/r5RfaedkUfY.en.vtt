 June 2002 the Audi TT with two engines from mtl fast but so far none 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.710
 In 2003, on the other hand, the hope of the MTM people went up in smoke and flames 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.710
 Luckily, no one got hurt 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.570

 unintentionally different from the projects in the past 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.240
 However, it was agreed that the standard ESP was delivered 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.050
 the trust at the moment to more you can barely rebuild a Porsche GT2 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.660
 everything taz more 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.829
 everything is bigger 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:19.829
 stronger than in the series a

 the tuners outdo each other at top speeds 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:32.339
 could it be a door Markus Peters has a very simple cause 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.819
 the fascination of high speed is just that 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.869
 Fascination of fast movement 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:41.729

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:48.369
 always simply thrilled by fast cars 

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:52.099
 and yes, I think everyone has already experienced 200 will probably everyone ever 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.849
 have driven on the highway and with increasing speed »take 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.339
 simply this fascination of fast movement 2

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.800
 makes 565 hp 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:16.059
 after 13 4 times 5 seconds falls the 200 mark 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:24.709
 alpiner not a tuner but a vehicle manufacturer if the 5 Series BMW 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.699
 as a basis remains clearly recognizable 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:30.260
 by compressor it brings the figure 4-liter v8 to 500 hp 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:39.969
 the alpine, which incidentally also exists as a combo, reaches 14 point 5 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:42.699
 Second pace 200 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:43.440

 receives a power boost of 83 hp makes the bottom line 560 hp 

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:21.219
 July 2005, despite extremely powerful engines, these cars are difficult for one 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.150
 These cars today are more characterized by the fact that they are really on the road 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.749
 normal road for what makes him easy now 

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:32.379
