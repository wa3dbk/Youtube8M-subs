00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
here is a black Lily the black lily with

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.280 
here is a black Lily the black lily with
nickel<00:00:32.610> hardware<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.450> bought<00:00:33.840> as<00:00:34.200> you

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.740 
nickel hardware and that I bought as you
can<00:00:34.410> see<00:00:34.590> it's<00:00:34.770> Betty<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.329> leather<00:00:36.540> is

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
can see it's Betty but the leather is

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.250 
can see it's Betty but the leather is
quite<00:00:37.020> thick<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.059> rigid<00:00:39.059> which<00:00:39.510> i<00:00:39.750> think<00:00:39.899> is

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
quite thick and rigid which i think is

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.560 
quite thick and rigid which i think is
useful<00:00:40.680> because<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.850> sort<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.120> holds<00:00:42.450> its

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
useful because it sort of holds its

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.540 
useful because it sort of holds its
shape<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.559> can<00:00:43.590> fit<00:00:43.950> more<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.309> there

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
shape and you can fit more in there

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.420 
shape and you can fit more in there
without<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.420> going<00:00:45.539> all<00:00:45.809> spooky<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.469> having

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
without it going all spooky and having

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.639 
without it going all spooky and having
to<00:00:47.520> run<00:00:47.730> things<00:00:48.000> inside<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:49.079> that's<00:00:49.289> quite

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
to run things inside so that's quite

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.310 
to run things inside so that's quite
useful<00:00:49.860> at<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.520> moment<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.969> Lily<00:00:51.780> that
