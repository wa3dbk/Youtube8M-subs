since then games been pretty much out

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.340 
since then games been pretty much out
for<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> month<00:00:37.650> or<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.130> now<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:39.450> have<00:00:40.110> played

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
for a month or so now and I have played

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.840 
for a month or so now and I have played
it<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.590> lot<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.809> yeah<00:00:42.809> okay<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.829> first<00:00:44.190> thing<00:00:44.430> I

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
it a lot so yeah okay the first thing I

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.479 
it a lot so yeah okay the first thing I
think<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.840> maps<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.710> game<00:00:46.920> look<00:00:47.160> really

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
think the maps in this game look really

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.709 
think the maps in this game look really
great<00:00:48.440> but<00:00:49.579> these<00:00:50.579> maps<00:00:50.940> are<00:00:51.180> too<00:00:51.390> small

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
great but these maps are too small

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.970 
great but these maps are too small
especially<00:00:52.649> for<00:00:52.800> search<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.219> destroy

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
especially for search and destroy

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.090 
especially for search and destroy
because<00:00:56.210> like<00:00:57.210> right<00:00:58.079> when<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.410> spawn<00:00:58.710> like

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
because like right when you spawn like

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.720 
because like right when you spawn like
after<00:00:59.579> like<00:00:59.899> 15-20<00:01:00.899> seconds<00:01:01.489> you're<00:01:02.489> already

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
after like 15-20 seconds you're already

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.760 
after like 15-20 seconds you're already
getting<00:01:03.149> into<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> gunfight<00:01:04.940> which<00:01:05.940> is<00:01:06.770> great

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
getting into a gunfight which is great

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.970 
getting into a gunfight which is great
if<00:01:07.800> you're<00:01:08.190> sure<00:01:08.460> but<00:01:08.850> for<00:01:09.030> someone<00:01:09.180> like<00:01:09.300> me

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
if you're sure but for someone like me

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.969 
if you're sure but for someone like me
you<00:01:11.330> wanted<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.450> get<00:01:12.660> yourself<00:01:12.900> set<00:01:13.350> up<00:01:13.500> right

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
you wanted to get yourself set up right

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.310 
you wanted to get yourself set up right
so<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.939> don't<00:01:15.090> really<00:01:15.180> have<00:01:15.360> time<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.990> most<00:01:16.200> of

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
so you don't really have time in most of

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.429 
so you don't really have time in most of
the<00:01:16.380> time<00:01:16.619> i<00:01:16.890> die<00:01:17.850> by<00:01:18.659> Russia<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.200> cuz<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.380> don't

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
the time i die by Russia it cuz I don't

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.620 
the time i die by Russia it cuz I don't
really<00:01:19.590> expect<00:01:20.070> them<00:01:20.450> and<00:01:23.270> it's<00:01:24.270> not<00:01:24.390> painted

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
really expect them and it's not painted

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.060 
really expect them and it's not painted
that<00:01:24.930> sometimes<00:01:25.759> so<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.820> gotta<00:01:27.530> adapt<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070

it<00:02:28.290> if<00:02:29.290> you're<00:02:29.950> close<00:02:30.130> range<00:02:31.320> it's<00:02:32.320> obvious

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
it if you're close range it's obvious

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.980 
it if you're close range it's obvious
they're<00:02:33.010> going<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.250> win<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.490> fight<00:02:33.900> even<00:02:34.900> if

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
they're going to win the fight even if

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.720 
they're going to win the fight even if
you<00:02:35.050> have<00:02:35.170> like<00:02:35.350> a<00:02:35.380> decent<00:02:35.680> aim<00:02:36.070> and<00:02:38.700> yeah<00:02:39.700> I

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
you have like a decent aim and yeah I

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.160 
you have like a decent aim and yeah I
think<00:02:39.940> they<00:02:40.240> should<00:02:40.420> really<00:02:40.630> nerve<00:02:40.930> that

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
think they should really nerve that

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.620 
think they should really nerve that
kimbos<00:02:41.650> instead<00:02:42.160> of<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.370> type<00:02:42.610> 95<00:02:43.000> or<00:02:43.450> just

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
kimbos instead of the type 95 or just

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.120 
kimbos instead of the type 95 or just
add<00:02:43.810> that<00:02:43.960> type<00:02:44.170> 95<00:02:44.500> in<00:02:44.830> there<00:02:44.980> or<00:02:45.070> something

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
add that type 95 in there or something

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.370 
add that type 95 in there or something
because<00:02:45.700> it<00:02:46.420> was<00:02:46.510> going<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:46.810> really<00:02:46.990> annoying

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
because it was going to really annoying

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.760 
because it was going to really annoying
I<00:02:47.680> just<00:02:48.100> hate<00:02:48.250> those<00:02:48.490> like<00:02:48.850> I<00:02:49.150> die<00:02:49.990> by<00:02:50.440> him<00:02:50.560> so

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
I just hate those like I die by him so

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.290 
I just hate those like I die by him so
much<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:51.010> sometimes<00:02:51.280> just<00:02:51.700> rage<00:02:51.970> quit

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
much that sometimes just rage quit

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.820 
much that sometimes just rage quit
because<00:02:52.390> like<00:02:52.600> they're<00:02:53.350> supposed<00:02:53.440> to<00:02:53.680> be

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
because like they're supposed to be

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.470 
because like they're supposed to be
secondaries<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:54.460> all<00:02:54.700> if<00:02:54.850> he's<00:02:55.000> just<00:02:55.150> people

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
secondaries and all if he's just people

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.700 
secondaries and all if he's just people
running<00:02:55.750> around<00:02:55.840> with<00:02:56.170> them<00:02:56.290> would<00:02:56.410> study<00:02:56.620> a

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
running around with them would study a

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.340 
running around with them would study a
man<00:02:57.160> fucking<00:02:57.670> sleight<00:02:58.540> of<00:02:58.570> hand<00:02:59.140> pro<00:02:59.640> and<00:03:01.350> just

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
man fucking sleight of hand pro and just

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.570 
man fucking sleight of hand pro and just
running<00:03:02.650> around<00:03:02.710> with<00:03:02.980> those<00:03:03.130> and<00:03:03.430> just

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
running around with those and just

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.400 
running around with those and just
fucking<00:03:03.910> using<00:03:04.180> them<00:03:04.300> as<00:03:04.390> primaries<00:03:04.930> and

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
fucking using them as primaries and

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.010 
fucking using them as primaries and
another<00:03:05.980> thing<00:03:06.250> I<00:03:06.520> think<00:03:06.880> Infinity<00:03:07.750> Ward

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
another thing I think Infinity Ward

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.860 
another thing I think Infinity Ward
should<00:03:08.410> not<00:03:08.590> have<00:03:08.740> brought<00:03:08.890> to<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.310> game<00:03:09.870> is

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
should not have brought to the game is

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.250 
should not have brought to the game is
that<00:03:11.590> lag<00:03:11.980> compensation<00:03:12.820> shit<00:03:13.390> like<00:03:14.020> for<00:03:14.200> the

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
that lag compensation shit like for the

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.720 
that lag compensation shit like for the
first<00:03:14.440> couple<00:03:14.680> of<00:03:14.860> weeks<00:03:14.920> I<00:03:15.280> just<00:03:15.490> thought<00:03:15.580> the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
first couple of weeks I just thought the

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.430 
first couple of weeks I just thought the
game<00:03:15.880> was<00:03:16.060> lagging<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:16.630> he'll<00:03:16.960> probably<00:03:17.110> get

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
game was lagging and he'll probably get

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.490 
game was lagging and he'll probably get
a<00:03:17.500> fix<00:03:17.800> for<00:03:18.070> that<00:03:18.130> sooner<00:03:18.700> or<00:03:18.730> later<00:03:19.500> couple

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
a fix for that sooner or later couple

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.950 
a fix for that sooner or later couple
patches<00:03:20.830> went<00:03:21.250> by<00:03:21.430> nothing<00:03:21.880> nothing<00:03:22.690> I<00:03:22.780> got<00:03:22.930> a

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
patches went by nothing nothing I got a

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.600 
patches went by nothing nothing I got a
little<00:03:23.170> better<00:03:23.470> but<00:03:23.710> nothing<00:03:24.070> really<00:03:24.250> major

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
little better but nothing really major

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.479 
little better but nothing really major
so<00:03:25.120> did<00:03:25.930> some<00:03:26.110> research<00:03:26.290> found<00:03:26.830> out<00:03:27.070> it<00:03:27.340> was

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
so did some research found out it was

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.830 
so did some research found out it was
lag<00:03:27.790> compensation<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:29.730> I<00:03:30.730> don't<00:03:31.540> think<00:03:31.660> the

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
lag compensation and I don't think the

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.080 
lag compensation and I don't think the
bad<00:03:32.050> player<00:03:32.410> should<00:03:32.590> really<00:03:32.920> get<00:03:33.130> rewarded

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
bad player should really get rewarded

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.300 
bad player should really get rewarded

anywhere<00:05:40.750> guys<00:05:41.020> um<00:05:41.500> this<00:05:42.460> was<00:05:42.640> a<00:05:42.670> pretty<00:05:42.910> close

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
anywhere guys um this was a pretty close

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.280 
anywhere guys um this was a pretty close
game<00:05:43.830> we<00:05:44.830> lost<00:05:45.070> so<00:05:45.550> I<00:05:46.030> thought<00:05:46.690> I<00:05:46.750> just<00:05:47.020> put<00:05:47.200> it

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290 
game we lost so I thought I just put it

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.610 
game we lost so I thought I just put it
up<00:05:47.410> because<00:05:48.510> we<00:05:49.510> were<00:05:49.690> catching<00:05:49.960> up<00:05:50.260> to<00:05:50.440> them

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
up because we were catching up to them

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.360 
up because we were catching up to them
if<00:05:50.860> my<00:05:51.430> team<00:05:51.730> just<00:05:52.060> didn't<00:05:52.750> die<00:05:53.080> a<00:05:53.110> lot<00:05:53.500> closer

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
if my team just didn't die a lot closer

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.210 
if my team just didn't die a lot closer
to<00:05:54.520> the<00:05:54.580> end<00:05:54.760> I<00:05:54.880> think<00:05:54.910> we<00:05:55.180> would<00:05:55.270> have<00:05:55.360> won<00:05:55.450> and

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
to the end I think we would have won and

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.910 
to the end I think we would have won and
getting<00:05:57.220> back<00:05:57.370> to<00:05:57.610> the<00:05:57.760> mp7<00:05:58.450> I<00:05:59.200> think<00:05:59.590> that

00:05:59.910 --> 00:05:59.920 
getting back to the mp7 I think that

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.830 
getting back to the mp7 I think that
it's<00:06:00.310> one<00:06:00.490> of<00:06:00.580> the<00:06:00.670> best<00:06:00.880> SMGs<00:06:01.540> I've<00:06:01.690> been
