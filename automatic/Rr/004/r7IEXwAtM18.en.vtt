00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.600 
this super thing while smoking so now
see<00:03:15.510> it's<00:03:15.689> still<00:03:15.870> not<00:03:16.019> there<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.500> then<00:03:17.370> if<00:03:17.489> I

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
see it's still not there and then if I

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.630 
see it's still not there and then if I
go<00:03:17.640> there<00:03:17.790> it's<00:03:18.510> flashing<00:03:18.840> on<00:03:19.110> and<00:03:19.140> off<00:03:19.640> now

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
go there it's flashing on and off now

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.170 
go there it's flashing on and off now
that<00:03:20.819> I'm<00:03:20.939> going<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.180> pipe<00:03:21.599> to<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:21.870> part<00:03:22.200> 1<00:03:23.180> still

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
that I'm going to pipe to a part 1 still

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.740 
that I'm going to pipe to a part 1 still
so<00:03:24.840> it's<00:03:24.959> flashing<00:03:25.230> on<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.500> off<00:03:26.599> still<00:03:27.599> not

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
so it's flashing on and off still not

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.559 
so it's flashing on and off still not
there<00:03:28.340> go<00:03:29.510> register<00:03:30.829> start<00:03:31.829> scanning<00:03:32.569> just

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
there go register start scanning just

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:40.580 
there go register start scanning just
wait<00:03:33.780> for<00:03:34.049> it<00:03:35.629> and<00:03:36.629> it<00:03:36.780> came<00:03:36.930> up<00:03:37.140> see<00:03:39.260> it<00:03:40.260> came

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
wait for it and it came up see it came

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.869 
wait for it and it came up see it came
up<00:03:40.769> so<00:03:41.280> now<00:03:41.519> all<00:03:41.849> have<00:03:42.209> to<00:03:42.329> do<00:03:42.480> is<00:03:42.599> go<00:03:42.780> X<00:03:46.459> and<00:03:47.459> as

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
up so now all have to do is go X and as

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.569 
up so now all have to do is go X and as
mostly<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:48.390> probably<00:03:48.900> know<00:03:49.200> that<00:03:49.590> our<00:03:49.950> past

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
mostly you probably know that our past

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.059 
mostly you probably know that our past
key<00:03:51.090> for<00:03:51.510> most<00:03:51.870> Bluetooth<00:03:52.290> stuff<00:03:52.590> is<00:03:52.799> just

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
key for most Bluetooth stuff is just

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.860 
key for most Bluetooth stuff is just
triple<00:03:53.489> zero<00:03:53.670> so<00:03:54.200> it<00:03:55.200> will<00:03:55.530> load<00:03:56.870> well

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
triple zero so it will load well

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.449 
triple zero so it will load well
obviously<00:03:58.139> it's<00:03:58.440> not<00:03:58.500> going<00:03:58.739> to<00:03:58.859> come<00:03:59.190> up<00:03:59.340> on

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
obviously it's not going to come up on

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.399 
obviously it's not going to come up on
my<00:03:59.609> fans<00:03:59.849> bit<00:04:00.090> blurry<00:04:00.359> so<00:04:00.659> just<00:04:01.440> go<00:04:03.079> 0000<00:04:04.079> four

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
my fans bit blurry so just go 0000 four

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:14.530 
my fans bit blurry so just go 0000 four
zeros<00:04:07.549> enter<00:04:09.590> okay<00:04:12.379> register<00:04:13.379> completely<00:04:14.010> and

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
zeros enter okay register completely and

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.569 
zeros enter okay register completely and
then<00:04:15.769> it<00:04:16.769> stopped<00:04:17.459> flashing<00:04:18.739> and<00:04:19.739> i'll<00:04:20.430> be

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
then it stopped flashing and i'll be

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.610 
then it stopped flashing and i'll be
doing<00:04:20.849> that<00:04:21.090> say<00:04:21.359> stop<00:04:22.199> going<00:04:22.440> between

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
doing that say stop going between

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.589 
doing that say stop going between
different<00:04:23.190> colors<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:23.520> then<00:04:23.760> if<00:04:23.880> i<00:04:24.000> see<00:04:24.389> it

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
different colors and then if i see it

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.240 
different colors and then if i see it
says<00:04:24.810> it's<00:04:24.990> on<00:04:25.199> but<00:04:25.500> it<00:04:25.590> won't<00:04:25.740> actually<00:04:25.860> work

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
says it's on but it won't actually work

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.469 
says it's on but it won't actually work
so<00:04:26.550> what<00:04:26.669> I'll<00:04:26.760> have<00:04:26.910> to<00:04:27.000> do<00:04:27.240> is<00:04:27.900> go<00:04:28.110> circle

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
so what I'll have to do is go circle

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:37.189 
so what I'll have to do is go circle
that<00:04:31.580> um<00:04:33.380> audio<00:04:34.380> device<00:04:34.800> settings<00:04:34.830> and<00:04:36.199> where

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
that um audio device settings and where

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.890 
that um audio device settings and where
it<00:04:37.289> says<00:04:37.500> input<00:04:38.039> device<00:04:38.419> you<00:04:39.419> want<00:04:39.539> to<00:04:39.660> choose

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
it says input device you want to choose

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.460 
it says input device you want to choose
the<00:04:43.260> what<00:04:44.160> I<00:04:44.190> want<00:04:44.490> see<00:04:44.760> and<00:04:45.270> now<00:04:45.960> I've
