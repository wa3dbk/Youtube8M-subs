borrowed rubber leg you can buy rubber
legs<00:00:36.400> with<00:00:36.550> the<00:00:36.700> barring<00:00:37.060> but<00:00:37.239> sometimes<00:00:37.690> you

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
legs with the barring but sometimes you

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.180 
legs with the barring but sometimes you
don't<00:00:37.989> have<00:00:38.140> just<00:00:38.380> the<00:00:38.530> color<00:00:38.739> or<00:00:38.950> size<00:00:39.160> you

need so here's a technique for adding
borrowing<00:00:42.190> to<00:00:42.310> solid<00:00:42.640> color<00:00:42.820> legs<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:44.320> only

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
borrowing to solid color legs this only

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.170 
borrowing to solid color legs this only
works<00:00:44.890> if<00:00:45.010> you're<00:00:45.160> adding<00:00:45.460> dark<00:00:45.700> bars<00:00:45.970> on

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
works if you're adding dark bars on

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.939 
works if you're adding dark bars on
lighter<00:00:46.360> color<00:00:46.630> legs<00:00:46.960> but<00:00:47.500> that's<00:00:47.680> usually

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
lighter color legs but that's usually

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.799 
lighter color legs but that's usually
what<00:00:48.070> you<00:00:48.190> want<00:00:48.340> to<00:00:48.399> do<00:00:48.489> anyway<00:00:48.760> the<00:00:49.300> materials

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
what you want to do anyway the materials

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.290 
what you want to do anyway the materials
to<00:00:49.930> do<00:00:50.050> this<00:00:50.199> are<00:00:50.440> simple<00:00:50.699> some<00:00:51.699> solid<00:00:52.090> color

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
to do this are simple some solid color

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.060 
to do this are simple some solid color
rubber<00:00:52.570> legs<00:00:52.899> which<00:00:53.199> usually<00:00:53.410> come<00:00:53.739> in<00:00:53.769> a<00:00:53.890> roll

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
rubber legs which usually come in a roll

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.220 
rubber legs which usually come in a roll
like<00:00:54.340> this<00:00:54.670> you<00:00:55.000> can<00:00:55.090> see<00:00:55.269> here<00:00:55.539> I'm<00:00:55.719> holding<00:00:55.929> a

like this you can see here I'm holding a
where<00:00:56.920> I've<00:00:57.010> unrolled<00:00:57.460> it<00:00:57.640> and<00:00:57.730> it's<00:00:57.850> just<00:00:58.030> a

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
where I've unrolled it and it's just a

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.419 
where I've unrolled it and it's just a
batch<00:00:58.780> of<00:00:58.809> legs<00:00:59.260> and<00:00:59.530> you<00:00:59.589> strip<00:00:59.920> out<00:01:00.100> the

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:00.429 
batch of legs and you strip out the

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.599 
batch of legs and you strip out the
individual<00:01:01.329> legs<00:01:01.629> as<00:01:01.899> you<00:01:01.929> need<00:01:02.230> them<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.550> you

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
individual legs as you need them and you

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.430 
individual legs as you need them and you
need<00:01:03.850> a<00:01:03.879> permanent<00:01:04.239> color<00:01:04.480> marker<00:01:04.960> I'm<00:01:05.230> using

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
need a permanent color marker I'm using

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.410 
need a permanent color marker I'm using
a<00:01:05.620> sharpie<00:01:06.070> but<00:01:06.310> Prisma<00:01:06.700> colors<00:01:06.970> work<00:01:07.180> well

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
a sharpie but Prisma colors work well

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.210 
a sharpie but Prisma colors work well
just<00:01:07.450> any<00:01:07.960> permanent<00:01:08.440> colored<00:01:08.800> marker

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
just any permanent colored marker

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.980 
just any permanent colored marker
prismacolor<00:01:09.970> comes<00:01:10.390> in<00:01:10.540> a<00:01:10.600> lot<00:01:10.750> of<00:01:10.780> different

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
prismacolor comes in a lot of different

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.750 
prismacolor comes in a lot of different
colors<00:01:11.470> so<00:01:11.620> that<00:01:11.770> can<00:01:11.890> be<00:01:11.920> very<00:01:12.220> useful<00:01:12.280> for

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
colors so that can be very useful for

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.899 
colors so that can be very useful for
some<00:01:12.940> flies<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:14.260> let's<00:01:14.500> go<00:01:14.590> ahead<00:01:14.740> and<00:01:15.130> make

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
some flies so let's go ahead and make

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.620 
some flies so let's go ahead and make
some<00:01:15.970> borrowing<00:01:16.450> on<00:01:16.540> some<00:01:16.690> rubber<00:01:16.780> legs<00:01:18.630> put

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
some borrowing on some rubber legs put

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.420 
some borrowing on some rubber legs put
the<00:01:19.750> piece<00:01:19.960> of<00:01:20.170> rubber<00:01:21.030> into<00:01:22.030> your<00:01:22.150> vice<00:01:23.430> it's

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
the piece of rubber into your vice it's

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.770 
the piece of rubber into your vice it's
just<00:01:24.640> going<00:01:24.730> to<00:01:24.820> hold<00:01:25.000> it<00:01:25.180> don't<00:01:25.450> get<00:01:25.540> it<00:01:25.600> too

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
just going to hold it don't get it too

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.570 
just going to hold it don't get it too
tight<00:01:26.080> at<00:01:26.350> that<00:01:26.860> point<00:01:27.190> you're<00:01:27.310> going<00:01:27.340> to<00:01:27.460> just

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
tight at that point you're going to just

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.210 
tight at that point you're going to just
take<00:01:27.820> it<00:01:28.060> and<00:01:28.240> you're<00:01:28.390> going<00:01:28.420> to<00:01:28.540> twist<00:01:28.960> it<00:01:29.220> and

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
take it and you're going to twist it and

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.000 
take it and you're going to twist it and
you<00:01:30.480> can<00:01:31.480> see<00:01:31.720> as<00:01:31.840> I<00:01:31.870> twist<00:01:32.020> it<00:01:32.470> it<00:01:32.620> starts<00:01:32.950> to

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
you can see as I twist it it starts to

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.590 
you can see as I twist it it starts to
kind<00:01:33.190> of<00:01:33.310> curl<00:01:33.610> up<00:01:33.790> on<00:01:33.940> itself

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
kind of curl up on itself

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.650 
kind of curl up on itself
now<00:01:35.020> how<00:01:35.200> Thai<00:01:35.260> you<00:01:35.500> twist<00:01:36.100> it<00:01:36.340> determines<00:01:37.030> how

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
now how Thai you twist it determines how

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.340 
now how Thai you twist it determines how
close<00:01:37.990> together<00:01:38.380> you're<00:01:38.620> barring<00:01:39.070> is<00:01:40.080> at<00:01:41.080> that

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
close together you're barring is at that

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.560 
close together you're barring is at that
point<00:01:41.650> you<00:01:42.010> want<00:01:42.100> to<00:01:42.190> take<00:01:42.280> your<00:01:42.670> black<00:01:43.120> magic

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
point you want to take your black magic

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:51.270 
point you want to take your black magic
marker<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:44.650> in<00:01:45.100> one<00:01:45.340> stroke<00:01:46.980> apply<00:01:49.950> okay<00:01:50.950> now

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
marker and in one stroke apply okay now

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.680 
marker and in one stroke apply okay now
the<00:01:51.340> reason<00:01:51.700> I<00:01:51.760> stopped<00:01:52.060> right<00:01:52.300> there<00:01:52.480> is<00:01:52.570> you

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
the reason I stopped right there is you

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.380 
the reason I stopped right there is you
can't<00:01:52.990> go<00:01:53.170> back<00:01:53.380> over<00:01:53.740> a<00:01:53.770> spot<00:01:54.100> so<00:01:54.940> what<00:01:55.120> I<00:01:55.150> have

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
now I got I got it on there I'll let it

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.150 
now I got I got it on there I'll let it
dry<00:01:58.960> a<00:01:58.990> second<00:01:59.620> and<00:02:00.150> then<00:02:01.150> I<00:02:01.240> release<00:02:01.450> it<00:02:02.160> and

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
dry a second and then I release it and

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.380 
dry a second and then I release it and
when<00:02:03.700> you<00:02:03.790> release<00:02:04.090> it<00:02:04.560> what<00:02:05.560> you<00:02:05.740> see<00:02:05.770> is

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
when you release it what you see is

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.229 
when you release it what you see is
you've<00:02:07.390> got<00:02:07.660> barring<00:02:08.440> on<00:02:08.709> your<00:02:09.310> legs<00:02:09.550> now

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
you've got barring on your legs now

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.170 
you've got barring on your legs now
right<00:02:10.660> here<00:02:11.290> is<00:02:12.099> where<00:02:12.340> I<00:02:12.370> made<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.640> mistake

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
right here is where I made the mistake

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.059 
right here is where I made the mistake
and<00:02:13.780> that's<00:02:13.900> why<00:02:14.140> I<00:02:14.170> stopped<00:02:14.530> because<00:02:14.769> I<00:02:14.920> knew

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
and that's why I stopped because I knew

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.070 
and that's why I stopped because I knew
it's<00:02:15.220> going<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.400> be<00:02:15.459> a<00:02:15.489> mistake<00:02:15.849> so<00:02:16.690> what<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:16.870> can

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
it's going to be a mistake so what I can

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.890 
it's going to be a mistake so what I can
do<00:02:17.200> now<00:02:17.379> I<00:02:17.769> can<00:02:17.980> take<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.519> legs<00:02:18.730> out<00:02:19.000> from<00:02:19.360> that

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
do now I can take the legs out from that

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.520 
do now I can take the legs out from that
point<00:02:20.519> put<00:02:21.519> them<00:02:21.640> in<00:02:21.910> because<00:02:22.870> usually<00:02:23.380> your

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
point put them in because usually your

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.370 
point put them in because usually your
legs<00:02:23.740> aren't<00:02:23.950> very<00:02:24.130> long<00:02:24.220> anyway<00:02:25.260> repeat<00:02:26.260> the

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
legs aren't very long anyway repeat the

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.320 
legs aren't very long anyway repeat the
process<00:02:26.590> over

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
process over

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.200 
process over
immune<00:02:29.930> one<00:02:30.930> key<00:02:31.200> is<00:02:31.550> once<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:32.760> start<00:02:33.060> the

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
immune one key is once you start the

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.810 
immune one key is once you start the
stripe<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:34.380> can't<00:02:34.650> stop<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.400> if<00:02:35.460> you<00:02:35.580> make<00:02:35.790> a

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
stripe you can't stop and if you make a

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.640 
stripe you can't stop and if you make a
mistake<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.660> just<00:02:36.870> have<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.110> live<00:02:37.320> with<00:02:37.350> it

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
mistake you just have to live with it

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.530 
mistake you just have to live with it
because<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.250> can't<00:02:38.280> go<00:02:38.640> back<00:02:38.820> over<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.300> same

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
because you can't go back over the same

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.410 
because you can't go back over the same
spot<00:02:39.930> again<00:02:41.270> so<00:02:42.270> here<00:02:42.510> we<00:02:42.630> go<00:02:44.120> I'm<00:02:45.120> just<00:02:45.180> going

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
spot again so here we go I'm just going

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.000 
spot again so here we go I'm just going
to<00:02:45.450> come<00:02:45.660> down<00:02:45.840> below<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.470> apply<00:02:47.040> some<00:02:47.340> more

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
to come down below that apply some more

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.350 
to come down below that apply some more
never<00:02:50.010> go<00:02:50.190> back<00:02:50.370> over<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.760> same<00:02:51.000> spot<00:02:51.330> you

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
never go back over the same spot you

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.640 
never go back over the same spot you
just<00:02:51.720> did<00:02:51.990> you<00:02:52.650> hold<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:53.070> let<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:53.280> dry<00:02:53.580> a<00:02:53.610> second

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
just did you hold it let it dry a second

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.370 
just did you hold it let it dry a second
release<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.880> there<00:02:57.270> are<00:02:57.300> some<00:02:57.600> more<00:02:57.810> bar

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
release it and there are some more bar

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.250 
release it and there are some more bar
legs<00:02:58.740> so<00:02:59.610> that's<00:02:59.820> the<00:02:59.970> basics<00:03:00.390> of<00:03:00.510> how<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:00.660> do

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
legs so that's the basics of how you do

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.150 
legs so that's the basics of how you do
it<00:03:01.460> it's<00:03:02.460> very<00:03:02.730> very<00:03:02.790> simple<00:03:03.240> I<00:03:03.920> want<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:04.980> thank
