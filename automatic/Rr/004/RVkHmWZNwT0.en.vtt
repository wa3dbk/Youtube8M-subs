00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.110 

I<00:00:16.410> love<00:00:17.410> this<00:00:17.530> little<00:00:17.800> thing<00:00:17.980> well<00:00:18.730> this<00:00:18.940> is

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:19.120 
I love this little thing well this is

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.090 
I love this little thing well this is
this<00:00:19.420> is<00:00:19.600> an<00:00:19.720> exciting<00:00:20.080> product<00:00:20.710> because<00:00:20.950> this

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.100 
this is an exciting product because this

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.220 
this is an exciting product because this
is<00:00:21.280> something<00:00:21.520> that's<00:00:21.850> totally<00:00:22.330> unique<00:00:22.780> and

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
is something that's totally unique and

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.470 
is something that's totally unique and
different<00:00:23.650> and<00:00:24.130> that's<00:00:24.670> what<00:00:24.910> we<00:00:25.030> like<00:00:25.240> to<00:00:25.270> do

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
different and that's what we like to do

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.810 
different and that's what we like to do
we<00:00:25.630> really<00:00:25.840> like<00:00:26.110> designing<00:00:27.040> products<00:00:27.580> that

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
we really like designing products that

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.730 
we really like designing products that
take<00:00:28.150> a<00:00:28.180> whole<00:00:28.450> new<00:00:28.630> fresh<00:00:28.900> approach<00:00:29.320> and<00:00:29.590> try

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
take a whole new fresh approach and try

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.380 
take a whole new fresh approach and try
to<00:00:29.800> solve<00:00:30.040> a<00:00:30.250> problem<00:00:30.730> that<00:00:30.760> hasn't<00:00:31.119> been

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
to solve a problem that hasn't been

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.720 
to solve a problem that hasn't been
solved<00:00:31.720> before<00:00:31.869> and<00:00:32.410> I<00:00:33.160> think<00:00:33.400> we've<00:00:33.550> done

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
solved before and I think we've done

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.890 
solved before and I think we've done
that<00:00:33.910> here<00:00:33.970> and<00:00:34.150> it's<00:00:34.270> taken<00:00:34.540> us<00:00:34.630> a<00:00:34.720> long<00:00:34.870> time

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
that here and it's taken us a long time

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.360 
that here and it's taken us a long time
to<00:00:35.140> do<00:00:35.380> it<00:00:35.500> I<00:00:35.590> mean<00:00:35.739> we're<00:00:35.860> not<00:00:35.890> gonna<00:00:36.100> lie<00:00:36.309> this

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
to do it I mean we're not gonna lie this

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.760 
to do it I mean we're not gonna lie this
thing<00:00:36.820> has<00:00:36.940> been<00:00:37.120> a<00:00:37.540> year<00:00:37.900> right<00:00:38.380> we've<00:00:38.559> known

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
thing has been a year right we've known

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.410 
thing has been a year right we've known
the<00:00:38.920> problem<00:00:39.309> but<00:00:39.460> to<00:00:39.520> get<00:00:39.940> to<00:00:40.150> the<00:00:40.239> solution

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
the problem but to get to the solution

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.410 
the problem but to get to the solution
took<00:00:41.110> a<00:00:41.230> few<00:00:41.380> iterations<00:00:41.559> a<00:00:42.100> lot<00:00:42.460> of<00:00:42.640> it<00:00:42.760> okay

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
took a few iterations a lot of it okay

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.020 
took a few iterations a lot of it okay
sure<00:00:43.870> but<00:00:44.230> I<00:00:44.800> what<00:00:45.040> I<00:00:45.070> like<00:00:45.340> is<00:00:45.489> that<00:00:45.520> we<00:00:45.730> did<00:00:45.910> it

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
sure but I what I like is that we did it

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.090 
sure but I what I like is that we did it
in<00:00:46.150> an<00:00:46.270> incredibly<00:00:46.840> simple<00:00:47.410> way<00:00:47.559> we<00:00:47.739> started

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
in an incredibly simple way we started

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.880 
in an incredibly simple way we started
off<00:00:48.250> with<00:00:48.430> all<00:00:48.610> kinds<00:00:48.910> of<00:00:48.970> crazy<00:00:49.440> cables<00:00:50.440> yeah

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
off with all kinds of crazy cables yeah

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.799 
off with all kinds of crazy cables yeah
sometimes<00:00:51.580> simpler<00:00:51.910> is<00:00:51.940> better<00:00:52.030> we're<00:00:52.720> gonna

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
sometimes simpler is better we're gonna

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.079 
sometimes simpler is better we're gonna
let's<00:00:53.260> first<00:00:53.559> talk<00:00:53.739> about<00:00:53.800> the<00:00:54.460> technology

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
let's first talk about the technology

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.600 
let's first talk about the technology
behind<00:00:55.600> the<00:00:56.050> if<00:00:56.500> you<00:00:56.680> can<00:00:56.830> even<00:00:57.040> call<00:00:57.280> it<00:00:57.309> tech

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
behind the if you can even call it tech

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.090 
behind the if you can even call it tech
now<00:00:57.760> well<00:00:58.000> yeah<00:00:58.269> it's<00:00:58.659> a<00:00:58.780> u-joint<00:00:58.930> that<00:00:59.500> would

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
now well yeah it's a u-joint that would

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.280 
now well yeah it's a u-joint that would
be<00:01:00.220> used<00:01:00.460> for<00:01:00.640> the<00:01:01.019> drivetrain

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
be used for the drivetrain

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.290 
be used for the drivetrain
on<00:01:02.500> automobiles<00:01:03.190> right<00:01:03.670> you<00:01:03.970> know<00:01:04.059> I<00:01:04.089> mean

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
on automobiles right you know I mean

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.910 
on automobiles right you know I mean
it's<00:01:04.449> that<00:01:04.510> simple<00:01:04.629> it's<00:01:05.170> that<00:01:05.230> technology

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
it's that simple it's that technology

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.380 
it's that simple it's that technology
actually<00:01:06.310> there's<00:01:06.430> two<00:01:06.670> connections<00:01:07.180> here

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
actually there's two connections here

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.870 
actually there's two connections here
that<00:01:07.960> gives<00:01:08.200> us<00:01:08.350> that<00:01:08.470> 60-degree<00:01:09.130> angle<00:01:09.340> that

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
that gives us that 60-degree angle that

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.060 
that gives us that 60-degree angle that
we<00:01:10.120> need<00:01:10.390> for<00:01:11.290> your<00:01:11.440> wrist<00:01:11.650> to<00:01:11.800> be<00:01:11.830> in<00:01:11.979> the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
we need for your wrist to be in the

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.950 
we need for your wrist to be in the
proper<00:01:12.400> position<00:01:12.850> right<00:01:13.330> and<00:01:13.600> that<00:01:13.810> that's

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
proper position right and that that's

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.050 
proper position right and that that's
that's<00:01:14.409> the<00:01:14.650> key<00:01:14.890> here<00:01:14.920> we<00:01:15.370> talked<00:01:15.700> about<00:01:15.850> the

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
that's the key here we talked about the

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.360 
that's the key here we talked about the
fact<00:01:16.540> that<00:01:16.750> a<00:01:16.900> traditional<00:01:17.500> follow<00:01:17.770> focus

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
fact that a traditional follow focus

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.700 
fact that a traditional follow focus
most<00:01:19.030> people<00:01:19.360> are<00:01:19.479> using<00:01:19.720> these<00:01:19.990> as<00:01:20.200> a<00:01:20.229> one-man

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
most people are using these as a one-man

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.100 
most people are using these as a one-man
band<00:01:20.740> in<00:01:21.340> an<00:01:21.579> improper<00:01:22.030> fashion<00:01:22.479> it<00:01:22.840> wasn't

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
band in an improper fashion it wasn't

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.569 
band in an improper fashion it wasn't
designed<00:01:23.229> for<00:01:23.560> that<00:01:23.770> right<00:01:24.009> the<00:01:24.130> traditional

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
designed for that right the traditional

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:26.490 
designed for that right the traditional
Philo<00:01:24.790> focus<00:01:25.119> was<00:01:25.299> used<00:01:25.570> for<00:01:25.780> an<00:01:25.930> assistant<00:01:26.409> to

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
Philo focus was used for an assistant to

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.770 
Philo focus was used for an assistant to
be<00:01:26.590> pulling<00:01:26.799> focused<00:01:27.340> now<00:01:27.520> for<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:28.119> operator

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
be pulling focused now for the operator

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.690 
be pulling focused now for the operator
to<00:01:28.899> be<00:01:29.110> grabbing<00:01:29.500> it<00:01:29.770> and<00:01:29.890> focusing<00:01:30.369> it<00:01:30.490> right

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
to be grabbing it and focusing it right

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.639 
to be grabbing it and focusing it right
and<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:30.969> problem<00:01:31.390> with<00:01:31.539> an<00:01:31.689> operator<00:01:32.140> using

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
and the problem with an operator using

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.399 
and the problem with an operator using
it<00:01:32.740> is<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.310> moment<00:01:33.520> you<00:01:33.850> grab<00:01:34.360> it<00:01:34.630> you're

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
it is the moment you grab it you're

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:36.899 
it is the moment you grab it you're
getting<00:01:35.500> a<00:01:35.710> lot<00:01:35.920> of<00:01:35.950> this<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:36.610> then<00:01:36.729> when

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
getting a lot of this and then when

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.069 
getting a lot of this and then when
you're<00:01:37.060> twisting<00:01:37.539> it<00:01:37.659> you're<00:01:37.780> even<00:01:37.869> getting

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
you're twisting it you're even getting

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.899 
you're twisting it you're even getting
more<00:01:38.469> of<00:01:38.680> but<00:01:39.100> your<00:01:39.219> wrist<00:01:39.399> is<00:01:39.549> not<00:01:39.700> in<00:01:39.850> a

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
more of but your wrist is not in a

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.580 
more of but your wrist is not in a
comfortable<00:01:40.360> position<00:01:40.479> your<00:01:41.020> arm<00:01:41.289> is<00:01:41.439> a

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
comfortable position your arm is a

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.219 
comfortable position your arm is a
little<00:01:41.619> higher<00:01:42.039> it's<00:01:42.820> and<00:01:43.570> if<00:01:43.719> you<00:01:43.840> have<00:01:44.200> a

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
little higher it's and if you have a

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.810 
little higher it's and if you have a
second<00:01:44.890> hand<00:01:45.100> grip<00:01:45.250> that<00:01:45.399> you're<00:01:45.490> letting<00:01:45.789> go

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
second hand grip that you're letting go

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.270 
second hand grip that you're letting go
to<00:01:46.060> grab<00:01:46.539> that<00:01:46.780> then<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.140> camera<00:01:47.469> moves<00:01:47.710> yeah

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
to grab that then the camera moves yeah

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.520 
to grab that then the camera moves yeah
a<00:01:48.460> whole<00:01:48.640> host<00:01:48.880> of<00:01:49.060> issues<00:01:49.210> exactly<00:01:50.140> and<00:01:50.350> and

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
a whole host of issues exactly and and

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.069 
a whole host of issues exactly and and
and<00:01:50.829> this<00:01:50.979> is<00:01:51.039> part<00:01:51.399> of<00:01:51.490> our<00:01:51.609> recoil<00:01:52.270> concept

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
and this is part of our recoil concept

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.310 
and this is part of our recoil concept
which<00:01:53.350> is<00:01:53.460> getting<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.579> camera<00:01:55.030> back

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
which is getting the camera back

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.349 
which is getting the camera back
creating<00:01:56.320> more<00:01:56.500> of<00:01:56.619> an<00:01:56.770> Eng<00:01:57.130> style<00:01:57.789> camera

00:01:58.349 --> 00:01:58.359 
creating more of an Eng style camera

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:00.899 
creating more of an Eng style camera
system<00:01:58.810> as<00:01:59.049> you<00:01:59.829> can<00:01:59.979> see<00:02:00.280> here<00:02:00.579> what<00:02:00.759> we've

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
system as you can see here what we've

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.289 
system as you can see here what we've
done<00:02:01.119> is<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.659> camera<00:02:02.049> is<00:02:02.170> now<00:02:02.439> back<00:02:02.950> over<00:02:03.789> his

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
done is the camera is now back over his

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.840 
done is the camera is now back over his
shoulder<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.770> that<00:02:06.189> we<00:02:06.429> don't<00:02:06.609> need

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
shoulder so that we don't need

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.240 
shoulder so that we don't need
counterbalance<00:02:07.780> it's<00:02:08.320> it's<00:02:08.560> a<00:02:08.710> balanced

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
counterbalance it's it's a balanced

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.970 
counterbalance it's it's a balanced
camera<00:02:09.670> package<00:02:10.149> but<00:02:10.450> where<00:02:10.990> it<00:02:11.230> needs<00:02:11.440> to<00:02:11.740> be

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
camera package but where it needs to be

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.520 
camera package but where it needs to be
so<00:02:12.700> that<00:02:12.880> you<00:02:13.000> it's<00:02:13.300> it's<00:02:13.600> super<00:02:13.840> lightweight

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
so that you it's it's super lightweight

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.550 
so that you it's it's super lightweight
in<00:02:14.740> order<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.490> do<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:15.910> you<00:02:16.450> have<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:16.720> relocate

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
in order to do that you have to relocate

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.070 
in order to do that you have to relocate
your<00:02:18.130> optics<00:02:18.730> because<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.630> camera<00:02:19.930> is<00:02:19.990> now

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
your optics because the camera is now

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.570 
your optics because the camera is now
behind<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.620> can't<00:02:20.860> have<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.010> Z<00:02:21.220> fine<00:02:21.430> or

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
behind you you can't have a Z fine or

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.230 
behind you you can't have a Z fine or
anything<00:02:21.730> like<00:02:21.910> that

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
anything like that

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.890 
anything like that
and<00:02:22.450> now<00:02:23.260> Yin's<00:02:23.830> has<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.069> very<00:02:24.400> comfortable

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
and now Yin's has a very comfortable

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.750 
and now Yin's has a very comfortable
focus<00:02:25.900> system<00:02:26.140> that<00:02:26.890> he<00:02:26.980> can<00:02:27.129> hold<00:02:27.310> super

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
focus system that he can hold super

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.250 
focus system that he can hold super
steady<00:02:28.239> yeah

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
steady yeah

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.020 
steady yeah
now<00:02:29.409> let's<00:02:29.860> talk<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.099> little<00:02:30.250> bit<00:02:30.489> about<00:02:30.790> the

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
now let's talk a little bit about the

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.880 
now let's talk a little bit about the
ratcheting<00:02:31.629> and<00:02:31.840> how<00:02:31.930> you<00:02:31.989> worked<00:02:32.349> a<00:02:32.470> tornado

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
ratcheting and how you worked a tornado

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.699 
ratcheting and how you worked a tornado
along<00:02:33.280> with<00:02:33.519> the<00:02:33.670> Z<00:02:33.819> Drive<00:02:34.120> right<00:02:34.989> what<00:02:35.590> I'm

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
along with the Z Drive right what I'm

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.649 
along with the Z Drive right what I'm
holding<00:02:35.920> here<00:02:36.310> is<00:02:36.340> what<00:02:37.000> I<00:02:37.030> call<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.420> horn

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:37.659 
holding here is what I call the horn

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.839 
holding here is what I call the horn
okay<00:02:38.049> so<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.409> I<00:02:38.439> never<00:02:38.650> let<00:02:39.040> go<00:02:39.069> of<00:02:39.370> I<00:02:39.489> have<00:02:39.700> at

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
okay so that I never let go of I have at

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.380 
okay so that I never let go of I have at
least<00:02:39.970> three<00:02:40.299> fingers<00:02:40.709> on<00:02:41.709> that<00:02:42.069> and<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:43.000> knob

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
least three fingers on that and the knob

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.630 
least three fingers on that and the knob
above<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.959> can<00:02:44.200> turn<00:02:44.379> independently<00:02:44.829> of<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.519> so

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
above it can turn independently of it so

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.059 
above it can turn independently of it so
I<00:02:45.670> can<00:02:45.970> if<00:02:46.360> I<00:02:46.540> need<00:02:46.690> more<00:02:46.810> range<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.530> can<00:02:47.709> turn<00:02:47.920> it

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
I can if I need more range I can turn it

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.130 
I can if I need more range I can turn it
I<00:02:48.159> can<00:02:48.310> let<00:02:48.489> go<00:02:48.640> of<00:02:48.670> that<00:02:48.760> knob<00:02:49.060> but<00:02:49.750> not<00:02:49.959> like

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
I can let go of that knob but not like

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.589 
I can let go of that knob but not like
over<00:02:50.409> the<00:02:50.500> horn<00:02:50.769> or<00:02:51.099> the<00:02:51.190> handle<00:02:51.579> and<00:02:51.760> then<00:02:52.420> we

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
over the horn or the handle and then we

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.600 
over the horn or the handle and then we
grab<00:02:52.900> it<00:02:52.930> and<00:02:53.230> continue<00:02:53.829> to<00:02:53.920> move<00:02:54.099> so<00:02:54.459> that

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
grab it and continue to move so that

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.399 
grab it and continue to move so that
that<00:02:54.909> keeps<00:02:55.269> it<00:02:55.420> really<00:02:55.599> stable<00:02:56.019> on<00:02:56.079> that<00:02:56.260> like

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
that keeps it really stable on that like

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.500 
that keeps it really stable on that like
letting<00:02:56.799> go<00:02:56.980> completely<00:02:57.549> kind<00:02:58.239> of<00:02:58.359> like<00:02:58.480> a

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
letting go completely kind of like a

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.240 
letting go completely kind of like a
socket<00:02:58.840> wrench<00:02:59.019> you<00:02:59.439> have<00:02:59.560> this<00:02:59.650> ratcheting

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
socket wrench you have this ratcheting

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.910 
socket wrench you have this ratcheting
capacity<00:03:00.879> exactly<00:03:01.359> but<00:03:01.750> now<00:03:01.930> on<00:03:02.200> on<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:02.680> lens

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
capacity exactly but now on on a lens

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.250 
capacity exactly but now on on a lens
like<00:03:03.220> this<00:03:03.579> where<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.420> rotation<00:03:05.019> is<00:03:05.170> very

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
like this where the rotation is very

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.949 
like this where the rotation is very
very<00:03:05.920> minuscule<00:03:06.519> you'll<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:07.090> never<00:03:07.510> end<00:03:07.810> up

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
very minuscule you'll and never end up

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.330 
very minuscule you'll and never end up
doing<00:03:08.019> that<00:03:08.379> ratcheting<00:03:08.950> now<00:03:09.069> I'm<00:03:09.159> going

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
doing that ratcheting now I'm going

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.710 
doing that ratcheting now I'm going
through<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.579> whole<00:03:09.700> range<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.209> one<00:03:10.329> movement

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
through the whole range and one movement

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.690 
through the whole range and one movement
here<00:03:10.840> pretty<00:03:11.019> much<00:03:11.109> yeah<00:03:11.590> if<00:03:11.769> you<00:03:12.190> go<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.430> like

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
here pretty much yeah if you go to like

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.520 
here pretty much yeah if you go to like
a<00:03:12.730> PL<00:03:13.180> style<00:03:13.569> lens<00:03:13.810> it<00:03:13.959> has<00:03:14.019> a<00:03:14.079> much<00:03:14.290> bigger

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
a PL style lens it has a much bigger

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.470 
a PL style lens it has a much bigger
barrel<00:03:15.010> and<00:03:15.159> has<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.280> larger<00:03:15.700> rotation<00:03:16.299> then

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
barrel and has a larger rotation then

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.089 
barrel and has a larger rotation then
you'll<00:03:16.659> do<00:03:16.840> a<00:03:16.870> little<00:03:17.049> bit<00:03:17.290> more<00:03:17.319> ratcheting

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
you'll do a little bit more ratcheting

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.410 
you'll do a little bit more ratcheting
right<00:03:18.489> we're<00:03:18.670> gonna<00:03:18.790> have<00:03:19.000> different

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
right we're gonna have different

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.369 
right we're gonna have different
diameter<00:03:19.900> gears

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
diameter gears

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:21.780 
diameter gears
that'll<00:03:20.920> help<00:03:21.010> reduce<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.549> amount<00:03:21.760> of

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
that'll help reduce the amount of

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.910 
that'll help reduce the amount of
rotation<00:03:21.909> needed<00:03:22.569> for<00:03:22.750> those<00:03:22.870> cine<00:03:23.590> lenses

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
rotation needed for those cine lenses

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.379 
rotation needed for those cine lenses
yeah<00:03:24.579> but<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.150> stability<00:03:26.049> now<00:03:26.230> is<00:03:26.620> what<00:03:26.950> is

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
yeah but the stability now is what is

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.110 
yeah but the stability now is what is
increased<00:03:28.389> measurably<00:03:29.260> because<00:03:29.829> you<00:03:30.819> have

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
increased measurably because you have

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.300 
increased measurably because you have
two<00:03:31.450> hands<00:03:32.049> and<00:03:32.200> you're<00:03:32.440> not<00:03:32.590> taking<00:03:33.069> one<00:03:33.280> away

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
two hands and you're not taking one away

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.809 
two hands and you're not taking one away
and<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:34.449> price<00:03:34.720> of<00:03:34.750> this<00:03:35.109> is<00:03:35.410> so<00:03:36.099> reasonable

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
and the price of this is so reasonable

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.150 
and the price of this is so reasonable
that<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.359> it's<00:03:37.959> not<00:03:38.349> much<00:03:38.620> more<00:03:38.889> than<00:03:39.099> the

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
that the it's not much more than the

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.860 
that the it's not much more than the
cost<00:03:39.430> of<00:03:39.639> a<00:03:39.760> hand<00:03:40.030> grip<00:03:40.209> when<00:03:40.449> you<00:03:40.540> really

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
cost of a hand grip when you really

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.830 
cost of a hand grip when you really
factor<00:03:41.650> in<00:03:41.859> what<00:03:42.760> a<00:03:42.790> set<00:03:43.030> of<00:03:43.150> e<00:03:43.269> grips<00:03:43.510> cost

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
factor in what a set of e grips cost

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.220 
factor in what a set of e grips cost
versus<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.739> hand<00:03:45.190> grip<00:03:45.459> a<00:03:45.699> Z<00:03:46.599> Drive<00:03:46.870> in<00:03:47.139> a

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.349 
versus a hand grip a Z Drive in a
tornado<00:03:47.620> I<00:03:47.980> think<00:03:48.910> that<00:03:49.030> this<00:03:49.150> will

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
tornado I think that this will

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.839 
tornado I think that this will
eventually<00:03:49.660> become<00:03:50.199> a<00:03:50.410> very<00:03:50.769> common<00:03:51.250> system

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
eventually become a very common system

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.509 
eventually become a very common system

angle<00:04:07.419> the<00:04:08.109> way<00:04:08.260> we've<00:04:08.500> designed<00:04:08.709> this<00:04:09.220> with

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:09.669 
angle the way we've designed this with

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.729 
angle the way we've designed this with
this<00:04:09.940> track<00:04:10.389> is<00:04:10.660> that<00:04:10.870> it<00:04:11.049> a<00:04:11.079> lot<00:04:11.349> that<00:04:11.560> will

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
this track is that it a lot that will

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.149 
this track is that it a lot that will
allow<00:04:12.040> you<00:04:12.099> to<00:04:12.629> position<00:04:13.629> the<00:04:13.870> tornado<00:04:14.769> at

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:15.159 
allow you to position the tornado at

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:17.339 
allow you to position the tornado at
various<00:04:15.639> angles<00:04:16.000> to<00:04:16.120> get<00:04:16.269> it<00:04:16.419> at<00:04:16.659> the<00:04:16.870> angle

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:17.349 
various angles to get it at the angle

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:18.719 
various angles to get it at the angle
that's<00:04:17.440> most<00:04:17.739> comfortable<00:04:18.190> for<00:04:18.370> you<00:04:18.430> right

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
that's most comfortable for you right

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.520 
that's most comfortable for you right
but<00:04:19.180> we've<00:04:19.299> also<00:04:19.510> designed<00:04:19.840> this<00:04:20.229> in<00:04:20.380> a<00:04:20.440> way

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
but we've also designed this in a way

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.200 
but we've also designed this in a way
where<00:04:20.560> this<00:04:20.829> can<00:04:21.039> pop<00:04:21.310> off<00:04:21.549> and<00:04:21.820> it<00:04:21.909> can<00:04:22.060> go<00:04:22.180> on

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
where this can pop off and it can go on

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.379 
where this can pop off and it can go on
the<00:04:22.360> top<00:04:22.780> and<00:04:23.340> that<00:04:24.340> opens<00:04:24.849> up<00:04:25.000> a<00:04:25.090> whole<00:04:25.120> host

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
the top and that opens up a whole host

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.990 
the top and that opens up a whole host
of<00:04:25.900> interesting<00:04:26.190> options<00:04:27.190> it<00:04:27.460> allows<00:04:27.669> you<00:04:27.909> to

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
of interesting options it allows you to

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.510 
of interesting options it allows you to
put<00:04:28.180> it<00:04:28.270> on<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.510> dumb<00:04:28.720> side<00:04:29.050> and<00:04:29.440> either<00:04:30.400> a

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
essentially operate the camera

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.740 
essentially operate the camera
completely<00:04:48.610> from<00:04:48.790> the<00:04:48.940> back<00:04:49.090> like<00:04:49.330> a<00:04:49.360> studio

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.560 
than hunched over the camera or a dolly
which<00:04:57.340> makes<00:04:57.580> hunting<00:04:57.820> over<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:58.180> camera

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
which makes hunting over the camera

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.990 
which makes hunting over the camera
really<00:04:59.020> complicated<00:04:59.770> or<00:04:59.889> on<00:05:00.100> a<00:05:00.130> slider<00:05:00.520> even

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
really complicated or on a slider even

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.120 
really complicated or on a slider even
it<00:05:01.120> makes<00:05:01.330> it<00:05:01.540> much<00:05:01.780> more<00:05:02.110> comfortable<00:05:02.530> right

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
it makes it much more comfortable right

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.000 
it makes it much more comfortable right
so<00:05:03.940> the<00:05:04.240> Z<00:05:04.419> Drive<00:05:04.690> is<00:05:04.930> a<00:05:04.960> very<00:05:05.260> small<00:05:05.560> compact

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
so the Z Drive is a very small compact

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.390 
so the Z Drive is a very small compact
follow<00:05:06.729> focus<00:05:07.330> that's<00:05:07.990> a<00:05:08.290> direct<00:05:08.620> drive<00:05:08.919> unit

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
follow focus that's a direct drive unit

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.490 
follow focus that's a direct drive unit

motor you need batteries and now it just

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.330 
motor you need batteries and now it just
keeps<00:05:28.210> escalating<00:05:28.450> in<00:05:29.110> the<00:05:29.229> weight<00:05:29.440> and<00:05:29.740> cost

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
keeps escalating in the weight and cost

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.940 
keeps escalating in the weight and cost
and<00:05:30.639> size<00:05:31.240> you<00:05:31.750> know<00:05:31.870> the<00:05:32.229> whole<00:05:32.410> idea<00:05:32.440> this

and size you know the whole idea this
recoils<00:05:33.460> to<00:05:33.580> keep<00:05:33.760> it<00:05:33.910> light<00:05:34.270> and<00:05:34.660> simple

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
recoils to keep it light and simple

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.230 
recoils to keep it light and simple
right<00:05:35.889> we<00:05:36.070> don't<00:05:36.250> want<00:05:36.520> extra<00:05:36.940> weight<00:05:37.090> a<00:05:37.120> lot

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
right we don't want extra weight a lot

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
you'd believe me you can add weight the

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.680 
you'd believe me you can add weight the
key<00:05:42.070> is<00:05:42.250> getting<00:05:42.490> these<00:05:42.699> things<00:05:42.940> like<00:05:43.240> because

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.350 
getting a camera back on the shoulder
it's<00:05:50.470> balanced<00:05:50.950> you<00:05:51.039> can<00:05:51.220> operate<00:05:51.880> it<00:05:51.970> all<00:05:52.180> day

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
it's balanced you can operate it all day

it's balanced you can operate it all day
so<00:05:52.720> in<00:05:52.960> order<00:05:53.110> to<00:05:53.229> make<00:05:53.440> a<00:05:53.470> recoil<00:05:54.039> you're

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
so in order to make a recoil you're

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.170 
so in order to make a recoil you're
gonna<00:05:54.520> need<00:05:55.020> the<00:05:56.020> Z<00:05:56.200> Drive<00:05:56.550> it's<00:05:57.550> the<00:05:57.970> follow

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
gonna need the Z Drive it's the follow

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.480 
gonna need the Z Drive it's the follow
focus<00:05:58.300> of<00:05:58.630> the<00:05:58.690> future<00:05:59.020> it<00:05:59.139> really<00:05:59.410> is<00:05:59.590> that's

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490
