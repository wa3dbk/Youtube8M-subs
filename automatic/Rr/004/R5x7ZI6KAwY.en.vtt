tonight an example of what you guys can

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.709 
tonight an example of what you guys can
do<00:00:56.070> when<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.340> ball<00:00:56.520> movement<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:57.149> there<00:00:57.390> so

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
do when the ball movement is there so

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.779 
do when the ball movement is there so
many<00:00:57.809> guys<00:00:58.050> scoring<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:58.710> different<00:00:59.039> ways<00:00:59.129> yeah

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
many guys scoring in different ways yeah

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.430 
many guys scoring in different ways yeah
i<00:00:59.820> mean<00:01:00.120> i<00:01:00.239> don't<00:01:00.390> know<00:01:00.510> how<00:01:00.629> many<00:01:00.690> guys<00:01:00.930> had<00:01:01.260> in

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
i mean i don't know how many guys had in

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.110 
i mean i don't know how many guys had in
double<00:01:01.739> figures<00:01:02.010> but<00:01:02.190> i'm<00:01:02.489> guessing<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:03.090> lot

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
double figures but i'm guessing a lot

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.000 
double figures but i'm guessing a lot
and<00:01:03.480> i<00:01:03.899> think<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.320> probably<00:01:04.500> had<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.799> i

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
and i think we probably had it i

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.350 
and i think we probably had it i
actually<00:01:05.400> don't<00:01:05.519> know<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:06.180> probably

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
actually don't know this but we probably

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.920 
actually don't know this but we probably
had<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> highest<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.260> game<00:01:07.439> as<00:01:07.619> well<00:01:07.970> so<00:01:08.970> you

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
had a highest this game as well so you

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
had a highest this game as well so you
know<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.049> thought<00:01:10.229> we<00:01:10.350> did<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.530> good<00:01:10.680> job<00:01:10.740> of

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
know I thought we did a good job of

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.100 
know I thought we did a good job of
moving<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.490> ball<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.700> think<00:01:11.850> we<00:01:12.689> also<00:01:12.840> did<00:01:13.080> a

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
moving the ball I think we also did a

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.469 
moving the ball I think we also did a
good<00:01:13.260> job<00:01:13.320> defensively<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.340> first<00:01:15.000> second

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
good job defensively in the first second

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.450 
good job defensively in the first second
and<00:01:15.540> fourth<00:01:15.840> quarter<00:01:16.229> coach<00:01:16.950> said<00:01:17.189> he<00:01:17.250> felt

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
and fourth quarter coach said he felt

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.130 
and fourth quarter coach said he felt
pats<00:01:17.670> at<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.909> real<00:01:18.119> good<00:01:18.299> tempo<00:01:18.659> for<00:01:18.869> tonight

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
pats at a real good tempo for tonight

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.990 
pats at a real good tempo for tonight
you<00:01:19.259> got<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.409> long<00:01:19.650> run<00:01:19.979> after<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.610> replaced

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
you got a long run after you replaced

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.640 
you got a long run after you replaced
and<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.270> think<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.600> kept<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:21.960> energy<00:01:22.020> bye

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
and I think you kept that energy bye

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.760 
and I think you kept that energy bye
yeah<00:01:23.220> he<00:01:23.369> did<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.580> great<00:01:23.759> job<00:01:23.850> pat<00:01:24.330> um<00:01:24.680> you<00:01:25.680> know

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
yeah he did a great job pat um you know

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.020 
yeah he did a great job pat um you know
I<00:01:25.830> think<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.189> thing<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.460> stuck<00:01:26.759> out<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
I think the thing that stuck out the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.340 
I think the thing that stuck out the
most<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.360> me<00:01:27.420> really<00:01:27.720> was<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.110> he<00:01:28.320> was

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
most to me really was just he was

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.170 
most to me really was just he was
getting<00:01:28.680> ever<00:01:28.799> defensive<00:01:29.400> rebound<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.939> start

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
getting ever defensive rebound to start

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.350 
getting ever defensive rebound to start
