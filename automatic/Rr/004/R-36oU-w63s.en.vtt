00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.869 
r1 concepts or something like that and
but<00:00:48.210> they<00:00:48.420> had<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> phone<00:00:48.840> number<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:49.550> eBay<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.610> I

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
but they had a phone number on eBay so I

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.459 
but they had a phone number on eBay so I
just<00:00:51.059> jotted<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.510> down<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.719> got<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.170> from<00:00:52.260> there

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
just jotted it down I got it from there

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.439 
just jotted it down I got it from there
they<00:00:52.559> were<00:00:52.649> pretty<00:00:52.800> reasonable<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.579> don't

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
they were pretty reasonable I don't

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.590 
they were pretty reasonable I don't
think<00:00:54.600> they<00:00:54.719> were<00:00:54.800> too<00:00:55.800> much<00:00:55.829> more<00:00:56.250> than<00:00:56.600> then

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
think they were too much more than then

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.619

some<00:00:58.140> LG<00:00:58.890> pose<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.730> think<00:01:00.149> they're<00:01:00.329> supposed<00:01:00.510> to

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629

some LG pose I think they're supposed to
be<00:01:00.750> made<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.079> USA<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.649> California<00:01:02.399> so

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.040 

so<00:01:07.320> they're<00:01:07.470> gonna<00:01:07.560> say<00:01:08.750> they're<00:01:09.750> not<00:01:09.870> going

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050

want to just paint them laying down and
if<00:03:19.099> you<00:03:19.220> do<00:03:19.340> that<00:03:19.459> just<00:03:19.760> paint<00:03:20.000> them<00:03:21.099> upside

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
if you do that just paint them upside

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.490 
if you do that just paint them upside
down<00:03:22.129> like<00:03:22.489> this<00:03:22.700> at<00:03:22.910> first<00:03:23.150> and<00:03:24.019> then<00:03:24.230> you<00:03:24.349> can

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
down like this at first and then you can

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.479 
down like this at first and then you can
flip<00:03:24.680> them<00:03:24.860> over<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:26.349> and<00:03:27.349> let<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.069> underside

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
flip them over and and let the underside
