00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.330
 The good side, because we 're a woman. 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.310
 different is not on the numbers site 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.100
 and I make a special treatment for 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.080
 You are here today. February 1st is 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.510
 my birthday is and the son this dish is 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.240
 that I will do if it hydrates for who 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.939
 to put the way is a chicken in beer 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.890
 very tasty much more to do and I 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.809
 I hope you like it a lot longer. 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.910
 to check the ingredients for the 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:42.110
 Today's recipe we will not need 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:48.059
 four seals 20 thigh and overcoat 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:52.140
 boned and chopped 5 tablespoons cornstarch 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:58.730
 dissolved water four cans of beer 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:03.449
 black shoyu red pepper ketchup 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:06.659
 sesame oil and look at that ingredient 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.040
 is prepared with 11 to 11 people and 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.909
 that's enough to spare 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.280
 usually I use 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.109
 a game of strength on the thigh and makes a 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.119
 piece of a thing a set of colors 

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:18.640
 more half for one person 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.250
 So you use this base then you are 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.799
 two people you will use three pieces of 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.039
 thigh and sock and so on 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:29.950
 right then that's all using 20 courses 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:32.109
 on thigh and see if these recipes 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.979
 to serve more or less as it would be 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:35.679
 people 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:40.299
 The first step is to throw oil in the 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:42.909
 panela and I was the first chicken because 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.610
 I like gilt before we 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.409
 play the onion and I 'll put a little 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:53.829
 of sesame oil and gives a taste 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:57.129
 special for spying and hence people 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:59.709
 You expect to get very hot for later. 

00:01:57.129 --> 00:02:01.950
 additional daughter with hot oil the people 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:01.950
 will play 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.340
 enough for him 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.620
 Now we'll let you bray well. 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.620
 in this house 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.660
 I've already been asked if I can do this. 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.840
 chicken breast recipe 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.730
 Yes, it only happens that what happens is done. 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.650
 it is much drier than the thigh is supercox 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.600
 so with that thigh overcook 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.730
 Boneless the dish will be much more 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.400
 that the slower than to use only the breast of 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.860
 Chicken I like more to do so when 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:45.860
 will begin to fry to stick in the pan 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:48.350
 we will add the onion and hence the 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.750
 We stir until golden brown boot 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.280
 aquasis or sale 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.740
 when the onion has these points already 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.510
 well I'm transparent living the people 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:01.400
 put the black beer 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.740
 here are four pencils the agent 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.600
 added the pitta beer here 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.380
 now I go with the dog we put 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.950
 rather it will show is after salting 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.600
 if I need to put a little more salt 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.550
 puts the shoyu 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.690
 we will now also place the 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.550
 ketchup 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:26.840
 the pepper I already put while frying 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:29.080
 ambushed the maiden 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:34.260
 dissolved in water 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:37.450
 I imagined Olympian, that's when I'd just put the fire down. 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:43.330
 and boil for half an hour of 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.740
 proof after adding more era 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.280
 dissolved in water to avoid embarking 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:50.620
 important texts about the agent below 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.290
 the fire and will leave it for about 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.700
 half an hour cooking is where the chicken 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.510
 will take all the flavor of the ingredients 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.850
 and will investigate will be fine this yummy 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:05.010
 call and you can check the following photos 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.010
 a kiss and until the next recipe
