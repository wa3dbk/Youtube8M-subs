00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
to kill you know it wants a little bit

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.279 
to kill you know it wants a little bit
that<00:00:22.140> hopefully<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.619> little<00:00:22.800> bit<00:00:22.949> relaxed

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
that hopefully a little bit relaxed

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.240 
that hopefully a little bit relaxed
really<00:00:26.369> okay<00:00:26.880> now<00:00:27.180> he<00:00:27.240> had<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> very<00:00:28.019> high<00:00:28.380> score

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
really okay now he had a very high score

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.040 
really okay now he had a very high score
therefore<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.090> further<00:00:30.630> halt

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
therefore the further halt

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.850 
therefore the further halt
ten<00:00:32.510> nine<00:00:33.510> five<00:00:33.870> eight<00:00:34.170> five<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.739> is

ten nine five eight five that is
probably<00:00:35.370> one<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.880> highest<00:00:36.329> scores<00:00:36.630> today

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
perfectly fine to have a ten on the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.160 
perfectly fine to have a ten on the
first<00:00:54.899> movement

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
first movement

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.560

to make sure that she gets to H mm-hmm
she's<00:01:16.140> very<00:01:16.409> very<00:01:16.770> clever<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.790> she<00:01:18.060> pulled<00:01:18.330> it

the running score she's definite the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.550 
the running score she's definite the
time<00:01:30.509> had<00:01:31.340> 78<00:01:32.340> 79<00:01:32.820> she<00:01:33.299> has<00:01:33.390> 83<00:01:33.900> as<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.200> can<00:01:34.350> see

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
here at V the transition to the path

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.670 
here at V the transition to the path
goes<00:01:40.500> up<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.740> sign<00:01:41.600> yeah<00:01:42.600> but<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.530> a

goes up a sign yeah but that that that a

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.069 
goes up a sign yeah but that that that a

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
process will come down a little bit here

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.310 
process will come down a little bit here
now<00:01:48.680> or<00:01:49.680> see<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.310> little<00:01:50.670> different<00:01:51.240> type<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.509> PS

it stays in rhythm and also the hind

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.230 
it stays in rhythm and also the hind
legs<00:02:05.070> come<00:02:05.310> too<00:02:05.490> far<00:02:05.700> under<00:02:05.909> it's<00:02:06.060> very

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
legs come too far under it's very

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.180 
legs come too far under it's very
difficult<00:02:06.690> to<00:02:06.750> get<00:02:06.870> back<00:02:07.140> out<00:02:07.350> into<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.009> turn

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
difficult to get back out into the turn

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.210 
difficult to get back out into the turn
into<00:02:08.490> the<00:02:08.580> transition<00:02:09.090> into<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.420> pass<00:02:09.630> i<00:02:10.220> but

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
into the transition into the pass i but

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.340 
into the transition into the pass i but
she<00:02:11.250> pulled<00:02:11.700> off<00:02:11.940> very<00:02:12.180> nicely<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:12.959> right<00:02:13.170> now

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
she pulled off very nicely so right now

could<00:02:23.640> he<00:02:23.730> have<00:02:23.760> stretched<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.270> little<00:02:24.540> bit

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
could he have stretched a little bit

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.309 
could he have stretched a little bit
more<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.810> bit<00:02:24.989> yes<00:02:25.500> probably<00:02:25.770> but<00:02:27.050> look<00:02:28.050> here

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
more a bit yes probably but look here

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.699 
more a bit yes probably but look here
yes<00:02:28.590> two<00:02:28.950> nines<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.489> and<00:02:29.760> three<00:02:30.030> eight<00:02:30.180> and

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
yes two nines and and three eight and

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.020 
yes two nines and and three eight and
that<00:02:31.709> is<00:02:31.860> really<00:02:32.100> better<00:02:32.310> when<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:32.730> see<00:02:32.910> it<00:02:32.970> a

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
that is really better when you see it a

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.000 
that is really better when you see it a
little<00:02:33.120> closer<00:02:33.510> up<00:02:33.780> that's<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.560> little

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
little closer up that's a little

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.759 
little closer up that's a little
difficult<00:02:35.520> for<00:02:35.550> me<00:02:35.760> as<00:02:35.940> far<00:02:36.180> away<00:02:36.330> as<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.690> am<00:02:36.870> to

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
difficult for me as far away as I am to

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.360

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
sometimes the verse is a little bit of a

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.170 
sometimes the verse is a little bit of a
habit<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.890> popping<00:02:44.160> up<00:02:44.430> behind<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.910> little<00:02:44.970> bit

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
the track so I would expect the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.650 
the track so I would expect the
transition<00:03:05.519> to<00:03:05.640> be<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.790> little<00:03:06.180> bit<00:03:06.329> lower<00:03:06.540> than
