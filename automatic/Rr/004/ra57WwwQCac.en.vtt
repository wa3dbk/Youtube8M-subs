00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.789
 if accepted 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.470

 even earlier it became known 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.899
 RIA News 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:30.149
 pioneers of greek sports

 and true bets on someone got angry and 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.190
 decided to take revenge on union and league 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.070
 the hero invaded the Usolsky valley 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.560
 aimed and aptly hit where his 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.400

 first discipline and olympic games 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.960
 therefore it may well be considered shooting from 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:02.640
 Luke 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.820

 the Greeks believed in the divine 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.790
 the essence of the game I think that luck 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.340
 sent down from the Olympus 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.090
