sport change a lot when I came into it
there<00:00:34.050> was<00:00:34.079> virtually<00:00:34.320> no<00:00:34.680> technology<00:00:35.610> in

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
there was virtually no technology in

there was virtually no technology in
this<00:00:35.820> country<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.660> mean<00:00:36.989> this<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> sport<00:00:37.710> time

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
this country I mean this is a sport time

sleds that lacked that consistency that

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.400 
sleds that lacked that consistency that
I<00:00:53.370> wanted<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.730> see<00:00:53.940> as<00:00:54.210> one<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.079> German

the first thing I did was I said well
I've<00:01:10.860> got<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.250> reignite<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.880> relationship

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
I've got to reignite this relationship

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.780 
I've got to reignite this relationship
with<00:01:12.780> Tao<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.320> get<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.040> going<00:01:14.250> because<00:01:14.670> if

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
with Tao and get this going because if

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.050 
with Tao and get this going because if
anybody<00:01:15.060> can<00:01:16.020> do<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.500> Dao<00:01:17.280> can<00:01:17.640> they've<00:01:17.850> got

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
anybody can do this Dao can they've got

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.600 
anybody can do this Dao can they've got
the<00:01:18.180> resources<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:19.500> give<00:01:19.680> us<00:01:19.800> exactly<00:01:20.370> what

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
the resources to give us exactly what

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.030 
the resources to give us exactly what
what<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.150> want<00:01:21.390> they<00:01:21.660> initially<00:01:22.380> asked<00:01:22.890> us<00:01:23.010> to

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
what we want they initially asked us to

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.540 
what we want they initially asked us to
look<00:01:23.460> at<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.600> coupons<00:01:25.380> or<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.830> runners<00:01:26.280> of

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
look at the coupons or the runners of

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.469 
look at the coupons or the runners of
the<00:01:26.940> sled<00:01:27.240> they<00:01:28.050> felt<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.590> was<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.190> key

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
the sled they felt that that was the key

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.150 
the sled they felt that that was the key
components<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.780> sled<00:01:31.080> so<00:01:31.740> that's<00:01:31.920> where

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
components of the sled so that's where

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.359 
components of the sled so that's where
we<00:01:32.369> started<00:01:32.910> we've<00:01:33.630> gone<00:01:33.869> through<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.979> design

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
we started we've gone through the design

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.660 
we started we've gone through the design
process<00:01:35.790> with<00:01:36.690> those<00:01:36.960> components<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.950> now

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
process with those components and now

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.660 
process with those components and now
have<00:01:39.030> arrived<00:01:39.390> at<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.750> design<00:01:40.410> that<00:01:40.710> works<00:01:41.399> very

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
have arrived at a design that works very

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.660 
have arrived at a design that works very
well<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.750> we've<00:01:42.960> expanded<00:01:43.170> our<00:01:43.920> efforts<00:01:44.430> now

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
well so we've expanded our efforts now

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.380 
well so we've expanded our efforts now
to<00:01:45.440> include<00:01:46.440> other<00:01:46.710> components<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
to include other components the the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.120 
to include other components the the
engineers<00:01:48.869> at<00:01:49.020> Dow<00:01:49.170> are<00:01:49.380> saying<00:01:49.590> well<00:01:49.770> okay

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
engineers at Dow are saying well okay

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.139 
engineers at Dow are saying well okay
well<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.460> know<00:01:50.550> we're<00:01:50.670> gonna<00:01:50.789> make<00:01:50.850> these

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
well you know we're gonna make these

my<00:02:04.979> ideal<00:02:05.310> kufan<00:02:05.759> right<00:02:05.910> now<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.360> let's<00:02:06.600> just

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
my ideal kufan right now so let's just

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.169 
my ideal kufan right now so let's just
start<00:02:07.680> going<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.250> that's<00:02:08.850> how<00:02:09.119> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
start going and that's how the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.979 
start going and that's how the
relationship<00:02:09.509> started<00:02:14.750> previously<00:02:15.750> the

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
relationship started previously the

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.670 
relationship started previously the

sleds were mostly hand-built and what

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.570 
sleds were mostly hand-built and what
we're<00:02:19.890> trying<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.340> do<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.940> provide<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:22.049> latest

fruitful in such a short period of time
that<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.810> still<00:03:15.320> feel<00:03:15.620> this<00:03:15.860> is<00:03:16.070> kind<00:03:16.280> of<00:03:16.340> the

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
that I still feel this is kind of the

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.090 
that I still feel this is kind of the
tip<00:03:16.610> of<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.820> iceberg<00:03:17.240> my<00:03:18.140> first<00:03:18.500> run<00:03:18.830> on<00:03:18.860> the

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
tip of the iceberg my first run on the

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.460 
tip of the iceberg my first run on the
Dow<00:03:19.250> coupe<00:03:19.550> ins<00:03:19.760> it<00:03:20.600> was<00:03:20.750> different<00:03:21.290> it's<00:03:21.410> a

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
Dow coupe ins it was different it's a

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.900 
Dow coupe ins it was different it's a
different<00:03:21.500> feel<00:03:22.040> but<00:03:22.310> I<00:03:22.340> think<00:03:22.520> it's<00:03:22.610> a<00:03:22.700> good

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
different feel but I think it's a good

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.600 
different feel but I think it's a good
feel<00:03:23.180> I<00:03:23.450> saw<00:03:24.050> changes<00:03:24.500> almost<00:03:25.040> immediately

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
feel I saw changes almost immediately

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.370 
feel I saw changes almost immediately
going<00:03:26.060> down<00:03:26.240> the<00:03:26.360> track<00:03:26.570> it<00:03:26.720> felt<00:03:26.930> smoother<00:03:27.290> to

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
going down the track it felt smoother to

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.880 
going down the track it felt smoother to
me<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:27.800> you<00:03:28.100> can<00:03:28.220> see<00:03:28.370> it<00:03:28.460> in<00:03:28.550> the<00:03:28.610> times<00:03:28.820> it's

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
me and you can see it in the times it's

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.660 
me and you can see it in the times it's
it's<00:03:30.890> pretty<00:03:31.100> crazy<00:03:31.280> to<00:03:31.730> do<00:03:32.390> a<00:03:32.470> back-to-back

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
it's pretty crazy to do a back-to-back

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.760 
it's pretty crazy to do a back-to-back
comparison<00:03:34.670> you<00:03:34.940> can<00:03:34.970> see<00:03:35.360> a<00:03:35.660> 2/10<00:03:36.350> difference

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
comparison you can see a 2/10 difference

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.900 
comparison you can see a 2/10 difference
I<00:03:37.010> mean<00:03:37.340> that's<00:03:37.600> ten<00:03:38.600> spots<00:03:38.950> some<00:03:39.950> some<00:03:40.700> of<00:03:40.820> the

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
I mean that's ten spots some some of the

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.530 
I mean that's ten spots some some of the

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
cutting edge you're the future I think

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.230 
cutting edge you're the future I think
you're<00:03:53.360> the<00:03:53.450> future<00:03:53.780> of<00:03:54.700> USA<00:03:55.700> luge<00:03:55.880> at<00:03:56.060> least

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
you're the future of USA luge at least

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.080 
you're the future of USA luge at least
and<00:03:56.570> I<00:03:56.630> think<00:03:56.870> it's<00:03:57.020> a<00:03:57.260> very<00:03:57.890> it's<00:03:58.580> a<00:03:58.790> great

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
and I think it's a very it's a great

and I think it's a very it's a great
partnership<00:03:59.450> we<00:04:00.110> started<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.530> project<00:04:00.710> play

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
partnership we started the project play

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.540 
partnership we started the project play
catch-up<00:04:01.990> but<00:04:02.990> I<00:04:03.020> think<00:04:03.320> in<00:04:03.410> some<00:04:03.650> ways<00:04:03.860> we're

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
catch-up but I think in some ways we're

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.330 
catch-up but I think in some ways we're
going<00:04:04.580> to<00:04:05.120> be<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:06.230> ones<00:04:06.440> that<00:04:06.590> are<00:04:06.680> that<00:04:07.010> are

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
going to be the ones that are that are

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.440 
going to be the ones that are that are
followed<00:04:07.730> really<00:04:08.000> soon<00:04:08.410> really<00:04:09.410> soon
