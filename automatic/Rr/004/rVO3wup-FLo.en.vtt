it's capable of recording 1080p at 30
frames<00:01:29.430> per<00:01:29.640> second<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.540> I've<00:01:31.290> actually<00:01:31.439> got

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
frames per second and I've actually got

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.069

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
to ultra fine so we should be getting

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.690 
to ultra fine so we should be getting
the<00:01:39.270> best<00:01:39.509> possible<00:01:39.869> detail<00:01:40.799> out<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.579> this

we've got going out there I'm just going
to<00:01:47.610> deal<00:01:47.790> with<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.030> camera<00:01:48.270> around<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.689> little

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
to deal with a camera around a little

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.569 
to deal with a camera around a little
bit<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.560> guys<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:50.040> let<00:01:50.189> me<00:01:50.280> know<00:01:50.399> what

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
bit and you guys can let me know what

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.240 
bit and you guys can let me know what
the<00:01:50.869> stabilization<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.020> like<00:01:52.290> on<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.979> back

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
the stabilization is like on the back

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.730 
the stabilization is like on the back
camera<00:01:54.030> here<00:01:54.750> obviously<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.320> front-facing

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
camera here obviously the front-facing

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.889 
camera here obviously the front-facing
camera<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.310> we<00:01:56.369> tested<00:01:56.759> yesterday<00:01:57.000> doesn't

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
camera that we tested yesterday doesn't

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.980 
camera that we tested yesterday doesn't
have<00:01:58.200> any<00:01:58.380> image<00:01:58.649> stabilization<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.790> that<00:02:00.780> one

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
have any image stabilization so that one

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.080 
have any image stabilization so that one
can<00:02:01.290> potentially<00:02:01.890> be<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.189> little<00:02:02.670> bit<00:02:02.850> wobbly

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
can potentially be a little bit wobbly

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.179 
can potentially be a little bit wobbly
let's<00:02:03.930> bring<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.229> away<00:02:04.409> from<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.770> light<00:02:04.979> and

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
into the darkness see how quickly adapts

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.520 
into the darkness see how quickly adapts
