here and you can actually then drag
those<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:14.360> edit<00:01:15.380> into<00:01:16.380> iPhoto<00:01:19.520> that<00:01:20.520> would<00:01:20.939> be

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
those to edit into iPhoto that would be

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.910 
those to edit into iPhoto that would be
the<00:01:21.240> first<00:01:21.479> way<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:22.049> probably<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.530> easiest

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
the first way in probably the easiest

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.130 
the first way in probably the easiest
way<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.580> second<00:01:24.090> way<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.659> little<00:01:24.930> more

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
way the second way is a little more

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.340 
way the second way is a little more
difficult<00:01:25.820> you<00:01:26.820> want<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.180> go<00:01:27.330> back<00:01:28.140> into

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
difficult you want to go back into

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.520 
difficult you want to go back into
iMovie<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.299> in<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.450> case<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:31.079> kind<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.380> see

iMovie and in this case you kind of see
what<00:01:31.710> I'm<00:01:31.799> talking<00:01:32.250> about<00:01:32.310> here<00:01:32.579> in<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.700> second
