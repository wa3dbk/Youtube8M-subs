00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.469 
I think whether it's listening to other
captains<00:02:07.799> on<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.009> field<00:02:08.250> as<00:02:08.429> well<00:02:08.610> maybe<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
captains on the field as well maybe the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.880 
captains on the field as well maybe the

way they interact with their team

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.260

maybe<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.340> way<00:02:11.460> they<00:02:11.610> interact<00:02:12.000> with<00:02:12.090> a

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
maybe the way they interact with a

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.510 
maybe the way they interact with a
referee<00:02:12.660> so<00:02:13.650> there's<00:02:13.800> always<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:14.040> little<00:02:14.190> kind
