00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
sash going around the back of it to let

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.569 
sash going around the back of it to let
hang<00:00:36.660> down<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.989> side<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.309> can<00:00:38.399> see

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
hang down the side and you can see

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.090 
hang down the side and you can see
around<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.969> center<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.170> blade<00:00:40.620> thing<00:00:40.950> it

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
around the center of the blade thing it

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.470 
around the center of the blade thing it
has<00:00:41.219> some<00:00:41.370> sort<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.550> ghostly<00:00:41.850> outline<00:00:42.239> there

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
has some sort of ghostly outline there

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.049 
has some sort of ghostly outline there
you<00:00:42.960> sit<00:00:43.170> top<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.710> says<00:00:43.739> blade<00:00:44.129> form<00:00:44.520> because

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
you sit top it says blade form because

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.130 
you sit top it says blade form because
apparently<00:00:45.360> has<00:00:45.539> another<00:00:45.719> form<00:00:45.989> which<00:00:46.110> is

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
apparently has another form which is

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.799 
apparently has another form which is
here<00:00:46.670> which<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.820> assume<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.390> shield

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
here which you assume it is the shield

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.080 
here which you assume it is the shield
form<00:00:49.219> which<00:00:50.219> used<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.460> be<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> shield<00:00:50.940> and

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
form which used to be the shield and

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.819 
form which used to be the shield and
then<00:00:51.210> takes<00:00:51.449> precedence<00:00:51.960> just<00:00:52.320> sit<00:00:52.469> right<00:00:52.620> on

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
then takes precedence just sit right on

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.459 
then takes precedence just sit right on
the<00:00:53.039> sword<00:00:53.340> with<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.300> two<00:00:54.660> sort<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.079> sasha's

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
the sword with the two sort of sasha's

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.639 
the sword with the two sort of sasha's
coming<00:00:56.219> behind<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.670> i<00:00:57.170> can<00:00:58.170> assume<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.500> would

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
coming behind it i can assume this would

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.189 
coming behind it i can assume this would
be<00:00:58.739> called<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.039> shield<00:00:59.460> form<00:00:59.760> or<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.199> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
be called the shield form or the the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.729 
be called the shield form or the the
armor<00:01:02.129> form<00:01:02.399> something<00:01:02.760> those<00:01:03.000> lines<00:01:03.739> what

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
armor form something those lines what

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.679 
armor form something those lines what
can<00:01:05.070> we<00:01:05.100> expect<00:01:05.250> between<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.850> forms<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.479> don't

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
can we expect between the forms I don't

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.149 
can we expect between the forms I don't
know<00:01:06.780> how<00:01:06.900> they<00:01:06.930> would<00:01:07.320> change<00:01:07.650> maybe<00:01:07.979> if<00:01:08.100> you

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
know how they would change maybe if you

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.940 
know how they would change maybe if you
change<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.580> yourself<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:09.299> battle<00:01:09.630> or<00:01:10.439> maybe

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
change it yourself in battle or maybe

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.980 
change it yourself in battle or maybe
there<00:01:11.130> has<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.400> be<00:01:11.430> an<00:01:11.549> item<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.880> change<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.360> but

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
there has to be an item to change it but

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.820 
there has to be an item to change it but
i<00:01:13.049> can<00:01:13.500> assume<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:15.049> mmm<00:01:16.049> there<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
i can assume that the mmm there the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.890 
i can assume that the mmm there the
shield<00:01:17.130> or<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> armor<00:01:17.759> form<00:01:18.000> will<00:01:18.479> not<00:01:18.689> have

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
shield or the armor form will not have

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.410 
shield or the armor form will not have
no<00:01:19.170> guard<00:01:19.470> much<00:01:19.860> like<00:01:20.159> honedge<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.000> blade<00:01:21.240> how

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
no guard much like honedge and blade how

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.820 
no guard much like honedge and blade how
and<00:01:21.600> assume<00:01:21.869> Aegis<00:01:22.229> that's<00:01:22.409> going<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.619> have<00:01:22.710> as

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
and assume Aegis that's going to have as

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.859 
and assume Aegis that's going to have as
well<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.729> consume<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.210> ability<00:01:24.630> for<00:01:24.659> that

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
well so consume the ability for that

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.480 
well so consume the ability for that
it's<00:01:24.960> gonna<00:01:25.049> be<00:01:25.140> different<00:01:25.350> because<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.430> a

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
it's gonna be different because it's a

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.039 
it's gonna be different because it's a
shield<00:01:26.700> now<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.180> can't<00:01:27.360> have<00:01:27.540> no<00:01:27.720> guard

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
shield now so you can't have no guard

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.060 
shield now so you can't have no guard
can<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.970> so<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.150> could<00:01:30.420> be<00:01:30.450> possibly<00:01:30.840> be<00:01:31.079> then

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
can you so it could be possibly be then

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.340 
can you so it could be possibly be then
some<00:01:32.430> sort<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.700> just<00:01:33.150> defensive<00:01:33.689> ability

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
some sort of just defensive ability

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.310 
some sort of just defensive ability
instead<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.890> an<00:01:35.579> offensive<00:01:36.180> one<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.360> guess<00:01:36.570> so

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
instead of a an offensive one I guess so

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.679 
instead of a an offensive one I guess so
yeah<00:01:37.470> I'm<00:01:37.680> not<00:01:37.979> generally<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.509> video

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
yeah I'm not generally it for this video

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.499 
yeah I'm not generally it for this video
guys<00:01:39.840> not<00:01:40.770> much<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.070> say<00:01:41.220> here<00:01:41.400> we<00:01:41.549> can<00:01:41.700> see<00:01:41.880> aug
