 by the way it's my birthday 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.540

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.880
 doing 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.810
 I always have such a crust 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.350
 crisp 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:27.079
 and everything basically 3:13 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.930
 and you will have the freshest tastiest 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.510

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.110

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:55.800
 all she will then be twang I 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:58.410
 counted 13 times the moment you can 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.770
 to lay other ingredients such as you 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.020
 like for example add raisins when 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:07.230
 the cupcake is baked that's it at that moment I 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.210
 I will scribble so I 'll show you tomorrow 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:16.170
 the result is because she will have a stove 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:19.290
 at night I hope that I will have time to take off even 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.510
