Shamokin<00:02:05.570> I<00:02:05.900> don't<00:02:06.229> think<00:02:06.380> they<00:02:06.470> can

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
Shamokin I don't think they can

Shamokin I don't think they can
technically<00:02:07.010> be<00:02:07.220> called<00:02:07.430> ship<00:02:08.030> bumpkin

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
technically be called ship bumpkin

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.719 
technically be called ship bumpkin
anymore<00:02:09.050> because<00:02:09.290> they<00:02:09.530> don't<00:02:09.740> have<00:02:09.800> the

and<00:02:19.780> I<00:02:20.780> have<00:02:21.620> about<00:02:21.950> I<00:02:22.490> think<00:02:23.150> I<00:02:23.240> had<00:02:23.420> about<00:02:23.660> a

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
and I have about I think I had about a

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.810 
and I have about I think I had about a
hundred<00:02:23.990> to<00:02:24.560> begin<00:02:24.830> with<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.130> I<00:02:25.160> think<00:02:25.459> I<00:02:25.550> have

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
hundred to begin with and I think I have

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.210 
hundred to begin with and I think I have
well<00:02:26.380> probably<00:02:27.380> more<00:02:27.560> than<00:02:27.709> that<00:02:27.770> but<00:02:28.100> I<00:02:28.160> think

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
well probably more than that but I think

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.440 
well probably more than that but I think
right<00:02:28.700> now<00:02:28.880> I<00:02:28.910> have<00:02:29.120> about<00:02:29.300> 80<00:02:29.630> left<00:02:30.100> I<00:02:31.450> was

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
right now I have about 80 left I was

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.280 
right now I have about 80 left I was
keeping<00:02:32.750> them<00:02:32.840> in<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.260> little<00:02:33.560> about<00:02:34.310> 10<00:02:34.670> gallon

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
keeping them in a little about 10 gallon

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.540 
keeping them in a little about 10 gallon
cement<00:02:36.290> mixing<00:02:36.560> tub<00:02:36.800> that<00:02:36.980> I<00:02:37.070> got<00:02:37.310> from

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
cement mixing tub that I got from

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.680 
cement mixing tub that I got from
Menards<00:02:38.209> and<00:02:38.420> I<00:02:39.140> was<00:02:40.100> I<00:02:40.310> have<00:02:40.580> just<00:02:40.790> been<00:02:40.970> so

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
Menards and I was I have just been so

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.770 
Menards and I was I have just been so
busy<00:02:41.720> lately<00:02:42.380> that<00:02:43.060> they<00:02:44.060> grew<00:02:44.300> and<00:02:44.450> grew<00:02:44.570> and

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
busy lately that they grew and grew and

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.930 
busy lately that they grew and grew and
grew<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:45.019> I<00:02:45.380> think<00:02:45.650> they<00:02:45.800> kind<00:02:46.040> of<00:02:46.190> outgrew<00:02:46.760> it

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
grew and I think they kind of outgrew it

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.090 
grew and I think they kind of outgrew it
but<00:02:47.239> I<00:02:47.269> didn't<00:02:47.630> have<00:02:47.660> time<00:02:48.110> or<00:02:48.470> anywhere<00:02:49.010> to

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
but I didn't have time or anywhere to

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.770 
but I didn't have time or anywhere to
put<00:02:49.250> them<00:02:49.310> I<00:02:49.820> didn't<00:02:50.150> have<00:02:50.239> time<00:02:50.390> to<00:02:50.450> put<00:02:50.630> them

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
put them I didn't have time to put them

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
put them I didn't have time to put them
somewhere<00:02:50.930> else<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.380> I<00:02:51.440> didn't<00:02:51.650> have

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
somewhere else and I didn't have

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.360 
somewhere else and I didn't have
anywhere<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:52.160> put<00:02:52.280> them<00:02:52.430> somewhere<00:02:52.970> else<00:02:54.370> but

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
anywhere to put them somewhere else but

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.699 
anywhere to put them somewhere else but
now<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.730> 55<00:02:56.360> beyond<00:02:56.660> tink<00:02:56.959> has<00:02:57.110> been<00:02:57.260> freed<00:02:57.560> up

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
now the 55 beyond tink has been freed up

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.020 
now the 55 beyond tink has been freed up
so<00:02:57.980> I<00:02:58.010> went<00:02:58.190> ahead<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.519> moved<00:02:58.640> them<00:02:58.850> into

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
so I went ahead and moved them into

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.759 
so I went ahead and moved them into
there<00:02:59.330> and<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.600> kind<00:02:59.840> of<00:02:59.870> decreased<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:00.470> flow<00:03:00.739> a

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
there and I kind of decreased the flow a

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.320 
there and I kind of decreased the flow a
little<00:03:01.010> bit<00:03:01.280> so<00:03:01.730> that<00:03:01.880> they<00:03:02.000> wouldn't<00:03:02.180> get

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
little bit so that they wouldn't get

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.030 
little bit so that they wouldn't get
sucked<00:03:02.720> into<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:03.080> filter<00:03:03.440> and<00:03:03.470> whatnot

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
sucked into the filter and whatnot

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.490 
sucked into the filter and whatnot
because<00:03:04.220> it's<00:03:04.489> a<00:03:04.550> sum<00:03:04.820> so<00:03:05.209> it<00:03:05.360> has<00:03:05.480> a<00:03:05.510> overflow

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
because it's a sum so it has a overflow

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.530 
because it's a sum so it has a overflow
so<00:03:06.739> I<00:03:06.769> had<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:07.010> put<00:03:07.190> little<00:03:07.430> filter<00:03:08.390> floss

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
so I had to put little filter floss

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.780 
so I had to put little filter floss
covering<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.560> overflow<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:10.220> then<00:03:10.340> turn<00:03:10.580> down

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
covering the overflow and then turn down

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.880 
covering the overflow and then turn down
the<00:03:11.090> pump<00:03:11.510> as<00:03:11.780> well<00:03:11.989> so<00:03:12.260> it<00:03:12.350> wouldn't<00:03:12.650> push

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
the pump as well so it wouldn't push

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.650 
the pump as well so it wouldn't push
them<00:03:13.100> all<00:03:13.220> over<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:13.580> place<00:03:13.760> in<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.120> tank<00:03:14.360> but

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
them all over the place in the tank but

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.720 
them all over the place in the tank but
it<00:03:15.500> seems<00:03:15.680> to<00:03:15.830> be<00:03:15.950> a<00:03:15.980> really<00:03:16.250> good<00:03:16.400> solution

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
it seems to be a really good solution

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.150 
it seems to be a really good solution
it's<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.360> lot<00:03:17.630> more<00:03:17.930> space<00:03:18.230> for<00:03:18.260> them<00:03:18.709> so

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
it's a lot more space for them so

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.050 
it's a lot more space for them so
hopefully<00:03:19.959> they<00:03:20.959> will<00:03:21.080> be<00:03:21.290> well<00:03:22.060> overcrowded

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
hopefully they will be well overcrowded

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.670 
hopefully they will be well overcrowded
for<00:03:23.269> a<00:03:23.300> while<00:03:23.540> until<00:03:23.840> they<00:03:24.110> start<00:03:24.350> growing

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
for a while until they start growing

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.470 
for a while until they start growing
more<00:03:24.890> here<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:25.519> then<00:03:25.640> I'll<00:03:25.730> have<00:03:25.850> to<00:03:26.030> think

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
more here and then I'll have to think

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.479 
more here and then I'll have to think
about<00:03:26.750> what<00:03:26.870> I'm<00:03:26.989> gonna<00:03:27.110> do<00:03:27.410> now<00:03:27.620> so<00:03:28.100> because

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
about what I'm gonna do now so because

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:29.830 
about what I'm gonna do now so because
they're<00:03:28.640> a<00:03:28.670> little<00:03:28.850> overcrowded<00:03:29.540> they<00:03:29.630> got<00:03:29.810> a

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
they're a little overcrowded they got a

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.480 
they're a little overcrowded they got a
little<00:03:30.019> bit<00:03:30.230> of

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
little bit of

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.570 
little bit of
and<00:03:30.580> rocked<00:03:30.850> and<00:03:31.210> I<00:03:31.480> hope<00:03:31.750> that<00:03:32.370> just<00:03:33.370> the

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
and rocked and I hope that just the

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.160 
and rocked and I hope that just the
clean<00:03:33.790> water<00:03:34.060> will<00:03:34.330> clear<00:03:34.600> that<00:03:34.750> up<00:03:34.810> and<00:03:35.110> I'll

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
clean water will clear that up and I'll

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.540 
clean water will clear that up and I'll
be<00:03:35.200> watching<00:03:35.650> in<00:03:35.740> the<00:03:35.800> next<00:03:35.920> couple<00:03:36.220> of<00:03:36.430> days

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
be watching in the next couple of days

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.370 
be watching in the next couple of days
here<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:37.180> if<00:03:37.270> it's<00:03:37.420> not<00:03:37.600> clearing<00:03:37.990> off<00:03:38.200> I'm

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
here and if it's not clearing off I'm

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.760 
here and if it's not clearing off I'm
going<00:03:38.500> to<00:03:38.590> add<00:03:38.740> some<00:03:39.040> salt<00:03:39.370> to<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:40.030> water<00:03:40.180> but

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
going to add some salt to the water but

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.590 
going to add some salt to the water but
it's<00:03:41.770> pretty<00:03:41.980> minor<00:03:42.340> so<00:03:42.790> I'm<00:03:42.910> hoping<00:03:43.510> that

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
it's pretty minor so I'm hoping that

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.360 
it's pretty minor so I'm hoping that
it'll<00:03:43.960> be<00:03:44.080> okay<00:03:44.320> other<00:03:44.650> than<00:03:44.710> that<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.220> fry

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
it'll be okay other than that the fry

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.010 
it'll be okay other than that the fry
are<00:03:45.430> doing<00:03:45.790> really<00:03:45.910> well<00:03:46.030> I<00:03:46.180> think<00:03:46.300> there<00:03:46.660> are

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
are doing really well I think there are

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.070 
are doing really well I think there are
about<00:03:47.260> 80<00:03:47.890> left<00:03:48.010> I<00:03:48.370> haven't<00:03:49.080> seriously

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
about 80 left I haven't seriously

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.150 
about 80 left I haven't seriously
counted<00:03:50.440> but<00:03:50.560> that's<00:03:50.740> kind<00:03:50.950> of<00:03:51.010> what<00:03:51.130> I

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
counted but that's kind of what I

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.350 
counted but that's kind of what I
estimated<00:03:51.610> and<00:03:52.410> they<00:03:53.410> aren't<00:03:54.010> eating<00:03:54.360> brine

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
estimated and they aren't eating brine

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.570 
estimated and they aren't eating brine
shrimp<00:03:55.390> anymore<00:03:56.110> they've<00:03:56.530> been<00:03:56.710> weaned<00:03:57.400> off

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
shrimp anymore they've been weaned off

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.430 
shrimp anymore they've been weaned off
of<00:03:57.820> that<00:03:57.970> and<00:03:58.300> now<00:03:58.480> they're<00:03:58.660> eating<00:03:59.050> in<00:03:59.170> gel

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
of that and now they're eating in gel

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.590 
of that and now they're eating in gel
foods<00:03:59.890> so<00:04:00.070> I've<00:04:00.160> been<00:04:00.310> feeding<00:04:00.520> the<00:04:00.760> repast<00:04:01.390> a

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
foods so I've been feeding the repast a

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.810 
foods so I've been feeding the repast a
spawning<00:04:01.900> girl<00:04:02.230> gel<00:04:02.560> food<00:04:02.740> and<00:04:03.280> what<00:04:03.700> I've

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
spawning girl gel food and what I've

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.700 
spawning girl gel food and what I've
been<00:04:03.910> doing<00:04:04.180> is<00:04:04.300> just<00:04:04.510> making<00:04:04.750> it<00:04:04.990> cutting<00:04:05.590> it

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
been doing is just making it cutting it

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.560 
been doing is just making it cutting it
into<00:04:05.920> cubes<00:04:06.130> like<00:04:06.490> normal<00:04:06.940> and<00:04:07.150> then<00:04:07.300> when<00:04:07.540> I

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
into cubes like normal and then when I

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.540 
into cubes like normal and then when I
go<00:04:07.810> to<00:04:07.870> feed<00:04:08.170> them<00:04:08.380> I<00:04:08.590> just<00:04:08.830> squish<00:04:09.130> the<00:04:09.310> cube

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
go to feed them I just squish the cube

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.980 
go to feed them I just squish the cube
in<00:04:09.670> between<00:04:09.940> my<00:04:10.060> finger<00:04:10.360> a<00:04:10.390> little<00:04:10.480> bit<00:04:10.780> to

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
in between my finger a little bit to

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.290 
in between my finger a little bit to
break<00:04:11.170> up<00:04:11.380> the<00:04:11.560> gel<00:04:11.800> holding<00:04:12.760> it<00:04:12.880> together<00:04:13.030> a

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
break up the gel holding it together a

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.480 
break up the gel holding it together a
little<00:04:13.450> and<00:04:14.110> then<00:04:14.560> I<00:04:14.650> toss<00:04:14.920> it<00:04:15.100> in<00:04:15.190> the<00:04:15.310> tank

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
little and then I toss it in the tank

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.640 
little and then I toss it in the tank
and<00:04:15.700> then<00:04:15.820> they<00:04:15.940> go<00:04:16.090> for<00:04:16.330> it<00:04:16.390> and<00:04:16.600> devour<00:04:17.350> it

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
and then they go for it and devour it

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.310 
and then they go for it and devour it
pretty<00:04:18.580> quickly<00:04:18.820> so<00:04:19.000> that's<00:04:19.540> pretty<00:04:19.780> cute<00:04:20.080> to

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
pretty quickly so that's pretty cute to

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.740 
pretty quickly so that's pretty cute to

gallon tub so that houses five butterfly

gallon tub so that houses five butterfly
telescopes<00:04:26.200> but<00:04:26.590> when<00:04:26.710> they<00:04:26.830> first<00:04:27.010> arrived<00:04:27.460> a

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
telescopes but when they first arrived a

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.250 
telescopes but when they first arrived a
couple<00:04:27.910> weeks<00:04:28.240> after<00:04:28.420> they<00:04:28.660> arrived<00:04:28.930> they

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
couple weeks after they arrived they

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.460 
couple weeks after they arrived they
spawned<00:04:29.920> or<00:04:30.430> they<00:04:30.940> either<00:04:31.120> spawned<00:04:31.630> or<00:04:32.050> the

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
spawned or they either spawned or the

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.430 
spawned or they either spawned or the
big<00:04:32.650> female<00:04:33.010> just<00:04:33.430> really<00:04:34.090> stags<00:04:34.390> because<00:04:34.900> she

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
big female just really stags because she

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.930 
big female just really stags because she
was<00:04:35.590> just<00:04:35.770> recently<00:04:35.950> shipped<00:04:36.460> and<00:04:36.700> a<00:04:36.760> lot<00:04:36.910> of

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
was just recently shipped and a lot of

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.520 
was just recently shipped and a lot of
times<00:04:37.240> goldfish<00:04:37.720> do<00:04:37.900> that<00:04:38.050> after<00:04:38.350> they've

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
times goldfish do that after they've

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.290 
times goldfish do that after they've
been<00:04:38.620> shipped<00:04:38.950> so<00:04:39.280> I<00:04:39.310> didn't<00:04:39.640> know<00:04:40.000> if<00:04:40.180> the

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
been shipped so I didn't know if the

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.460 
been shipped so I didn't know if the
eggs<00:04:40.450> were<00:04:40.600> fertilized<00:04:41.020> or<00:04:41.110> not<00:04:41.260> but<00:04:41.380> I'm

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
eggs were fertilized or not but I'm

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.870 
eggs were fertilized or not but I'm
pretty<00:04:41.710> sure<00:04:41.800> they<00:04:42.100> weren't<00:04:42.280> so<00:04:42.580> I<00:04:42.610> ended<00:04:42.820> up

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
pretty sure they weren't so I ended up

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.000 
pretty sure they weren't so I ended up
tossing<00:04:43.540> them<00:04:43.660> out<00:04:43.780> they<00:04:44.200> didn't<00:04:44.530> I<00:04:44.650> figured

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
tossing them out they didn't I figured

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.290 
tossing them out they didn't I figured
they<00:04:45.190> might<00:04:45.340> spawn<00:04:45.670> again<00:04:45.820> because<00:04:46.180> my

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
they might spawn again because my

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.090 
they might spawn again because my
Bristol's<00:04:46.750> had<00:04:46.900> been<00:04:47.080> spawning<00:04:47.410> like<00:04:47.770> every

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
Bristol's had been spawning like every

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.400 
Bristol's had been spawning like every
week<00:04:48.310> or<00:04:48.520> two<00:04:48.790> weeks<00:04:49.030> or<00:04:49.240> so<00:04:49.450> and<00:04:49.840> the

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
week or two weeks or so and the

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.260 
week or two weeks or so and the
butterflies<00:04:50.830> didn't<00:04:51.190> spawn<00:04:51.370> again<00:04:51.490> so<00:04:51.940> that

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
butterflies didn't spawn again so that

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.780 
butterflies didn't spawn again so that
was<00:04:52.390> kind<00:04:52.600> of<00:04:52.660> a<00:04:52.780> bummer<00:04:52.960> and<00:04:53.320> I<00:04:54.160> decided<00:04:54.610> you

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
was kind of a bummer and I decided you

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.220 
was kind of a bummer and I decided you
know<00:04:54.940> I<00:04:55.030> waited<00:04:55.360> awhile<00:04:55.480> to<00:04:55.840> see<00:04:55.990> if<00:04:56.080> they

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
know I waited awhile to see if they

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.050 
know I waited awhile to see if they
would<00:04:56.380> but<00:04:56.560> I<00:04:56.680> decided<00:04:56.980> that<00:04:57.220> I<00:04:57.850> was<00:04:58.030> just

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
would but I decided that I was just

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.270 
would but I decided that I was just
gonna<00:04:58.300> try<00:04:58.840> to<00:04:58.900> do<00:04:59.200> a<00:04:59.230> little<00:04:59.410> hibernation

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
gonna try to do a little hibernation

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.920 
gonna try to do a little hibernation
period<00:05:00.310> for<00:05:00.940> them<00:05:01.090> and<00:05:01.360> see<00:05:01.510> if<00:05:01.600> that<00:05:01.750> might

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
period for them and see if that might

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.750 
period for them and see if that might
trigger<00:05:02.290> spawning<00:05:02.860> once<00:05:03.070> they<00:05:03.340> come<00:05:03.610> out<00:05:03.700> of

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
trigger spawning once they come out of

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.630 
trigger spawning once they come out of
that<00:05:03.970> so<00:05:04.330> what<00:05:05.050> I'm<00:05:05.170> doing<00:05:05.200> is<00:05:05.770> decreasing<00:05:06.520> the

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
that so what I'm doing is decreasing the

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.190 
that so what I'm doing is decreasing the
photo<00:05:06.820> period<00:05:07.120> so<00:05:07.570> the<00:05:07.660> lights<00:05:07.870> are<00:05:07.990> on

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
photo period so the lights are on

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.550 
photo period so the lights are on
for<00:05:08.620> less<00:05:09.100> time<00:05:09.730> each<00:05:10.090> day<00:05:10.120> I<00:05:10.600> also<00:05:10.960> decrease

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
for less time each day I also decrease

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.220 
for less time each day I also decrease
in<00:05:11.740> feeding<00:05:12.130> a<00:05:12.220> little<00:05:12.370> bit<00:05:12.670> and<00:05:13.230> decreasing

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
in feeding a little bit and decreasing

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.610 
in feeding a little bit and decreasing
the<00:05:14.260> temperature<00:05:14.920> so<00:05:15.880> that<00:05:16.300> will<00:05:16.690> kind<00:05:17.050> of<00:05:17.170> put

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
the temperature so that will kind of put

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.440 
the temperature so that will kind of put
them<00:05:17.770> into<00:05:17.920> like<00:05:18.340> a<00:05:18.370> hibernation<00:05:18.910> type<00:05:19.270> of

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
them into like a hibernation type of

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.410 
them into like a hibernation type of
mode<00:05:19.690> once<00:05:20.320> I<00:05:20.670> you<00:05:21.670> know<00:05:21.760> in<00:05:21.940> a<00:05:22.030> couple<00:05:22.360> of

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420 
mode once I you know in a couple of

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.330 
mode once I you know in a couple of
months<00:05:22.570> or<00:05:22.960> whenever<00:05:23.470> I<00:05:23.500> decide<00:05:23.710> to<00:05:23.920> do<00:05:24.160> it

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
months or whenever I decide to do it

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.960 
months or whenever I decide to do it
start<00:05:25.590> increasing<00:05:26.590> feeding<00:05:27.130> temperature<00:05:27.700> and

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
start increasing feeding temperature and

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.050 
start increasing feeding temperature and
photo<00:05:28.180> period<00:05:28.660> again<00:05:28.960> then<00:05:29.740> they'll<00:05:30.060> they'll

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
photo period again then they'll they'll

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.090 
photo period again then they'll they'll
it'll<00:05:31.570> hopefully<00:05:31.990> trigger<00:05:32.560> spawning

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
it'll hopefully trigger spawning

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.740 
it'll hopefully trigger spawning
behavior<00:05:33.490> and

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
behavior and

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.900 
behavior and
they'll<00:05:34.080> think<00:05:34.260> but<00:05:34.500> it's<00:05:34.650> springtime<00:05:35.400> and

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
they'll think but it's springtime and

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.840 
they'll think but it's springtime and
it's<00:05:36.060> time<00:05:36.270> to<00:05:36.450> start<00:05:36.690> spawning<00:05:37.140> again<00:05:37.530> so<00:05:37.890> I'm

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
it's time to start spawning again so I'm

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.610 
it's time to start spawning again so I'm
keeping<00:05:39.300> my<00:05:39.390> fingers<00:05:39.420> crossed<00:05:39.780> about<00:05:40.380> that

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
keeping my fingers crossed about that

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.670 
keeping my fingers crossed about that
and<00:05:40.920> trying<00:05:41.130> to<00:05:41.190> do<00:05:41.310> everything<00:05:41.520> I<00:05:41.700> can<00:05:41.760> to

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
and trying to do everything I can to

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.250 
and trying to do everything I can to
encourage<00:05:43.680> them<00:05:44.190> to<00:05:44.220> spawn<00:05:44.840> so<00:05:45.840> hopefully

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
encourage them to spawn so hopefully

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.110 
encourage them to spawn so hopefully
I'll<00:05:46.380> have<00:05:46.530> some<00:05:46.590> butterfly<00:05:47.160> fried<00:05:47.550> to<00:05:47.850> Ria's

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
I'll have some butterfly fried to Ria's

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.830 
I'll have some butterfly fried to Ria's
in<00:05:48.300> the<00:05:48.360> next<00:05:48.920> six<00:05:49.920> months<00:05:50.070> or<00:05:50.520> so<00:05:50.780> Luka<00:05:51.780> and

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
in the next six months or so Luka and

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.860 
in the next six months or so Luka and
Felix<00:05:52.290> are<00:05:52.500> still<00:05:52.830> in<00:05:53.100> their<00:05:53.340> 60<00:05:53.820> on<00:05:54.000> table<00:05:54.360> no

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
Felix are still in their 60 on table no

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.600 
Felix are still in their 60 on table no
updates<00:05:55.440> about<00:05:55.620> them<00:05:55.950> they're<00:05:56.310> still<00:05:56.400> just

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
updates about them they're still just

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.120 
updates about them they're still just
doing<00:05:57.450> their<00:05:57.750> thing<00:05:58.020> and<00:05:58.380> I<00:05:58.500> think<00:05:58.800> I<00:05:58.950> might

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
doing their thing and I think I might

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.760 
doing their thing and I think I might
eventually<00:05:59.790> end<00:06:00.750> up<00:06:00.870> moving<00:06:01.200> them<00:06:01.320> into<00:06:01.650> the

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
eventually end up moving them into the

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.830 
eventually end up moving them into the
big<00:06:01.980> tub<00:06:02.250> with<00:06:02.430> other<00:06:02.700> butterflies<00:06:03.270> but<00:06:03.660> not

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
big tub with other butterflies but not

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.620 
big tub with other butterflies but not
until<00:06:04.140> I<00:06:04.170> need<00:06:04.560> this<00:06:04.850> space<00:06:05.850> for<00:06:06.270> maybe

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
until I need this space for maybe

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.110 
until I need this space for maybe
butterfly<00:06:07.140> fry<00:06:07.500> or<00:06:07.740> something<00:06:08.070> like<00:06:08.250> that<00:06:08.490> and

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
butterfly fry or something like that and

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.720 
butterfly fry or something like that and
then<00:06:09.360> I<00:06:09.390> also<00:06:09.600> have<00:06:10.020> over<00:06:10.530> here<00:06:10.950> in<00:06:11.580> this

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:11.730 
then I also have over here in this

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.610 
then I also have over here in this
5-gallon<00:06:12.300> bucket<00:06:12.570> some<00:06:12.840> new<00:06:13.020> plants<00:06:13.290> that<00:06:13.500> I

always include a couple extra bunches of
plants<00:06:40.410> from<00:06:41.340> what<00:06:41.490> you<00:06:41.580> ordered<00:06:41.910> so<00:06:42.300> that's

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
kind of cool too so I just have these

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.820 
kind of cool too so I just have these
plants<00:06:44.790> in<00:06:45.090> quarantine<00:06:45.660> right<00:06:46.110> now<00:06:46.320> to<00:06:46.380> make

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
plants in quarantine right now to make

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.140 
plants in quarantine right now to make
sure<00:06:46.860> they're<00:06:47.190> healthy<00:06:47.370> and<00:06:47.640> they're<00:06:47.880> not

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
sure they're healthy and they're not

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.570 
sure they're healthy and they're not
carrying<00:06:48.690> any<00:06:48.870> disease<00:06:49.290> and<00:06:49.830> then<00:06:50.430> I'm

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
carrying any disease and then I'm

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.770 
carrying any disease and then I'm
probably<00:06:50.760> gonna<00:06:51.000> quarantine<00:06:51.450> them<00:06:51.540> for<00:06:51.750> a

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 
probably gonna quarantine them for a

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.230 
probably gonna quarantine them for a
couple<00:06:52.110> weeks<00:06:52.320> and<00:06:52.560> add<00:06:52.740> them<00:06:52.950> to<00:06:53.250> the<00:06:53.550> tanks

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 
couple weeks and add them to the tanks

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.280 
couple weeks and add them to the tanks
and<00:06:54.419> tubs<00:06:54.780> so<00:06:55.169> I<00:06:55.470> got<00:06:56.280> a<00:06:56.700> bunch<00:06:57.030> of<00:06:57.210> foxtail<00:06:57.810> and

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:58.290 
and tubs so I got a bunch of foxtail and

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.409 
and tubs so I got a bunch of foxtail and
then<00:06:58.410> a<00:06:58.650> few<00:06:58.950> bunches<00:06:59.430> of<00:06:59.640> Brazilian

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:00.419 
then a few bunches of Brazilian

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:02.450 
then a few bunches of Brazilian
pennywort<00:07:00.960> and<00:07:01.380> for<00:07:01.710> the<00:07:01.830> Brazilian<00:07:02.250> penny

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
pennywort and for the Brazilian penny

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.570 
pennywort and for the Brazilian penny
word<00:07:02.640> I'm<00:07:02.850> going<00:07:02.970> to<00:07:03.030> put<00:07:03.300> that<00:07:04.020> in<00:07:04.500> the<00:07:04.800> tubs<00:07:05.310> I

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 
word I'm going to put that in the tubs I

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.730 
word I'm going to put that in the tubs I
think<00:07:05.850> because<00:07:06.150> it's<00:07:06.330> kind<00:07:06.600> of<00:07:06.720> a<00:07:06.870> it's<00:07:07.500> pretty

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:07.740 
think because it's kind of a it's pretty

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.520 
think because it's kind of a it's pretty
underwater<00:07:08.550> but<00:07:08.820> I<00:07:08.850> think<00:07:09.240> it's<00:07:09.530> prettiest

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:10.530 
underwater but I think it's prettiest

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.760 
underwater but I think it's prettiest
when<00:07:11.280> it<00:07:11.400> starts<00:07:11.640> growing<00:07:11.729> above<00:07:12.090> the<00:07:12.270> water

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:12.770 
when it starts growing above the water

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.950 
when it starts growing above the water
and<00:07:13.770> it<00:07:13.890> kind<00:07:14.100> of<00:07:14.160> creates<00:07:14.490> a<00:07:14.700> mat<00:07:15.240> of<00:07:15.450> plants

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 
and it kind of creates a mat of plants

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.690 
and it kind of creates a mat of plants
above<00:07:16.320> the<00:07:16.470> water<00:07:16.620> so<00:07:16.950> I'm<00:07:17.040> hoping<00:07:17.310> that<00:07:17.550> will

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:17.700 
above the water so I'm hoping that will

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.820 
above the water so I'm hoping that will
happen<00:07:17.910> because<00:07:18.690> I<00:07:18.870> want<00:07:19.080> some<00:07:19.320> visual

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:19.830 
happen because I want some visual

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.040 
happen because I want some visual
interest<00:07:19.979> in<00:07:20.669> the<00:07:20.790> tops<00:07:21.060> of<00:07:21.330> some<00:07:21.540> sort<00:07:21.840> and

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.050 
interest in the tops of some sort and

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.380 
interest in the tops of some sort and
plus<00:07:22.320> I<00:07:22.560> think<00:07:22.590> live<00:07:23.580> plants<00:07:23.910> would<00:07:24.030> be<00:07:24.060> really

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:24.390 
plus I think live plants would be really

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:26.390 
plus I think live plants would be really
enriching<00:07:24.960> for<00:07:24.990> the<00:07:25.380> goldfish<00:07:25.740> to<00:07:26.010> have<00:07:26.190> in

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 
enriching for the goldfish to have in

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.760 
enriching for the goldfish to have in
their<00:07:26.550> tubs<00:07:26.910> as<00:07:27.090> well<00:07:27.300> so<00:07:27.630> I<00:07:27.870> hope<00:07:28.229> that<00:07:28.290> ends

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:28.770 
their tubs as well so I hope that ends

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.190 
their tubs as well so I hope that ends
up<00:07:28.860> working<00:07:29.040> out<00:07:29.220> I<00:07:29.280> haven't<00:07:29.580> had<00:07:29.880> super<00:07:30.630> good

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:31.200 
up working out I haven't had super good

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.460 
up working out I haven't had super good
luck<00:07:31.410> with<00:07:31.620> plant<00:07:32.430> raising<00:07:33.330> in<00:07:33.600> the<00:07:33.750> past<00:07:34.020> I

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:34.470 
luck with plant raising in the past I

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.040 
luck with plant raising in the past I
tend<00:07:35.160> to<00:07:35.250> just<00:07:35.400> not<00:07:36.180> do<00:07:36.660> so

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.050 
tend to just not do so

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.350 
tend to just not do so
that<00:07:37.349> area<00:07:37.770> so<00:07:38.129> hopefully<00:07:38.430> this<00:07:38.909> time<00:07:39.150> will<00:07:39.330> be

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 
that area so hopefully this time will be

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.420 
that area so hopefully this time will be
a<00:07:39.479> little<00:07:39.659> different<00:07:40.020> we'll<00:07:40.590> see<00:07:40.830> with<00:07:41.310> the

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:41.430 
a little different we'll see with the

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.920 
a little different we'll see with the
foxtail<00:07:42.000> I'm<00:07:42.120> probably<00:07:42.330> going<00:07:42.539> to<00:07:42.629> plant

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:42.930 
foxtail I'm probably going to plant

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.710 
foxtail I'm probably going to plant
