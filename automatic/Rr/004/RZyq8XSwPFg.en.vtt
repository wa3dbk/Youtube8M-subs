 prestigious psychologist and psychoanalyst isabel menéndez has just published a 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:11.860
 new essay titled the Menéndez love construction takes more than 30 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.160
 years alternating clinical practice with the disclosure of major issues

 nobody escapes in the construction of love isabel menéndez ensures that love 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.289
 it is something that is learned 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.520
 we are able to talk but received love 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.150
 all the deputies and how we approach the point where everything was twisted an ankle 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.230
 continues to condition an event that a person is built 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.260
 that we need to achieve healthy and satisfying relationships 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.770
 can learn to love 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.970
 the loving j is at the base of our nineteenth century 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.060
 a second study has been based on our parents 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.400
 we can build a life that we want 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.539
 we can build our own life 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.539
 the axis of the relationships that we want 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.790
 we all suffer in life 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.790
 also duty and is related to love 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.220
 injured is active 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.700
 with the lack of love with the post 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.090
 arch complain about not being loved 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.670
 that is the phobias expressions obsessions 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.210
 efe 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.590
 very narcissistic people this one can not 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.340
 do not know how to love 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.360
 nissan able to love 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.700
 For this 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.840
 Everything is related 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.230
 with the ability 1 drama 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.570
 and love another 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.600
 equally love ourselves 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.600
 this miller gives him an apprenticeship 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.719
 that the first years of life are organized and that this was a construction 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.740
 that goes hand in hand with the construction of identity losada 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.269
 the German entity 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.819
 that has to do with the psyche 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.689
 is built for identification is and wishes with our first objects of 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.139
 love you are the 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:21.129
 of three 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.989
 we have 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.809
 Carlos Tevez entity 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:27.909
 had the ones that go out to family to call others 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.909
 but we learned to him 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.939
 everything we suffer in life 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:38.389
 see with love 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:39.959
 everything around him 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.339
 that also has to do with how we live sexuality does not 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.470
 the big issues of life that affect us most 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.129
 Funes and women 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.539
 they are very common 

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:53.659
 we want you to love us 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.129
 where they were where we failed 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.129
 we want to be recognized we want to be valued 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.889
 we want you not to ask us what we can not 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:08.639
 e good we want relatively similar things but that is so easy 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:09.779
 tell 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:12.919
 it is very difficult to adeje will be carried out not 

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:15.010
 because sometimes 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.010
 we can engage with people who make us suffer 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:21.459
 we know because that's where 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.779
 ceded to that 

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:27.159
 yes, elaborating what happens does not change the mode of choice 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.349
 Jorge 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.349
 because we choose according to a national history 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.349
 that enables us but of which little we know 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:40.589
 and also to think that usually always a little bit of fear 

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:44.219
 I do not know why species belongs we're going to be afraid of ourselves 

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:48.699
 we should be more afraid yes if we do not think 

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:52.029
 because we would act 

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:55.029
 without knowing so much what will happen to us but obviously 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.159
 the unconscious scares a little because it teaches us 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.639
 For everything that does not dominate over ourselves and makes us beings 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:03.219
 alive 

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:04.579
 the tip of the east 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:05.830
 very fragile 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.939
 very needy not 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:11.819
 clear question is that yes we can give love if we have not received it 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:17.099
 well, badly, someone has had us that wants a bit like 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:19.599
 sustain us alive 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:23.629
 if they could not have wanted us badly because we will always have 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.479
 a very important lack 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.270
 that can be elaborated in the line of the possible 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.490
 so as not to be so damaged, 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.490
 you can not modify 9º 

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:42.249
 they were interested in the science of love that absence 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:46.340
 to be able to contain a child that goes through the desire to contain him 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.600
 both the mother and the father because the father has to have enough 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.090
 high enough to separate him from the mother and put him 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.979
 limits of being there 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.979
 but that absence of love can be him 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.219
 of dramatic events 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:06.229
 what we deny 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.539
 because we can not realize the company 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:11.779
 is what it has to do with him 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:13.879
 with what we have not had 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:15.610
 with a story 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.689
 that we have mounted in our head 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:22.719
 because the child I do not go to adults designated does not know how 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:27.069
 which the children's institution is not that kind of events 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:29.740
 that's why it's built and built 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.580
 in tennessee virginia the mother list 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.159
 but he has to stop idealizing the hunger request without idealizing it 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:38.210
 mother 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.320
 Well, you can not 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.350
 never to have a relationship with a rewarding woman 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.310
 because probably the idea life 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.030
 and then the tse fall to the ground iniesta also a woman can do 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.550
 then the story that we put them in your head 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.849
 it's very important we all have a story 

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:03.050
 what works for us 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.039
 I ask that it is a reality city 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:10.819
 that can end navas the way to love throughout life but this one 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:12.860
 It has a good part 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.860
 which is that if we make it 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.540
 and of which that story and why we have set it up so conflicts we 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:25.740
 creates can be built though another way 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.119
 the history 

00:06:28.119 --> 00:06:30.719
 and live love in another way 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:32.779
 because love is built 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:33.619
 I insist
