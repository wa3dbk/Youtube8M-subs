00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
I know if this shows up on a computer

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.590 
I know if this shows up on a computer
monitor<00:01:44.830> doesn't<00:01:45.310> show<00:01:45.580> up<00:01:45.610> well<00:01:45.970> my<00:01:46.180> camera

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
monitor doesn't show up well my camera

monitor doesn't show up well my camera
display<00:01:47.080> can<00:01:48.070> we<00:01:48.190> see<00:01:48.400> these<00:01:48.580> waves<00:01:48.880> here

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
display can we see these waves here

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.290 
display can we see these waves here
trying<00:01:49.870> to<00:01:49.960> show<00:01:50.080> it<00:01:50.440> up<00:01:50.620> in<00:01:51.460> this<00:01:51.670> thing<00:01:51.940> here

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
trying to show it up in this thing here

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.140 
trying to show it up in this thing here
and<00:01:52.620> it<00:01:53.620> doesn't<00:01:53.980> even<00:01:54.100> meet<00:01:54.520> with<00:01:54.790> thing

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
and it doesn't even meet with thing

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.430 
and it doesn't even meet with thing
underneath<00:01:55.480> then<00:01:55.900> notice<00:01:56.230> how<00:01:56.380> the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
underneath then notice how the

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.470 
underneath then notice how the
temperatures<00:01:56.980> and<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.190> two<00:01:57.430> things<00:01:58.090> are<00:01:58.300> very

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
temperatures and the two things are very

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:05.160 
temperatures and the two things are very
different<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.700> these<00:02:04.360> constant<00:02:04.900> planes

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
different and these constant planes

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.950 
different and these constant planes
working<00:02:05.710> close<00:02:05.980> together<00:02:09.119> do<00:02:10.119> is<00:02:10.330> section<00:02:10.780> by

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
working close together do is section by

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.770 
working close together do is section by
section<00:02:10.990> and<00:02:11.860> then<00:02:12.490> there's<00:02:12.730> even<00:02:13.450> another

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
section and then there's even another

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.490 
section and then there's even another
type<00:02:14.200> of<00:02:14.230> texture<00:02:16.320> over<00:02:17.320> here<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:20.170> change

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
type of texture over here and change

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.310 
type of texture over here and change
pass<00:02:20.890> it<00:02:21.250> was<00:02:21.400> real<00:02:21.640> hairy<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.209> couple<00:02:22.360> minutes

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
pass it was real hairy a couple minutes

of us is going up I hope my battery

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.340 
of us is going up I hope my battery
ricordo<00:03:13.030> get<00:03:13.210> full<00:03:13.540> before<00:03:13.840> I<00:03:13.900> could<00:03:14.080> get<00:03:14.230> this

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350

planet op a plane atop a flame there's a

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.199 
planet op a plane atop a flame there's a
nua<00:03:44.810> trail<00:03:45.319> sample<00:03:46.280> of<00:03:46.370> what<00:03:46.430> I'm<00:03:46.640> talking

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
nua trail sample of what I'm talking

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.350 
nua trail sample of what I'm talking
about<00:03:48.760> and<00:03:49.760> these<00:03:50.209> waves<00:03:50.599> are<00:03:50.810> getting<00:03:50.989> bigger

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
about and these waves are getting bigger

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.170 
about and these waves are getting bigger
and<00:03:53.360> I<00:03:53.810> stick<00:03:54.080> it<00:03:54.110> bigger<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:55.489> other<00:03:55.640> stuff<00:03:56.030> is

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
and I stick it bigger the other stuff is

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.500 
and I stick it bigger the other stuff is
acting<00:03:56.569> really<00:03:56.870> strange<00:03:57.590> but<00:03:58.549> above<00:03:58.970> it<00:03:59.209> and

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
acting really strange but above it and

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.990 
acting really strange but above it and
then<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:00.440> gap<00:04:00.709> in<00:04:01.010> between<00:04:01.629> and<00:04:02.629> then<00:04:04.000> step

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
then the gap in between and then step

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.720 
then the gap in between and then step
above<00:04:05.390> that<00:04:05.660> it<00:04:06.110> occurs<00:04:06.680> more<00:04:07.010> fresh<00:04:07.370> trail

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
above that it occurs more fresh trail

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:14.009 
above that it occurs more fresh trail
widening<00:04:08.420> up<00:04:08.629> and<00:04:09.019> this<00:04:09.680> thing<00:04:09.980> is<00:04:10.040> moving

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.620 

upwards<00:04:15.019> it<00:04:15.230> just<00:04:15.470> looks<00:04:15.680> strange<00:04:16.389> and<00:04:17.389> this

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
upwards it just looks strange and this

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.690 
upwards it just looks strange and this
thing<00:04:17.930> is<00:04:17.989> almost<00:04:18.410> taking<00:04:18.859> the<00:04:18.950> shape<00:04:19.220> it's<00:04:19.519> in

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
thing is almost taking the shape it's in

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.240 
thing is almost taking the shape it's in
between<00:04:19.880> part<00:04:20.510> of<00:04:20.720> this<00:04:21.320> way<00:04:21.769> that's<00:04:22.040> of<00:04:22.160> a

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
between part of this way that's of a

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.760 
between part of this way that's of a
different<00:04:22.639> texture<00:04:23.030> and<00:04:23.330> of<00:04:23.930> course<00:04:24.290> there's

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
different texture and of course there's

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.250 
different texture and of course there's
one<00:04:24.919> of<00:04:25.010> our<00:04:25.160> lower<00:04:25.790> flying<00:04:26.240> military<00:04:26.810> planes

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
of electromagnetic manipulation and I

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.680 
of electromagnetic manipulation and I
know<00:05:57.740> I<00:05:57.920> put<00:05:58.460> this<00:05:58.640> on<00:05:58.820> youtube<00:05:59.030> this<00:05:59.480> dope

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
know I put this on youtube this dope

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.440 
know I put this on youtube this dope
would<00:05:59.870> be<00:06:00.190> going<00:06:01.190> to<00:06:01.280> be<00:06:01.430> stupid<00:06:01.700> people<00:06:02.240> who

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 
would be going to be stupid people who

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.920 
would be going to be stupid people who
say<00:06:03.580> that<00:06:04.580> I<00:06:04.640> need<00:06:04.940> to<00:06:05.060> learn<00:06:05.180> about<00:06:05.330> types<00:06:05.720> of

clouds

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:14.540 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.890 

yeah<00:06:15.430> maybe<00:06:16.430> it<00:06:16.700> means<00:06:16.820> you<00:06:17.180> mounted<00:06:17.630> shutter

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900
