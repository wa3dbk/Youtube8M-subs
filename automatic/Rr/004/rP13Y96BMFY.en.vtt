00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.149
 so seven to a four-seater coupe high-garonne it's really ridiculous 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:13.969
 to know that we put on this vehicle all that we could not 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:15.229
 see 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:16.720
 a vehicle of this type 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.699
 because it is 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.399
 nest egg that is that measures a little bit less than 2 5 meters 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.289
 which is endowed with a peculiarity these are these magnificent doors butterfly 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.300
 but which have the peculiarity to let discover also the mechanics 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.260
 why because the car butcher is a mythical object 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.150
 and it is necessary that soon that we do not remain side we maintain those of this 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.850
 myth 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.160
 and the danger of course is that the car comes from a halal product 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.180
 white goods note 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.390
 it's really the boxes the automobile rust that we find in my 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.390
 career 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.850
 it does not reach it's a neologism 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.400
 it's based on the name of m 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.110
 hard to evil in e2 of the sea is a 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.590
 and from that it was thought that this name is quoted and quite online 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.590
 with the style of the vehicle that is inspired by the mount 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.040
 sailing 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.670
 there are several elements that reminds the afsset reminds sail 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.570
 e if only for example the aluminum customers who support who 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.470
 support 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.360
 the seat in the overall form of the vehicle 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.990
 who recalls his guitar 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.390
 the boat that we imagine in the years in the 20s and see more 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.990
 late 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.680
 poker indeed this art 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.920
 the mother was a very big influence i would say that the style of the 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.350
 vehicle with this big wave of course from front to back and 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.420
 also something that kingsley and dancers in this world of sailing 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.790
 for this vehicle are fed up we chose 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.400
 even if we do not show a traditional soft top in 3d in senegal 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.880
 today's summer hoods of both of us with a chronic seal 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.010
 during their remarkable and also 46% and vandalism since there is a triangle 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.000
 but metallic inside 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.959
 so we wanted to associate with% to 7 this car this type of property 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.569
 of hoods because 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.890
 she calls it a first year not much influence the style then 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.819
 that when we have a coupe-cabriolet well that tells you that it's still 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.409
 many proportions and then the style of the rear of the vehicle alas 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.409
 we wanted a lot of freedom to be able to speak freely 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:34.799
 the idea is especially a point of view the pistil stick 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.309
 % 

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:37.969
 themes 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:42.019
 I'm going to talk about this big wave e but also the sale 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.119
 the theme of the sale 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:49.459
 the interior is very simple nevertheless the extremely luxurious 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.209
 e the counters 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.919
 that we particularly like we like this work 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:00.209
 this association between analog and digital 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.659
 e and so these are men of things that we will remember the facts 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.169
 in annecy that 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:09.519
 many small details like the screen-printed cook which is 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.249
 thing that you have to believe a lot 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:14.459
 and who will then come in series in a near future on fire 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.799
 I must say that I am also a better ferrarist 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.839
 in the souls banks 

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:27.649
 whenever the new ferrari how not to see her
