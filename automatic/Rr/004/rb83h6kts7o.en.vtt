00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.490 
and I have another piece over here
that's<00:04:45.800> bringing<00:04:46.550> more<00:04:46.700> hot<00:04:46.940> air<00:04:47.050> in<00:04:48.050> for<00:04:48.410> the

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
that's bringing more hot air in for the

that's bringing more hot air in for the
primary<00:04:49.990> one<00:04:50.990> good<00:04:51.380> short<00:04:51.650> these<00:04:52.130> are<00:04:52.430> the<00:04:52.639> two

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
primary one good short these are the two

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.180 
primary one good short these are the two
loops<00:04:53.630> here<00:04:54.020> that<00:04:54.200> we<00:04:54.290> haven't<00:04:54.440> connected<00:04:54.860> up

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190

and<00:04:56.479> will<00:04:56.690> this<00:04:57.410> is<00:04:57.770> a<00:04:57.800> three<00:04:58.520> quarter<00:04:58.880> inch

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
and will this is a three quarter inch

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.500 
and will this is a three quarter inch
pipe<00:04:59.960> then<00:05:00.560> I<00:05:00.620> put<00:05:00.830> in<00:05:01.010> for<00:05:01.880> the<00:05:01.970> second<00:05:02.360> year

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
pipe then I put in for the second year

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.810 
pipe then I put in for the second year
it<00:05:02.690> goes<00:05:02.840> right<00:05:03.050> across<00:05:03.169> here<00:05:03.680> here's<00:05:03.919> quarter

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
it goes right across here here's quarter

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.760 
it goes right across here here's quarter
inch<00:05:04.940> holes<00:05:05.210> every<00:05:05.570> inch<00:05:06.190> and<00:05:07.570> and<00:05:08.570> I<00:05:08.750> it's<00:05:09.260> it

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
inch holes every inch and and I it's it

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.950 
inch holes every inch and and I it's it
has<00:05:09.800> to<00:05:10.220> be<00:05:10.370> drawing<00:05:10.669> hot<00:05:11.150> it's<00:05:11.450> hot<00:05:11.660> here

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
has to be drawing hot it's hot here

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.469 
has to be drawing hot it's hot here
throwing<00:05:12.800> warm<00:05:13.550> air<00:05:13.760> I'd<00:05:13.880> like<00:05:14.030> to<00:05:14.210> get<00:05:14.330> it

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
throwing warm air I'd like to get it

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:31.860 
throwing warm air I'd like to get it
down<00:05:14.630> further<00:05:15.110> so<00:05:15.490> big<00:05:16.490> it
