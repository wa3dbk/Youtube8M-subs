00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
landscape picture so let's use our

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.780 
landscape picture so let's use our
organizer<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.990> browse<00:00:13.620> for<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.130> picture<00:00:14.549> and

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
we need to browse some more folders and

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.070 
we need to browse some more folders and
I<00:00:17.520> happened<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.910> know<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.090> picture<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.600> want<00:00:18.840> is

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
is actually in a folder called new

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.740 
is actually in a folder called new
images<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.700> it's<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.120> boat<00:00:39.300> picture<00:00:39.629> now

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
images and it's the boat picture now

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.389 
images and it's the boat picture now
right<00:00:39.960> here<00:00:40.110> which<00:00:40.290> I'm<00:00:40.440> just<00:00:40.469> gonna<00:00:40.710> drag<00:00:41.160> and

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
right here which I'm just gonna drag and

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.779 
right here which I'm just gonna drag and
drop<00:00:41.790> onto<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.120> workspace<00:00:43.399> as<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.520> can<00:00:44.610> see

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
drop onto the workspace as you can see

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.090 
drop onto the workspace as you can see
the<00:00:44.940> boat<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.270> looking<00:00:45.629> rather<00:00:45.840> lost<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.590> this

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
the boat is looking rather lost in this

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.209 
the boat is looking rather lost in this
vast<00:00:47.640> area<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.690> don't<00:00:49.260> actually<00:00:49.469> need<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
vast area so I don't actually need the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.790 
vast area so I don't actually need the
organizer<00:00:50.789> anymore<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:52.289> don't<00:00:52.350> need<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
organizer anymore and I don't need the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.439 
organizer anymore and I don't need the
Learning<00:00:53.190> Center<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:53.699> we<00:00:53.730> close<00:00:54.059> both<00:00:54.329> of

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
Learning Center so we close both of

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.139 
Learning Center so we close both of
those<00:00:54.600> down<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.320> now<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.070> can<00:00:56.370> maximize<00:00:56.640> this

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
those down and now I can maximize this

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.939 
those down and now I can maximize this
window<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.780> we'll<00:00:58.020> click<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.649> fitting

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
window so we'll click on this fitting

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.970 
window so we'll click on this fitting
and<00:00:59.340> window<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.969> screen<00:01:00.739> looking<00:01:01.739> at<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
and window to screen looking at the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.009 
and window to screen looking at the
picture<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.640> can<00:01:02.879> see<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.449> it's<00:01:03.660> looking<00:01:03.899> a

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
picture I can see that it's looking a

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.700 
picture I can see that it's looking a
little<00:01:04.229> bit<00:01:04.500> dull<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.040> flat<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:06.200> also<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
little bit dull and flat and also the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.219 
little bit dull and flat and also the
horizon<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:09.090> sloping<00:01:09.630> down<00:01:09.689> towards<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
horizon is sloping down towards the

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.350 
horizon is sloping down towards the
left-hand<00:01:10.560> side<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.580> let's<00:01:11.790> fix<00:01:12.030> both<00:01:12.299> of

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
left-hand side so let's fix both of

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.679 
left-hand side so let's fix both of
these<00:01:12.570> problems<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.439> can<00:01:13.979> fix<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.689> sloping

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
these problems I can fix the sloping

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.270 
these problems I can fix the sloping
horizon<00:01:16.200> first<00:01:16.439> by<00:01:16.650> clicking<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.159> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
horizon first by clicking on the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.510 
horizon first by clicking on the
straighten<00:01:17.880> tool<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:19.470> produces<00:01:20.460> a

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
straighten tool and this produces a

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.820 
straighten tool and this produces a
straight<00:01:20.909> line<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.750> now<00:01:21.930> if<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.080> take<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.500> line

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
straight line so now if I take a line

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.520 
straight line so now if I take a line
left<00:01:23.490> edge<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.060> put<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.780> horizon<00:01:24.930> and

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
left edge and put it on the horizon and

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.770 
left edge and put it on the horizon and
then<00:01:25.920> put<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.189> on<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.400> right<00:01:27.000> edge<00:01:27.240> on<00:01:27.479> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
then put it on the right edge on the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.810 
then put it on the right edge on the
horizon<00:01:28.259> as<00:01:28.350> well<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.890> we<00:01:29.220> can<00:01:29.369> see<00:01:29.579> that

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
horizon as well and we can see that

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.090 
horizon as well and we can see that
degree<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.750> it's<00:01:31.079> actually<00:01:31.380> slanting<00:01:31.890> why

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
degree that it's actually slanting why

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.160 
degree that it's actually slanting why
so<00:01:32.729> now<00:01:32.909> let's<00:01:33.240> click<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.840> apply<00:01:34.079> button

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
so now let's click on the apply button

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.960 
so now let's click on the apply button
and<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:36.900> image<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.229> rotated<00:01:37.549> but<00:01:38.549> we've<00:01:38.729> got

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
and the image is rotated but we've got

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.910 
and the image is rotated but we've got
this<00:01:39.150> yellow<00:01:40.049> border<00:01:40.350> all<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.680> way<00:01:40.799> around

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
this yellow border all the way around

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.190 
this yellow border all the way around
which<00:01:41.340> automatically<00:01:41.820> want<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:43.020> is

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
which automatically want and this is

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.679 
which automatically want and this is
actually<00:01:43.530> caused<00:01:43.799> by<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.299> background<00:01:45.299> color

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
actually caused by the background color

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.630 
actually caused by the background color
so<00:01:46.049> let's<00:01:46.890> undo<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.950> we'll<00:01:49.950> check<00:01:50.340> now

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
so let's undo this and we'll check now

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.999 
so let's undo this and we'll check now
the<00:01:50.700> crop<00:01:51.329> image<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:52.290> will<00:01:52.439> automatically

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
the crop image this will automatically

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.130 
the crop image this will automatically
crop<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.549> picture<00:01:53.579> for<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.540> take<00:01:54.960> out

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
crop the picture for you and take out

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.850 
crop the picture for you and take out
any<00:01:55.439> unwanted<00:01:55.829> borders<00:01:57.290> so<00:01:58.290> now<00:01:58.439> let's<00:01:58.680> move

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
any unwanted borders so now let's move

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.810 
any unwanted borders so now let's move
the<00:01:58.920> picture<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.549> left<00:01:59.850> hand<00:02:00.060> side<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:01.820> this

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
the picture to left hand side and this

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.300 
the picture to left hand side and this
alter<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.420> tonality<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.439> picture<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.100> we

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
alter the tonality of the picture and we

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.920 
alter the tonality of the picture and we
can<00:02:05.340> do<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.820> by<00:02:06.000> going<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.479> adjust

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
can do that by going to adjust

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.680 
can do that by going to adjust
brightness<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.250> contrast<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:09.149> we'll<00:02:09.479> select

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
brightness and contrast and we'll select

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.839 
brightness and contrast and we'll select
levels<00:02:10.520> in<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.640> levels<00:02:11.970> palette

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
levels in the levels palette

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.819 
levels in the levels palette
we<00:02:13.060> can<00:02:13.209> see<00:02:13.359> that<00:02:13.510> we<00:02:13.719> any<00:02:14.140> adjustments<00:02:14.680> we

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
we can see that we any adjustments we

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:16.830 
we can see that we any adjustments we
make<00:02:15.040> can<00:02:15.579> be<00:02:15.700> previewed<00:02:16.090> on<00:02:16.269> the<00:02:16.450> image<00:02:16.689> so

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
make can be previewed on the image so

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.920 
make can be previewed on the image so
I'm<00:02:16.900> going<00:02:17.079> to<00:02:17.109> check<00:02:17.349> this<00:02:17.590> box<00:02:18.450> we<00:02:19.450> below

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
I'm going to check this box we below

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.959 
I'm going to check this box we below
that<00:02:20.139> we<00:02:20.290> have<00:02:20.319> the<00:02:20.499> before<00:02:21.010> image<00:02:21.219> and<00:02:21.579> the

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:21.969 
that we have the before image and the

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:25.259 
that we have the before image and the
after<00:02:22.420> image<00:02:23.459> moving<00:02:24.459> downwards<00:02:24.939> we've<00:02:25.090> got<00:02:25.239> a

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
after image moving downwards we've got a

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.539 
after image moving downwards we've got a
histogram<00:02:25.689> I<00:02:26.109> can<00:02:26.439> see<00:02:26.590> it's<00:02:26.709> a<00:02:26.829> quite<00:02:27.129> a<00:02:27.159> flat

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
histogram I can see it's a quite a flat

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.149 
histogram I can see it's a quite a flat
histogram<00:02:28.209> and<00:02:28.450> that's<00:02:28.950> indicating<00:02:29.950> that<00:02:29.980> the

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
histogram and that's indicating that the

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.000 
histogram and that's indicating that the
picture<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.519> looking<00:02:30.719> fairly<00:02:31.719> flat<00:02:31.989> so<00:02:32.590> if<00:02:32.859> we

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
picture is looking fairly flat so if we

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.920 
picture is looking fairly flat so if we
take<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.430> darkest<00:02:33.879> point<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.450> move<00:02:34.689> that<00:02:34.870> to

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
take the darkest point and move that to

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.129 
take the darkest point and move that to
the<00:02:35.200> right<00:02:35.409> a<00:02:35.769> bit<00:02:36.459> that<00:02:37.389> is<00:02:37.599> darkened<00:02:38.079> a

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:38.139 
the right a bit that is darkened a

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:39.809 
the right a bit that is darkened a
picture<00:02:38.469> down<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:39.010> we<00:02:39.159> can<00:02:39.310> add<00:02:39.400> just<00:02:39.639> a

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
picture down and we can add just a

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.239 
picture down and we can add just a
fraction<00:02:40.269> of<00:02:40.359> contrast<00:02:40.930> by<00:02:41.650> lightening<00:02:42.129> up

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:42.249 
fraction of contrast by lightening up

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:45.929 
fraction of contrast by lightening up
the<00:02:42.280> lighter<00:02:42.639> areas<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:44.519> I'm<00:02:45.519> going<00:02:45.819> to

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:45.939 
the lighter areas and I'm going to

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:48.899 
the lighter areas and I'm going to
accept<00:02:46.209> that<00:02:46.359> okay<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.519> levels

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:48.909 
accept that okay so the levels

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.000 
accept that okay so the levels
adjustment<00:02:49.060> has<00:02:49.870> actually<00:02:50.349> added<00:02:50.500> a<00:02:50.709> little

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
adjustment has actually added a little

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.220 
adjustment has actually added a little
bit<00:02:51.159> more<00:02:51.310> drama<00:02:51.549> to<00:02:51.819> the<00:02:51.909> picture<00:02:52.329> but<00:02:52.840> we<00:02:52.959> can

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
bit more drama to the picture but we can

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.039 
bit more drama to the picture but we can
further<00:02:53.500> improve<00:02:53.709> this<00:02:54.689> so<00:02:55.689> I'm<00:02:55.780> going<00:02:56.019> to

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
further improve this so I'm going to

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.339 
further improve this so I'm going to
maximize<00:02:56.560> this<00:02:57.549> window<00:02:57.760> now<00:02:57.969> and<00:02:58.750> now<00:02:59.049> we<00:02:59.109> can

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
maximize this window now and now we can

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.429 
maximize this window now and now we can
selectively<00:03:00.069> burn<00:03:00.969> in<00:03:01.209> areas<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.049> picture

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:02.439 
selectively burn in areas to the picture

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.679 
selectively burn in areas to the picture
to<00:03:02.769> add<00:03:02.919> more<00:03:03.129> drama<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:04.090> we<00:03:04.180> do<00:03:04.329> that<00:03:04.540> by

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:04.689 
to add more drama and we do that by

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:09.509 
to add more drama and we do that by
selecting<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.500> burn<00:03:06.219> tool<00:03:07.139> and<00:03:08.139> now<00:03:08.590> we<00:03:09.370> can

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
selecting the burn tool and now we can

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.369 
selecting the burn tool and now we can
select<00:03:09.849> our<00:03:10.000> brush<00:03:10.180> size<00:03:10.599> and<00:03:10.989> at<00:03:11.109> the<00:03:11.199> moment

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
select our brush size and at the moment

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.080 
select our brush size and at the moment
I'm<00:03:11.680> going<00:03:11.739> to<00:03:11.980> select<00:03:12.310> something<00:03:12.579> around

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
I'm going to select something around

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.280 
I'm going to select something around
about<00:03:13.299> the<00:03:13.480> 200<00:03:14.139> pixel<00:03:15.129> mark<00:03:15.569> and<00:03:16.569> also<00:03:16.959> my

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
about the 200 pixel mark and also my

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.259 
about the 200 pixel mark and also my
opacity<00:03:17.709> I'm<00:03:18.189> going<00:03:18.400> to<00:03:18.459> lower<00:03:18.669> this<00:03:18.849> down<00:03:18.909> to

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
opacity I'm going to lower this down to

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.520 
opacity I'm going to lower this down to
about<00:03:19.379> 20%<00:03:20.379> and<00:03:21.720> now<00:03:22.720> we<00:03:23.169> can<00:03:23.349> just

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
about 20% and now we can just

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.789 
about 20% and now we can just
selectively<00:03:24.720> burn<00:03:25.720> in<00:03:25.959> areas<00:03:26.889> here<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:29.500> don't

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
selectively burn in areas here and don't

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.369 
selectively burn in areas here and don't
worry<00:03:29.979> if<00:03:30.069> we<00:03:30.129> go<00:03:30.280> over<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.609> same<00:03:30.849> area<00:03:31.000> twice

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
worry if we go over the same area twice

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.749 
worry if we go over the same area twice
because<00:03:32.379> as<00:03:32.709> long<00:03:32.919> as<00:03:32.979> you<00:03:33.159> don't<00:03:33.340> lift<00:03:33.519> your

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:33.759 
because as long as you don't lift your

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:35.939 
because as long as you don't lift your
mouse<00:03:33.970> pointer<00:03:34.299> up<00:03:34.689> everything<00:03:35.620> will<00:03:35.769> be

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:35.949 
mouse pointer up everything will be

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:39.119 
mouse pointer up everything will be
restricted<00:03:36.699> to<00:03:36.729> a<00:03:36.849> 20%<00:03:37.239> increase<00:03:38.009> want<00:03:39.009> to

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
restricted to a 20% increase want to

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.699 
restricted to a 20% increase want to
lift<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.400> mouse<00:03:39.609> up<00:03:39.900> 20%<00:03:40.900> is<00:03:41.319> going<00:03:41.530> to<00:03:41.620> be

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
lift the mouse up 20% is going to be

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.890 
lift the mouse up 20% is going to be
applied<00:03:41.979> again<00:03:42.400> so<00:03:42.639> you<00:03:42.729> can<00:03:42.900> selectively

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
applied again so you can selectively

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.530 
applied again so you can selectively
build<00:03:44.650> up<00:03:44.859> the<00:03:45.069> area<00:03:45.489> and<00:03:48.030> let's<00:03:49.030> add<00:03:49.299> a<00:03:49.359> little

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
build up the area and let's add a little

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.759 
build up the area and let's add a little
bit<00:03:49.720> more<00:03:49.810> darkness<00:03:50.229> on<00:03:50.530> top<00:03:52.229> and<00:03:53.229> just<00:03:53.560> keep

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
bit more darkness on top and just keep

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.159 
bit more darkness on top and just keep
working<00:03:54.159> your<00:03:54.250> way<00:03:54.310> out<00:03:54.579> it<00:03:54.840> it<00:03:55.840> takes<00:03:56.019> a

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169 
working your way out it it takes a

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.719 
working your way out it it takes a
little<00:03:56.319> bit<00:03:56.469> of<00:03:56.560> practice<00:03:56.739> and<00:03:57.370> if<00:03:57.459> you<00:03:57.579> do

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:57.729 
little bit of practice and if you do

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:00.149 
little bit of practice and if you do
make<00:03:57.909> mistake<00:03:58.359> just<00:03:58.810> use<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.079> ctrl<00:03:59.500> +<00:03:59.680> Z<00:03:59.919> to

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 
make mistake just use the ctrl + Z to

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.059 
make mistake just use the ctrl + Z to
undo<00:04:01.019> and<00:04:02.019> I'm<00:04:02.139> going<00:04:02.290> to<00:04:02.349> add<00:04:02.530> a<00:04:02.590> little<00:04:02.919> bit

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
undo and I'm going to add a little bit

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.189 
undo and I'm going to add a little bit
more<00:04:03.099> darkness<00:04:04.409> to<00:04:05.409> those<00:04:06.000> days<00:04:07.000> here<00:04:07.359> and<00:04:08.079> I'm

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:08.199 
more darkness to those days here and I'm

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:10.770 
more darkness to those days here and I'm
using<00:04:08.319> a<00:04:08.500> Wacom<00:04:08.739> tablet<00:04:09.030> for<00:04:10.030> this<00:04:10.180> exercise

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
using a Wacom tablet for this exercise

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.649 
using a Wacom tablet for this exercise
here<00:04:11.169> and<00:04:11.500> it<00:04:11.949> really<00:04:12.609> does<00:04:12.819> make<00:04:13.030> life<00:04:13.060> a<00:04:13.539> lot

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:13.659 
here and it really does make life a lot

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:15.390 
here and it really does make life a lot
easier<00:04:13.719> now<00:04:14.439> if<00:04:14.560> I<00:04:14.650> want<00:04:14.919> to<00:04:15.009> actually

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
easier now if I want to actually

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.399 
easier now if I want to actually
increase<00:04:15.849> the<00:04:16.090> brush<00:04:16.269> size<00:04:16.329> there's<00:04:17.169> a<00:04:17.199> quick

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:17.409 
increase the brush size there's a quick

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:18.810 
increase the brush size there's a quick
way<00:04:17.560> of<00:04:17.590> doing<00:04:17.680> it<00:04:17.979> just<00:04:18.159> hold<00:04:18.370> down<00:04:18.519> the<00:04:18.669> Alt

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
way of doing it just hold down the Alt

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.930 
way of doing it just hold down the Alt
key<00:04:18.940> and<00:04:19.630> you<00:04:19.959> can<00:04:20.109> move<00:04:20.500> them<00:04:20.739> else<00:04:20.949> or<00:04:21.310> you

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
key and you can move them else or you

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.390 
key and you can move them else or you
point<00:04:22.210> it<00:04:22.330> up<00:04:22.570> and<00:04:22.810> down<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:23.349> that<00:04:24.279> will

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
point it up and down and that will

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.370 
point it up and down and that will
increase<00:04:24.760> or<00:04:24.969> decrease<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.419> brush<00:04:25.719> size

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
increase or decrease the brush size

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.380 
increase or decrease the brush size
accordingly<00:04:27.130> so<00:04:27.730> you<00:04:27.820> can<00:04:27.970> be<00:04:28.650> very<00:04:29.650> precise

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
accordingly so you can be very precise

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.820 
accordingly so you can be very precise
that<00:04:31.390> I'm<00:04:31.570> just<00:04:31.810> gonna<00:04:31.900> make<00:04:32.110> it<00:04:32.170> a<00:04:32.410> little<00:04:32.620> bit

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
that I'm just gonna make it a little bit

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.780 
that I'm just gonna make it a little bit
darker<00:04:33.370> on<00:04:34.080> this<00:04:35.310> reflection<00:04:36.310> in<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.640> water

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
darker on this reflection in the water

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.550 
darker on this reflection in the water
always<00:04:37.360> seems<00:04:37.690> to<00:04:37.750> be<00:04:37.840> a<00:04:37.930> little<00:04:38.080> bit<00:04:38.170> darker

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
always seems to be a little bit darker

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.210 
always seems to be a little bit darker
and<00:04:38.950> I<00:04:39.040> can<00:04:39.190> also<00:04:39.340> selectively<00:04:40.080> darkened<00:04:41.080> down

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.650 

areas<00:04:45.220> on<00:04:45.400> the<00:04:45.520> boat<00:04:45.700> I<00:04:48.210> just<00:04:49.210> put<00:04:49.450> a<00:04:49.480> little

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
areas on the boat I just put a little

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:56.040 
areas on the boat I just put a little
bit<00:04:49.840> more<00:04:51.150> darker<00:04:52.150> area<00:04:52.930> there<00:04:53.200> and<00:04:55.050> and

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
bit more darker area there and and

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.130 
bit more darker area there and and
that's<00:04:56.440> looking<00:04:56.740> quite<00:04:57.040> nice<00:04:57.220> here<00:04:57.570> if<00:04:58.570> I<00:04:58.840> want

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
that's looking quite nice here if I want

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.380 
that's looking quite nice here if I want
to<00:04:59.320> actually<00:04:59.470> light<00:05:00.010> up<00:05:00.040> areas<00:05:00.610> if<00:05:01.000> I<00:05:01.120> hold

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
to actually light up areas if I hold

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.670 
to actually light up areas if I hold
down<00:05:01.540> the<00:05:01.720> right<00:05:01.990> mouse<00:05:02.050> button<00:05:03.930> the<00:05:04.930> burn

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
down the right mouse button the burn

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.590 
down the right mouse button the burn
tool<00:05:05.980> now<00:05:06.190> becomes<00:05:06.550> the<00:05:06.760> Dodge<00:05:06.970> tool<00:05:07.330> so<00:05:07.570> we

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
tool now becomes the Dodge tool so we

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.300 
tool now becomes the Dodge tool so we
can<00:05:07.780> lighten<00:05:08.170> up<00:05:09.060> parts<00:05:10.060> of<00:05:10.150> the<00:05:10.240> boat<00:05:10.420> here

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
can lighten up parts of the boat here

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.910 
can lighten up parts of the boat here
and<00:05:12.310> I<00:05:12.370> think<00:05:12.610> that's<00:05:12.790> looking<00:05:13.180> ok<00:05:13.540> now<00:05:13.920> and

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
and I think that's looking ok now and

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.130 
and I think that's looking ok now and
now<00:05:15.760> we've<00:05:15.940> improved<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:16.540> overall<00:05:16.570> look<00:05:17.050> of

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
now we've improved the overall look of

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.230 
now we've improved the overall look of
the<00:05:17.200> picture<00:05:17.410> why<00:05:18.190> not<00:05:18.400> experiment<00:05:18.760> further

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
the picture why not experiment further

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.000 
the picture why not experiment further
and<00:05:19.600> have<00:05:19.900> a<00:05:19.930> look<00:05:20.140> at<00:05:20.230> some<00:05:20.440> of<00:05:20.470> the<00:05:20.620> special

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
and have a look at some of the special

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.280 
and have a look at some of the special
effects<00:05:21.430> found<00:05:21.610> in<00:05:21.790> Paint<00:05:22.060> Shop<00:05:22.120> Pro<00:05:22.270> and<00:05:22.840> one

effects found in Paint Shop Pro and one

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.560 
effects found in Paint Shop Pro and one

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
that's worth looking at is photo effects

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.650 
that's worth looking at is photo effects
time<00:05:26.320> machine<00:05:26.740> and<00:05:27.210> this<00:05:28.210> can<00:05:28.390> make<00:05:28.480> your

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
time machine and this can make your

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.720 
time machine and this can make your
photograph<00:05:29.080> look<00:05:29.350> like<00:05:29.800> it<00:05:29.950> was<00:05:30.070> taken<00:05:30.370> in<00:05:30.490> any

to 1960 and they're each worth

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:49.790 
to 1960 and they're each worth
experimenting<00:05:36.310> with
