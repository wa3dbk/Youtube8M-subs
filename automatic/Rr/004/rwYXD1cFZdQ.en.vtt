are<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:07.919> tablet<00:00:08.429> I<00:00:08.670> have<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.420> on<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.750> VI<00:00:09.900> 40

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
are a tablet I have the on the VI 40

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.640 
are a tablet I have the on the VI 40
tablet<00:00:10.679> here<00:00:11.240> that<00:00:12.240> really<00:00:12.480> needs<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.990> speed

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
tablet here that really needs to speed

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.010 
tablet here that really needs to speed
up<00:00:13.799> because<00:00:14.519> this<00:00:14.880> kind<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.330> slow<00:00:15.540> tablet

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
up because this kind of a slow tablet

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.800 
up because this kind of a slow tablet
now<00:00:16.770> it's<00:00:16.920> advertised<00:00:17.369> as<00:00:17.460> 1.5<00:00:18.000> gigahertz<00:00:18.270> but

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
now it's advertised as 1.5 gigahertz but

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.269 
now it's advertised as 1.5 gigahertz but
it's<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.050> it's<00:00:19.080> false<00:00:19.470> advertising<00:00:19.949> it's

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
it's a it's false advertising it's

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.769 
it's a it's false advertising it's
actually<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.609> 1<00:00:20.789> gigahertz<00:00:22.220> speed<00:00:23.240> so<00:00:24.240> how<00:00:24.720> you

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
actually a 1 gigahertz speed so how you

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.170 
actually a 1 gigahertz speed so how you
increase<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.769> make<00:00:25.949> your<00:00:26.130> tablet<00:00:26.640> faster

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
increase that to make your tablet faster

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.720 
increase that to make your tablet faster
or<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:27.960> decrease<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.380> save<00:00:29.160> battery<00:00:29.400> life

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
or you can decrease it save battery life

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.950 
or you can decrease it save battery life
if<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.000> want<00:00:32.120> you<00:00:33.120> know<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.450> go<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.719> the

called the voltage control now you don't

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.970 
called the voltage control now you don't
need<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:43.379> route<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.040> top<00:00:44.450> the<00:00:45.450> tablet<00:00:45.899> for<00:00:46.289> to

need to route this top the tablet for to
increase<00:00:47.570> your<00:00:48.570> megahertz<00:00:49.170> or<00:00:49.620> gigahertz<00:00:51.079> you

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
increase your megahertz or gigahertz you

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.139 
increase your megahertz or gigahertz you
just<00:00:52.350> get<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.649> app<00:00:52.829> but<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.550> problem<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:53.969> you

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
just get this app but the problem is you

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.540 
just get this app but the problem is you
cannot<00:00:54.449> go<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:55.050> once<00:00:55.469> suggest<00:00:55.770> going<00:00:55.920> up<00:00:56.100> over

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
cannot go I once suggest going up over

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.819 
cannot go I once suggest going up over
1.2<00:00:57.449> gigahertz<00:00:57.719> or<00:00:58.170> twelve<00:00:58.770> hundred

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
1.2 gigahertz or twelve hundred

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.470 
1.2 gigahertz or twelve hundred
megahertz<00:01:00.590> because<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:02.460> makes<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.149> top<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
megahertz because it makes the top the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.289 
megahertz because it makes the top the
crash<00:01:04.850> which<00:01:05.850> what<00:01:06.600> crashing<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:08.090> when<00:01:09.090> when

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
crash which what crashing is when when

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.450 
crash which what crashing is when when
this<00:01:09.390> tablet<00:01:09.720> crashes<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:10.770> restarts<00:01:11.340> and

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
this tablet crashes it just restarts and

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.160 
this tablet crashes it just restarts and
it<00:01:11.520> takes<00:01:11.670> about<00:01:11.790> two<00:01:12.210> minutes<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.540> restart<00:01:12.960> so

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
it takes about two minutes to restart so

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.800 
it takes about two minutes to restart so
don't<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.130> would<00:01:14.250> recommend<00:01:14.640> going<00:01:14.850> past<00:01:15.240> 1.2

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
don't I would recommend going past 1.2

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.300 
don't I would recommend going past 1.2
gigahertz<00:01:16.110> it's<00:01:16.680> not<00:01:16.799> very<00:01:17.009> safe<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.130> have

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
gigahertz it's not very safe so I have

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.219 
gigahertz it's not very safe so I have
mine<00:01:20.460> on<00:01:21.680> 1152<00:01:22.680> gigahertz<00:01:23.659> which<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.840> almost

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
mine on 1152 gigahertz which is almost

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.050 
mine on 1152 gigahertz which is almost
1.2<00:01:26.390> but<00:01:27.650> yeah<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.070> didn't<00:01:29.400> recognize<00:01:29.880> I

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
1.2 but yeah so I didn't recognize I

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.960 
1.2 but yeah so I didn't recognize I
didn't<00:01:30.240> realize<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.659> was<00:01:30.750> faster<00:01:31.140> or<00:01:31.439> notice

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
didn't realize it was faster or notice

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.170 
didn't realize it was faster or notice
but<00:01:32.970> then<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.210> went<00:01:33.390> down<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:34.400> 60<00:01:35.400> gigahertz<00:01:35.670> or

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
but then I went down to 60 gigahertz or

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.100 
but then I went down to 60 gigahertz or
megahertz<00:01:36.810> sorry<00:01:38.090> and<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.180> was<00:01:39.299> really<00:01:39.630> slow<00:01:40.079> I

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
megahertz sorry and it was really slow I

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.440 
megahertz sorry and it was really slow I
mean<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.530> had<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.710> I'd<00:01:41.189> took<00:01:41.640> me<00:01:41.820> 5<00:01:42.030> minutes<00:01:42.240> to

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
mean I had to I'd took me 5 minutes to

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.510 
mean I had to I'd took me 5 minutes to
put<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.259> back<00:01:43.549> to<00:01:44.549> normal<00:01:45.409> because<00:01:46.409> simply<00:01:47.280> so

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
put it back to normal because simply so

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.429 
put it back to normal because simply so
slow<00:01:48.740> so<00:01:49.740> yeah<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.340> definitely<00:01:50.490> works<00:01:51.439> and

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
slow so yeah it definitely works and

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.080 
slow so yeah it definitely works and
it's<00:01:52.590> simple<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.950> install<00:01:53.100> just<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.700> get<00:01:53.820> from

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
it's simple to install just to get from

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.649 
it's simple to install just to get from
the<00:01:54.240> app<00:01:54.450> store<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.530> Google<00:01:55.799> Play<00:01:55.950> Store

and yeah it's just downloaded there and
a<00:02:00.950> little<00:02:01.950> simple<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:03.090> how<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.299> control

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
a little simple and so how you control

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.910 
a little simple and so how you control
it<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.170> just<00:02:04.729> hate<00:02:05.729> says<00:02:05.939> minimum<00:02:06.329> maximum

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
it is you just hate says minimum maximum

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.000 
it is you just hate says minimum maximum
so<00:02:08.090> mine<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.239> set<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.509> 1<00:02:10.099> 1152

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
so mine is set of 1 1152

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.110 
so mine is set of 1 1152
so<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.100> yeah<00:02:13.310> that's<00:02:13.520> how<00:02:13.670> you<00:02:13.730> change<00:02:13.880> it<00:02:14.090> you
