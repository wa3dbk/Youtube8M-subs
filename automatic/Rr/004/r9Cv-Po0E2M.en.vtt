00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.820
 electric of the renault group and the first 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.080
 don't respond but by car but it's a motorcycle 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.630
 forgotten air-conditioned cockpits and 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.369
 luxurious finishes the twizy stands as 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.740
 four- wheeled alternative of one 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.930
 scooter is open on the sides with the 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.439
 closed roof moon air conditioner o 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.439
 heating 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.340
 the seemingly trivial question in 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.340
 reality has its own logic 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:41.420
 flying patrician who commanded for water 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.250
 but also two seats one behind the other e 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.090
 it has no lateral protection of the 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.950
 external elements 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.530
 the crisis is driven absolutely like 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.329
 a car rather than reactions that 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.100
 has make it very pleasant to drive 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.039
 whereas it weighs very little 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.800
 we only talk about just over 300 pounds and 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:00.140
 which has four-wheel drive 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.489
 which allows it to always slide 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.620
 in maximum security 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.840
 the cue is good allows to follow 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.180
 normally the traffic also the 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.320
 departure of traffic lights in the avenues 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.600
 peripheral 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.490
 It is obvious that to get a minimum of 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.500
 performance you have to sink a little 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.020
 more see acceleration at the expense 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.539
 autonomy 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.619
 the brakes are very good you have to do it 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:22.780
 a moment a habit above all 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.850
 because four rather powerful discs 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.560
 they have no servant assistance for which 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.079
 you have to crush a little more 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.399
 compared to what you get used to overcome 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.770
 the brake to reach the maximum 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:35.259
 efficiency details the belts of 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.360
 front security two are one 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.250
 normal other points and should be used in 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.630
 compliment with another that offers a 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.340
 additional anchor point e 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.890
 guarantees the immobility of the body in 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.630
 any case on the back seat anymore 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.329
 a normal one in the passenger compartment 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.640
 belt other points on gennari exist 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:54.220
 two holes to drain any water 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.560
 that should enter in case of rain 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.450
 door opening protected by 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.060
 plÃ¡sticas allows to visualize 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.770
 I had to go to the fender and then 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.450
 they had no idea where the 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.009
 width of the car 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.860
 the dashboard from twizy is rather 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.190
 simple and encloses around the place of 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.380
 guide 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.510
 all the equipment and all the 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.069
 control buttons at the extreme 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.450
 left 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.299
 we have the four arrow button 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.510
 to follow we have the two buttons of 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:25.239
 drive management with the drive 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.970
 neutral then lnd of the mad and the era of 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.790
 reverse then of reverse gear 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.340
 the two levers behind the wheel allow us to 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.799
 command with the one on the left 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.889
 access to switching off the headlights and the 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.630
 horn and buzzer to activate a 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:43.180
 low speed in urban centers for 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.849
 make sure that pedestrians hear 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.280
 approach by electric car with the 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:51.310
 lever on the right we can instead manage the 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.940
 windshield wipers defroster 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.209
 windshield and on-board computer 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.079
 through the steering wheel it is possible to see 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.480
 dell'ics that contains all the 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.160
 instrumentation gives us the percentage of 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.799
 recharge at the time the 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.970
 car is charging or otherwise 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:11.290
 operating conditions 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.569
 gives me cloning but is behind mine 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.040
 the state of charge of the batteries e 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.840
 all to those little information that 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.340
 I need to better manage the 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.540
 electric vehicle must be done 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.700
 be careful at the time you decide 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.980
 wanting to start because in reality 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.140
 the glance immediately falls on 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.549
 a lock hunts on the dashboard but 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.069
 which serves to open the drawer 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.470
 hold the lock for 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.540
 starting is attached to the steering column 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.159
 of the steering 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.980
 the charging compartment with the cable a 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:40.629
 spiral placed on the standard snout a 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.720
 pair of adapters that allow to 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:44.829
 connect to different types of sockets 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.840
 through a normal grip 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.879
 maid with a 3 kilowatt line 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.379
 it goes from 0 to one hundred percent of 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.379
 charge in three and a half hours
