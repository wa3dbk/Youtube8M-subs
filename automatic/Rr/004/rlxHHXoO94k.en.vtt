00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.879
 hi everyone today must be like 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.330
 get root permissions on lg gip 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.570
 all 8.3 with the new update 4 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.170
 against 4 point two goodies then for 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.619
 First we need to enable USB debugging 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.449
 how do we go in the settings 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.810
 of the device 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.140
 there are developer options here if not 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.750
 you have activated it just go up 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:35.300
 tablet information settings on 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.550
 software is up I do not know if you see well 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.040
 software information and type falls 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.300
 lots of times on a bull type number 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.270
 here this thing will appear here ok 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.300
 we ask and select this thing here 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.760
 usb of the bug and very important that 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.730
 they select after this is enough 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:02.760
 connect the device via the cable 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:10.890
 usb as it starts to connect it and it 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:13.350
 we connect to the PC, here we are on the computer 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.240
 but what you must do in the meantime this 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.659
 close to anything so we do not need 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.880
 closed and let's go into my description 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.860
 you will find seeing that you will download 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:32.060
 this file will speak with power 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:33.020
 here is we wait a few seconds after we 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.500
 companions I saw phone 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.680
 let's go over this file to the area that 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.460
 I 'm not at nothing on the table we click 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:47.120
 shift and right click and click on 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.729
 opens a command window here we have 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:55.510
 open then here we write the following 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.510
 commands then adb device 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.590
 ok 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.280
 on the table and something will appear 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.229
 so you just want it selected which it is 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.350
 very important that you do it if you do not 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:14.350
 the following command works is the following 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.350
 adv 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.150
 The agents 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.480
 right now our tablet is 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.480
 going as recovery is going 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.980
 we are in shelters and now I do 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:42.459
 see the recovery wait for the parties 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.459
 polito 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.850
 as you can see we are in the recovery bike e 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:53.310
 of the tablet 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.960
 let's select ap abdul hadi b 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.530
 as usual we move with the 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.900
 low volume down and high volume up 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:09.300
 and with ignition key we select 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:12.740
 then power button done to this 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.360
 point we return to the computer 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:24.530
 here we are on the computer and we go with 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:24.530
 the last cody with the last alibi command 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.560
 who can not 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.830
 all 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.720
 point g 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.870
 above if you see above I am 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:47.400
 wrong then the last command is 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:53.880
 used the lot of the higher end websites kk 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:59.690
 step ruth account zip enter we have 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:02.970
 finished however you have seen that it was 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.820
 fast so let's go to the 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.950
 Tablet 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:11.990
 here we are on the tablet again 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.880
 see how you see there appears ruth 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.950
 we installed rue we got 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.560
 the broken and the last first thing to 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.200
 make and buzzi sternheim is enough 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.450
 select the power button e 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:30.270
 we were able to get the permits from 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:34.320
 root on the new update 4.4.2 which 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:37.410
 before it was much simpler to 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:41.340
 make this light because it was enough 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.560
 just a little program with the 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.490
 programmino did everything automatically 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:53.940
 now it's a bit more complicated and in any case there is 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:59.010
 I do not recommend installing various roms 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:02.700
 things because I honestly don't know I don't know 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:05.660
 if it has a key combination for 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.660
 go to shelters 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.840
 therefore it is better to avoid installing several 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:16.140
 tom various things I know what you want 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.460
 do as we do to see if we have the 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.990
 root permissions 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.630
 just go to 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.800
 on super sua see if it opens 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:27.060
 the sky app opens up so there 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.910
 are problems 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:35.480
 he also went on a crime even on ruth 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.480
 look for the basic 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:43.470
 here is what's on your device 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:47.850
 access to ruth don't be scared if for 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:50.460
 example the first time there appears the 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.530
 red try again 2,000 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.950
 two thousand times because you saw in the 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.900
 message in recovery moccia said 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.630
 I said and ruth so we have three 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:03.240
 months so don't get scared and see 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.830
 if you open up super if we ve opened 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.510
 even the application under the 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.520
 his means a hit went wrong and 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:12.090
 so we recommend repeating the 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:17.130
 proceeding was all I want to apologize for 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:19.170
 if something of the video went wrong and there 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.580
 we see the pressure and next time 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.580
 Hi everyone
