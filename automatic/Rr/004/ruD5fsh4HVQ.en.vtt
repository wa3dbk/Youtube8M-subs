really<00:00:56.340> cool<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.670> then<00:00:57.059> figured<00:00:57.480> out<00:00:57.629> how<00:00:57.809> to

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
really cool and then figured out how to

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.779 
really cool and then figured out how to
put<00:00:58.079> all<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.289> parts<00:00:58.440> inside<00:00:58.920> rather<00:00:59.640> than

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
put all the parts inside rather than

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.340 
put all the parts inside rather than
maybe<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.180> other<00:01:00.329> way<00:01:00.480> around<00:01:00.600> which<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.199> how

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
maybe the other way around which is how

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.599 
maybe the other way around which is how
you<00:01:01.410> get<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.649> lot<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.829> sort<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.100> generic
