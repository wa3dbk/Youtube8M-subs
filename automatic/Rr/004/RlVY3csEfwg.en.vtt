absolutely as you know Dave I had a
previous<00:01:15.440> generation<00:01:15.680> bandit<00:01:16.490> for<00:01:16.729> many

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
previous generation bandit for many

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.499 
previous generation bandit for many
years<00:01:17.600> and<00:01:17.869> I<00:01:18.350> was<00:01:18.500> very<00:01:18.680> curious<00:01:19.250> to<00:01:19.490> try<00:01:20.300> out

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
years and I was very curious to try out

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.899 
years and I was very curious to try out
the<00:01:20.660> new<00:01:21.080> band<00:01:21.350> at<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:21.590> liquid-cooled<00:01:22.040> where

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
the new band at the liquid-cooled where

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.630 
the new band at the liquid-cooled where
are<00:01:23.000> we<00:01:23.090> going<00:01:23.270> to<00:01:23.330> start<00:01:24.100> well<00:01:25.100> let's<00:01:25.340> start

no<00:01:29.479> replacement<00:01:29.900> for<00:01:30.350> displacement<00:01:30.530> right

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
no replacement for displacement right

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.820 
no replacement for displacement right
and<00:01:31.490> they<00:01:31.610> went<00:01:32.060> bigger<00:01:32.300> again<00:01:32.690> well<00:01:33.470> the

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
absolute did they went to 1,250 5 cubic

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.100 
absolute did they went to 1,250 5 cubic
centimeters<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:38.060> motor<00:01:38.240> is<00:01:38.360> entirely

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
centimeters and the motor is entirely

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.040 
centimeters and the motor is entirely
new<00:01:39.530> right<00:01:40.190> but<00:01:40.520> even<00:01:40.789> though<00:01:40.910> it's<00:01:41.119> a<00:01:41.180> 12:55

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
new right but even though it's a 12:55

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.990 
new right but even though it's a 12:55
it's<00:01:42.470> a<00:01:42.619> very<00:01:42.890> compact<00:01:43.460> motor

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
it's a very compact motor

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.840 
it's a very compact motor
yes<00:01:44.360> it's<00:01:44.630> smaller<00:01:44.899> dimensions<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:45.850> it

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
yes it's smaller dimensions and it

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.969 
yes it's smaller dimensions and it
actually<00:01:47.240> feels<00:01:47.509> like<00:01:47.660> you're<00:01:47.929> riding<00:01:48.140> a<00:01:48.350> 900

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
actually feels like you're riding a 900

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.550 
actually feels like you're riding a 900
but<00:01:49.610> with<00:01:49.789> a<00:01:49.820> lot<00:01:50.060> more<00:01:50.240> torque<00:01:50.899> and<00:01:51.170> power<00:01:51.200> of

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
but with a lot more torque and power of

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.480 
but with a lot more torque and power of
course<00:01:51.830> yeah

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
course yeah

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.830

so really the only thing that's the same
in<00:01:54.170> this<00:01:54.289> motorcycle<00:01:54.619> is<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.160> wheelbase

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
in this motorcycle is the wheelbase

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.240 
in this motorcycle is the wheelbase
everything<00:01:56.630> else<00:01:56.780> is<00:01:57.050> brand<00:01:57.500> new<00:01:57.619> for<00:01:57.740> for

the Bandit over to my friends at Pro 6
cycle<00:02:05.450> in<00:02:05.659> Toronto<00:02:06.320> and<00:02:06.799> they<00:02:06.890> put<00:02:07.070> on<00:02:07.159> the

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.660 
cycle in Toronto and they put on the
dyno<00:02:07.460> mm-hmm<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:08.329> I<00:02:09.079> got<00:02:09.350> almost<00:02:10.130> 85

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
dyno mm-hmm and I got almost 85

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.960 
dyno mm-hmm and I got almost 85
foot-pounds<00:02:11.390> of<00:02:11.480> torque<00:02:11.540> and<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:13.370> hundred<00:02:13.880> and

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
foot-pounds of torque and a hundred and

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.690 
foot-pounds of torque and a hundred and
five<00:02:14.290> horsepower<00:02:15.290> now<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.310> thought<00:02:16.489> I<00:02:16.549> was

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
five horsepower now I thought I was

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.340 
five horsepower now I thought I was
going<00:02:16.820> to<00:02:16.880> be<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:17.090> little<00:02:17.390> bit<00:02:17.540> more<00:02:17.780> in<00:02:18.049> the

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
going to be a little bit more in the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.690 
going to be a little bit more in the
horsepower<00:02:18.680> department<00:02:19.130> cause<00:02:19.220> it<00:02:19.340> feels

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
horsepower department cause it feels

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.640 
horsepower department cause it feels
like<00:02:19.940> so<00:02:20.150> much<00:02:20.299> more<00:02:20.570> right<00:02:20.989> it<00:02:21.110> really<00:02:21.290> has<00:02:21.620> a

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
like so much more right it really has a

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.640 
like so much more right it really has a
kick<00:02:22.160> in<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.370> ass<00:02:22.579> from<00:02:23.570> very<00:02:23.840> low<00:02:24.049> rpm<00:02:24.530> I

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
kick in the ass from very low rpm I

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.900 
kick in the ass from very low rpm I
think<00:02:24.860> it<00:02:24.950> reaches<00:02:25.480> 105<00:02:26.480> horsepower<00:02:27.140> at<00:02:27.410> 30

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
think it reaches 105 horsepower at 30

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.650 
think it reaches 105 horsepower at 30
750<00:02:28.910> rpm<00:02:29.060> which<00:02:29.510> is<00:02:29.660> just<00:02:29.840> amazing<00:02:29.989> yeah<00:02:30.920> and

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
750 rpm which is just amazing yeah and

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.600 
750 rpm which is just amazing yeah and
so<00:02:32.660> on<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.019> street<00:02:33.320> it<00:02:33.799> just<00:02:34.010> pulls<00:02:34.280> from<00:02:34.459> any

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
so on the street it just pulls from any

so on the street it just pulls from any
gear<00:02:34.880> doesn't<00:02:35.090> matter<00:02:35.329> if<00:02:35.420> you're<00:02:35.510> in<00:02:35.540> sixth

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
gear or 1st gear it just pulls from

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.600 
gear or 1st gear it just pulls from
