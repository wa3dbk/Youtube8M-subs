 Translator: Mahmoud Aghiorly Checker: Ayd Asraf 

00:00:14.065 --> 00:00:16.742
 What is the center of the universe? 

00:00:16.742 --> 00:00:18.078
 It is a fundamental issue 

00:00:18.078 --> 00:00:21.164
 People have been wondering about it for centuries. 

00:00:21.164 --> 00:00:22.971
 But the search for an answer 

00:00:22.971 --> 00:00:24.430
 It began strangely 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.553
 If you want to know the answer to this question you have to go back 

00:00:26.553 --> 00:00:28.874
 To the third century BC in Greece, 

00:00:28.874 --> 00:00:30.423
 The answers then depended on looking up into the night sky 

00:00:30.423 --> 00:00:32.094
 And trust what you see. 

00:00:32.094 --> 00:00:33.428
 This is what Aristotle did, 

00:00:33.428 --> 00:00:35.878
 That man then did it 

00:00:35.878 --> 00:00:38.097
 He believed that it was stated that, considering that we are on the surface of the earth and we can look up 

00:00:38.097 --> 00:00:40.056
 We should be in the center, right? 

00:00:40.056 --> 00:00:41.900
 For him, world wide 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.654
 It consisted of four elements: 

00:00:43.654 --> 00:00:44.069
 Earth, 

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.521
 Water, 

00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:44.988
 Air, 

00:00:44.988 --> 00:00:46.189
 And fire. 

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:48.441
 These elements become intertwined with a group problem 

00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:50.803
 Of the hard crystalline "spheres" 

00:00:50.803 --> 00:00:53.322
 Every star and planet is in heaven 

00:00:53.322 --> 00:00:55.199
 He had his own crystalline "sphere" cover 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.660
 The rest of the universe and all the stars 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.869
 Located in the last Crystal "sphere" atmosphere. 

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:01.788
 If you are who is watching the sky continuously 

00:01:01.788 --> 00:01:03.614
 You will notice that this idea is properly explained and justified 

00:01:03.614 --> 00:01:05.916
 The movement of objects that you see in the sky 

00:01:05.916 --> 00:01:08.001
 For centuries this idea was prevalent in Europe 

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:11.186
 And the Islamic world towards the universe 

00:01:11.186 --> 00:01:13.992
 But in 1543, a man named Copernicus 

00:01:13.992 --> 00:01:16.002
 Suggest a different model. 

00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:17.275
 He believed that the sun 

00:01:17.275 --> 00:01:19.525
 Is the center of the universe. 

00:01:19.525 --> 00:01:21.099
 This new idea radically altered previous beliefs 

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:23.487
 It was hard for many people to accept 

00:01:23.487 --> 00:01:25.645
 For in the end Aristotle's ideas were logical to many 

00:01:25.645 --> 00:01:26.899
 Because she sees the naked eye 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.984
 The abstract eye was then the basis for scientific observation and follow-up 

00:01:28.984 --> 00:01:30.905
 But a series of subsequent discoveries 

00:01:30.905 --> 00:01:34.668
 The idea of ​​a central model made the sun difficult to ignore. 

00:01:34.668 --> 00:01:36.739
 The beginning was noted by Johannes Kepler 

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:39.585
 The orbits are not circles or perfect curves 

00:01:39.585 --> 00:01:41.504
 Galileo then discovered through the telescope 

00:01:41.504 --> 00:01:43.511
 That Jupiter has moons orbiting it 

00:01:43.511 --> 00:01:45.414
 Completely ignoring the planet. 

00:01:45.414 --> 00:01:48.752
 Newton then proposed the theory of universal gravity, 

00:01:48.752 --> 00:01:52.178
 Which provided for a common attraction between all elements 

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:54.151
 So eventually we had to give up the idea 

00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:57.154
 That our planet is the center of the universe. 

00:01:57.154 --> 00:01:59.851
 Shortly after Copernicus, in 1580, 

00:01:59.851 --> 00:02:02.098
 An Italian monk, Giordano Bruno, 

00:02:02.098 --> 00:02:03.808
 He referred to the universe as an independent cosmos 

00:02:03.808 --> 00:02:05.602
 It has its own planets 

00:02:05.602 --> 00:02:08.705
 And that the universe is infinite 

00:02:08.705 --> 00:02:10.933
 Human society has not accepted the idea 

00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:14.527
 Bruno was burned because of that strange sign 

00:02:14.527 --> 00:02:17.404
 Centuries later, the philosopher Rene Descartes 

00:02:17.404 --> 00:02:20.407
 He pointed out that the universe is a series of swirls, 

00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:21.824
 Which he called circular cones 

00:02:21.824 --> 00:02:25.283
 He said that each star is located in the middle of a cone 

00:02:25.283 --> 00:02:28.041
 At the same time, mankind realized that there was an enormous number of stars 

00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:30.332
 Much more than Aristotle had dreamed. 

00:02:30.332 --> 00:02:32.323
 And astronomers like William Herschel 

00:02:32.323 --> 00:02:34.464
 Who have been able to use more advanced telescopes, 

00:02:34.464 --> 00:02:36.570
 It became clear to us that the sun actually 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.017
 Is just one of the many stars in Milky Way. 

00:02:40.017 --> 00:02:42.272
 These bright clusters that we see in the sky at night 

00:02:42.272 --> 00:02:43.616
 Are actually other galaxies 

00:02:43.616 --> 00:02:46.104
 It is as vast as the Milky Way 

00:02:46.104 --> 00:02:50.022
 Perhaps we are far from the center of the universe much more than we imagine 

00:02:50.022 --> 00:02:53.000
 In the 1920s, astronomers studying at Nepoli 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.485
 They wanted to know how galaxies moved 

00:02:55.485 --> 00:02:56.694
 Based on the Doppler effect, 

00:02:56.694 --> 00:02:58.489
 Expect to see a blue shift 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.032
 For objects moving towards the ground 

00:03:00.032 --> 00:03:02.662
 And a red twist to those that move away from them. 

00:03:02.662 --> 00:03:05.375
 But all they saw was the red switch. 

00:03:05.375 --> 00:03:08.282
 Everything was moving away from us very quickly 

00:03:08.282 --> 00:03:10.625
 This discovery is one of the evidence that is in the interest of 

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:13.604
 What we call today the Big Bang theory. 

00:03:13.604 --> 00:03:14.796
 According to this theory, 

00:03:14.796 --> 00:03:16.152
 All the blocks in the universe 

00:03:16.152 --> 00:03:20.005
 Was essentially one element of infinite intensity 

00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:21.854
 Within this context, the universe we live in now 

00:03:21.854 --> 00:03:23.727
 It was once before the explosion in the center. 

00:03:23.727 --> 00:03:26.688
 But this theory essentially eliminates the idea of ​​a center of the universe 

00:03:26.688 --> 00:03:30.079
 There can be no center for an infinite universe! 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.149
 The big explosion was not just an explosion in space; 

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:36.370
 It is an explosion in space, area and size 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.116
 Every new discovery confirms to us 

00:03:38.116 --> 00:03:40.615
 That whenever our ability to observe is limited, 

00:03:40.615 --> 00:03:42.628
 Our ability to predict and dream 

00:03:42.628 --> 00:03:44.598
 For what is absent from us is far from it. 

00:03:44.598 --> 00:03:47.745
 What we know today and who believe in it can change tomorrow 

00:03:47.745 --> 00:03:49.914
 As we have already pointed out to the great thinkers 

00:03:49.914 --> 00:03:52.195
 We can sometimes realize that our fantasies and expectations are extreme 

00:03:52.195 --> 00:03:54.592
 Can lead us to wonderful and convincing answers later on 

00:03:54.592 --> 00:03:58.512
 These expectations and answers will always push us to more puzzling questions.
