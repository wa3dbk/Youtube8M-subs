00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
of august we're in the grain store here

of august we're in the grain store here
back<00:00:11.099> at<00:00:11.250> middle<00:00:11.550> barn<00:00:11.759> farms<00:00:12.360> this<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.750> a

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
back at middle barn farms this is a

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.180 
back at middle barn farms this is a
store<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:13.170> was<00:00:13.469> put<00:00:13.710> up<00:00:13.860> in<00:00:15.080> 2008<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.379> it

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
store that was put up in 2008 and it

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.340 
store that was put up in 2008 and it
holds<00:00:17.340> about<00:00:17.609> 1,800<00:00:18.390> tons<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.810> weeks<00:00:19.080> when

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
holds about 1,800 tons of weeks when

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.380 
holds about 1,800 tons of weeks when
it's<00:00:19.560> completely<00:00:20.400> full<00:00:20.640> so<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.060> all<00:00:21.300> the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
it's completely full so this is all the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.349 
it's completely full so this is all the
galant<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.900> we've<00:00:22.020> harvested<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:22.800> far<00:00:23.359> it

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
galant that we've harvested so far it

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.050 
galant that we've harvested so far it
goes<00:00:24.600> into<00:00:24.840> one<00:00:25.170> big<00:00:25.439> pile<00:00:25.890> basically<00:00:26.670> so

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
goes into one big pile basically so

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.050 
goes into one big pile basically so
there's<00:00:28.070> probably<00:00:29.070> getting<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.490> for<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.820> nine

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
there's probably getting on for a nine

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.540 
there's probably getting on for a nine
hundred<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.570> thousand<00:00:31.080> tons<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.529> wheat<00:00:32.489> in

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
hundred to a thousand tons of wheat in

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.540 
hundred to a thousand tons of wheat in
here<00:00:33.500> as<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.680> can<00:00:34.710> see<00:00:34.890> there's<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.280> little<00:00:35.309> bit

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
here as you can see there's a little bit

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.729 
here as you can see there's a little bit
of<00:00:35.610> chap<00:00:35.910> just<00:00:36.210> on<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.540> top<00:00:36.750> but<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.469> tends

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
of chap just on the top but that tends

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.619 
of chap just on the top but that tends
to<00:00:37.950> rise<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.000> top<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.420> pile

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
to rise to this to the top of the pile

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.119 
to rise to this to the top of the pile
anyway<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.079> we're<00:00:40.410> not<00:00:40.530> too<00:00:40.739> worried<00:00:41.070> about

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
anyway so we're not too worried about

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.470 
anyway so we're not too worried about
that<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:42.440> the<00:00:43.440> quality<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.040> grain<00:00:44.480> quite

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
that and the quality of the grain quite

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.770 
that and the quality of the grain quite
pleased<00:00:45.870> with<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.550> it<00:00:47.550> really<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.059> down<00:00:48.329> here

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
pleased with it it really is down here

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.369 
pleased with it it really is down here
and<00:00:51.920> nice<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.190> dark<00:00:53.690> it's<00:00:54.690> got<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.930> very<00:00:55.140> high

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
and nice and dark it's got a very high

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.170 
and nice and dark it's got a very high
bushel<00:00:55.829> way<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.129> year<00:00:56.280> specific<00:00:56.760> weight<00:00:56.940> so

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
bushel way this year specific weight so

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.779 
bushel way this year specific weight so
brain<00:00:57.960> for<00:00:58.199> grain<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:58.590> actually<00:00:58.980> quite<00:00:59.670> a

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
brain for grain it's actually quite a

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.360 
brain for grain it's actually quite a
heavy<00:01:00.180> grain<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.870> year<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.379> hopefully<00:01:01.920> when

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
heavy grain this year so hopefully when

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.889 
heavy grain this year so hopefully when
we<00:01:02.399> come<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.789> load<00:01:02.969> lorries<00:01:03.359> will<00:01:03.539> be<00:01:03.660> putting

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
we come to load lorries will be putting

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.910 
we come to load lorries will be putting
slightly<00:01:04.530> less<00:01:06.110> bucket<00:01:07.110> loads<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.500> each<00:01:07.650> lorry

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
slightly less bucket loads in each lorry

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.289 
slightly less bucket loads in each lorry
which<00:01:08.130> will<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.460> help<00:01:08.610> with<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.850> tonnage<00:01:09.180> a

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
which will just help with the tonnage a

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.560 
which will just help with the tonnage a
little<00:01:09.570> bit<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.500> we'll<00:01:11.010> sort<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.430> out<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.909> bit

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
little bit and we'll sort that out a bit

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.890 
little bit and we'll sort that out a bit
later<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:13.010> these<00:01:14.090> tubes<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.509> can<00:01:15.689> see

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
later on these tubes that you can see

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.960 
later on these tubes that you can see
sticking<00:01:16.320> out<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.950> grain<00:01:17.220> they're

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
sticking out of the grain they're

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.440 
sticking out of the grain they're
actually<00:01:18.600> cooling<00:01:19.320> towers<00:01:20.180> it's<00:01:21.180> called<00:01:21.360> a

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
actually cooling towers it's called a

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.140 
actually cooling towers it's called a
pedestal<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.369> what<00:01:23.369> happens<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.880> there<00:01:24.090> are

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
pedestal and what happens is there are

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.120 
pedestal and what happens is there are
little<00:01:24.270> vents<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.960> little<00:01:25.350> holes<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
little vents a little holes in the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.819 
little vents a little holes in the
bottom<00:01:26.280> wide<00:01:26.700> bit<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.390> tube<00:01:27.659> there<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.350> at

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
bottom wide bit of the tube there and at

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.819 
bottom wide bit of the tube there and at
the<00:01:28.950> top<00:01:29.250> we'll<00:01:29.820> stick<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> fan<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.470> it'll<00:01:31.740> have

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
the top we'll stick a fan and it'll have

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.440 
the top we'll stick a fan and it'll have
a<00:01:31.860> temperature<00:01:32.310> probe<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.909> sits<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.329> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
a temperature probe that sits in the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.380 
a temperature probe that sits in the
weeds

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
weeds

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.810 
weeds
and<00:01:34.510> it<00:01:35.290> also<00:01:35.470> measures<00:01:35.860> the<00:01:36.159> air<00:01:36.370> temperature

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
and it also measures the air temperature

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.820 
and it also measures the air temperature
within<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.420> store<00:01:37.720> and<00:01:38.409> when<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:38.710> air

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
within the store and when the air

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.640 
within the store and when the air
temperature<00:01:38.860> is<00:01:39.640> five<00:01:40.000> degrees<00:01:40.450> or<00:01:41.320> six

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
temperature is five degrees or six

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.260 
temperature is five degrees or six
degrees<00:01:42.040> depending<00:01:42.310> on<00:01:42.520> how<00:01:42.670> we<00:01:42.729> set<00:01:43.060> it

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
degrees depending on how we set it

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.930 
degrees depending on how we set it
cooler<00:01:43.960> than<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.470> grain<00:01:44.740> then<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:45.400> fans<00:01:45.700> will

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
cooler than the grain then the fans will

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.390 
cooler than the grain then the fans will
actually<00:01:46.450> start<00:01:46.780> up<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.650> idea<00:01:47.979> is<00:01:48.040> that<00:01:48.190> we

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
actually start up the idea is that we

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.850 
actually start up the idea is that we
want<00:01:48.490> to<00:01:48.610> call<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.030> brain<00:01:49.240> down<00:01:49.540> to<00:01:49.960> somewhere

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
want to call the brain down to somewhere

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.060 
want to call the brain down to somewhere
between<00:01:51.100> five<00:01:51.550> and<00:01:51.580> ten<00:01:52.030> degrees<00:01:52.450> Celsius<00:01:53.200> so

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
between five and ten degrees Celsius so

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.120 
between five and ten degrees Celsius so
that<00:01:54.310> we<00:01:54.759> don't<00:01:55.000> get<00:01:55.300> bugs<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:56.470> insects

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
that we don't get bugs and insects

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.060 
that we don't get bugs and insects
living<00:01:57.670> in<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:58.000> grain<00:01:58.470> which<00:01:59.470> we<00:01:59.650> definitely

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
living in the grain which we definitely

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.649
