00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
at the tank there's a little bit of

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.470 
at the tank there's a little bit of
residue<00:00:40.190> the<00:00:41.190> overflow<00:00:41.700> box<00:00:41.969> kind<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.360> has

residue the overflow box kind of has
this<00:00:42.629> weird<00:00:42.840> texture<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.010> really

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
this weird texture to it so it really

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.580 
this weird texture to it so it really
holds<00:00:44.489> on<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.910> things<00:00:45.149> but<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.170> doesn't<00:00:46.469> look

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
holds on to things but it doesn't look

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.040 
holds on to things but it doesn't look
too<00:00:46.800> bad<00:00:46.910> a<00:00:47.910> little<00:00:48.270> bit<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.539> residue<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
too bad a little bit of residue in the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.430 
too bad a little bit of residue in the
bottom<00:00:49.340> from<00:00:50.340> evaporation<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.300> had<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.170> metal

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
bottom from evaporation I had the metal

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.160 
bottom from evaporation I had the metal
halides<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:54.329> took<00:00:54.660> care<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:54.930> that

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
halides on and it took care of that

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.810 
halides on and it took care of that
pretty<00:00:55.620> quick<00:00:56.570> moving<00:00:57.570> down<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.020> sump<00:00:58.820> I'm

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
and you would think that these were

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.560 
and you would think that these were
straight<00:01:10.080> out<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.409> box<00:01:10.619> no<00:01:11.159> lie<00:01:11.570> very

as<00:02:05.840> well<00:02:06.840> as<00:02:07.280> kind<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.340> reduce<00:02:08.789> some

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
as well as kind of reduce some

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.170 
as well as kind of reduce some
vibrations<00:02:09.599> from<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.410> pumps<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:10.979> such

vibrations from the pumps and such
so<00:02:13.019> here's<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.319> stomping<00:02:13.709> just<00:02:14.010> see<00:02:14.159> it<00:02:14.280> it

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
so here's the stomping just see it it

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
over here you see the quick disconnect

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.509 
over here you see the quick disconnect
that<00:02:20.489> I<00:02:20.549> made<00:02:20.790> with<00:02:20.819> that<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:22.290> know<00:02:22.409> one<00:02:23.370> inch

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
paper before I actually mount it in so I

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.009

I'm trying to figure out what to do with

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.039 
I'm trying to figure out what to do with
they're<00:03:22.919> pretty<00:03:23.159> big<00:03:23.310> pretty<00:03:23.370> heavy<00:03:24.049> prob

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
they're pretty big pretty heavy prob

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.469 
they're pretty big pretty heavy prob
about<00:03:25.260> 25<00:03:25.709> pounds<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.250> pop<00:03:26.430> on<00:03:27.120> each<00:03:27.269> one<00:03:27.449> of

about 25 pounds of pop on each one of

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:30.860 
about 25 pounds of pop on each one of
those<00:03:28.099> so<00:03:29.389> trying<00:03:30.389> to<00:03:30.419> figure<00:03:30.599> out<00:03:30.629> a<00:03:30.720> way<00:03:30.810> to

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
those so trying to figure out a way to

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.539 
those so trying to figure out a way to
mount<00:03:31.109> these<00:03:31.260> either<00:03:31.590> outside<00:03:31.859> behind<00:03:32.340> the

stand<00:03:32.849> or<00:03:33.180> something<00:03:33.629> like<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:35.389> don't

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
stand or something like that I don't

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:37.789 
stand or something like that I don't
know<00:03:36.479> maybe<00:03:36.689> I'll<00:03:36.930> try<00:03:37.139> and<00:03:37.379> hook<00:03:37.500> something

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
know maybe I'll try and hook something

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.170 
know maybe I'll try and hook something
up<00:03:38.010> here<00:03:38.489> or<00:03:38.879> I<00:03:39.180> don't<00:03:39.720> know<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:39.959> just<00:03:41.180> haven't

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
up here or I don't know I just haven't

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.449 
up here or I don't know I just haven't
quite<00:03:42.299> figured<00:03:42.569> it<00:03:42.750> out<00:03:42.900> but<00:03:43.259> I'm<00:03:44.040> taking<00:03:44.370> my

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
quite figured it out but I'm taking my

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.509 
quite figured it out but I'm taking my
time<00:03:44.639> with<00:03:44.849> this<00:03:44.939> build<00:03:45.709> so<00:03:46.709> you<00:03:47.250> know<00:03:47.340> there's

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
time with this build so you know there's

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.119 
time with this build so you know there's
no<00:03:47.669> real<00:03:47.879> rush<00:03:48.120> I<00:03:48.470> just<00:03:49.470> kind<00:03:49.620> of<00:03:49.739> want<00:03:49.919> to<00:03:49.979> do

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
no real rush I just kind of want to do

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.259 
no real rush I just kind of want to do
things<00:03:50.370> right<00:03:50.549> and<00:03:52.519> have<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.699> reasoning<00:03:54.030> well

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
things right and have the reasoning well

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.149 
things right and have the reasoning well
thought<00:03:54.569> out<00:03:54.599> you<00:03:55.439> know<00:03:55.590> before<00:03:55.919> I<00:03:55.979> make<00:03:56.129> a

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
thought out you know before I make a

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.420 
thought out you know before I make a
move<00:03:56.459> or<00:03:56.699> permanently<00:03:57.209> install<00:03:57.569> something<00:03:58.430> so

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
move or permanently install something so

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.189 
move or permanently install something so
that's<00:04:00.150> pretty<00:04:00.389> much<00:04:00.599> going<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:00.870> be<00:04:00.930> it

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:01.199 
that's pretty much going to be it

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:05.030 
that's pretty much going to be it
that'll<00:04:01.889> wrap<00:04:01.919> it<00:04:02.220> up<00:04:02.569> next<00:04:03.569> video<00:04:03.889> you'll<00:04:04.889> be

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
that'll wrap it up next video you'll be
