 arrived to be probed by the staff of the total challenge 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.090
 You would not have accepted it but I do not want to explore it too much.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.380
 is working right inside a station that has another victim 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.650

 something that takes a little this principle that is you who really agreste 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.219
 it imposes on the insane third that is the 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.760
 that you hear the wall to say something 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.519
