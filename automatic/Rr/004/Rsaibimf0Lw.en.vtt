had a few problems with his knee we've

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.160 
had a few problems with his knee we've
lost<00:00:08.849> that<00:00:09.000> yarder<00:00:09.330> pace<00:00:09.480> he<00:00:09.780> must<00:00:09.990> feel<00:00:10.110> that

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
lost that yarder pace he must feel that

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.990 
lost that yarder pace he must feel that
he's<00:00:10.440> going<00:00:10.620> absolutely<00:00:10.860> mad<00:00:11.400> at<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.670> moment

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
he's going absolutely mad at the moment

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.999 
he's going absolutely mad at the moment
but<00:00:12.330> our<00:00:12.540> theory<00:00:13.019> is<00:00:13.170> actually<00:00:13.740> he's<00:00:13.980> not

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
but our theory is actually he's not

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.440 
but our theory is actually he's not
being<00:00:14.280> supported<00:00:14.759> well<00:00:14.940> enough<00:00:15.179> by<00:00:15.389> the
