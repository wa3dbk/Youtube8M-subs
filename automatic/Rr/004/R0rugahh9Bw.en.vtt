00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.549
 How about guys is just one month 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.859
 that the final version of windows 8 is 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.410
 release officially and we continue 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.109
 publishing tutorials with a goal 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.630
 that the day you have that version already 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.119
 you know how they are used and what they are used for 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.130
 the tools that the series has 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.800
 new microsoft operating system 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.230
 today we will talk about the administrator of 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.540
 windows 8 tasks that like the 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.610
 most of the functions of the system has 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.910
 been renovated and improved to fit 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.890
 better with the new platform the 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.230
 task manager as his name 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.480
 already well indicates is a tool or 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.329
 application that allows us to manage 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.870
 applications programs processes and tasks 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.550
 that run on windows 8 let's say that 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.920
 is the panel from which we can 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.170
 control not only the services or 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.360
 executions that occur in the system or 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.580
 the consumption of resources that make the pc 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.950
 but also close or stop a 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.340
 application that is usually 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.259
 slowing down the pc or blocking what 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.390
 also the task manager is 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.159
 very useful to close a process that 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.700
 prevent an application from being 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.829
 erased naturally so for 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.110
 open or enter the administrator 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:28.479
 Windows 8 tasks we have several 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.200
 options we can press the keys 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.719
 capital control and escape also the 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.180
 combination control uppercase delete 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:40.150
 and push on task manager 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.070
 with the mouse or directly click on the 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.140
 metro interface icon on the 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.140
 Secured windows system 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.130
 just enter the administrator of 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.560
 Windows 8 tasks or also known 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.980
 as tag manager what we see is a 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.900
 remarkable change in the visual section 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.270
 now every element is much more graphic 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.270
 is more careful with icons brought 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.380
 directly from the metro interface 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.050
 we also see that the menus of 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.380
 performance processes users and so on 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.510
 you do not see them at first sight, it's due 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.030
 now trying to minimize the 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.500
 main screen which serves to 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.920
 know what applications are there 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.780
 running and if any does not answer for 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.910
 so much to open the tabs of 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.340
 services performance and processes 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.000
 administrator you have to click on more 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.000
 details 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.060
 from left to right we find the 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.629
 following tabs of which you 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.849
 we 'll talk about the tab below 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.580
 process are show each and every one of 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.670
 the processes executed on the computer and 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.680
 the applications here we find several 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.019
 changes such as grouping by category 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.269
 of processes and a much more interface 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.120
 clear of the consumption of resources that makes 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.459
 each one something very important in the 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.620
 Windows 8 task manager is 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.840
 that now to filter better before the 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.720
 data saturation we can detect 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.370
 quickly what applications or processes 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.060
 who are making excessive consumption 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.160
 of cpu memory or network thanks to a map 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.010
 of heat that marks light yellow or 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.120
 red the level of such consumption what 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.610
 allows us to close them quickly 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.799
 The performance tab shows a 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.830
 very intuitive graphic of the consumption of 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.890
 resources in the system we can consult 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.530
 the graphics of the cpu disk or network memory 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.780
 we can also read very data 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.150
 important as the use of cpu the 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.129
 Processor speed processes 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.470
 open their processes 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.900
 In short, the task manager 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.030
 of windows 8 gives us a graphic vision 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.040
 of the state of the active components 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.040
 of the pc or also the tablet 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.940
 the application history tab will 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.430
 has introduced for the first time in 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.260
 Task Manager does not know very 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.540
 well what is the goal at functional level 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.940
 but what it offers us is the possibility 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.100
 to see a record of all the 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.800
 applications that have been executed some 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.380
 time in windows 8 and also its consumption of 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.310
 resources by the way this tab is 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.310
 can reset 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.970
 the home tab is used to add or 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.250
 Remove applications from the start of 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.730
 windows and is another of the novelties of 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.660
 task manager windows 8 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.100
 historically this tool has 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.590
 been included in the panel 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.990
 windows setting something hidden 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.360
 now with the tab included in the 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.430
 administrator, its use will be more 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.380
 reach of all 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.050
 with the users tab we can 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.000
 check which users of windows 8 and 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.760
 what applications or processes have 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.520
 charged and what resource consumption are 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.070
 doing also as administrators 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.940
 we can finish a process or close 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.950
 an application the details tab 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.380
 allows to see a general summary of the 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.930
 processes that are executed in a moment 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.550
 determined including also a 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.940
 description that allows us to identify 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.810
 more easily the purpose of each 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.810
 of these processes 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.030
 the last tab of the administrator 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.760
 tasks of windows 8 is the services 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.250
 in it we can see a list with all 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.650
 the processes that windows executes 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.140
 invisible way to be able to adapt to 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:31.910
 the demands of the system or functions 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.910
 demanded by some applications 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.710
 basically this is the X-ray of what 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.010
 that we can find in the 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.020
 task manager 8 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.570
 general norm and user level 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.330
 surely we have to use it for two 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.340
 specific situations close or end 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.140
 Application processes and remove 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.240
 windows start programs for 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.720
 increase the start speed of the 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.210
 system in the first case in the 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.190
 to close applications just go to 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.170
 the application or process that we want 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.450
 end and click on the button 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.510
 finish task from the bottom 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.910
 right 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.190
 to remove applications or programs from 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.050
 start of windows will be enough to mark 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.600
 that or those that we do not want 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:19.240
 they start next to the system and press 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:22.150
 about disable placed on it 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.160
 position is already this is the new 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.910
 task manager that includes 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.910
 windows 8
