hi guys this is the starcraft neu Trina
and<00:00:05.750> this<00:00:06.750> is<00:00:06.899> another<00:00:07.230> tutorial<00:00:08.450> on<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:10.050> map

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700

tearin and cirque basics I never never
played<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.570> Terran<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.590> starcraft<00:00:47.340> 2<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
played this Terran in starcraft 2 in the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.990 
played this Terran in starcraft 2 in the
tutorial<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:49.190> this<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:52.129> pretty<00:00:53.129> all<00:00:53.610> right

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
tutorial and this is a pretty all right

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.770 
tutorial and this is a pretty all right
strategy<00:00:54.750> if<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.469> want<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:56.360> do<00:00:57.360> some<00:00:57.570> high

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
strategy if you want to do some high

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.759 
strategy if you want to do some high
pressure<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.710> Cirque<00:00:59.460> and<00:01:01.070> I'll<00:01:02.070> just

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
pressure on the Cirque and I'll just

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:10.969 
pressure on the Cirque and I'll just
make<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:08.150> audio<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.210> bit<00:01:09.450> lower<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.710> can

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
make the audio a bit lower so you can

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.390 
make the audio a bit lower so you can
hear<00:01:11.189> my<00:01:11.369> voice<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.580> little<00:01:11.760> bit<00:01:12.060> better<00:01:13.400> yeah

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
hear my voice a little bit better yeah

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.640 
hear my voice a little bit better yeah
if<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.909> want<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.180> end<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.720> game<00:01:15.750> fast<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.500> can

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
if you want to end the game fast you can

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.980 
if you want to end the game fast you can
do<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:17.009> strategy<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:18.060> very<00:01:18.479> annoying<00:01:18.840> for

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
do this strategy it's very annoying for

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.510 
do this strategy it's very annoying for
the<00:01:19.290> circuit<00:01:19.740> hard<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:21.020> counter<00:01:22.020> when<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:23.310> its

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
the circuit hard to counter when on its

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.600 
the circuit hard to counter when on its
highest<00:01:23.990> highest<00:01:24.990> point<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.680> need<00:01:25.860> some

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
highest highest point you need some

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.840 
highest highest point you need some
micro<00:01:27.060> because<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.570> need<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.490> mean<00:01:29.640> II

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
micro because you need to and I mean II

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.219 
micro because you need to and I mean II
need<00:01:30.000> some<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.570> little<00:01:31.560> bit<00:01:31.829> high<00:01:32.610> APM<00:01:33.600> because

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
need some a little bit high APM because

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.260 
need some a little bit high APM because
you<00:01:34.350> have<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.619> make<00:01:34.799> sure<00:01:34.950> your<00:01:35.100> units<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.759> you

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
you have to make sure your units and you

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.819 
you have to make sure your units and you
have<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.509> chrono<00:01:36.750> boost<00:01:37.049> your<00:01:37.229> buildings<00:01:37.650> and

have to chrono boost your buildings and
walk<00:01:38.250> more<00:01:39.030> units<00:01:39.390> in<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:41.509> in<00:01:42.509> every<00:01:42.960> protoss

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
walk more units in and in every protoss

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.100 
walk more units in and in every protoss
zerg<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:44.369> want<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.729> roll<00:01:45.450> your<00:01:45.630> entrance

wop upgrade is finished even you won't

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.789 
wop upgrade is finished even you won't
have<00:03:00.319> a<00:03:00.819> four<00:03:01.819> gateways<00:03:02.269> up<00:03:02.780> at<00:03:03.049> least<00:03:03.650> when

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
have a four gateways up at least when

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.190 
have a four gateways up at least when
you<00:03:03.920> want<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.489> warp<00:03:04.670> in<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:04.940> unit's<00:03:05.480> you<00:03:05.989> want

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
you want to warp in the unit's you want

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.300 
you want to warp in the unit's you want
you<00:03:06.440> need<00:03:06.620> four<00:03:07.310> gateways<00:03:07.579> and<00:03:08.709> now<00:03:09.709> you<00:03:09.769> see<00:03:10.099> I

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
you need four gateways and now you see I

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.559 
you need four gateways and now you see I
was<00:03:11.000> I<00:03:11.540> did<00:03:12.170> very<00:03:12.200> bad<00:03:12.500> there<00:03:12.950> it's<00:03:13.569> blocking

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
was I did very bad there it's blocking

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.229 
was I did very bad there it's blocking
my<00:03:15.049> entrance<00:03:16.209> luckily<00:03:17.209> is<00:03:17.389> running<00:03:17.750> out<00:03:17.930> and

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
my entrance luckily is running out and

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.530 
my entrance luckily is running out and
now<00:03:20.590> this<00:03:21.590> is<00:03:21.769> very<00:03:22.100> bad<00:03:22.370> on<00:03:22.549> on<00:03:22.790> his<00:03:23.090> part<00:03:23.359> I

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
now this is very bad on on his part I

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:35.830 
now this is very bad on on his part I
don't<00:03:23.750> know<00:03:23.930> why<00:03:24.889> I<00:03:24.920> did<00:03:25.220> that

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.740 

and<00:03:36.840> this<00:03:37.400> must<00:03:38.400> have<00:03:38.640> been<00:03:38.819> a<00:03:38.879> Miss<00:03:39.299> kick<00:03:39.569> by

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
and this must have been a Miss kick by

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.399 
and this must have been a Miss kick by
him<00:03:39.870> i<00:03:39.989> don't<00:03:40.230> know<00:03:40.470> i'm<00:03:41.840> in<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:42.989> Diamond

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
him i don't know i'm in the Diamond

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.920 
him i don't know i'm in the Diamond
League<00:03:43.439> so<00:03:43.829> this<00:03:44.010> is<00:03:44.159> very<00:03:44.420> rare<00:03:45.420> that<00:03:45.480> this

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
League so this is very rare that this

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.280 
League so this is very rare that this
happens<00:03:46.319> and<00:03:47.250> I'm<00:03:47.370> getting<00:03:47.579> my<00:03:47.819> first<00:03:48.290> warp

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
happens and I'm getting my first warp

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.399 
happens and I'm getting my first warp
gates<00:03:52.069> and<00:03:53.069> this<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:54.209> have<00:03:54.329> a<00:03:54.540> lot<00:03:54.750> of<00:03:54.780> gas<00:03:55.170> so

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409 
gates and this you have a lot of gas so

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:58.610 
gates and this you have a lot of gas so
I<00:03:55.680> can<00:03:56.129> get<00:03:56.280> some<00:03:56.340> centuries<00:03:56.849> now<00:03:57.440> if<00:03:58.440> you're

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
I can get some centuries now if you're

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.640 
I can get some centuries now if you're
planning<00:03:58.950> attack<00:03:59.280> you<00:03:59.459> should<00:03:59.640> produce<00:04:00.000> your

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
planning attack you should produce your

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.930 
planning attack you should produce your
centuries<00:04:01.650> before<00:04:01.920> you<00:04:02.280> do<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.579> salads

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
centuries before you do the salads

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.080 
centuries before you do the salads
because<00:04:04.190> then<00:04:05.190> the<00:04:05.340> centuries<00:04:05.700> will<00:04:05.879> have<00:04:06.060> a

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
because then the centuries will have a

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.119 
because then the centuries will have a
lot<00:04:06.329> of<00:04:06.359> energy<00:04:06.629> and<00:04:06.989> you<00:04:07.109> can<00:04:07.319> do<00:04:07.920> this<00:04:08.069> the

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
lot of energy and you can do this the

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.990 
lot of energy and you can do this the
shield<00:04:08.579> and<00:04:09.709> there<00:04:10.709> are<00:04:11.099> two<00:04:11.280> kinds<00:04:11.609> of<00:04:11.670> kinds

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
shield and there are two kinds of kinds

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.770 
shield and there are two kinds of kinds
of<00:04:12.209> shields<00:04:12.629> you<00:04:13.170> should<00:04:13.349> know<00:04:13.560> that<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:14.780> I'll

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
of shields you should know that and I'll

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.640 
of shields you should know that and I'll
do<00:04:16.139> a<00:04:16.169> pilum<00:04:16.829> near<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:17.850> enemies<00:04:18.209> expansion<00:04:18.840> so

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
do a pilum near the enemies expansion so

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:30.360 
do a pilum near the enemies expansion so
I<00:04:19.680> can<00:04:20.239> wop<00:04:21.239> units<00:04:21.690> directly<00:04:22.190> to<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.340> enemy

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.890 

and<00:04:31.370> if<00:04:31.759> you<00:04:31.850> don't<00:04:32.060> detect<00:04:32.360> this<00:04:32.509> earlier<00:04:32.840> you

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
and if you don't detect this earlier you

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.740 
and if you don't detect this earlier you
want<00:04:33.110> to<00:04:33.229> get<00:04:33.380> a<00:04:33.430> scouting<00:04:34.430> probe<00:04:34.880> to<00:04:35.570> your

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
want to get a scouting probe to your

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.719 
want to get a scouting probe to your
enemy<00:04:36.440> space<00:04:36.680> so<00:04:36.889> you<00:04:37.009> know<00:04:37.130> if<00:04:37.280> it<00:04:37.400> goes<00:04:37.550> for

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
enemy space so you know if it goes for

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.659 
enemy space so you know if it goes for
roaches<00:04:37.970> or<00:04:38.360> for<00:04:38.600> hydras<00:04:39.410> of<00:04:39.680> our<00:04:39.919> mutual<00:04:40.789> escs

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
roaches or for hydras of our mutual escs

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.310 
roaches or for hydras of our mutual escs
and<00:04:43.669> now<00:04:44.030> it<00:04:44.210> comes<00:04:44.570> down<00:04:44.750> a<00:04:44.960> little<00:04:45.199> bit

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
and now it comes down a little bit

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.640 
and now it comes down a little bit
micron<00:04:45.919> trying<00:04:46.160> to<00:04:47.169> hide<00:04:48.169> my<00:04:48.580> units<00:04:50.470> at<00:04:51.470> the

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
micron trying to hide my units at the

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.490 
micron trying to hide my units at the
middle<00:04:51.979> so<00:04:52.190> he<00:04:52.220> can't<00:04:52.520> surround<00:04:52.820> me<00:04:53.120> and<00:04:53.500> now

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
middle so he can't surround me and now

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.650 
middle so he can't surround me and now
he<00:04:54.560> realizes<00:04:54.949> that<00:04:55.310> my<00:04:55.580> arm<00:04:55.970> is<00:04:56.150> too<00:04:56.300> big<00:04:56.509> he

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
he realizes that my arm is too big he

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.409 
he realizes that my arm is too big he
needs<00:04:56.840> to<00:04:57.310> mass<00:04:58.310> produce<00:04:58.340> servings<00:04:59.270> and

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
needs to mass produce servings and

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.390 
needs to mass produce servings and
roaches<00:04:59.900> now<00:05:00.110> and<00:05:01.810> now<00:05:02.810> your<00:05:03.080> macro<00:05:03.590> is<00:05:03.740> very

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
roaches now and now your macro is very

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.909 
roaches now and now your macro is very
important<00:05:05.000> because<00:05:05.720> you<00:05:06.229> have<00:05:06.470> to<00:05:06.650> chrono

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
important because you have to chrono

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:13.300 
important because you have to chrono
boost<00:05:07.250> your<00:05:08.560> your<00:05:09.560> stopwatch<00:05:10.090> your<00:05:11.979> wap<00:05:12.979> gates

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
boost your your stopwatch your wap gates

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.400 
boost your your stopwatch your wap gates
that's<00:05:13.669> that's<00:05:14.240> what<00:05:14.479> they<00:05:14.660> called<00:05:17.350> so<00:05:18.350> you

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
that's that's what they called so you

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.560 
that's that's what they called so you
can<00:05:18.710> support<00:05:18.919> the<00:05:19.280> army<00:05:19.580> and<00:05:19.820> you<00:05:19.880> always<00:05:20.270> have

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
can support the army and you always have

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.860 
can support the army and you always have
to<00:05:20.720> warp<00:05:20.960> in<00:05:21.139> units<00:05:21.820> I'd<00:05:22.820> also<00:05:23.240> never<00:05:23.510> forget

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
to warp in units I'd also never forget

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:30.700 
to warp in units I'd also never forget
for<00:05:24.349> pilots<00:05:26.800> and<00:05:27.940> yes<00:05:28.940> some<00:05:29.930> micro<00:05:30.320> can<00:05:30.500> help

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
for pilots and yes some micro can help

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.159 
for pilots and yes some micro can help
you<00:05:30.860> a<00:05:30.889> lot<00:05:31.070> there<00:05:31.340> so<00:05:32.090> if<00:05:32.750> the<00:05:32.900> stalker

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
you a lot there so if the stalker

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:34.930 
you a lot there so if the stalker
becomes<00:05:33.620> attacked<00:05:33.949> or<00:05:34.160> a<00:05:34.190> unit<00:05:34.550> you<00:05:34.669> want<00:05:34.849> to

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
becomes attacked or a unit you want to

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:41.230 
becomes attacked or a unit you want to
move<00:05:35.060> it<00:05:35.240> to<00:05:35.270> the<00:05:35.570> back<00:05:35.599> and<00:05:37.210> you<00:05:39.280> also<00:05:40.280> should

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
move it to the back and you also should

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.620 
move it to the back and you also should
always<00:05:41.979> have<00:05:42.979> a<00:05:43.070> good<00:05:43.400> composition<00:05:43.820> of<00:05:44.150> the

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
always have a good composition of the

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.899 
always have a good composition of the
unit<00:05:44.960> so<00:05:45.440> right<00:05:45.650> now<00:05:45.680> I<00:05:45.800> had<00:05:46.039> only<00:05:46.220> stalker<00:05:46.610> so

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:46.909 
unit so right now I had only stalker so

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:48.700 
unit so right now I had only stalker so
I<00:05:46.940> had<00:05:47.030> to<00:05:47.060> move<00:05:47.479> back<00:05:47.780> because<00:05:48.229> stalkers<00:05:48.590> are

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
I had to move back because stalkers are

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.520 
I had to move back because stalkers are
very<00:05:48.919> bad<00:05:49.280> against<00:05:50.210> set<00:05:50.479> I<00:05:50.659> can<00:05:51.020> Sterling's

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
very bad against set I can Sterling's

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.690 
very bad against set I can Sterling's
but<00:05:52.130> they're<00:05:52.310> very<00:05:52.490> good<00:05:52.580> against<00:05:53.060> roaches

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
but they're very good against roaches

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.180 
but they're very good against roaches
and<00:05:56.660> now<00:05:56.990> it's<00:05:57.200> trying<00:05:57.410> to<00:05:57.650> defend<00:05:58.010> this

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
and now it's trying to defend this

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.860 
and now it's trying to defend this
natural<00:05:58.670> expansion<00:05:58.970> again<00:06:00.940> but<00:06:01.940> I'm<00:06:02.330> popping

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
natural expansion again but I'm popping

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.920 
natural expansion again but I'm popping
in<00:06:02.990> more<00:06:03.230> and<00:06:03.320> more<00:06:03.410> units<00:06:04.360> so<00:06:05.360> we<00:06:05.540> won't<00:06:05.750> be

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
in more and more units so we won't be

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.860 
in more and more units so we won't be
able<00:06:06.050> to<00:06:06.260> hold<00:06:06.410> this<00:06:06.650> and<00:06:07.010> when<00:06:07.820> the<00:06:07.910> circus<00:06:08.570> is

able to hold this and when the circus is

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.440 
able to hold this and when the circus is
expansionist<00:06:09.620> it's<00:06:09.860> like<00:06:10.430> his<00:06:10.670> he<00:06:11.210> has

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.450 
expansionist it's like his he has

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.790 
expansionist it's like his he has
already<00:06:11.690> lost<00:06:12.140> in<00:06:12.350> DC<00:06:12.650> left<00:06:13.100> the<00:06:13.220> game<00:06:13.960> yeah<00:06:14.960> so
