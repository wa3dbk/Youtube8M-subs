honestly<00:00:36.090> there's<00:00:36.270> about<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.450> tool<00:00:36.660> for<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.930> I

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
honestly there's about a tool for this I

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.569 
honestly there's about a tool for this I
couldn't<00:00:37.290> cut<00:00:37.410> straight<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.649> save<00:00:37.829> my<00:00:37.980> life

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
but you know it works you could probably

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.360 
but you know it works you could probably
use<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> toilet<00:00:42.360> paper<00:00:42.540> tube<00:00:42.690> except<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.530> naeli

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
these are the two sides I find it's a

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.830 
these are the two sides I find it's a
lot<00:01:29.579> easier<00:01:29.729> for<00:01:29.909> me<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.119> space<00:01:30.450> things<00:01:30.720> out

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
lot easier for me to space things out

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.499 
lot easier for me to space things out
like<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.790> but<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.880> can<00:01:33.030> do<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.119> however<00:01:33.329> you

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
like that but you can do it however you

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.539 
like that but you can do it however you
like<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.750> can<00:01:33.869> measure<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.320> I'm<00:01:34.470> not<00:01:34.950> into

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
like you can measure it I'm not into

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.039 
like you can measure it I'm not into
measuring<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.740> more<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.920> eyeball<00:01:38.640> err

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
measuring so more of the eyeball err

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.300 
measuring so more of the eyeball err
like<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.140> eyeball<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:40.710> then<00:01:40.979> I'll<00:01:41.100> put<00:01:41.280> a

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
like to eyeball it so then I'll put a

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.490 
like to eyeball it so then I'll put a
peg<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.060> between<00:01:42.390> each<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.689> these<00:01:42.930> don't<00:01:43.320> worry

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
peg in between each of these don't worry

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.889 
peg in between each of these don't worry
about<00:01:43.680> them<00:01:43.860> being<00:01:44.070> perfect<00:01:44.610> yet<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.509> rubber

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
about them being perfect yet the rubber

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.179 
about them being perfect yet the rubber
bands<00:01:46.140> going<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.380> kind<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.619> hold<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:46.979> place

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
bands going to kind of hold it in place

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.520 
bands going to kind of hold it in place
as<00:01:47.399> we<00:01:47.549> get<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.759> spaced<00:01:48.180> out

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.320 

see<00:01:51.830> just<00:01:52.190> like<00:01:52.369> that<00:01:52.580> this<00:01:52.790> is<00:01:52.970> not<00:01:53.000> a

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
see just like that this is not a

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.010 
see just like that this is not a
difficult<00:01:54.080> project<00:01:54.490> at<00:01:55.490> all<00:01:55.549> and<00:01:56.360> then<00:01:56.780> I<00:01:56.840> want

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
difficult project at all and then I want

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.310 
difficult project at all and then I want
to<00:01:57.049> make<00:01:57.140> sure<00:01:57.320> they're<00:01:57.500> all<00:01:57.650> the<00:01:57.680> same<00:01:57.860> height

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
to make sure they're all the same height

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.300 
to make sure they're all the same height
not<00:02:00.320> that<00:02:00.470> it<00:02:00.560> really<00:02:00.590> makes<00:02:00.860> that<00:02:01.009> much<00:02:01.130> of<00:02:01.250> a

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
not that it really makes that much of a

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.190 
not that it really makes that much of a
difference<00:02:01.400> but<00:02:02.180> I<00:02:02.210> want<00:02:02.509> him<00:02:02.570> about<00:02:02.810> an<00:02:02.900> inch

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
difference but I want him about an inch

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.530 
difference but I want him about an inch
I<00:02:04.159> want<00:02:04.460> about<00:02:04.549> an<00:02:04.700> inch<00:02:04.909> of<00:02:05.150> these<00:02:05.270> pegs

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
I want about an inch of these pegs

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.999 
I want about an inch of these pegs
sticking<00:02:05.659> out<00:02:06.020> so<00:02:06.320> they're<00:02:06.650> not<00:02:06.770> you<00:02:06.860> don't

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
sticking out so they're not you don't

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.040 
sticking out so they're not you don't
have<00:02:07.190> too<00:02:07.310> long<00:02:07.550> because<00:02:07.729> it'll<00:02:07.940> be<00:02:08.000> hard<00:02:08.239> for

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
have too long because it'll be hard for

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.809 
have too long because it'll be hard for
the<00:02:09.170> kids<00:02:09.350> to<00:02:09.590> lift<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.950> yarn<00:02:10.160> up<00:02:10.369> but<00:02:10.759> you

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
the kids to lift the yarn up but you

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.729 
the kids to lift the yarn up but you
don't<00:02:10.910> want<00:02:11.090> it<00:02:11.150> too<00:02:11.270> short<00:02:11.300> that<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:11.870> yarn<00:02:12.680> is

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
don't want it too short that the yarn is

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:13.780 
don't want it too short that the yarn is
gonna<00:02:12.890> slide<00:02:13.100> off<00:02:13.280> either

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
gonna slide off either

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.210 
gonna slide off either
so<00:02:14.330> about<00:02:14.510> 3/4<00:02:15.050> of<00:02:15.140> an<00:02:15.260> inch<00:02:15.350> to<00:02:15.500> an<00:02:15.680> inch<00:02:15.860> would

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
so about 3/4 of an inch to an inch would

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.280 
so about 3/4 of an inch to an inch would
be<00:02:16.430> will<00:02:16.790> suffice<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.420> then<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:18.050> just<00:02:18.170> want

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
be will suffice and then you just want

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.250 
be will suffice and then you just want
to<00:02:18.319> go<00:02:18.440> around<00:02:18.530> do<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.100> eyeball<00:02:19.430> test<00:02:20.260> you

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
to go around do the eyeball test you

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.250 
to go around do the eyeball test you
could<00:02:21.530> measure<00:02:21.770> it<00:02:22.069> if<00:02:22.370> you're<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:23.030> know

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
could measure it if you're you know

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.300 
could measure it if you're you know
you're<00:02:24.260> that<00:02:24.410> kind<00:02:24.530> of<00:02:24.650> person<00:02:24.709> you<00:02:25.130> need<00:02:25.280> to

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
have perfect go ahead and measure it no

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.050 
have perfect go ahead and measure it no
offense<00:02:27.040> no<00:02:28.040> offense<00:02:28.070> to<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:28.519> perfectionist

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
don't need to be perfect then you want

don't need to be perfect then you want

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
those fancy new duct tapes which I

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.009 
those fancy new duct tapes which I
cannot<00:02:49.060> bring<00:02:50.060> myself<00:02:50.090> to<00:02:50.540> spend<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:50.900> kind

cannot bring myself to spend that kind
of<00:02:51.110> money<00:02:51.170> for<00:02:51.440> duct<00:02:51.620> tape<00:02:51.830> but<00:02:52.269> those<00:02:53.269> fancy

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
of money for duct tape but those fancy

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.000 
of money for duct tape but those fancy
there's<00:02:53.930> like<00:02:54.050> a<00:02:54.080> zillion<00:02:54.380> new<00:02:54.590> designs<00:02:54.890> of

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
there's like a zillion new designs of

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.280 
there's like a zillion new designs of
duct<00:02:55.160> tape<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:55.549> want<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:55.790> use<00:02:55.880> that<00:02:56.290> that

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
duct tape you want to use that that

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.630 
duct tape you want to use that that
would<00:02:57.440> be<00:02:57.530> great<00:02:57.709> too<00:02:57.860> I<00:02:57.890> think<00:02:58.220> I<00:02:58.280> probably<00:02:58.400> do

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
would be great too I think I probably do

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.560 
would be great too I think I probably do
masking<00:02:58.970> tape<00:02:59.120> first<00:02:59.530> just<00:03:00.530> because<00:03:00.920> um

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
masking tape first just because um

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.600 
masking tape first just because um
actually<00:03:02.570> know<00:03:02.959> what<00:03:03.170> do<00:03:03.920> this<00:03:04.070> underneath

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
actually know what do this underneath

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.069 
actually know what do this underneath
and<00:03:04.910> then<00:03:05.360> you<00:03:05.420> could<00:03:05.540> take<00:03:05.630> that<00:03:05.870> elastic<00:03:06.650> off

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
and then you could take that elastic off

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.690 
and then you could take that elastic off
but<00:03:09.079> the<00:03:09.200> dot<00:03:09.380> the<00:03:09.530> fancy<00:03:10.010> duct<00:03:10.190> tape<00:03:10.370> I<00:03:10.489> think

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
but the dot the fancy duct tape I think

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.979 
but the dot the fancy duct tape I think
would<00:03:10.820> look<00:03:11.060> really<00:03:11.269> cool<00:03:11.480> on<00:03:11.540> this<00:03:11.780> project

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
would look really cool on this project

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.509 
would look really cool on this project
if<00:03:12.920> you<00:03:13.400> uh<00:03:13.510> if<00:03:14.560> you<00:03:15.560> are<00:03:15.590> spending<00:03:15.980> like<00:03:16.280> that

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
and put some paper around it that's

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.150 
and put some paper around it that's
white<00:03:35.030> good<00:03:35.269> this<00:03:36.140> is<00:03:36.320> it<00:03:36.470> really<00:03:36.829> this<00:03:36.950> is<00:03:37.070> all

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
I need to do that's what I did here and

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.420 
I need to do that's what I did here and
this<00:03:39.350> is<00:03:39.500> some<00:03:39.620> paper<00:03:39.769> that<00:03:39.950> I<00:03:40.010> had<00:03:40.130> made<00:03:40.280> with

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
this is some paper that I had made with

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.190 
this is some paper that I had made with
chalk<00:03:40.730> and<00:03:40.760> then<00:03:41.120> I<00:03:41.180> was<00:03:41.510> using<00:03:41.690> it<00:03:41.900> as<00:03:42.079> gay

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
chalk and then I was using it as gay

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.750 
chalk and then I was using it as gay
chocolate<00:03:42.650> over<00:03:42.739> my<00:03:42.829> hands<00:03:43.130> my<00:03:43.370> head<00:03:43.489> still

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
chocolate over my hands my head still

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.729 
chocolate over my hands my head still
filled<00:03:44.090> it<00:03:44.239> so<00:03:44.329> I<00:03:44.359> crudely<00:03:45.140> went<00:03:45.410> over<00:03:45.560> it<00:03:45.650> with

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
filled it so I crudely went over it with

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.280 
filled it so I crudely went over it with
some<00:03:45.769> packing<00:03:46.130> tape<00:03:46.480> but<00:03:47.480> you<00:03:47.660> know<00:03:47.780> it<00:03:47.959> works

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
some packing tape but you know it works

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.780 
some packing tape but you know it works
it<00:03:48.590> doesn't<00:03:48.769> look<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.220> prettiest<00:03:49.519> but<00:03:49.670> it

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
it doesn't look the prettiest but it

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.729 
it doesn't look the prettiest but it
still<00:03:50.000> works<00:03:50.269> so<00:03:50.570> when<00:03:51.140> it's<00:03:51.260> time<00:03:51.320> to<00:03:51.470> use

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
still works so when it's time to use

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.640 
still works so when it's time to use
this<00:03:52.269> actually<00:03:53.269> let<00:03:53.840> me<00:03:53.959> just<00:03:53.989> I'll<00:03:54.290> take<00:03:54.500> the

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
this actually let me just I'll take the

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:55.930 
this actually let me just I'll take the
other<00:03:54.799> end<00:03:54.859> of<00:03:55.040> this<00:03:55.190> yarn<00:03:55.430> and<00:03:55.609> show<00:03:55.700> you<00:03:55.760> on

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
other end of this yarn and show you on

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.920 
other end of this yarn and show you on
the<00:03:56.060> new<00:03:56.150> one<00:03:56.299> just<00:03:56.329> so<00:03:56.510> you<00:03:56.570> know<00:03:56.600> how<00:03:56.720> to<00:03:56.780> get

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
the new one just so you know how to get

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.509 
the new one just so you know how to get
it<00:03:57.079> started<00:03:57.290> because<00:03:58.100> that<00:03:58.220> might<00:03:58.370> be<00:03:58.400> a

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
it started because that might be a

00:03:58.519 --> 00:03:59.649 
it started because that might be a
little<00:03:58.730> confusing<00:03:59.030> if<00:03:59.209> you've<00:03:59.329> never<00:03:59.510> used

00:03:59.649 --> 00:03:59.659 
little confusing if you've never used

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:02.740 
little confusing if you've never used

inditing spool before part of my tangle
here

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
here

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.550 
here
there<00:04:04.430> we<00:04:04.489> go<00:04:04.609> you<00:04:05.120> want<00:04:05.269> to<00:04:05.299> drop<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.959> end

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
there we go you want to drop the end

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.589 
there we go you want to drop the end
through<00:04:07.010> the<00:04:07.129> hole<00:04:07.340> and<00:04:07.700> you<00:04:08.299> want<00:04:08.450> to<00:04:08.510> leave

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
through the hole and you want to leave

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.250 
through the hole and you want to leave
about<00:04:08.719> six<00:04:09.019> inches<00:04:09.290> at<00:04:09.409> the<00:04:09.439> bottom<00:04:09.829> and<00:04:10.010> then

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
about six inches at the bottom and then

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.199 
about six inches at the bottom and then
be<00:04:12.260> kinda<00:04:12.590> it<00:04:13.310> doesn't<00:04:13.700> this<00:04:13.819> it<00:04:13.969> you<00:04:14.090> only

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
be kinda it doesn't this it you only

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:15.399 
be kinda it doesn't this it you only
have<00:04:14.329> to<00:04:14.420> do<00:04:14.480> this<00:04:14.569> the<00:04:14.689> first<00:04:14.840> time<00:04:15.170> or<00:04:15.290> to

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:15.409 
have to do this the first time or to

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:17.849 
have to do this the first time or to
just<00:04:15.829> kind<00:04:16.009> of<00:04:16.070> hold<00:04:16.250> that<00:04:16.489> tail<00:04:16.759> and<00:04:17.090> then

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
just kind of hold that tail and then

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.039 
just kind of hold that tail and then
you're<00:04:18.859> going<00:04:19.009> to<00:04:19.100> go<00:04:19.220> around<00:04:19.340> and<00:04:20.000> you<00:04:20.900> have

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
you're going to go around and you have

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.620 
you're going to go around and you have
to<00:04:21.169> make<00:04:21.289> sure<00:04:21.590> that<00:04:22.009> when<00:04:22.310> you<00:04:22.400> wrap<00:04:22.669> your

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
to make sure that when you wrap your

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.320 
to make sure that when you wrap your
wrapping<00:04:24.169> around<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:25.580> loop<00:04:25.789> so<00:04:26.030> that<00:04:26.060> it

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
wrapping around the loop so that it

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.990 
wrapping around the loop so that it
crosses<00:04:27.070> crosses<00:04:28.070> in<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.340> backups<00:04:28.729> I<00:04:28.820> just

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
crosses crosses in the backups I just

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.270 
crosses crosses in the backups I just
did<00:04:29.090> it<00:04:29.180> backwards<00:04:29.539> pardon<00:04:29.840> me<00:04:30.070> so<00:04:31.070> you<00:04:31.160> want

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
did it backwards pardon me so you want

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.070 
did it backwards pardon me so you want
to<00:04:31.340> make<00:04:31.430> sure<00:04:31.639> that<00:04:31.820> it's<00:04:31.940> going<00:04:32.030> to<00:04:32.120> cross<00:04:32.570> in

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
to make sure that it's going to cross in

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.909 
to make sure that it's going to cross in
the<00:04:33.979> back<00:04:34.720> so<00:04:35.720> see<00:04:35.870> I<00:04:35.900> have<00:04:36.020> one<00:04:36.080> nice<00:04:36.500> smooth

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
the back so see I have one nice smooth

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.339 
the back so see I have one nice smooth
loop<00:04:37.400> on<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:37.639> front<00:04:37.669> see<00:04:38.570> that<00:04:38.780> but<00:04:39.199> if<00:04:39.289> you

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349 
loop on the front see that but if you

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:41.080 
loop on the front see that but if you
look<00:04:39.470> on<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:39.620> inside<00:04:40.039> you<00:04:40.340> can<00:04:40.460> see<00:04:40.520> that<00:04:40.970> it's

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
look on the inside you can see that it's

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.029 
look on the inside you can see that it's
crossing<00:04:41.479> in<00:04:41.960> the<00:04:42.080> back<00:04:42.229> so<00:04:42.680> you<00:04:42.770> go<00:04:42.919> around

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
crossing in the back so you go around

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:48.879
