priming the carburetor and go and turn
the<00:00:51.170> key<00:00:51.320> so<00:00:51.890> I'll<00:00:52.100> of<00:00:52.460> course<00:00:52.520> videotape<00:00:53.270> the

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
the key so I'll of course videotape the

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.990 
the key so I'll of course videotape the
first<00:00:53.720> startup<00:00:54.110> and<00:00:54.730> watch<00:00:55.730> it<00:00:55.910> either

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
first startup and watch it either

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.340 
first startup and watch it either
explode<00:00:57.190> knock<00:00:58.870> but<00:00:59.870> that's<00:00:59.989> not<00:01:00.140> going<00:01:00.290> to

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
explode knock but that's not going to

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.760 
explode knock but that's not going to
knock<00:01:00.560> but<00:01:00.890> explode<00:01:01.610> or<00:01:02.060> not<00:01:02.390> run<00:01:02.630> or<00:01:03.170> run<00:01:03.500> I

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
knock but explode or not run or run I

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.640 
knock but explode or not run or run I
guess<00:01:04.430> we'll<00:01:04.579> have<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.729> find<00:01:04.970> out<00:01:05.530> you<00:01:06.530> could

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
guess we'll have to find out you could

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
guess we'll have to find out you could
drill<00:01:06.890> now<00:01:10.420> yeah<00:01:16.990> reloading<00:01:17.990> bench<00:01:18.549> going<00:01:19.549> a

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
drill now yeah reloading bench going a

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.700 
drill now yeah reloading bench going a
little<00:01:20.090> bit<00:01:20.210> overkill<00:01:20.659> with<00:01:20.840> it<00:01:21.049> two<00:01:21.560> by

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
little bit overkill with it two by

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:31.090 
little bit overkill with it two by
eights<00:01:28.240> yeah<00:01:29.240> I<00:01:29.930> think<00:01:30.560> you<00:01:30.620> could<00:01:30.770> do<00:01:30.830> a<00:01:30.860> lot

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
eights yeah I think you could do a lot

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.890 
eights yeah I think you could do a lot
more<00:01:31.130> weight<00:01:31.520> on<00:01:31.549> that<00:01:31.880> bench<00:01:32.119> dead<00:01:32.450> and<00:01:32.750> that

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
more weight on that bench dead and that

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.609 
more weight on that bench dead and that
the<00:01:32.960> semi<00:01:33.260> truck<00:01:33.470> engine<00:01:33.770> could<00:01:33.920> sit<00:01:34.070> on<00:01:34.100> there

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
the semi truck engine could sit on there

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.920 
the semi truck engine could sit on there
anyway<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:37.010> point<00:01:37.190> of<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:37.400> video<00:01:37.490> is<00:01:37.940> to<00:01:38.330> give

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
anyway the point of the video is to give

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.920 
anyway the point of the video is to give
this<00:01:39.049> thing<00:01:39.260> to<00:01:39.380> first<00:01:39.590> start<00:01:40.220> test<00:01:40.790> I<00:01:41.180> just

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
this thing to first start test I just

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.359 
this thing to first start test I just
finished<00:01:42.200> putting<00:01:42.320> some<00:01:42.560> gas<00:01:42.680> in<00:01:42.979> it<00:01:43.100> gonna

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
finished putting some gas in it gonna

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.340 
finished putting some gas in it gonna
hook<00:01:43.580> up<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.850> booster<00:01:44.150> battery<00:01:44.479> no<00:01:45.140> wires

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
hook up the booster battery no wires

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.990 
hook up the booster battery no wires
touching<00:01:45.680> there<00:01:45.979> nope<00:01:48.310> you<00:01:49.310> know<00:01:49.400> I<00:01:49.430> know<00:01:49.790> it's

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
touching there nope you know I know it's

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.090 
touching there nope you know I know it's
going<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.299> run<00:01:50.479> it<00:01:50.750> has<00:01:50.960> to<00:01:51.140> run<00:01:51.290> I<00:01:51.590> already

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
going to run it has to run I already

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.830 
going to run it has to run I already
turned<00:01:52.250> it<00:01:52.490> over<00:01:52.610> before<00:01:52.939> we<00:01:53.150> hope<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.570> spark

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
turned it over before we hope the spark

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.740 
turned it over before we hope the spark
plug<00:01:54.049> in<00:01:54.229> and<00:01:54.380> everything<00:01:55.420> I'm<00:01:56.420> sure<00:01:56.630> it's

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
plug in and everything I'm sure it's

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.270 
plug in and everything I'm sure it's
going<00:01:56.900> to<00:01:57.110> I<00:01:57.520> don't<00:01:58.520> see<00:01:58.729> nothing<00:01:59.060> leaking<00:01:59.479> yet

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
going to I don't see nothing leaking yet

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.679 
going to I don't see nothing leaking yet
mm-hmm<00:02:01.310> now<00:02:01.700> which<00:02:01.850> way<00:02:02.030> is<00:02:02.180> gas<00:02:02.420> on<00:02:02.780> I<00:02:04.689> don't

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
mm-hmm now which way is gas on I don't

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:06.969 
mm-hmm now which way is gas on I don't
know<00:02:05.840> if<00:02:05.869> it's<00:02:06.080> down<00:02:06.350> but<00:02:06.680> that<00:02:06.830> would<00:02:06.950> be

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
know if it's down but that would be

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.509 
know if it's down but that would be
either<00:02:07.220> on/off<00:02:07.820> or<00:02:08.000> reserve<00:02:09.280> find<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.340> key

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
either on/off or reserve find the key

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:11.710 
either on/off or reserve find the key
for<00:02:10.759> it

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
for it

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.270 
for it
I<00:02:16.390> don't<00:02:17.390> just<00:02:17.560> start<00:02:18.560> our<00:02:18.710> buttons<00:02:19.010> kind<00:02:19.190> of

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
I don't just start our buttons kind of

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.150 
I don't just start our buttons kind of
glitchy<00:02:19.600> takes<00:02:20.650> uh-oh
