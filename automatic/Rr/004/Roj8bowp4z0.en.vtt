00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
to turn the twin vortex uses these two

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.100 
to turn the twin vortex uses these two
flaps<00:00:47.129> which<00:00:47.489> always<00:00:47.730> move<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.570> opposite

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
flaps which always move in opposite

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.590 
flaps which always move in opposite
directions<00:00:49.289> they<00:00:50.219> help<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.579> redirect<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.239> air

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
directions they help to redirect the air

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.799 
directions they help to redirect the air

from the main rotors the twin vortex has

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.750 
from the main rotors the twin vortex has
a<00:00:54.870> three-channel<00:00:55.860> infrared<00:00:56.610> controller

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
a three-channel infrared controller

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.700 
a three-channel infrared controller
you've<00:00:57.420> got<00:00:57.600> your<00:00:57.780> throttle<00:00:58.289> over<00:00:58.500> here

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
you've got your throttle over here

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.889 
you've got your throttle over here
that's<00:00:58.949> for<00:00:59.309> going<00:00:59.579> up<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.879> down<00:00:59.969> then<00:01:00.660> you've

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
that's for going up and down then you've

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.380 
that's for going up and down then you've
got<00:01:01.109> your<00:01:01.219> steering<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.270> can

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
got your steering here and you can

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.539 
got your steering here and you can
independently<00:01:03.750> move<00:01:04.500> forward<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.460> your

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
independently move forward on your

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.630 
independently move forward on your
command<00:01:06.299> now<00:01:06.930> interestingly<00:01:07.260> enough<00:01:07.950> there's

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
command now interestingly enough there's

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.609 
command now interestingly enough there's
this<00:01:08.760> little<00:01:08.970> piece<00:01:09.390> sort<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.840> like<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:09.990> shift

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
this little piece sort of like a shift

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.950 
this little piece sort of like a shift
gate<00:01:10.950> from<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.340> car<00:01:11.610> as<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.360> pull<00:01:12.570> off<00:01:12.600> you

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
gate from a car as you can pull off you

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.539 
gate from a car as you can pull off you
just<00:01:13.140> have<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.380> pull<00:01:13.530> off<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.890> extra<00:01:14.369> little

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
just have to pull off this extra little

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.240 
just have to pull off this extra little
thumb<00:01:14.909> finger<00:01:15.720> knob<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.409> top<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.950> this

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
thumb finger knob on the top and this

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.770 
thumb finger knob on the top and this
comes<00:01:17.520> right<00:01:17.729> off<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.240> allows<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.659> to

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
comes right off and that allows you to

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.460 
comes right off and that allows you to
move<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.560> right<00:01:20.369> side<00:01:20.640> stick<00:01:21.180> around<00:01:21.570> 360

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
move this right side stick around 360

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.859 
move this right side stick around 360
degrees<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:23.159> actually<00:01:23.460> can't<00:01:23.700> go<00:01:24.150> backwards

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
degrees you actually can't go backwards

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.289 
degrees you actually can't go backwards
with<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.560> electronics<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.430> twin<00:01:26.850> vortex

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
with the electronics on the twin vortex

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.090 
with the electronics on the twin vortex
but<00:01:27.540> at<00:01:27.630> least<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.930> allows<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.409> turn<00:01:28.650> while

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
but at least it allows you to turn while

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.980 
but at least it allows you to turn while
going<00:01:29.460> forward<00:01:29.939> now<00:01:30.180> there<00:01:30.329> are<00:01:30.450> two<00:01:30.509> trim

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
going forward now there are two trim

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.679 
going forward now there are two trim
abilities<00:01:31.710> here<00:01:32.040> one<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:33.000> knob<00:01:33.360> which

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
abilities here one is that knob which

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.569 
abilities here one is that knob which
allows<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.259> adjust<00:01:34.350> your<00:01:34.740> role<00:01:35.130> or<00:01:35.430> your

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
allows you to adjust your role or your

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.330 
allows you to adjust your role or your
left<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.479> right<00:01:36.720> as<00:01:36.960> viewed<00:01:37.200> from<00:01:37.470> behind<00:01:37.979> you

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
left to right as viewed from behind you

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.789 
left to right as viewed from behind you
can<00:01:38.490> actually<00:01:38.640> trim<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.810> drift<00:01:40.259> out<00:01:40.560> if

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
can actually trim that and drift out if

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.100 
can actually trim that and drift out if
it<00:01:40.890> has<00:01:41.070> any<00:01:41.310> then<00:01:41.820> there's<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.180> regular<00:01:42.659> yaw

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
it has any then there's this regular yaw

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.920 
it has any then there's this regular yaw
control<00:01:43.290> that's<00:01:43.920> your<00:01:44.130> steering<00:01:44.640> trim<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.750> if

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
control that's your steering trim so if

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.380 
control that's your steering trim so if
it's<00:01:46.079> spinning<00:01:47.009> off<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.490> one<00:01:47.820> direction<00:01:48.000> or

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
it's spinning off to one direction or

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.810 
it's spinning off to one direction or
the<00:01:48.450> other<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:49.320> can<00:01:49.619> make<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.040> stop<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.549> and

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
the other you can make it stop that and

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.999 
the other you can make it stop that and
have<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.240> going<00:01:51.600> fairly<00:01:51.930> straight<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.590> like

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
have it going fairly straight I like

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.730 
have it going fairly straight I like

and it's very agile so it requires

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.020 
and it's very agile so it requires
plenty<00:03:41.050> of<00:03:41.140> practice<00:03:41.680> to<00:03:41.950> get<00:03:42.280> used<00:03:42.340> to<00:03:42.790> its

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
plenty of practice to get used to its

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.330 
plenty of practice to get used to its

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
controls and how quickly it can respond

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.240

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
that practice oh man it's just a joy to

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.430 
that practice oh man it's just a joy to
fly<00:03:51.610> around<00:03:51.850> it's<00:03:52.660> a<00:03:52.930> little<00:03:53.170> bit<00:03:53.290> of<00:03:53.380> a

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
fly around it's a little bit of a

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.620 
fly around it's a little bit of a
challenge<00:03:53.740> but<00:03:54.310> it's<00:03:54.370> a<00:03:54.640> good<00:03:54.820> challenge<00:03:55.090> it's

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
challenge but it's a good challenge it's

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.199 
challenge but it's a good challenge it's
not<00:03:55.900> panicky<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:56.770> it's<00:03:56.950> always<00:03:57.250> under<00:03:57.640> your

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
control it's really up to how quickly

you can respond and how well that you
