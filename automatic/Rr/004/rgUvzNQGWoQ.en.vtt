00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.180 

okay<00:02:29.630> so<00:02:30.140> these<00:02:30.290> are<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.560> dropper<00:02:30.829> systems

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
okay so these are the dropper systems

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.660 
okay so these are the dropper systems
that<00:02:31.310> we<00:02:31.400> use<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:36.230> power<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.829> droppers

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
that we use to to power to droppers

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.750 
that we use to to power to droppers
either<00:02:37.850> side<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.269> then<00:02:38.360> a<00:02:38.390> central<00:02:38.750> bit<00:02:39.760> the

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
either side and then a central bit the

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.250 
either side and then a central bit the
central<00:02:41.090> bit<00:02:41.239> dissipates<00:02:41.630> across<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.049> middle

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
central bit dissipates across the middle

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.650 
central bit dissipates across the middle
bar<00:02:42.440> with<00:02:43.250> a<00:02:43.280> cut<00:02:43.519> out<00:02:43.549> bit<00:02:43.910> for<00:02:44.269> where<00:02:44.540> the

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
bar with a cut out bit for where the

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.110 
bar with a cut out bit for where the
button<00:02:44.900> still<00:02:45.110> go<00:02:45.320> and<00:02:46.280> then<00:02:46.610> they<00:02:46.700> just<00:02:46.880> drop

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
button still go and then they just drop

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.900 
button still go and then they just drop
in<00:02:47.269> either<00:02:47.390> side<00:02:48.250> move<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.370> cores<00:02:49.579> out<00:02:49.760> of<00:02:49.850> the

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
in either side move the cores out of the

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.900 
in either side move the cores out of the
way<00:02:50.030> so<00:02:50.510> they<00:02:50.630> don't<00:02:50.810> give<00:02:50.930> you<00:02:51.019> a<00:02:51.079> problem<00:02:51.910> and

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
way so they don't give you a problem and

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.970 
way so they don't give you a problem and
there<00:02:53.030> we<00:02:53.120> are<00:02:53.150> we're<00:02:53.420> ready<00:02:53.600> to<00:02:53.750> go

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.979 

doesn't<00:02:58.760> reduce<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.180> capacity<00:02:59.629> much<00:02:59.780> of<00:02:59.930> the

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
doesn't reduce the capacity much of the

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.770 
doesn't reduce the capacity much of the
boat<00:03:00.170> these<00:03:00.349> boats<00:03:00.590> hold<00:03:00.830> four<00:03:01.129> kilos<00:03:01.700> of<00:03:02.450> bait

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
boat these boats hold four kilos of bait

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.530 
boat these boats hold four kilos of bait
which<00:03:03.049> is<00:03:03.230> more<00:03:03.379> than<00:03:03.560> enough<00:03:03.620> for<00:03:03.920> anyone<00:03:04.280> I

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540

which is more than enough for anyone I
reckon<00:03:05.540> with<00:03:05.629> the<00:03:05.659> hoppers<00:03:05.989> Ian<00:03:06.170> you're<00:03:06.260> still

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:06.409 
reckon with the hoppers Ian you're still

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.080 
reckon with the hoppers Ian you're still
going<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.620> put<00:03:06.769> in<00:03:06.890> about<00:03:06.980> two<00:03:07.400> or<00:03:07.459> three<00:03:07.519> kilos
