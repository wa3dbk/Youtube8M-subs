00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
because when you jailbreak supposedly

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.160 
because when you jailbreak supposedly
Apple<00:00:14.250> says<00:00:14.460> that<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:15.360> don't<00:00:15.719> have<00:00:15.839> warranty

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
anymore but this will restore that

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.480 
anymore but this will restore that
because<00:00:18.869> they<00:00:19.050> can<00:00:19.199> never<00:00:19.350> know<00:00:19.710> whether<00:00:20.310> or

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
because they can never know whether or

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.970 
because they can never know whether or
not<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:20.880> had<00:00:21.180> jailbroken<00:00:21.600> before<00:00:21.960> so<00:00:22.230> this

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
not you had jailbroken before so this

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.320 
not you had jailbroken before so this
will<00:00:23.130> basically<00:00:23.279> get<00:00:23.850> rid<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.090> all<00:00:24.300> your

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
will basically get rid of all your

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.570 
will basically get rid of all your
jailbroken<00:00:24.869> data<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.859> will<00:00:26.070> delete

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
jailbroken data it will delete

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.929 
jailbroken data it will delete
everything<00:00:27.410> it's<00:00:28.410> pretty<00:00:28.830> much<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.670> same<00:00:29.699> as

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
everything it's pretty much the same as

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.720 
everything it's pretty much the same as
restoring<00:00:30.470> except<00:00:31.470> there's<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.800> little<00:00:32.160> trick

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
restoring except there's a little trick

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.240 
restoring except there's a little trick
to<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.540> enter<00:00:33.870> DFU<00:00:34.320> mode<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.739> help<00:00:34.800> avoid

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
to it to enter DFU mode to help avoid

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.760 
to it to enter DFU mode to help avoid
errors<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.870> will<00:00:36.989> delete<00:00:37.230> everything<00:00:37.500> I

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
errors so it will delete everything I

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.580 
errors so it will delete everything I

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
you want to restore to that backup so

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.880

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
to my iCloud and everything should work

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.430 
to my iCloud and everything should work
out<00:00:56.070> if<00:00:56.460> not<00:00:56.789> then<00:00:57.239> don't<00:00:57.510> restore<00:00:58.140> from<00:00:58.289> your

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
out if not then don't restore from your

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.110 
out if not then don't restore from your
iCloud<00:00:58.800> backup<00:00:59.039> I'll<00:00:59.460> get<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.820> later

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120

settings that'll also on gel break your

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.889 
settings that'll also on gel break your
device<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.759> can<00:01:59.820> also<00:02:00.060> do<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.689> then<00:02:00.810> you

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
device you can also do that and then you

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.139 
device you can also do that and then you
also<00:02:00.930> will<00:02:01.439> be<00:02:01.560> able<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.920> restore<00:02:02.850> from<00:02:03.000> an

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.839 
restore those contacts and all that data
if<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:26.910> want<00:02:27.150> but<00:02:28.019> if<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.680> backup<00:02:28.890> messes<00:02:29.730> up

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
if you want but if the backup messes up

your<00:02:29.970> iPod<00:02:30.269> and<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.540> still<00:02:30.780> get<00:02:30.930> some

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
your iPod and you still get some

your iPod and you still get some
jailbroken<00:02:31.590> data<00:02:31.769> mixed<00:02:32.130> in<00:02:32.280> there<00:02:32.430> like<00:02:32.670> if

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
jailbroken data mixed in there like if

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.120 
jailbroken data mixed in there like if
the<00:02:33.209> city<00:02:33.420> app<00:02:33.630> is<00:02:33.840> still<00:02:34.110> there<00:02:34.319> then

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
the city app is still there then

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.860 
the city app is still there then
definitely<00:02:35.640> set<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.180> up<00:02:36.269> as<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.420> new<00:02:36.569> iPod

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
definitely set it up as a new iPod

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.330 
definitely set it up as a new iPod
because<00:02:36.989> that<00:02:37.260> means<00:02:37.349> you<00:02:37.500> backed<00:02:37.769> up<00:02:37.980> too

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
because that means you backed up too

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.320 
because that means you backed up too
much<00:02:38.519> data<00:02:39.019> but<00:02:40.019> really<00:02:40.349> that's<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:41.180> you<00:02:42.180> can

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
much data but really that's it you can

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.820 
much data but really that's it you can
just<00:02:42.360> say<00:02:42.480> continue<00:02:43.019> you<00:02:43.140> can<00:02:43.230> do<00:02:43.410> this<00:02:43.590> you

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
just say continue you can do this you

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.300 
just say continue you can do this you
can<00:02:43.860> do<00:02:44.730> all<00:02:44.880> these<00:02:44.970> settings<00:02:45.180> yourself<00:02:46.310> your
