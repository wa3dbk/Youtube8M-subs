00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
going to want to do is pull our power

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.080 
going to want to do is pull our power
off<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.239> aim<00:02:21.780> for<00:02:21.810> 55<00:02:22.620> knots<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.730> this<00:02:23.879> will

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
off and aim for 55 knots and this will

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.630 
off and aim for 55 knots and this will
help<00:02:24.120> slow<00:02:24.569> the<00:02:24.599> plane<00:02:24.959> down<00:02:25.140> for<00:02:25.829> a<00:02:25.859> nice<00:02:26.129> soft

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
help slow the plane down for a nice soft

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:37.660 
help slow the plane down for a nice soft
landing

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
we're going to want to do is tap on the

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.949 
we're going to want to do is tap on the
foot<00:02:43.560> pedals<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.220> this<00:02:44.340> will<00:02:44.520> help<00:02:44.550> us<00:02:44.959> slow

slow down to a nice speed to maneuver on
the<00:02:51.000> ground<00:02:51.239> will<00:02:52.080> control<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.680> plane<00:02:52.890> using

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
the ground will control the plane using

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.020 
the ground will control the plane using
