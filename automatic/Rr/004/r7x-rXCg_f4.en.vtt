00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:07.930
 we have pressed up we have 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:10.630
 started well and when you play so high 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.900
 they are lethal players on the counter 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.429
 and they can hurt you a lot and it has been 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.550
 a bit like that the story of the 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:22.050
 play off 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.060
 I would have liked to have arrived 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.320
 rest at least with a goal that we 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.840
 I would have given hope 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.520
 despite this result in the second 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.940
 part if we had scored a goal 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.610
 quick you get inside the game but 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.950
 the goal of robben has left us touched 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.020
 psychologically you know that you have to 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.250
 score 5 goals in half an hour and this is 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:50.180
 very difficult the wardrobe is touched is 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.400
 painful but we have to try 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.430
 react and win the league as soon as 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.430
 possible 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.890
 well I think you have to look at 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.040
 global 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.040
 we have not passed we are sad about it 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.900
 We wanted to be in wembley yes or yes but 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.000
 yes it is true that personally 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.970
 Despite conceding goals not very 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.750
 I'm unhappy in this sense I have 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.630
 a lot to improve but I think I was at 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.640
 level 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.640
 I know it is a high level competition 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.670
 If the rival is superior to you, you do not have 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.070
 to say that happiness is a 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.190
 very big competition I think that 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.200
 we have arrived just 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.960
 to this competition where it requires a 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.180
 It requires tremendous effort 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.890
 and many things many arguments and 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.280
 maybe we have just arrived from 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.940
 they have arrived quite whole with 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.920
 enough arguments and in the end there's no 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.810
 another to congratulate them well I think that 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.810
 the results of the two matches leaves 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.390
 clear the superiority that they have had 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.070
 about us 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.630
 There is no other choice but to accept it. I think that 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.310
 by attitude has not been the team has given 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.950
 everything to try to get it so much 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.440
 there like here we have found a 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.540
 superior rival in both matches and already 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.980
 I have made you congratulate them for the great 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.720
 game that we two have done 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.270
 matches and not during all the 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.910
 competition and wish them luck for the 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.459
 final and nothing else we forget this 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.600
 competition already and focus on how much 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.600
 before getting to win the league
