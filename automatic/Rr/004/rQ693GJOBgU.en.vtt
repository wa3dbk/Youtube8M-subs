00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.060
 something we explain in 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.160
 English so we really try to 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.840
 maximum at the beginning it's a bit difficult 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.670
 but we do it right away and 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.800

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.809
 true school case 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.180
 it's often quite passive 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:10.549
 we really try to combine the assets 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.549

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.350
