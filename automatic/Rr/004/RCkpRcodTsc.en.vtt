once you do land on that ledge which can

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.820 
once you do land on that ledge which can
be<00:01:11.119> a<00:01:11.149> little<00:01:11.360> bit<00:01:11.570> tricky<00:01:12.020> because<00:01:12.440> the<00:01:12.590> ledge

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
be a little bit tricky because the ledge

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.029 
be a little bit tricky because the ledge
is<00:01:13.009> rather<00:01:13.280> small<00:01:13.520> but<00:01:14.509> and<00:01:14.840> you<00:01:15.530> will<00:01:15.740> do<00:01:15.920> it

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:16.039 
is rather small but and you will do it

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:18.520 
is rather small but and you will do it
in<00:01:16.220> a<00:01:16.610> few<00:01:17.090> tries<00:01:17.360> I<00:01:17.630> wouldn't<00:01:17.869> say<00:01:17.960> a<00:01:17.990> fair<00:01:18.259> try

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
in a few tries I wouldn't say a fair try

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.590 
in a few tries I wouldn't say a fair try
today<00:01:18.950> expect<00:01:19.430> to<00:01:19.520> do<00:01:19.640> switch<00:01:19.940> first<00:01:20.300> time

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
today expect to do switch first time

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.420 
today expect to do switch first time
every<00:01:20.960> town<00:01:21.200> because<00:01:21.410> it<00:01:21.530> may<00:01:21.710> take<00:01:22.100> a<00:01:22.369> couple

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
every town because it may take a couple

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.240 
every town because it may take a couple
of<00:01:22.940> tries<00:01:23.270> first<00:01:23.600> so<00:01:24.410> once<00:01:24.560> you<00:01:24.680> are<00:01:24.830> up<00:01:25.009> here

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
of tries first so once you are up here

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.910 
of tries first so once you are up here
what<00:01:25.550> you<00:01:25.640> want<00:01:25.820> to<00:01:25.880> do<00:01:25.970> is<00:01:26.119> basically<00:01:26.570> 10<00:01:26.960> 180

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
what you want to do is basically 10 180

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.990 
what you want to do is basically 10 180
degrees<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:28.640> you<00:01:28.789> want<00:01:28.940> to<00:01:29.000> turn<00:01:29.210> around<00:01:29.479> and

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
degrees so you want to turn around and

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.160 
degrees so you want to turn around and

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
basically all the zombies are going to

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.130 
basically all the zombies are going to
simply<00:01:33.649> pile<00:01:34.310> up<00:01:34.520> right<00:01:35.119> where<00:01:35.540> you<00:01:35.689> drop<00:01:35.930> down

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
lots of zombies start falling down but

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.109 
lots of zombies start falling down but
luckily<00:01:45.439> for<00:01:45.799> us<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:45.950> zombies<00:01:46.490> do<00:01:46.700> come<00:01:46.939> back

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
luckily for us the zombies do come back

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.730 
luckily for us the zombies do come back
up<00:01:47.270> there<00:01:47.450> just<00:01:47.659> carry<00:01:47.900> on<00:01:47.960> doing<00:01:48.140> a<00:01:48.290> cycle<00:01:48.710> of

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
up there just carry on doing a cycle of

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.859 
up there just carry on doing a cycle of
crime<00:01:49.100> and<00:01:49.369> falling<00:01:50.119> down<00:01:50.270> on<00:01:50.299> climbing<00:01:50.720> back

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
crime and falling down on climbing back

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.319 
crime and falling down on climbing back
up<00:01:50.900> so<00:01:51.590> this<00:01:51.770> glitzy<00:01:52.159> pretty<00:01:52.460> much<00:01:52.610> unlimited

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
up so this glitzy pretty much unlimited
