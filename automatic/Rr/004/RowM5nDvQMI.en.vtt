00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
testing the stove out here let's go and

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.090 
testing the stove out here let's go and
take<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.060> look<00:00:36.240> at<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.590> this<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.860> prototype

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
take a look at it this is the prototype

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.940 
take a look at it this is the prototype
I've<00:00:38.550> been<00:00:38.700> working<00:00:39.030> on<00:00:39.290> this<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.500> basically

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
I've been working on this is basically

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.100 
I've been working on this is basically
just<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.370> straight<00:00:41.760> bio<00:00:42.030> stove<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.750> can<00:00:42.930> see

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
just a straight bio stove you can see

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.530 
just a straight bio stove you can see
the<00:00:43.230> wick<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.860> everything<00:00:44.270> side<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.450> it

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
the wick on it and everything side of it

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:52.729 
the wick on it and everything side of it
and<00:00:45.720> put<00:00:46.290> it<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:47.690> Phyllis<00:00:48.690> toefl<00:00:49.140> alcohol<00:00:51.739> now

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
and put it on Phyllis toefl alcohol now

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.270 
and put it on Phyllis toefl alcohol now
this<00:00:53.370> goes<00:00:53.670> down<00:00:53.850> over<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.239> Jets<00:00:54.570> and

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
this goes down over the Jets and

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.500 
this goes down over the Jets and
basically<00:00:56.280> turns<00:00:56.880> a<00:00:57.090> stove<00:00:57.420> into<00:00:58.200> an<00:00:58.290> ISIL<00:00:58.620> fly

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
basically turns a stove into an ISIL fly

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.790 
basically turns a stove into an ISIL fly
so<00:01:00.510> now<00:01:00.690> you've<00:01:00.840> got<00:01:01.020> two<00:01:01.170> different<00:01:01.350> stoves

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
so now you've got two different stoves

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.170 
so now you've got two different stoves
you've<00:01:02.040> got<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> bios<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.480> an<00:01:04.320> ISO<00:01:04.500> fly<00:01:04.909> all<00:01:05.909> in

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
you've got a bios and an ISO fly all in

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.039 
you've got a bios and an ISO fly all in
one<00:01:06.329> unit<00:01:06.509> by<00:01:06.780> just<00:01:07.020> adding<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.470> top<00:01:09.049> that's

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
one unit by just adding this top that's

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.719 
one unit by just adding this top that's
what<00:01:10.200> I'm<00:01:10.290> working<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:13.280> out<00:01:14.280> here<00:01:14.310> I'm
