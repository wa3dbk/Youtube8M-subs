00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.430
 hello rockets 

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.990
 Today I received a package called 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.690
 this 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.690
 She Kalinina process store 

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:11.799
 he's called a client like children like 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:12.829
 told 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:14.540
 and the manufacturer itself 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.540
 called and so is the mayor of the pole here 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.810
 but the pros are not a plus now we'll figure it out 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.789
 so 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.589
 Manufacturers on the belt model is almost 9 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:28.169
 let's open it 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.499
 we have such a young man 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:33.560
 so 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.000
 I have already cut a little above 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.970
 look 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.970
 now we will hide 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.750
 which means the box is completely ready 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.769
 and we can 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:50.260
 and see 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.690
 so the front of the prom that is the rate which 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.730
 right away 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.580
 Ben Saar Plaza II which 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.020
 the main thing is to reveal the parties here 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.340
 prophet specified 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.269
 the name of the goods is the type that's the parents Katya 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.350
 scales 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.070
 painted goods themselves 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.370
 model 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.010
 title 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.500
 I do not know why the cremer is written here 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.960
 well I think in this answer here we get 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.480
 concern withdraws all the same 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.820
 I think there should be an explanation in 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.940
 box style 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.980
 on the right side read on 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.980
 English language 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.250
 so she should focus now 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.650
 here in English is indicated here 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.790
 This is such a small price structure. 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.970
 apply this device 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.180
 here indicated in the service life if you 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.460
 Can children written here 5 years 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.350
 I do not know why the right is a little bit but 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.450
 here a limited period of use he 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.770
 prime 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.969
 and chicago 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.799
 mean interest also I read on the site 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.099
 Japanese manufacturer well then 

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:06.160
 have power is about the error 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.519
 that it is impossible to cut lines he 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.819
 cow and tee years 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.899
 and all the others so on the left side of Moscow 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:16.269
 we go 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.099
 signing percentage 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.109
 where 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:21.420
 there is English Russian 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.290
 my happiness knowledge of english actor 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.689
 not useful here 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.369
 so it is written which means that uk indication 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:31.290
 smooth out h 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.889
 except contempt to remove the cards 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.939
 so let's open our cheater 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.800
 he opens it for the first time therefore 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.049
 and myself to supervise 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.019
 a bit illogical 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.280
 and means that among is here means 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:48.809
 machine itself 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:51.559
 and what the weather of Moscow means 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:52.650
 percent 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.590
 written in Ukrainian if someone 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.870
 does not know attacks 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.180
 title and no well as I said 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.619
 don't look at the truth 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:03.589
 models with 9 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:05.309
 mean it 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:07.869
 pieces of paper online store but not us 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:10.709
 she is interested in tactics and we will all 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.689
 still 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.769
 candidate himself 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.719
 brush verses coming 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:20.759
 but to her, but let's go back like tomorrow 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:24.109
 it means 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.109
 warranty card 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.989
 critics and cues 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.349
 but this is law mashka 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.029
 as local centers wrote 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:41.629
 so it came that the goods as brought 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.759
 from russia though will make chinese 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:46.619
 Ukraine, it is not officially shipped then 

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:47.439
 there is a stage 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:49.589
 name of service centers that are 

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:53.069
 only in Russia but it is a Russian product 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.739
 warranty card naturally not 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.809
 are filled 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:59.149
 the shop is not very prestigious which I 

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:00.659
 took more 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:02.949
 I was cheated on almost 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:05.929
 be 10 dollars 

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:08.859
 but nothing 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.069
 the latter addition is such a code 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.159
 more nothing here let's go 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:14.999
 let's see what is here 

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:16.049
 mean in this 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.609
 complex represent themselves 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.120
 information about us 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.650
 security and mesh that is in the family of mur 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.349
 supplied in pfo 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:25.809
 bunk cars 

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:28.960
 and the second tarp point from what it works 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.770
 how to teach, I think that all the same not 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.879
 as interesting as yourself 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:37.210
 so here's the car 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.210
 we can look at it now I'll get it 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:43.749
 after itself represents viburnum 

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:45.639
 mean pen here 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.639
 going down 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:50.630
 ride 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.249
 I 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:54.680
 so we have a pen 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.419
 which can be used that is 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.419
 like this after all take off 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.479
 I think it is much more convenient 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.059
 mean what is it 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:07.419
 it's anas 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.419
 arch track gauge 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:14.999
 Well, so that the garbage that cut it 

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:15.870
 not you 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.520
 and before the trial 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.559
 means 

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:20.889
 and I develop that 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:24.219
 This machine still runs on batteries. 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:27.370
 Now Iâ€™ll try to come up with something 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.300
 and look 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.300
 how young works on batteries 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:35.819
 and affect the first time 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:38.349
 therefore, he himself does not yet know how here that 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:39.719
 open well there is 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:41.710
 which lever 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.819
 he catch that is turn on off 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:47.819
 and boiler motors so 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:50.650
 I do not know how to open 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.069
 so as not to break 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:57.069
 we'll see 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.680
 honestly i say 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.680
 I do not understand how it works 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:08.839
 Traktovaya street bargained 

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:11.649
 okay now let's see 

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:14.649
 box to prove something 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.619
 Yes 

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:21.930
 no tenge in general 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.319
 here it is 

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:27.319
 here is our 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:31.080
 who is 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.419
 kvass 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:33.800
 Brodsky from 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.310
 machine ready for use 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.349
 it remains only to put her medalist 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:41.389
 and add revenue 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:43.849
 Here's a car chk drove for what is not 

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:44.539
 smog 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:47.539
 take off 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:50.559
 the entrance is this container 

00:06:50.559 --> 00:06:52.379
 for 

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:54.110

 we shoot crocker spiral typewriter and 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:04.729
 try 

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:06.509
 remove the cap 

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:09.800
 for batteries and so the cap is removed 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.469
 so we see 

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:14.389
 what the power has got two 

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:15.759
 holes 

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:17.919
 naturally the ships leave the dogs they and 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:18.589
 those 

00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:21.339
 I do not know what to call such batteries 

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:22.809
 but 

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:25.720
 will read to japan 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.490

 ambushed ambassador 

00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:52.569
 principle, so far plastic 

00:07:52.569 --> 00:07:54.979
 I like the machine thanks for the theme 

00:07:54.979 --> 00:07:56.219
