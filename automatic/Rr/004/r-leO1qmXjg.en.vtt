this particular racket is ten point six
ounce<00:00:59.190> or<00:00:59.430> 300<00:00:59.879> grams<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.840> took<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.079> little<00:01:01.289> bit

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
ounce or 300 grams we took a little bit

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.609 
ounce or 300 grams we took a little bit
off<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.680> black<00:01:02.039> 100<00:01:02.579> from<00:01:02.730> last<00:01:02.969> year<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.619> we

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
off the black 100 from last year and we

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.080 
off the black 100 from last year and we
distributed<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.189> weight<00:01:05.400> towards<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.909> head

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
distributed the weight towards the head

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.359 
distributed the weight towards the head
and<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:06.750> increase<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.140> beam<00:01:07.560> by<00:01:07.799> one<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.189> two

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
and we increase the beam by one to two

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.670 
and we increase the beam by one to two
millimeters<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:09.150> there's<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.390> 24<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.020> 26

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
millimeters so there's a 24 to 26

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.609 
millimeters so there's a 24 to 26
millimeter<00:01:11.250> range<00:01:11.610> which<00:01:12.510> helps<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.930> drive

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
millimeter range which helps you drive

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.410 
millimeter range which helps you drive
the<00:01:13.860> ball<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.250> hit<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.369> heavier<00:01:14.760> ball<00:01:15.060> by

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
the ball and hit a heavier ball by

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.179 
the ball and hit a heavier ball by
having<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.780> nice<00:01:15.990> heavy<00:01:16.259> swing<00:01:16.650> weight<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:17.040> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
having a nice heavy swing weight in the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.640 
having a nice heavy swing weight in the
320s<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.180> particular<00:01:18.390> frame<00:01:19.049> it's

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
320s on this particular frame it's

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.960 
320s on this particular frame it's
comparable<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.340> pure<00:01:20.520> drive<00:01:20.759> from

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
comparable to the pure drive from

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.390 
comparable to the pure drive from
babolat<00:01:21.390> or<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.780> juice<00:01:22.020> from<00:01:22.229> Wilson<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.250> if

racquet<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.509> warrior<00:01:30.920> 100<00:01:31.920> team<00:01:32.310> version

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
racquet is the warrior 100 team version

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.999 
racquet is the warrior 100 team version
it's<00:01:33.390> nine<00:01:33.689> point<00:01:33.990> nine<00:01:34.079> ounce<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.799> it's<00:01:34.920> a

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
it's nine point nine ounce so it's a

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.120 
it's nine point nine ounce so it's a
half<00:01:35.159> ounce<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.640> lighter<00:01:36.259> 280<00:01:37.259> grams<00:01:37.439> it's

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
half ounce have lighter 280 grams it's

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.270 
half ounce have lighter 280 grams it's
also<00:01:38.369> for<00:01:38.790> points<00:01:39.210> headlight<00:01:39.860> so<00:01:40.860> it's<00:01:41.040> a

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
also for points headlight so it's a

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.670 
also for points headlight so it's a
