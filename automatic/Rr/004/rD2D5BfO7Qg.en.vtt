00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.160
 it has them all these operators then 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.349
 I hope you are well 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.020
 today I'm going to show you the 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.410
 ninten display plugin while s &amp; p 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.660
 guÃ®nes 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.550
 as you can see this plugin 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.670
 allows you to ask items 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.689
 which on a block this theme in 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.830
 question we can not pick it up so that 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.649
 can be a decorative pipeline or 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.960
 yeah no I do not see how he can 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.530
 to serve apart decoration but I am 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.390
 sure that you will find then for for 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.989
 float this item on a block 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.289
 you have to type the item command 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.739
 where is it going to activate the plugin lo 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.989
 cultivated you have to be in 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.239
 survival 1 because in creativ-service 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.300
 many move you will see if 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.920
 you do not care so there you 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.920
 take a people in your hand if you 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.640
 want to put on the block and you do 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.080
 a left click just tap on it 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.700
 so now you've asked the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.470
 but you realize that you 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.790
 wanted to put the library and at 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.030
 place of gluttonous forgiveness I 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.990
 confuse me 5 to remove it just 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.770
 to do shift right click here so 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.369
 it's the delete you can ask 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.880
 system on any blog look 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:35.159
 as it works 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.780
 except for the gravel and the sahb all 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.329
 just because if someone 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.850
 digs below his blogs that you 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.159
 they will fall and it will bug the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:51.000
 plugin so better not you look at a 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:53.070
 do not eat it then so if you 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.090
 want to have all the orders of this 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:01.320
 plugin you do it mdm 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:04.829
 So here are all the commands 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.049
 so items list it bleeds like in 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.569
 a that you can use that I you 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:14.010
 so advise it mt list 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.200
 so that actually tells you what item you 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.890
 asked or what items are asked 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:25.090
 by which 5 blain 5 block around you 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:29.260
 so here I think I said it all 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:36.670
 so here you delete the items hop 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:40.830
 you put it very easy huh that's it 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.840
 so we will not abuse anyway 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.120
 here is emma I hope this little 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.630
 presentation of the theme display it you 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:53.880
 will be better so here is a small 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.880
