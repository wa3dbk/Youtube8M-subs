00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.010 
you get in EMGs when you do know some
palm<00:06:29.650> use<00:06:29.980> they<00:06:30.250> don't<00:06:30.460> quite<00:06:30.790> you<00:06:31.690> know<00:06:31.720> they

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:33.760 
don't quite get it quite as much as you

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.640 
don't quite get it quite as much as you

do with the MGS that could be down to my
technique<00:06:36.100> I'm<00:06:36.370> not<00:06:36.490> the<00:06:36.580> greatest<00:06:36.940> player

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:37.980

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:48.730 
if you want to change tuning so i would

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.510 
if you want to change tuning so i would
say<00:06:48.880> it's<00:06:49.060> not<00:06:49.410> not<00:06:50.410> really<00:06:50.680> a<00:06:50.710> great<00:06:51.010> guitar
