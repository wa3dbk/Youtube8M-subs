00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
really nice and like I said it's pretty

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.450 
really nice and like I said it's pretty
inexpensive<00:02:45.780> this<00:02:46.380> is<00:02:46.590> definitely<00:02:47.280> worth

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
inexpensive this is definitely worth

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.210 
inexpensive this is definitely worth
checking<00:02:47.640> out<00:02:48.150> I<00:02:48.560> really<00:02:49.560> like<00:02:49.770> their<00:02:50.010> stuff

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
checking out I really like their stuff

for another phone we have coming up here
in<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.810> review<00:02:55.850> but<00:02:56.850> this<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.180> really<00:02:58.340> probably

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
in a review but this is really probably

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.390 
in a review but this is really probably
my<00:02:59.700> favorite<00:03:00.120> favorite<00:03:00.800> design<00:03:01.800> for<00:03:02.100> a<00:03:02.130> case

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
my favorite favorite design for a case

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.270 
my favorite favorite design for a case
just<00:03:02.430> because<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.360> slide<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.870> slide<00:03:04.410> in<00:03:04.709> the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
just because you slide the slide in the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.190 
just because you slide the slide in the
original<00:03:05.520> design<00:03:06.120> pick<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:06.750> out<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:07.020> know

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
original design pick it out you know

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.690 
original design pick it out you know
it's<00:03:07.410> not<00:03:07.560> going<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.770> be<00:03:07.860> scratched<00:03:08.220> from<00:03:08.490> this

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
it's not going to be scratched from this

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.330 
it's not going to be scratched from this
material<00:03:09.240> and<00:03:09.500> you<00:03:10.500> want<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.709> keep<00:03:10.860> this<00:03:11.010> slim

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
material and you want to keep this slim

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.680 
material and you want to keep this slim
I<00:03:11.490> really<00:03:11.790> don't<00:03:11.970> like<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.270> use<00:03:12.300> screen

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
I really don't like to use screen

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
protectors and that sort of thing just

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.760 
protectors and that sort of thing just
because<00:03:14.520> it<00:03:14.640> damages<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.330> original<00:03:15.959> glass

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
because it damages the original glass

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
that I have the pouch on there I don't

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.199 
that I have the pouch on there I don't
have<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.350> worry<00:03:22.530> about<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.980> not<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.790> whole<00:03:24.060> lot

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
have to worry about it not a whole lot

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.710 
have to worry about it not a whole lot
of<00:03:24.360> shock<00:03:24.570> protection<00:03:25.370> but<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:27.330> know<00:03:27.450> I'm<00:03:27.570> not

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
of shock protection but you know I'm not

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.400 
of shock protection but you know I'm not
real<00:03:27.989> rough<00:03:28.290> with<00:03:28.560> my<00:03:28.820> my<00:03:29.820> devices<00:03:30.420> now<00:03:31.230> if<00:03:31.320> you

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
real rough with my my devices now if you

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.750 
real rough with my my devices now if you
didn't<00:03:31.620> want<00:03:31.739> a<00:03:31.769> lot<00:03:31.920> of<00:03:31.950> shock<00:03:32.190> protection<00:03:32.459> if

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
didn't want a lot of shock protection if

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.860 
didn't want a lot of shock protection if
you're<00:03:32.850> going<00:03:32.940> to<00:03:33.000> be<00:03:33.090> tossing<00:03:33.330> this<00:03:33.570> enough

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
you're going to be tossing this enough

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.100 
you're going to be tossing this enough
in<00:03:34.610> an<00:03:35.610> area<00:03:35.880> with<00:03:36.180> a<00:03:36.209> lot<00:03:36.269> of<00:03:36.480> where<00:03:36.989> it's

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
in an area with a lot of where it's

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.330 
in an area with a lot of where it's
going<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.290> jingle<00:03:37.650> around<00:03:37.739> you<00:03:38.010> may<00:03:38.130> want<00:03:38.310> to

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
going to jingle around you may want to

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.310 
going to jingle around you may want to
go<00:03:38.400> elsewhere<00:03:38.670> but<00:03:39.540> for<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.810> most<00:03:39.989> part<00:03:40.110> I

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
go elsewhere but for the most part I

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.259 
go elsewhere but for the most part I
think<00:03:40.350> this<00:03:40.709> will<00:03:40.920> suit<00:03:41.400> most<00:03:41.670> people's<00:03:42.060> needs

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
think this will suit most people's needs

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.880 
think this will suit most people's needs
and<00:03:42.510> like<00:03:42.630> I<00:03:42.750> said<00:03:42.810> it's<00:03:43.080> very<00:03:43.590> inexpensive

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
and like I said it's very inexpensive

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.120 
and like I said it's very inexpensive
very<00:03:44.670> competitive<00:03:45.300> price<00:03:45.570> and<00:03:46.130> probably

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
very competitive price and probably

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.070 
very competitive price and probably
built<00:03:47.489> better<00:03:47.730> than<00:03:48.030> most<00:03:48.300> things<00:03:48.600> I've<00:03:48.840> seen

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
built better than most things I've seen

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.350 
built better than most things I've seen
care<00:03:49.800> was<00:03:50.010> taken<00:03:50.040> that<00:03:50.610> they<00:03:50.760> have<00:03:50.850> any<00:03:50.970> extra

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
care was taken that they have any extra

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.570 
care was taken that they have any extra
any<00:03:51.870> extra<00:03:52.350> little<00:03:52.500> strings<00:03:52.950> hanging<00:03:53.250> off

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
any extra little strings hanging off

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.790 
any extra little strings hanging off
that<00:03:53.880> sort<00:03:54.180> of<00:03:54.239> thing<00:03:54.300> so<00:03:55.080> just<00:03:55.320> real<00:03:55.530> simple

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
that sort of thing so just real simple

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.350 
that sort of thing so just real simple
but<00:03:56.010> again<00:03:57.260> really<00:03:58.260> good<00:03:58.730> simple<00:03:59.730> design<00:04:00.060> and
