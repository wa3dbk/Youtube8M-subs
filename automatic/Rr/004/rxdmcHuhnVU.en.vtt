friends since they had they had the last
time<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.199> put<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.530> world<00:00:49.739> up<00:00:49.829> for<00:00:49.980> download<00:00:50.309> and

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
time I put the world up for download and

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.490 
time I put the world up for download and
it's<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.210> portions<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.899> Mahdi<00:00:52.079> portion

it's the portions the Mahdi portion
effects<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:52.980> you've<00:00:53.100> got<00:00:53.219> swiftness<00:00:53.719> for<00:00:54.719> our

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
effects so you've got swiftness for our

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.119 
effects so you've got swiftness for our
haste<00:00:55.170> for<00:00:55.589> strange<00:00:56.280> foreign<00:00:56.820> jumpers<00:00:57.239> tois

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
haste for strange foreign jumpers tois

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.040 
haste for strange foreign jumpers tois
and<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.280> roll<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.730> limited<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.600> you'll<00:01:00.809> have

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
and the roll and limited so you'll have

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.009 
and the roll and limited so you'll have
these<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:01.469> how<00:01:01.769> long<00:01:01.980> time<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.609> if<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.570> do<00:01:03.749> get

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
these for how long time so if you do get

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.840 
these for how long time so if you do get
that's<00:01:04.230> when<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.440> don't<00:01:04.559> want<00:01:04.769> them<00:01:04.890> out<00:01:04.980> I'm

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
that's when you don't want them out I'm

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.430 
that's when you don't want them out I'm
not<00:01:06.060> sure<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.300> little<00:01:06.570> walking<00:01:06.960> really

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
not sure this little walking really

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.790 
not sure this little walking really
don't<00:01:07.710> know<00:01:08.210> so<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.750> get<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.650> get

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
don't know so you get that you get

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.340 
don't know so you get that you get
infinite<00:01:11.220> Hale<00:01:11.430> F<00:01:11.820> they're<00:01:12.600> swaps<00:01:12.900> I'm<00:01:13.200> not

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
infinite Hale F they're swaps I'm not

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.980 
infinite Hale F they're swaps I'm not
should<00:01:13.530> for<00:01:13.710> walk<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.850> get<00:01:15.090> all<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.540> XP<00:01:15.960> that

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
should for walk you get all the XP that

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.130 
should for walk you get all the XP that
you<00:01:16.229> can<00:01:16.380> see<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.619> though<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.990> 32767<00:01:18.990> over

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
you can see you though the 32767 over

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.560 
you can see you though the 32767 over
and<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:20.399> get<00:01:20.549> infinite<00:01:21.119> breathing

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
and you get infinite breathing

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.929 
and you get infinite breathing
underwater<00:01:21.840> I'm<00:01:22.170> sure<00:01:22.380> as<00:01:22.530> well<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.040> that

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
underwater I'm sure as well so that

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.399 
underwater I'm sure as well so that
should<00:01:24.119> all<00:01:24.240> be<00:01:24.360> good<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.810> also<00:01:24.960> get<00:01:25.229> this

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
should all be good you also get this

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.800 
should all be good you also get this

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
just if you want take the portions away

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.980 
just if you want take the portions away
