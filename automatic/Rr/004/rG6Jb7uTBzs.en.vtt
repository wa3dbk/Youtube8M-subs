00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
1630 racing gears here's a cover plate

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.180 
1630 racing gears here's a cover plate
that<00:01:02.699> goes<00:01:02.789> over<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.239> motor<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.949> these<00:01:04.949> are

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
that goes over this motor and these are

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.340 
that goes over this motor and these are
three<00:01:05.460> examples<00:01:05.640> I'd<00:01:06.420> say<00:01:06.750> save<00:01:07.020> everything

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
three examples I'd say save everything

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.060 
three examples I'd say save everything
if<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.460> can<00:01:08.780> take<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> look<00:01:10.170> here<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.039> a

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
if you can take a look here this is a

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.279 
if you can take a look here this is a
stock<00:01:11.460> primary<00:01:12.420> gear<00:01:12.659> i<00:01:12.690> believe<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.170> or

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:13.289 
stock primary gear i believe is it or

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:15.350 
stock primary gear i believe is it or
drive<00:01:13.560> shaft<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.640> can<00:01:14.820> see<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.149> size

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
drive shaft you can see the size

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.770 
drive shaft you can see the size
difference<00:01:16.250> in<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:18.920> in<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:19.979> gear<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:21.450> racing

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
difference in the in the gear the racing

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.010 
difference in the in the gear the racing
gear<00:01:21.899> is<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.110> lot<00:01:22.490> taller<00:01:23.490> or<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.030> lot<00:01:24.240> larger<00:01:24.569> in

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
gear right in here all this all these

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:34.940 
gear right in here all this all these
things<00:01:33.450> do<00:01:33.600> they<00:01:34.140> just<00:01:34.380> slip<00:01:34.590> right<00:01:34.619> in

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
things do they just slip right in

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.389 
things do they just slip right in
there's<00:01:35.399> no<00:01:36.470> welding<00:01:37.470> or<00:01:37.619> pins<00:01:37.890> or<00:01:38.130> anything

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.690 
there's no welding or pins or anything
they<00:01:38.520> slip<00:01:38.819> in<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.060> slip<00:01:39.149> out<00:01:39.390> if<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.500> uh

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
they slip in and slip out if this uh

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.210 
they slip in and slip out if this uh
secondary<00:01:41.700> gear<00:01:41.940> is<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.330> bit<00:01:43.049> smaller<00:01:43.409> that

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
secondary gear is a bit smaller that

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.350 
secondary gear is a bit smaller that
gives<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.549> arm<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:47.490> 60<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.000> 70

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
gives you the arm the 60 and 70

gives you the arm the 60 and 70
mile-an-hour<00:01:48.539> range<00:01:49.159> instead<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:51.259> 35<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.409> 45

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:53.629 
mile-an-hour range instead of 35 to 45

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:56.809 
mile-an-hour range instead of 35 to 45
the<00:01:54.629> only<00:01:54.899> thing<00:01:55.800> you<00:01:55.860> have<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.009> best<00:01:56.429> fit<00:01:56.670> this

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
the only thing you have to best fit this

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:00.440 
the only thing you have to best fit this
in<00:01:57.030> which<00:01:57.209> is<00:01:57.360> easy<00:01:57.690> to<00:01:57.869> do<00:01:58.970> and<00:01:59.970> what<00:02:00.179> I<00:02:00.209> do<00:02:00.300> is

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
in which is easy to do and what I do is

in which is easy to do and what I do is
I'm<00:02:00.810> if<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.410> get<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> new<00:02:01.739> engine<00:02:02.390> I'll<00:02:03.530> tear<00:02:04.530> it

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
I'm if I get a new engine I'll tear it

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.770 
I'm if I get a new engine I'll tear it
down<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:05.899> this<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.140> belt<00:02:08.390> these<00:02:09.390> are<00:02:09.539> thirty

honda band a bit belt that i can take a
look<00:02:15.269> at<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.420> belt<00:02:15.629> see<00:02:15.930> how<00:02:16.050> much<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:16.410> where

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
look at the belt see how much in where

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.440 
look at the belt see how much in where
the<00:02:17.430> engine<00:02:17.700> has<00:02:17.870> this<00:02:18.870> engine<00:02:20.060> cost<00:02:21.060> me<00:02:21.269> a<00:02:21.300> lot

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
the engine has this engine cost me a lot

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.900 
the engine has this engine cost me a lot
of<00:02:21.510> money<00:02:21.629> and<00:02:22.610> III<00:02:23.610> think<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.510> was<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:25.819> lot<00:02:26.819> of

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
of money and III think it was a lot of

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
of money and III think it was a lot of
things<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.150> stripped<00:02:27.420> off<00:02:27.540> her<00:02:27.720> for<00:02:27.870> the

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
things that stripped off her for the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.930 
things that stripped off her for the
price<00:02:28.170> which<00:02:28.410> i'm<00:02:28.530> not<00:02:28.560> happy<00:02:28.860> about<00:02:29.040> but<00:02:29.879> I

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
price which i'm not happy about but I

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.399
