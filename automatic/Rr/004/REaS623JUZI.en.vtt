00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.000
 hello that such welcome friends are 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.010
 efficient chapter of the debut course after 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.690
 my name is Carlos Arturo and well then 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.450
 in this chapter we're going to look at what 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.520
 men are searching the 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.410
 tunnels in your allow us to give you a 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.300
 small effect to our photos and good 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.369
 work our images in a way 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.619
 a little different not only images 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.390
 but also dips in which we have 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.399
 an image and we want to have text and 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.480
 buttons so well let's see it 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.250
 because the truth is that today is not 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.260
 I have no example and I want to do it 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.180
 during the video so well what 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.410
 I have a very basic structure in the 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.809
 structure of always what is the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.519
 container inside I have a roe and before 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.219
 that nothing good to add metal view 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:49.140
 port that I forget there is 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.879
 container inside I have the roe that is 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.070
 our row and inside we're going to add 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.449
 an image to add an image as 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.149
 we would do it well because it is very simple 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.039
 we do not add our img and we add the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.989
 route of our image and in this case 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.329
 here I already have a route that I have 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.920
 loren pixel there is then then that 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.110
 we update good well we also have 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.150
 our image but this image is at 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.140
 100% size then we 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.729
 we want to establish some measures 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.830
 what happens if for example we 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.050
 we want to put four measures in one 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.360
 row four images forgiveness in a row 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.070
 one two three four good so what 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.530
 we are going to do is that in our image 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.720
 we're going to lock it inside a dif and 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.220
 this is going to put a column in 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.470
 this case the column is going to put you 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.970
 in columns in extra small size is 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.310
 say mobile devices like 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.560
 cell phones are going to be 6 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.229
 then on mobile devices they go to 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.630
 fit two photos and on devices 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.970
 older than average they will not fit four 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.080
 photos this why good because you 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.869
 let's put our our kind of 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.180
 of three columns sorry one q each 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.399
 column is going to be 3 sorry and we're going to 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.580
 have 4 columns then if each one is 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.960
 of 3 3 by 4 will give us 12 on 12 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.030
 remember that it is the total number of 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.130
 columns that we can have then here 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.229
 We update good because we already have what 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.630
 which is the column that we have here if 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.250
 we check in our code how can you 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.989
 see here we have what is the image and 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.850
 the column but the image is 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.410
 surpassing what the column is like 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.270
 can be seeing good then then 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.430
 what we are going to do is 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.440
 well we have to put him first 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.810
 nothing, I'm going to close it inside a 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.850
 container can be a container or a 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.230
 link in this case I 'm going to make it a 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.850
 link because I want the user to 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.830
 I can give a click because we suppose it's 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.230
 a good gallery then locked up 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.120
 between an element in the following way 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.710
 and it would be good for us now 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.990
 next way we can not give you a 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.540
 click but we have to add a 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.330
 class this class we are going to give you a 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.150
 email 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.890
 and with this kind of tunnel let's say let's 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.680
 to resize the image to 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.020
 that is 100% but without going over 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.120
 This measure is worth those of the column of 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.940
 3 then we update and how can you 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.380
 see we already have a column of 3 and 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.150
 we can add more columns to the side 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.770
 this kind of tunnel what it does is 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.290
 add this small edge between the 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.360
 image and the edge that we have adds 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.340
 rounded edges and also when passing the 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.050
 mouse if it is a link if it is a link 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.820
 It will happen to us in the following way 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.040
 there is then what you are going to 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.110
 continuation is that this column I'm going 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.330
 to copy and I'll paste in this case 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.209
 the other two times to have four 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.200
 Photos and stay as follows 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.060
 there is the truth is that it is very 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.380
 simple and there it is good I want that 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.000
 I have done is change put different 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.010
 images to make it look better but 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.510
 good is exactly the same thing that happens 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.610
 if we want to put more images below 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.200
 Well, it's very simple, you have to 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.480
 add another row worth this is 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.430
 important is with another row then 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.910
 let's copy this row and we're going to 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.200
 paste 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.260
 under 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.840
 then I have the hero with all our 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.730
 columns inside and then down I have 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.739
 another rock with more columns and it's going to 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.140
 show more images and that's how 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.970
 we can form galleries with boots to the 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.319
 age is not very complicated is simple and 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.660
 you just have to do what you do 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.450
 she finally do that in the 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.260
 images after putting the text 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.269
 suppose you want to make cards 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.069
 where you put the title of the image to 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.200
 a small description and even 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.760
 good buttons can you do it for me 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.230
 example here in my last image I'm going 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.599
 to do what I 'm going to do is that 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.910
 local in my last image is this this 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.680
 is my last column and well here I go to 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.739
 change the situation a little bit 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.320
 why because now the image is going to 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.479
 remove what is ours our 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.060
 container of the image and I will add 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.160
 another container inside the column 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.710
 this container is going to be the sub mail 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.500
 that we just deleted that I was wrong 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.020
 sub mail 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.090
 there it is and inside we are going to put everything 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.850
 that we want that can be good because 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.350
 let's first add our image 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.800
 inside the tunnel and then we're going to 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.870
 add another day with the caption class and 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.520
 Within caption we can add everything 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.350
 the text that we want suppose a 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.500
 Heading 3 for example to the bus pass 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.300
 title of the photo or article of 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.480
 that you want you can also add 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.780
 For example, a paragraph with text 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.070
 we can add for example also 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.640
 buttons for example a button with its 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.740
 class then you know vtn leave nation 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.930
 primary and good what else you 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.140
 you need to throw because we suppose read 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.210
 more good then as we update we go 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.860
 to get the following as you can see 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.230
 we have already transformed what was a 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.880
 picture on a card here good can 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.950
 be that the text is much you can 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.419
 delete more but as you can see we have 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.520
 a structure that looks very good 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.230
 we have what is the image we have the 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.360
 Title of the photo a small 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.770
 description and a button and well then 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.670
 we can save more buttons if we want 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:40.110
 so for example we copy this 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:42.150
 and we can change the color scares 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.430
 we keep updating and there it is 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.590
 we have two buttons and this works 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.000
 for everything you can put good this 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.370
 structure in each of them and it 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.550
 would see very well remember that this is 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.950
 inside our column we add the 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.260
 class shift and inside our image and 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.210
 our dif caption within caption 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.060
 see all our content as a headline 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.790
 text and buttons then finally 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:09.180
 I'm going to copy again our row what 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:10.620
 is our our row of photos I check 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.620
 where my previous robbery ends 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.120
 here he hit another and we will be left of the 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.150
 next way how can you see the 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.070
 photos are put under this caption 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.120
 that we have worth and just in case 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.740
 the doubt arises 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.810
 the ideal would be anyway that 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.580
 put the case in the text in each one 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.340
 of them because it would be like very illogical 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.780
 just put it in one but well then that 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.370
 is what you can do with whatsapp is 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.050
 the way they can be done 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.970
 galleries and give it a very structure 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.560
 so quick and easy to me not me 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.030
 then I hope you liked this 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.590
