00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.080
Come.
Bill, Bill, Good to see you.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:23.580
Sorry I was late, the trafic was a bitch.
Good to see you.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.320
Well, the play is going well, isn´t it?
Looks like we have a bit of a smash on our

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.540
hands.
Well, seems to be ok, yeah.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.500
They always seems to go for the ones with
the snappy titles.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.309
Hamlet!, perfect, perfect.
Act three may be a little long, I don´t know.

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.630
Act three may be a little long.
In fact, generally, I think we have a bit

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.850
of a lenght problem.
Oh

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.120
It´s five hours Bill.
On wooden seats.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.520
And no toilet this side of the Thames.
Well, I have Allways said the Rose theater

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.850
is a dump, frankly.
The sooner they knock it down and build something

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:11.350
decent the better.
Exactly. And that´s why I think we should

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.630
trim some of the dead wood.
Dead wood?

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.380
Yeah, some of that stad up stuff in the middle
of the action.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.659
You mean the soliloquies.
Yeah, and I think we both know wich one is

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:30.310
the dodgy one.
Oh, Oh, which is the dodgy one?

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:39.049
To be... nobler in the mind, mortal coil
It´s boring Bill, the crowd hates it.

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.329
Yawns, Bill.
That happens to be my favourite.

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.280
Bill, you said that about the avocado monologue
in King Liar.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.290
And the tap dance at the end of Othello.
Absolutly not, you cut one word of that and

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.259
I´m off the play.
Bill, Bill, the king has got his costume change

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.179
down to one minute.
Hamlet is out there ranting on about god knows

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.780
what and that soliloquie of yours and Claudius
is already in the wings waiting to come on

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.260
with that very funny codpiece... waiting.
Oh, you can cut the speech all together.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.110
Bill,Bill,Bill, why do we have to fight?
It´s long long long. We can make it so snappy.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.739
Snappy?
Yeah, give it some pizzazz.

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.151
How to begin? that speech.
To be.

00:02:26.151 --> 00:02:32.430
C´mon, c´mon Bill.
To be a victim of all earthly woes

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.640
or not to be a coward and take death by it´s
proffered hand.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:44.790
There, I´m sure ge can get that down.
No, absolutly no. It´s perfect.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:53.000
How about to be a victim or not to be a coward.
It doesn´t make sense, does it?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.870
To be, Tobe a victim of what? To be a coward
about what?

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:03.480
Ok. Take out victim, take out coward.
Just start: To be or not to be.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:10.150
You can´t say that, it´s gibberish.
But it, But it´s short, William, it´s short.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:20.180
It flows, listen: To be or not to be that
is the question.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.489
Damn right it´s the question. I have no bloody
idea what is he taking about.

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:30.230
Ok lets leave that and go on. Blah blah blah
Slings and arrows, good. Action, the crowd

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.519
loves it.
Take up arms, brilliant, against those cursed

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.379
doubts that do plague on man
Hmm, getting very woolly there Bill, plague

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.989
is a bit tasteless at the moment.
We´ll have letters actually.

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.379
And set sail on a sea of troubles.
this is good: travel; travel's very popular.

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:49.980
So let's just take out the guff and see what
we've got.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.622
"...to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous
fortune, or to take up arms against a sea

00:03:56.622 --> 00:03:58.030
of troubles"!
Good!

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.999
I resign.
Bill, it's brilliant!

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:04.790
It's absolute crap! What is he talking about?
He's going to put on a bow and arrow and potter

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.580
down to the seaside?
This is Prince Hamlet, not King Canute!

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.829
He might as well kill himself if that's the
best idea he can come up with.

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:17.950
Creative thinking, Bill! Hamlet; perhaps he
should top himself!

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.970
In Act One?
Well, yeah, well, look we must think about

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:30.040
bums on seats, Bill. Let's face it: It's the
ghost that's selling this show at the moment.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.670
Joe Public loves the ghost; he loves the swordfights;
he loves the crazy chick in the see-through

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:43.570
dress who does the flower gags and then drowns
herself. But no-one likes Hamlet -- no-one.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.750
All right, then, I'll kill him off for you.
"Aye; there's the rub. To die, to sleep..."

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.730
"Whoops! (Hamlet falls off the battlements)"

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:02.780
Bill, Bill, Bill; I can see, I can see you're
annoyed. I'm sorry. Hamlet has his moments.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.200
The mad stuff is very funny. It really is
hysterical.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:18.040
But all I'm saying, Shakey, is let's just
shorten this one terribly dull speech.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.790
...and all I'm saying is no. You cut one word,
and you can take my name off the credits.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.970
All right. I'll tell you what I'll do: I'll
trim this speech, and you can put back in

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:33.050
those awful cockney gravediggers.
The both of them?

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.130
Yeah
And the skull routine?

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.200
Yep -- the whole sketch.
All right, then; you've got a deal -- and

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:47.090
we'll see which one history remembers.
Bill, I love you!

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.960
Tempermental git!
