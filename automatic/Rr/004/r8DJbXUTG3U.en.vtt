the<00:00:03.929> black<00:00:04.200> shadow<00:00:04.500> terminator<00:00:05.069> if<00:00:05.279> you'd

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
the black shadow terminator if you'd

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.920 
the black shadow terminator if you'd

on the link in the description below so
the<00:00:10.080> black<00:00:10.650> shadow<00:00:10.920> terminator<00:00:11.900> runs<00:00:12.900> off<00:00:13.139> of

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
the black shadow terminator runs off of

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.590 
the black shadow terminator runs off of

4 18 650 batteries it has four cree xm-l
emitters<00:00:19.699> it's<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.789> currently<00:00:21.359> black<00:00:21.600> shadows

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
emitters it's a currently black shadows

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.849 
emitters it's a currently black shadows
largest<00:00:22.439> light<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.580> they<00:00:23.699> offer<00:00:24.300> up<00:00:24.769> so<00:00:25.769> as

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
largest light that they offer up so as

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.830 
largest light that they offer up so as
you<00:00:25.920> can<00:00:26.039> see<00:00:26.250> each<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.640> these<00:00:26.789> emitters<00:00:27.449> has

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
you can see each of these emitters has

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.669 
you can see each of these emitters has
its<00:00:28.140> own<00:00:28.519> reflector<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.750> relatively<00:00:30.750> small

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
its own reflector a relatively small

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.350 
its own reflector a relatively small
reflector<00:00:32.309> when<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.520> look<00:00:32.669> at<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.850> larger

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
reflector when you look at the larger

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.819 
reflector when you look at the larger
side<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.750> head<00:00:33.930> but<00:00:34.140> at<00:00:34.290> each<00:00:34.410> one<00:00:34.620> has<00:00:34.800> its

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
side of the head but at each one has its

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.549 
side of the head but at each one has its
own<00:00:35.160> there<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:36.300> then<00:00:36.420> fairly<00:00:37.110> deep<00:00:37.260> but<00:00:37.290> not

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
own there and then fairly deep but not

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.869 
own there and then fairly deep but not
too<00:00:37.739> deep<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.160> overall<00:00:38.460> this<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.700> pretty

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
too deep so overall this is a pretty

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.750 
too deep so overall this is a pretty
floody<00:00:39.239> light<00:00:39.510> it's<00:00:40.140> got<00:00:40.410> decent<00:00:40.860> throw<00:00:41.430> just

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
floody light it's got decent throw just

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.209 
floody light it's got decent throw just
because<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.540> large<00:00:43.469> amount<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.040> light

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
because of the large amount of light

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.970 
because of the large amount of light
that<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.550> puts<00:00:44.760> out<00:00:45.140> for<00:00:46.140> high<00:00:46.649> powered

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
that it puts out for high powered

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.290 
that it puts out for high powered
flashlight<00:00:47.160> strapped<00:00:47.730> together<00:00:47.879> basically

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
flashlight strapped together basically

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.319 
flashlight strapped together basically
and<00:00:49.430> but<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:50.550> not<00:00:50.610> built<00:00:50.850> for<00:00:51.030> throw<00:00:51.180> it's

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
and but it's not built for throw it's

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.470 
and but it's not built for throw it's
more<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.629> floodlight<00:00:52.309> so<00:00:53.309> as<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.210> see

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
more of a floodlight so as you can see

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.779 
more of a floodlight so as you can see
the<00:00:55.350> button<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.890> here<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> handle<00:00:56.640> and

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
the button is here on the handle and

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.270 
the button is here on the handle and
right<00:00:57.570> now<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:57.899> lit<00:00:58.140> up<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.710> indicate<00:00:59.250> that

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
right now it's lit up to indicate that

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.939 
right now it's lit up to indicate that
the<00:01:00.149> light<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.329> ready<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.870> go<00:01:01.020> if<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.800> look

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
the light is ready to go if you look

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.219 
the light is ready to go if you look
here<00:01:02.039> on<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.250> body<00:01:02.460> its<00:01:03.300> marked<00:01:03.660> off<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.110> on

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
here on the body its marked off and on

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.740 
here on the body its marked off and on
so<00:01:04.530> if<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.710> loosen<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.280> little<00:01:05.309> bit<00:01:05.750> turn

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
so if you loosen it a little bit turn

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.899 
so if you loosen it a little bit turn
the<00:01:06.840> body<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.200> direction<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:08.310> light<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
the body that direction the light on the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.310 
the body that direction the light on the
handle<00:01:09.210> goes<00:01:09.360> off<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.750> if<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.900> try<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.170> turn

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
handle goes off and if you try and turn

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.750 
handle goes off and if you try and turn
the<00:01:10.470> light<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.950> won't<00:01:11.100> turn<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:11.640> a

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
the light on it won't turn on it's a

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.109 
the light on it won't turn on it's a
mechanical<00:01:11.909> lock<00:01:12.479> out<00:01:13.580> so<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.790> it's<00:01:14.939> not

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
mechanical lock out so that it's not

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.469 
mechanical lock out so that it's not
wasting<00:01:15.570> power<00:01:15.750> for<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.880> button<00:01:17.880> when<00:01:18.390> you

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
wasting power for the button when you

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.460 
wasting power for the button when you
don't<00:01:18.659> want<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.840> use<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.049> light<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.380> when

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
don't want to use the light so when

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.350 
don't want to use the light so when
you're<00:01:19.590> ready<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.830> use<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.130> light<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:21.090> twist

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
you're ready to use the light you twist

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.840 
you're ready to use the light you twist
that<00:01:21.509> tight<00:01:22.009> now<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.070> can<00:01:23.340> see<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> buttons

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
that tight now you can see the buttons

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.340 
that tight now you can see the buttons
on<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.210> ready<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.509> turn<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.080> now<00:01:25.170> if<00:01:25.290> you

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
on it's ready to turn on so now if you

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.550 
on it's ready to turn on so now if you
press<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.710> button<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.549> light<00:01:26.700> will<00:01:26.820> turn<00:01:27.000> on

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.140 
press the button the light will turn on
the<00:01:28.560> terminator<00:01:28.979> has<00:01:29.220> three<00:01:29.640> regular

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
the terminator has three regular

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.980 
the terminator has three regular
brightness<00:01:30.540> modes<00:01:31.610> it's<00:01:32.610> got<00:01:32.759> low<00:01:33.000> medium<00:01:33.600> and

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
brightness modes it's got low medium and

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.870 
brightness modes it's got low medium and
high<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.650> as<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.340> can<00:01:35.460> see<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.700> kind<00:01:35.790> of

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
high and as you can see it kind of

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.819 
high and as you can see it kind of
pulsing<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.390> little<00:01:36.630> bit<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:37.290> harder<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.560> see

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
pulsing a little bit it's harder to see

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.969 
pulsing a little bit it's harder to see
in<00:01:37.979> real<00:01:38.159> life<00:01:38.400> but<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.759> does<00:01:38.909> use<00:01:39.150> pulse<00:01:39.479> width

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
in real life but it does use pulse width

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.649 
in real life but it does use pulse width
modulation<00:01:40.979> shows<00:01:41.850> up<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.299> camera<00:01:42.630> a

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
modulation shows up on the camera a

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.410 
modulation shows up on the camera a
little<00:01:42.720> easier<00:01:43.460> then<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.610> your<00:01:44.729> eyes<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.270> it

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
little easier then to your eyes so it

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.139 
little easier then to your eyes so it
doesn't<00:01:45.780> look<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.790> but<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.880> can<00:01:48.000> see

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
doesn't look like that but you can see

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.539 
doesn't look like that but you can see
it<00:01:48.210> does<00:01:48.360> use<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.740> PWM<00:01:49.740> on<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.040> low<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.430> medium

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
it does use a PWM on the low and medium

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.170 
it does use a PWM on the low and medium
modes<00:01:51.829> so<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.920> change<00:01:53.250> modes<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:53.909> click

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
modes so to change modes you just click

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.330 
modes so to change modes you just click
the<00:01:54.210> switch<00:01:54.450> repeatedly<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.740> goes<00:01:55.920> from<00:01:56.070> off

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
the switch repeatedly it goes from off

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.780 
the switch repeatedly it goes from off
to<00:01:56.369> low<00:01:56.820> medium<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.780> high<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.740> then<00:01:59.430> if<00:01:59.640> you

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
to low medium and high and then if you

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.940 
to low medium and high and then if you
want<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.180> use<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.840> hidden<00:02:01.320> strobe<00:02:01.619> mode<00:02:01.829> you

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
want to use the hidden strobe mode you

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.289 
want to use the hidden strobe mode you
just<00:02:02.100> hold<00:02:02.250> down<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.610> switch<00:02:02.909> for<00:02:03.090> about<00:02:03.270> a

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
just hold down on the switch for about a

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.780 
just hold down on the switch for about a
second<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.159> it<00:02:05.159> goes<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.579> strobe<00:02:05.909> mode

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
second and it goes to a strobe mode

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:14.060 
second and it goes to a strobe mode
if<00:02:08.790> you<00:02:09.030> want<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.990> take<00:02:10.380> a<00:02:10.410> look<00:02:10.619> inside<00:02:13.070> here

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.470 
if you want to take a look inside here
it's<00:02:14.220> kind<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:15.000> threads<00:02:15.240> are<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.390> little

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
it's kind of the threads are a little

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.110 
it's kind of the threads are a little
bit<00:02:15.660> squeaky<00:02:16.050> they<00:02:16.170> came<00:02:16.320> without<00:02:16.410> greets

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
bit squeaky they came without greets

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
bit squeaky they came without greets
added<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.180> little<00:02:18.330> bit<00:02:18.450> too<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:18.870> sounds

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
added a little bit too and it sounds

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.540 
added a little bit too and it sounds
like<00:02:19.230> they<00:02:19.380> need<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.560> little<00:02:19.770> bit<00:02:19.920> more<00:02:22.460> you<00:02:23.460> can

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
like they need a little bit more you can

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.910 
like they need a little bit more you can

of a raised top you can see mine don't
have<00:02:36.540> much<00:02:36.840> but<00:02:37.020> even<00:02:37.080> just<00:02:37.320> a<00:02:37.470> little<00:02:37.500> bit<00:02:37.830> is

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
have much but even just a little bit is

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.310 
have much but even just a little bit is
enough<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.310> make<00:02:38.340> contact<00:02:38.670> there<00:02:39.150> so<00:02:40.050> button

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
enough to make contact there so button

three and just have less capacity but
for<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.530> full<00:02:52.740> capacity<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:53.400> you've<00:02:53.550> got<00:02:53.580> full

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
for a full capacity so you've got full
