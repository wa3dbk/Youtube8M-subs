throw money you can see the description

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.790 
throw money you can see the description
on<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.230> top<00:02:22.530> right<00:02:23.660> it<00:02:24.660> says<00:02:24.930> throw<00:02:25.260> money<00:02:25.470> and

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
on the top right it says throw money and

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.240 
on the top right it says throw money and
press<00:02:26.130> F<00:02:27.230> unlike<00:02:28.230> any<00:02:29.720> kind<00:02:30.740> I<00:02:31.740> don't<00:02:32.040> know<00:02:32.100> in

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
press F unlike any kind I don't know in

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.810 
press F unlike any kind I don't know in
situ<00:02:32.700> maybe<00:02:33.200> there's<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.500> name<00:02:34.830> under<00:02:35.520> each

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
situ maybe there's a name under each

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.530 
situ maybe there's a name under each
icon<00:02:36.270> so<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:37.470> have<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.860> guess<00:02:38.100> which<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.300> can

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
icon so you have to guess which I can

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.740 
icon so you have to guess which I can
represent<00:02:39.840> which<00:02:40.560> axiom<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.610> so<00:02:42.360> this<00:02:42.600> is

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
represent which axiom and so this is

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.870 
represent which axiom and so this is
throw<00:02:43.020> money<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.560> this<00:02:43.920> is<00:02:44.070> treasure<00:02:44.490> maps

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
throw money and this is treasure maps

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.560 
throw money and this is treasure maps
and<00:02:45.240> this<00:02:45.959> is<00:02:46.170> smoke<00:02:46.500> bomb<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:47.100> this<00:02:48.090> is<00:02:48.209> gun

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
and this is smoke bomb and this is gun

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.410 
and this is smoke bomb and this is gun
so<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:49.380> have<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:50.400> type<00:02:50.610> of<00:02:50.640> option<00:02:51.180> with

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
so you have that type of option with

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.350 
so you have that type of option with
