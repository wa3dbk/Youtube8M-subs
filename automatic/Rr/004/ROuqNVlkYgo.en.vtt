00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
have this code in the link and then you

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.830 
have this code in the link and then you
can<00:01:22.229> copy<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.920> paste<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.460> there<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.000> then<00:01:24.810> you

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
can copy and paste it there and then you

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.510 
can copy and paste it there and then you
hit<00:01:25.080> closed<00:01:25.470> let's<00:01:25.860> go<00:01:25.979> ahead<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.280> see<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
hit closed let's go ahead and see the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.080 
hit closed let's go ahead and see the
results<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.600> saw<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.140> blood<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.619> saw<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
results so you saw the blood you saw the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.859 
results so you saw the blood you saw the
how<00:01:30.090> played<00:01:30.780> when<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:32.390> didn't<00:01:33.390> put<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.630> code

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
how played when I didn't put this code

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:34.969 
how played when I didn't put this code
and<00:01:34.020> now<00:01:34.140> here's<00:01:34.320> how<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.590> looks<00:01:34.740> what<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:34.920> do

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
and now here's how it looks what I do

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:44.550 
and now here's how it looks what I do
put<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.340> code<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.630> he<00:01:36.630> finds<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.990> lot<00:01:37.170> faster

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.850 

yeah<00:01:45.560> it<00:01:46.520> runs<00:01:46.729> faster<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:48.110> little<00:01:48.590> screens

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
yeah it runs faster the little screens

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.700 
yeah it runs faster the little screens
are<00:01:49.040> much<00:01:49.399> much<00:01:49.700> quicker<00:01:50.110> before<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.229> load

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
are much much quicker before the load

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.710 
are much much quicker before the load
escapes<00:01:52.009> taking<00:01:52.369> almost<00:01:52.610> an<00:01:52.790> entire<00:01:53.240> minute

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
escapes taking almost an entire minute

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.010 
escapes taking almost an entire minute
but<00:01:53.899> now<00:01:54.020> there's<00:01:54.229> so<00:01:54.470> much<00:01:54.590> faster<00:01:55.180> so<00:01:56.180> here

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
but now there's so much faster so here

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.350 
but now there's so much faster so here
we<00:01:57.080> go<00:01:57.200> now<00:01:57.440> you<00:01:58.250> probably<00:01:58.430> just<00:01:58.700> saw<00:01:58.789> it<00:01:59.119> said

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
we go now you probably just saw it said

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.609 
we go now you probably just saw it said
a<00:01:59.570> and<00:01:59.960> B<00:02:00.409> like<00:02:00.799> an<00:02:00.920> xbox<00:02:01.509> version<00:02:02.509> of<00:02:03.020> Skyrim

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
a and B like an xbox version of Skyrim

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.679 
a and B like an xbox version of Skyrim
but<00:02:03.860> basically<00:02:04.549> what<00:02:04.789> I<00:02:04.820> do<00:02:04.909> is<00:02:05.060> I<00:02:05.180> have<00:02:05.360> it<00:02:05.479> set

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
but basically what I do is I have it set

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.529 
but basically what I do is I have it set
up<00:02:05.720> for<00:02:05.810> Xbox<00:02:06.619> controller<00:02:07.310> settings<00:02:07.880> with<00:02:08.330> my

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
up for Xbox controller settings with my

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.779 
up for Xbox controller settings with my
PC<00:02:08.899> control<00:02:09.319> and<00:02:09.830> I'll<00:02:10.069> show<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:10.280> how<00:02:10.550> to<00:02:10.610> do

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
PC control and I'll show you how to do

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.330 
PC control and I'll show you how to do
that<00:02:10.910> later<00:02:11.230> but<00:02:12.230> for<00:02:12.410> now<00:02:14.170> here<00:02:15.170> we<00:02:15.260> go<00:02:15.380> see

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
that later but for now here we go see

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.320 
that later but for now here we go see
how<00:02:16.400> much<00:02:16.489> quicker<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.940> was<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.420> blood<00:02:18.110> stream

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
how much quicker it was a blood stream

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.190 
how much quicker it was a blood stream
and<00:02:20.330> you<00:02:20.450> can<00:02:20.540> see<00:02:20.660> right<00:02:20.780> here<00:02:20.930> I<00:02:21.019> can

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
and you can see right here I can

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.710 
and you can see right here I can
actually<00:02:21.290> move<00:02:21.590> around<00:02:21.769> it's<00:02:22.730> not<00:02:22.850> laggy<00:02:23.180> so

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
actually move around it's not laggy so

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.199 
actually move around it's not laggy so
it's<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.709> little<00:02:24.860> bit<00:02:25.100> laggy<00:02:25.310> but<00:02:25.640> it's<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.150> much

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
it's a little bit laggy but it's so much

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.850 
it's a little bit laggy but it's so much
more<00:02:26.330> better<00:02:26.690> so<00:02:27.170> much<00:02:27.319> better

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
more better so much better

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.520 
more better so much better
so<00:02:28.459> I'm<00:02:28.700> going<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.480> grab<00:02:29.750> this<00:02:29.870> guy's<00:02:30.080> stuff

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
so I'm going to grab this guy's stuff

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.949 
so I'm going to grab this guy's stuff
here<00:02:31.040> it<00:02:31.730> sounded<00:02:32.060> bad

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
here it sounded bad

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.710 
here it sounded bad
