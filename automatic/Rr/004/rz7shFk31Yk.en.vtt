00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:21.449
 Hello dear friends of my youtube 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.060
 tutorials like you see on the top right 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.090
 filmpreis minimap that means we have 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.939
 a new minecraft version that is 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.259
 now the 15 and unfortunately it is not 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.160
 more the 15 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:38.040
 the 151 but of course that must 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.400
 disturb what I also I like 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.510
 want to share is relatively simple until after 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.820
 that helps because we need our coal 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.239
 recommended and got this railway up 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.890
 to bring a technically better stand 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.690
 so we can show where the difference 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.600
 I have some golems here 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.059
 just built here and now if 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.769
 we fly when we get down there 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.750
 go and our golem case 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.990
 they're looking at something different now 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.380
 which has the advantage at 10 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.970
 5 and later we funnel this 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.270
 funnel 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.550
 can be used as a catch container 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.790
 and we are right now 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.950
 to perform in the form of a kind and 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.080
 wise, so we have the down here 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.290
 funnel is under the funnels 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.830
 a chest, so to speak, that is 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.450
 not directly but in the middle 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.420
 Line is the name is wearing the sound 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.000
 Down left and right are social 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.160
 judge the upper funnel again 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.930
 you go something directly down and the 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.270
 funnel to the left and right of the chest 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.290
 go from left to right in the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.750
 tour in 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:54.270
 that means everything up here in ours 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.460
 Golem trap arrives that what here 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.380
 arrives lands through the funnel 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.410
 either by renting directly into the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.119
 chest or just left and right over 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.259
 the detour of the second war therefore of 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.090
 the side out so now I have myself 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.100
 We have to think for ourselves 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.170
 operate the coal in the chill machine 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.500
 because the situation has changed 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:20.040
 So far the golems were there 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.040
 yes not dispo the guarantee for that was that 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.739
 the iron accumulates when you get the 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.810
 golems honored want to kill automatically 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.630
 then those who have been killed that 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.340
 iron was on the ground but very with the 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.180
 have been away for a while if you yourself are not 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.660
 is present 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.930
 now the situation has changed when 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.790
 Now the iron items dry then 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.780
 fall into the funnel and then just 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.280
 right in the chest 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:50.370
 that means we can do our golems 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:53.940
 Replace memory with the golems 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.739
 fall down the red are killed 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.890
 without us even a button 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.480
 need to serve and in a wise way 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.370
 we have one down here 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.620
 built in tripwire that is too 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.450
 not so easily explained the same and 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.860
 Of course, this sport activates 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:13.560
 our bolt up here then 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.780
 the golems then fall just that 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.200
 items Monday the flags through the tour 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.470
 so to lay this wire down here 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.520
 That's not easy 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.820
 I have to watch where I have a hair 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:32.060
 oral but that's one but there 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.410
 we have such a day just like me 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.720
 make that the cover here now 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.310
 is this is just gone and if 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.050
 Now you are trying this one to the 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.450
 money is going to open immediately 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.300
 funnel and you can now almost here 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.920
 see the funnel content if you are 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.940
 powerful stacks that within 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.680
 The judge does not help us 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.510
 and therefore you have to wire so 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.770
 quasi on the blog behind it 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:00.170
 place namely da da da and behold 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.160
 down here he obviously lies on this 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.050
 blog clicked 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.600
 Now the whole story works 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.120
 again the bolt beats so bonus 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.650
 are not tilted so the whole thing is not so 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.570
 of course I have dry up here 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.950
 our olesch always worried and now 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.709
 Let's do a short test 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.570
 that is before I show you 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:21.079
 not happening either here or not 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.630
 too much literature is already filled 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.700
 now you throw the whole thing 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.630
 Kramer needs a little bit of that 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.130
 was only demo trying out the whole 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.510
 junk you throw away here and 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.280
 hope that then not back in the 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.870
 chest land because the funnels saw here 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.040
 Everyone is saying what's in the area 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.669
 even the glass I am good 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.800
 thrown away 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:44.060
 from the top has entered the tour na 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:46.910
 Well, let's just do it now 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.500
 golems free that is now was the 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.220
 everything besides knowing what's good 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.020
 probably these iron blogs would be 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.840
 because bottom in the funnel land 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.700
 but good the heat of when you are 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.380
 survive that I will be you 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:07.010
 Unfortunately, this is not true 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.750
 Mist 3 with you on number one why 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.919
 are not you going in there or lou number 2 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:15.080
 and halo monday also always waives in 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.040
 the hole in the hole a bit more 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.810
 more comfortable 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:22.490
 the first already warned you see that is 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.390
 a question that is correct too 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.820
 apply 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.620
 that means the school too flood 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.930
 exactly as they always look 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.590
 not having to walk with him 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.590
 kill all 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:39.770
 and as usual the pick is now 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:41.840
 on the triggers on the line below 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.460
 Unfortunately, the bolt can not 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.420
 dodge and become accordingly 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:49.790
 The other julians are about to die 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.530
 Mom, if you can see what he's up to 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.770
 them we make the run or leave 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:58.610
 that is not the case with inhuman people 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:01.220
 in any case, the cool is really good for me 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:04.610
 then we understand that his iron 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.860
 items get big theme says yes well 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.780
 what matters down through the test 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.740
 Funnel in the box gladly suffers 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.860
 pressed prices 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.330
 so have everything clearly in this way 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.300
 we now we on the one hand a 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:20.360
 nomade naked made who walk 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:23.990
 let and then we showed you 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:26.780
 I showed you how to fall this 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:29.360
 now update that means you can 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.220
 continue to kill golems without lava 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.220
 and that means you 're on servers 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.410
 but it does not work, so to speak 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.660
 that one on these servers just as well 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:42.500
 anyway a reasonable railway construction 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:44.120
 and yes yes the art is brown 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.040
 Of course not like me the film 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.900
 Simply have your ideas above 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.750
 usually we have now for this 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.910
 kind of re-starting our planks 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:56.360
 generator is a kind of factory 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:57.650
 for oems and I had in one 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.850
 other video shown here you can 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.850
 you like to watch 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:03.680
 he's down here in the 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.780
 Explanation to this video as link 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.490
 provided and a few more updates 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.870
 maybe or by news and 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.000
 Of course you will also find information 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.460
 my 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.050
 wiki page also is below on the left 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.720
 Look around there is always there 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.400
 one or the other very interesting 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.410
 for people who want to know something new 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.720
 okay in the sense first that at 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:27.190
 a short trip to a new one 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:31.330
 technological stand on baguette 151 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:32.110
 firstly 1 and have fun while 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.870
 neighbors 

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:36.970
 I hope you look at the others 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:39.100
 Like youtube videos again 

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:41.380
 a channel and would be nice if you see me 

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:43.210
 would subscribe so to speak or too 

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:46.000
 times a nice comment writes 

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:49.230
 Anyway I wish you something 

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.230
 then the pure metal is
