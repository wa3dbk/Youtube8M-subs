like<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.460> play<00:00:44.730> card<00:00:44.969> structure<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:46.010> there<00:00:47.010> are

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
like I play card structure and there are

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.260 
like I play card structure and there are
too<00:00:47.129> many<00:00:47.250> situations<00:00:47.460> where<00:00:47.969> if<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.149> only

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
too many situations where if you only

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.700 
too many situations where if you only
play<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.629> chaos<00:00:48.840> sorcerer<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.379> you'll<00:00:49.620> have

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
play to chaos sorcerer and you'll have

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.410 
play to chaos sorcerer and you'll have
to<00:00:49.829> discard<00:00:50.129> one<00:00:50.340> or<00:00:50.550> two<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.030> only<00:00:51.239> have

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
to discard one or two and you only have

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.150 
to discard one or two and you only have
one<00:00:51.449> Cales<00:00:51.960> monster<00:00:52.230> left<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.920> base

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
one Cales monster left and this is base

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.729 
one Cales monster left and this is base
beard<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:53.789> it's<00:00:54.059> not<00:00:54.180> too<00:00:54.360> much<00:00:54.510> no<00:00:54.930> if<00:00:55.469> I

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
beard and so it's not too much no if I

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.680 
beard and so it's not too much no if I
don't<00:00:56.100> play<00:00:56.280> chaos<00:00:56.520> source<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.850> would<00:00:56.879> if<00:00:57.539> I

Nikki break to at a card structure and
the<00:01:14.970> card<00:01:15.150> struck<00:01:15.360> here<00:01:15.570> um<00:01:15.799> but<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:16.950> this

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
the card struck here um but like this

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.280 
the card struck here um but like this
makes<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:17.729> every<00:01:18.479> time<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.750> draw<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.049> it

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
makes it so every time you draw this it

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.560 
makes it so every time you draw this it
makes<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:20.030> you'll<00:01:21.030> always<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.479> a

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
makes it so that you'll always have a

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.840 
makes it so that you'll always have a
good<00:01:21.720> life<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:21.900> grave<00:01:22.320> because<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.670> never

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
good life in grave because this never

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.130 
good life in grave because this never
gets<00:01:24.030> bulbous<00:01:24.390> or<00:01:24.509> something<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.780> first<00:01:24.810> one

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
gets bulbous or something the first one

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.630 
gets bulbous or something the first one
that<00:01:25.320> never<00:01:25.619> happens<00:01:25.979> anything<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.400> because

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
that never happens anything to because

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.030 
that never happens anything to because
you<00:01:26.820> send<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.090> straight<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.299> grade<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.890> then

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
you send it straight to grade and then

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.740 
you send it straight to grade and then
it<00:01:29.369> makes<00:01:29.549> return<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> lot<00:01:30.060> better<00:01:30.299> like<00:01:30.509> if<00:01:30.659> you

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
it makes return a lot better like if you

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.940 
it makes return a lot better like if you
don't<00:01:30.960> play<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.470> would<00:01:31.680> have<00:01:31.770> probably

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
don't play this I would have probably

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.590 
don't play this I would have probably
not<00:01:32.220> play<00:01:32.400> return<00:01:32.700> from<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.360> different

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
not play return from the different

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.010 
not play return from the different
dimension<00:01:33.979> 1x<00:01:34.979> areal<00:01:35.340> because<00:01:35.880> like<00:01:36.570> if<00:01:36.960> you

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
dimension 1x areal because like if you

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.510 
dimension 1x areal because like if you
ever<00:01:37.110> draw<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.710> have<00:01:37.799> your<00:01:37.920> large<00:01:38.070> so

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
ever draw this you have your large so

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.160 
ever draw this you have your large so
it's<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.180> darkest<00:01:39.570> sometimes<00:01:39.869> but<00:01:39.990> with<00:01:40.079> a

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
it's the darkest sometimes but with a

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.450 
it's the darkest sometimes but with a
problem<00:01:40.439> because<00:01:40.560> most<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.950> those<00:01:41.070> are<00:01:41.250> flip

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
problem because most of those are flip

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.340 
problem because most of those are flip
effect<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.060> they<00:01:42.210> get<00:01:42.329> an<00:01:42.450> obvious<00:01:42.689> base<00:01:42.840> and

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
effect so they get an obvious base and

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.350 
effect so they get an obvious base and
then<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.530> lose<00:01:43.710> all<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:44.070> them<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:45.180> is

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
then you lose all of them and this is

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.840 
then you lose all of them and this is
kind<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.810> decent<00:01:46.140> leader<00:01:46.259> because<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:47.399> don't

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
kind of a decent leader because I don't

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.340 
kind of a decent leader because I don't
play<00:01:47.939> any<00:01:48.090> tribute<00:01:48.390> muscles<00:01:48.659> besides<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
play any tribute muscles besides the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.999 
play any tribute muscles besides the
tummy<00:01:49.560> dragon

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
tummy dragon

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.800 
tummy dragon
so<00:01:50.460> there's<00:01:50.670> no<00:01:50.880> like<00:01:51.090> chainsaw<00:01:51.420> rare<00:01:51.600> nights

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
so there's no like chainsaw rare nights

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.810 
so there's no like chainsaw rare nights
so<00:01:52.320> premature<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:52.950> call<00:01:53.130> can<00:01:53.280> be<00:01:53.310> pretty<00:01:53.579> like

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
so premature and call can be pretty like

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.249 
so premature and call can be pretty like
loss<00:01:54.030> here<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.509> makes<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.930> little<00:01:55.049> bit

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
loss here and this makes it a little bit

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:55.990 
loss here and this makes it a little bit
better

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
better

just be playing there knocks any time

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:21.339 
just be playing there knocks any time
you<00:05:19.880> said<00:05:20.060> something<00:05:20.210> because<00:05:20.780> everything

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
you said something because everything

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.710 
you said something because everything
you<00:05:21.440> said<00:05:21.620> is<00:05:21.770> so<00:05:21.890> good<00:05:22.039> in<00:05:22.160> it<00:05:22.220> so<00:05:22.940> this<00:05:23.450> makes

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
you said is so good in it so this makes

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.240 
you said is so good in it so this makes
it<00:05:23.840> so<00:05:23.990> that<00:05:24.020> at<00:05:24.590> least<00:05:24.710> you<00:05:24.860> don't<00:05:25.010> lose

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
it so that at least you don't lose

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.490 
it so that at least you don't lose
everything<00:05:25.550> it's<00:05:26.180> like<00:05:26.270> if<00:05:26.479> you<00:05:26.599> if<00:05:26.840> you<00:05:26.960> stop

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
everything it's like if you if you stop

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.110 
everything it's like if you if you stop
a<00:05:27.530> knock<00:05:27.770> with<00:05:27.890> this<00:05:28.070> you're<00:05:28.610> in<00:05:28.729> a<00:05:28.849> really

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
a knock with this you're in a really

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.520 
a knock with this you're in a really
good<00:05:29.240> position<00:05:31.450> for<00:05:32.450> the<00:05:32.510> psychic<00:05:32.960> card<00:05:33.200> play

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
good position for the psychic card play

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.390 
good position for the psychic card play
one<00:05:33.830> Jinzo

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
one Jinzo

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.000 
one Jinzo
so<00:05:34.610> I<00:05:35.479> think<00:05:35.870> if<00:05:36.200> you're<00:05:36.320> not<00:05:36.470> playing<00:05:36.770> against

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
so I think if you're not playing against

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.320 
so I think if you're not playing against
you<00:05:37.070> should<00:05:37.250> be<00:05:37.370> citing<00:05:37.669> it<00:05:37.760> for

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
you should be citing it for

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.830 
you should be citing it for
and<00:05:38.720> very<00:05:38.930> much<00:05:39.520> like<00:05:40.520> one<00:05:41.150> Mobius<00:05:41.539> this<00:05:41.720> was

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
and very much like one Mobius this was

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.869 
and very much like one Mobius this was
made<00:05:42.020> mostly<00:05:42.409> for<00:05:42.620> time<00:05:43.009> lock<00:05:43.310> if<00:05:43.520> I<00:05:43.639> played

00:05:43.869 --> 00:05:43.879 
made mostly for time lock if I played

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:45.790 
made mostly for time lock if I played
against<00:05:44.120> its<00:05:44.300> and<00:05:44.479> other<00:05:44.810> solitary<00:05:45.259> sticks

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
against its and other solitary sticks

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.839 
against its and other solitary sticks
same<00:05:46.220> with<00:05:46.340> this<00:05:47.889> took<00:05:48.889> I<00:05:49.039> confirm<00:05:49.340> a<00:05:49.490> match<00:05:49.669> it

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:49.849 
same with this took I confirm a match it

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.809 
same with this took I confirm a match it
actually<00:05:50.180> won<00:05:50.360> me<00:05:50.479> the<00:05:50.509> mayor<00:05:50.810> match<00:05:50.960> like<00:05:51.199> and

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:51.819 
actually won me the mayor match like and

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:55.749 
actually won me the mayor match like and

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:55.759 
one dude at the at the dreams I had my

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:57.700 
one dude at the at the dreams I had my
original<00:05:55.909> chaos<00:05:56.569> and<00:05:56.930> so<00:05:57.319> he<00:05:57.440> was<00:05:57.560> also

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
original chaos and so he was also

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.920 
original chaos and so he was also
playing<00:05:58.009> it<00:05:58.159> but<00:05:58.310> then<00:05:58.460> a<00:05:59.060> bit<00:05:59.509> different<00:05:59.810> and

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
playing it but then a bit different and

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.279 
playing it but then a bit different and
this<00:06:00.710> is<00:06:00.770> just<00:06:00.949> one<00:06:01.159> game<00:06:01.360> like<00:06:02.360> I<00:06:02.659> so<00:06:03.199> many

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:03.289 
this is just one game like I so many

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:05.619 
this is just one game like I so many
device<00:06:03.919> like<00:06:04.220> I<00:06:04.250> summon<00:06:04.699> it<00:06:04.789> and<00:06:05.060> friendlies

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:05.629 
device like I summon it and friendlies

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:07.749 
device like I summon it and friendlies
and<00:06:05.659> then<00:06:05.930> just<00:06:06.229> made<00:06:06.949> it<00:06:07.069> survive<00:06:07.340> the<00:06:07.490> entire

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759 
and then just made it survive the entire

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:10.119 
and then just made it survive the entire
game<00:06:07.970> so<00:06:08.000> he<00:06:08.240> could<00:06:08.419> do<00:06:08.780> anything<00:06:08.990> the<00:06:09.860> purpose

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:10.129 
game so he could do anything the purpose

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:15.040 
game so he could do anything the purpose
