00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
 then sport today is above all 

00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:04.410
 the controversy triggered by the remarks 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.000
 of the player emmanuel petit le former 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.799
 world champion for the first time 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.260
 he speaks on television in 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.090
 exclusivity for haiti for news il 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.570
 responds to the accusations he is 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.070
 the emmanuel object hello then you're 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.840
 the target of many media and even at 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.520
 beyond what triggered this outcry it is 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.949
 this statement that is attributed to you I 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.510
 will start with the city word for word 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.090
 small mania you said 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.039
 France is hypocritical and sometimes age 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.840
 I think that having been invaded by 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.430
 the Germans we would be better able to lead 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.840
 today then you understand well 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.579
 that when we hear it like that 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.530
 sentence sounds extremely shocking 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.300
 1 do you understand that people 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.250
 be shocked and 2 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.640
 what did you mean in 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.079
 using words so violent so I 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.820
 understand very precisely precisely 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.170
 that people are shocked 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.030
 sincerely my words were concerned 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.680
 an interview that was based on thierry 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.760
 henry on the treatment is in concert 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.620
 in the press and I made a hint 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.940
 precisely who is moved from elsewhere 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.129
 deeply regret because this 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.170
 historical reference has been a skid 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.030
 on my part I apologize if I shocked 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.540
 people sincerely I present to you 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.630
 my excuses 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.100
 on the other hand the reason I 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.990
 was referring to Germany this is 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.210
 today's germany germany's 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.729
 sport especially the nationalmannschaft the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.380
 sense of unity of solidarity 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.330
 national when they wear the jersey 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.740
 from the nationalmannschaft the same way 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.939
 that at the level of the German clubs we are 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.080
 still light years we 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.180
 French clubs because there is a 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.490
 solidarity a unity in all sport 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.030
 German is in this sense that I 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.640
 wanted to say it was badly said about my 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.659
 part the historical reference was to 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.490
 bad taste I recognize it 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.680
 perfectly but you have to crop 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.939
 exactly what I said and it takes 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.200
 also take into account all the comments 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.750
 that I held during this interview 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.130
 so then formally 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.329
 have wanted to refer have everything 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.020
 summer at no time in this 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.729
 interview to the second world war 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.380
 I do it but it was a skid of 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.790
 my part I wanted to refer to 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.140
 Germany today who took the 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.430
 turning points that were needed devie years 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.299
 2000 both in the sport even though 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.799
 in his economy 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.030
 and I find today that we 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.009
 should be inspired by what we 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.390
 do good Germans so instead 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.740
 to look at the belly button all the time 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.780
 here in France is not to treat 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.160
 the background problems that are problem 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.300
 recurrent who are still very healthy 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.040
 as a societal perspective yes 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.900
 so this interview is also a 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.100
 charge against France you say that's it 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.490
 that's all I hate in this 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.080
 country 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.160
 I have a lot of trouble with the French 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.090
 I have never made a people so 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.310
 arrogant enough 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.330
 liar and hypocrite then emmanuel 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.500
 little game ask you a single question 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.300
 is very simple 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.540
 does this France want but 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.770
 again I am deeply attached to 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.510
 my country you know when I 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.710
 represented my country for 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.750
 many years when I gave myself 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.640
 heart their just on a ground 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.230
 is that at no time for me I had 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.250
 these societal issues when I 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.990
 took on the jersey of the team 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.820
 France it turns out that today 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.930
 becomes a political problem at every 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.530
 players wear the jersey 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.630
 The french team 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.580
 what I see today is that 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.410
 racism is present at the four corners 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.300
 from France he is present at every 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.980
 street corner because we can not manage to 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.810
 deal with the substantive issues that are 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.640
 recurring in France there is a majority 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.140
 of French today who want 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.060
 to live in peace in communion 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.700
 with the mix permanently but we 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.350
 Spends our time just to be caught 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.300
 in hostage we will say permanently in 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.460
 conflicts and stigmatize each 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.540
 Once either minorities or people 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.700
 of religious denominations 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.620
 I have more than enough I'm desperate 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.030
 France I touch it has always been 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.140
 in my heart will always be put 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.570
 today I do not recognize my 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.980
 country that was the land of lights the 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.640
 country of human rights values 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.650
 universal 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.870
 when i look in the past france 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.580
 what she was capable of the end of 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.810
 national level politics game when 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.060
 I see what France today 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.980
 I am afraid for the future for my children 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.080
 I'm scared for myself I'm scared for the 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.400
 France itself so we must stop 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.810
 live in this hypocrisy must 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.670
 look at the background problems facing it 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.989
 must be treated serenely but with 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.120
 the communion of all and stop 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.560
 permanently stigmatize people from 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.940
 of immigration it is necessary to stop 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.290
 mount the jews against the arabs he 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.700
 must stop riding the French 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.140
 against the Arabs France 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.270
 today is auch by 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.150
 advance is the same it's based on the 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.500
 mixed on and several cultures in 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.880
 permanence who made ammunition 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.530
 precisely who made the beauty of the 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.820
 France at different levels 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.980
 and when I see today as we 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.500
 treats how one is vilified in 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.180
 permanence in the media as we are 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.860
 just keeps a certain 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.930
 propaganda of racism 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.730
 I can not do more people can not 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.530
 the more I put myself in your place 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.750
 as he says he is in israel or 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.850
 Palestine I tell myself a world 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.109
 the majority of people are fed up with 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.370
 these girls camps want to live in peace 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.290
 he goes quickly in communion he must 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.330
 stop with all that and push on we pass 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.770
 our time of the you open a newspaper 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.390
 listen to the radio or watch 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.740
 TV is always hate it's 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.960

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.790
 can I am more desperate I want 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.770
 come back to France which was a France 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.850
 from the old days a France where we really 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.110
 was not beating values ​​that is 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.580
 universal values ​​the rights of 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.740
