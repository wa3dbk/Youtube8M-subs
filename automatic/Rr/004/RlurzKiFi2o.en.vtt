actually<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.890> want<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.730> say<00:00:32.820> it's<00:00:32.969> more

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
actually I want to say it's more

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.639 
actually I want to say it's more
consistent<00:00:33.719> than<00:00:33.750> her<00:00:33.930> tonight<00:00:34.170> even<00:00:34.440> less

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
consistent than her tonight even less

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.530 
consistent than her tonight even less
effect<00:00:34.980> isn't<00:00:35.130> as<00:00:35.309> like<00:00:35.579> blow<00:00:35.940> Audi<00:00:36.180> I'm

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
effect isn't as like blow Audi I'm

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.569 
effect isn't as like blow Audi I'm
really<00:00:37.290> helps<00:00:37.500> with<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.649> consistency<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.489> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
really helps with the consistency of the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.160 
really helps with the consistency of the
deck<00:00:38.760> where<00:00:38.940> night<00:00:39.210> can<00:00:39.480> be<00:00:39.510> kind<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.989> dead

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.480 
works fairly decently I'm rounding out
our<00:01:48.960> monsters<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:50.040> actually<00:01:50.130> going<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.430> be

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
our monsters it's actually going to be

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.840 
our monsters it's actually going to be
three<00:01:50.820> tour<00:01:51.180> guide<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:52.439> tour<00:01:52.829> bus<00:01:53.130> tour

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
three tour guide and one tour bus tour

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.770 
three tour guide and one tour bus tour
bus<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.180> like<00:01:54.360> obviously<00:01:55.350> terrible<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.950> draw

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
bus is like obviously terrible to draw

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.270 
bus is like obviously terrible to draw
but<00:01:57.780> uh<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.590> actually<00:01:58.950> very<00:01:58.979> helpful

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
but uh it is actually very helpful

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.160 
but uh it is actually very helpful

was<00:02:05.159> playing<00:02:05.340> just<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.700> tour<00:02:05.880> guide<00:02:06.060> for<00:02:06.270> a

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
was playing just a tour guide for a

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.339 
was playing just a tour guide for a
while<00:02:07.009> but<00:02:08.009> uh<00:02:08.069> like<00:02:08.789> you'd<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:10.020> don't<00:02:10.170> want

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
while but uh like you'd you don't want

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.500 
while but uh like you'd you don't want
to<00:02:10.440> have<00:02:11.370> more<00:02:11.610> dead<00:02:11.819> cards<00:02:12.120> than<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.330> need

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
to have more dead cards than you need

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.370 
to have more dead cards than you need
because<00:02:12.660> iron<00:02:12.870> cores

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
because iron cores

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.600 
because iron cores
already<00:02:13.560> like<00:02:13.770> really<00:02:14.040> shitty<00:02:14.250> because<00:02:14.520> it

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
already like really shitty because it

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.150 
already like really shitty because it
essentially<00:02:14.940> is<00:02:15.210> a<00:02:15.470> spell<00:02:16.470> card<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.770> does

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
essentially is a spell card that does

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.820 
essentially is a spell card that does
absolutely<00:02:17.430> nothing<00:02:17.970> for<00:02:18.210> you<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:19.170> drawing

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
absolutely nothing for you so drawing

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.890 
absolutely nothing for you so drawing
the<00:02:20.010> third<00:02:20.490> tour<00:02:20.700> guide<00:02:20.970> after<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:21.570> special

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
the third tour guide after you special

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.630 
the third tour guide after you special
someone<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.140> first<00:02:22.380> two<00:02:22.590> doesn't<00:02:23.370> really<00:02:23.490> get

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
someone the first two doesn't really get

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.180 
someone the first two doesn't really get
you<00:02:23.760> anywhere<00:02:23.910> but<00:02:24.150> your<00:02:24.300> bus<00:02:24.420> is<00:02:24.450> good<00:02:24.690> so<00:02:25.190> and

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
you anywhere but your bus is good so and

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.260 
you anywhere but your bus is good so and
sometimes<00:02:26.340> they'll<00:02:26.670> draw<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:26.910> but<00:02:27.150> you'll

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
sometimes they'll draw it but you'll

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.060 
sometimes they'll draw it but you'll
also<00:02:27.390> draw<00:02:27.630> stuff<00:02:27.840> like<00:02:27.990> iron<00:02:28.200> core<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.710> tour

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
also draw stuff like iron core and tour

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.850 
also draw stuff like iron core and tour
bus<00:02:29.310> is<00:02:29.490> arguably<00:02:30.060> more<00:02:30.840> useful<00:02:31.230> by<00:02:31.380> itself<00:02:31.650> an

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
bus is arguably more useful by itself an

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.300 
bus is arguably more useful by itself an
iron<00:02:32.070> core<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:32.580> for<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.600> spells<00:02:34.130> point<00:02:35.130> three

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
iron core so for the spells point three

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.600 
iron core so for the spells point three
diamond<00:02:35.610> core<00:02:35.870> obviously<00:02:37.280> it's<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.400> rota

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
diamond core obviously it's a rota

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
of the cool things of this is that

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.500

gaining popularity diamond core gets a
lot<00:02:52.470> better<00:02:53.150> we're<00:02:54.150> also<00:02:54.240> playing<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.530> iron

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710

lot better we're also playing a to iron
core<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.370> mean<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.180> could<00:02:57.300> play<00:02:57.480> one<00:02:57.720> but<00:02:58.700> like

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
core I mean you could play one but like

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.860 
core I mean you could play one but like
you<00:02:59.730> can<00:02:59.910> definitely<00:03:00.090> slide<00:03:00.390> one<00:03:00.540> out<00:03:00.660> but

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
you can definitely slide one out but

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.720 
you can definitely slide one out but
game<00:03:01.020> one<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.230> really<00:03:01.500> wanted<00:03:01.860> turbo<00:03:02.280> into

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
game one you really wanted turbo into

game one you really wanted turbo into
your<00:03:03.060> combos<00:03:03.570> so<00:03:04.050> you<00:03:04.110> got<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.470> play<00:03:04.590> too<00:03:04.650> which

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
your combos so you got to play too which

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.350 
your combos so you got to play too which
really<00:03:05.280> sucks<00:03:05.640> but<00:03:06.060> whatever<00:03:07.640> point<00:03:08.640> 3<00:03:08.940> 10<00:03:09.180> key

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
really sucks but whatever point 3 10 key

around<00:03:36.090> so<00:03:36.840> this<00:03:37.080> I<00:03:37.260> don't<00:03:37.320> really<00:03:37.470> want<00:03:37.650> to

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
around so this I don't really want to

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.230 
around so this I don't really want to
make<00:03:37.800> that<00:03:37.980> chemisty<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.580> get<00:03:38.730> just<00:03:38.910> like

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
make that chemisty and get just like

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.890 
make that chemisty and get just like
destroyed<00:03:39.900> by<00:03:40.100> artifacts<00:03:41.100> so<00:03:41.870> we're<00:03:42.870> just

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
destroyed by artifacts so we're just
