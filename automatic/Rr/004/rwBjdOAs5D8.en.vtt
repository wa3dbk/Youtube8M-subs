00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.980 

it's<00:03:33.989> a<00:03:34.320> lot<00:03:34.530> of<00:03:34.620> yep

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.760 

see<00:03:38.990> look<00:03:39.140> at<00:03:39.260> this

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
see look at this

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.010 
see look at this
this<00:03:40.430> makes<00:03:40.700> it<00:03:40.819> a<00:03:40.880> lot<00:03:41.030> easier<00:03:41.450> into<00:03:41.690> shooting

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
this makes it a lot easier into shooting

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.150 
this makes it a lot easier into shooting
for<00:03:42.290> me<00:03:42.380> on<00:03:42.470> that<00:03:42.500> box<00:03:42.890> back<00:03:43.190> there<00:03:43.459> because

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
for me on that box back there because

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.140 
for me on that box back there because
they<00:03:46.160> can't<00:03:46.430> get<00:03:46.550> anywhere<00:03:46.819> near<00:03:46.880> the

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
they can't get anywhere near the

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.280 
they can't get anywhere near the
hostages<00:03:47.569> so<00:03:47.750> you<00:03:47.840> don't<00:03:47.990> have<00:03:48.080> to<00:03:48.170> worry

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
hostages so you don't have to worry

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.510 
hostages so you don't have to worry
about<00:03:48.380> them<00:03:48.650> killing<00:03:48.830> them

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.850 

I<00:03:53.610> think<00:03:54.510> that's<00:03:54.690> it<00:03:54.930> once<00:03:55.500> you<00:03:55.620> hit<00:03:55.710> that

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
I think that's it once you hit that

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.740 
I think that's it once you hit that
objective<00:03:56.430> marker<00:03:56.850> I<00:03:56.880> think<00:03:57.210> one<00:03:57.360> more<00:03:57.540> guy

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
objective marker I think one more guy

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.950 
objective marker I think one more guy
comes<00:03:58.050> down<00:03:59.420> not<00:04:00.420> there<00:04:00.660> is<00:04:00.810> see<00:04:01.620> I<00:04:02.960> think

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
comes down not there is see I think

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:09.620 
comes down not there is see I think
that's<00:04:04.230> all<00:04:06.410> all<00:04:07.410> right<00:04:08.060> this<00:04:09.060> way

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
that's all all right this way

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.970 
that's all all right this way
doors<00:04:10.080> open<00:04:10.770> this<00:04:11.460> is<00:04:11.610> the<00:04:11.730> last<00:04:11.940> breach<00:04:12.980> let's

last<00:04:22.370> Emeritus<00:04:24.470> it's<00:04:25.470> that<00:04:25.740> easy<00:04:26.030> no<00:04:27.030> it's<00:04:27.180> not

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
last Emeritus it's that easy no it's not

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.430 
last Emeritus it's that easy no it's not
it<00:04:28.590> takes<00:04:28.770> a<00:04:28.890> lot<00:04:29.040> of<00:04:29.070> practice<00:04:29.580> but<00:04:30.440> like

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
it takes a lot of practice but like

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.130 
it takes a lot of practice but like
maybe<00:04:31.770> if<00:04:31.920> you<00:04:32.040> watch<00:04:32.190> this<00:04:32.340> video<00:04:32.490> it'll<00:04:32.790> be

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
maybe if you watch this video it'll be

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:39.110 
maybe if you watch this video it'll be
it'll<00:04:34.140> get<00:04:34.260> a<00:04:34.290> lot<00:04:34.500> easier<00:04:35.330> there's<00:04:37.280> ah<00:04:38.280> yeah

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120
