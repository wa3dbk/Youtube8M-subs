 I would like to ask today is very 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.500
 simple of what reality by the tone 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.629

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.920
 two women during several cuts 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.590
 widespread polygamy everyone is 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.000

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.809
 chooses between a Charolais and 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.149
 a montbéliarde and in the early morning there 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.469
 dismiss one of the two from which 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.789
 reality by the tone that's what it's ace 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.800

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.649
 reality is what is there what is it 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.329
 else in this improbable reality and 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.559
 tone in reality as to each time 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.840
 we have the chance to see 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.860
 images of bucolic country animals 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.860

 chickens of the gorets but I can you 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.880
 to say that it's hard that the reality has been 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.130
 modified yes but we talk about tenerife 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.229
 because the protagonists are 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.600
 characters of reality are not 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.159

 seriously you believe we are in the 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.470
 real when adults who have more than 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.460
 50 years old bears the same name as the nephews 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.110
 donald 400 km from the sheet if they

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.850

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.840
 eu and loulou that's what will happen to 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.970
 what we are in the real world when people 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.560
 young people in the rain by 8 degrees to 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.830
 the terrace of a guinguette and no 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.420
 table is drawn up the things that make you 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.900
 pleasure to you who make me happy to man 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.510
 and that's a set what's going on 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.980
 a thing at and history is that it is 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.299
 in any case both of us and finally is this 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.069
 we are in the real when three 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.840
 singles completely stuffed this 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.370

 that's for sure it's real 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.910
 that's true it's okay but we 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.560
 learned this week that one of 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:55.890
 candidates this season was accused 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:57.510
 of abuse on a pony made to evoke 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.200
 a total recall that his street no but he 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.330
 must be very careful 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.799
 another candidate of season 7 thierry 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.910
 accused of trading scheming it's 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.120
 a traffic story of you when 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.549
 even 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.290
 then certainly farmers are 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.910
 super people who caress biquettes who 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.620
 get up early in the morning or will receive 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.549
 mail to dusty but yes because 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.810

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.670
 farmer hides a dangerous 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.840

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.049

 immense emotional distress but what 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.170
 I say but let 's be honest sometimes 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.010
