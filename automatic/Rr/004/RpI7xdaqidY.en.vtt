thing<00:00:47.579> back<00:00:47.969> together<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.570> camera<00:00:49.200> or<00:00:49.379> I'm

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
thing back together on camera or I'm

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.690 
thing back together on camera or I'm
just<00:00:49.590> gonna<00:00:49.770> have<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.980> leave<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.430> with

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
just gonna have to leave it with

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.760 
just gonna have to leave it with
explaining<00:00:51.510> how<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.629> do<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.559> have<00:00:52.590> to

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
explaining how to do it and you have to

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.290 
explaining how to do it and you have to
trust<00:00:53.010> me<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.280> that's<00:00:53.550> how<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.850> do<00:00:54.090> it

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
trust me that that's how to do it

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
because it can take some finagling to

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.130 
because it can take some finagling to
get<00:00:57.000> some<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.270> these<00:00:57.329> parts<00:00:57.660> back<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:58.020> there

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
get some of these parts back in there

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.430 
get some of these parts back in there
but<00:00:58.289> anyways<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.800> getting<00:00:59.520> right<00:00:59.640> into<00:00:59.850> it

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
want to pop open the only thing really

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.880 
want to pop open the only thing really
there's<00:01:30.450> some<00:01:30.630> spring<00:01:30.930> tension<00:01:31.380> on<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.770> blade

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
there's some spring tension on the blade

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.590 
there's some spring tension on the blade
that's<00:01:32.340> going<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.549> make<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.759> want<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.270> kind<00:01:33.509> of

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
that's going to make it want to kind of

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.469 
that's going to make it want to kind of
come<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.380> jarred<00:01:34.710> if<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.490> not<00:01:35.759> really

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
come on jarred if it's not really

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.390 
come on jarred if it's not really
securely<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.079> place<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.680> then<00:01:38.070> there's<00:01:38.250> also

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
securely in place and then there's also

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.490 
securely in place and then there's also
some<00:01:38.700> spring<00:01:39.119> tension<00:01:39.509> under<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.930> button<00:01:40.320> so

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
some spring tension under that button so

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.200 
some spring tension under that button so
let's<00:01:40.650> go<00:01:40.770> ahead<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:40.979> just<00:01:41.220> remove<00:01:41.820> this

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
let's go ahead and just remove this

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.899 
let's go ahead and just remove this
scale<00:01:42.540> here<00:01:43.130> take<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> look<00:01:44.399> at<00:01:44.490> what<00:01:44.640> we<00:01:44.759> got

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
scale here take a look at what we got

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.450 
scale here take a look at what we got
okay<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:45.930> everything<00:01:46.409> stayed<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:46.890> place<00:01:47.189> it

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
okay so everything stayed in place it

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.690 
okay so everything stayed in place it
looks<00:01:47.729> like<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.360> button<00:01:48.689> popped<00:01:48.990> up

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
looks like the button popped up

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
underneath you can see the spring the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.810 
underneath you can see the spring the
safety<00:01:53.460> right<00:01:53.640> here<00:01:55.189> we're<00:01:56.189> doing<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.610> oh

crap okay that was very very bad that is
exactly<00:02:03.509> what<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.810> didn't<00:02:04.049> want<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.320> happen

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
exactly what I didn't want to happen

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.460 

okay<00:02:22.220> who<00:02:23.220> thought<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:23.790> was<00:02:23.940> in<00:02:24.060> trouble<00:02:24.470> okay

this is what I was going to show you and

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.490 
this is what I was going to show you and
I<00:02:26.940> was<00:02:27.060> going<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.239> make<00:02:27.330> it<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.510> point<00:02:27.720> not<00:02:28.230> to

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
I was going to make it a point not to

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.160 
I was going to make it a point not to
lose<00:02:28.680> this<00:02:29.040> this<00:02:29.670> is<00:02:29.819> a<00:02:29.849> little<00:02:30.360> tiny<00:02:30.629> free

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
lose this this is a little tiny free

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.869 
lose this this is a little tiny free
bearing<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:32.480> basically<00:02:33.480> what<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.870> does<00:02:34.610> is<00:02:35.610> it

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
bearing and basically what it does is it

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.550 
bearing and basically what it does is it
works<00:02:36.569> in<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.930> safety<00:02:38.360> it<00:02:39.360> sits<00:02:39.810> right<00:02:40.110> there

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
works in the safety it sits right there

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.180 
works in the safety it sits right there
as<00:02:40.829> soon<00:02:41.010> as<00:02:41.159> we<00:02:41.370> get<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.730> focus<00:02:42.440> it<00:02:43.440> sits<00:02:44.040> in

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
as soon as we get a focus it sits in

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.619 
as soon as we get a focus it sits in
these<00:02:44.340> two<00:02:44.549> holes<00:02:44.819> right<00:02:45.000> here<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.480> actually

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
these two holes right here it actually

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.949 
these two holes right here it actually
moves<00:02:46.110> between<00:02:46.409> the<00:02:46.739> holes

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
moves between the holes

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:54.800 
moves between the holes
so<00:02:48.959> it's<00:02:49.110> positioned<00:02:50.840> in<00:02:51.950> this<00:02:52.950> hole<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.810> when

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
so it's positioned in this hole and when

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.740 
so it's positioned in this hole and when
you<00:02:54.900> slide<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.200> safety<00:02:56.000> it's<00:02:57.000> like<00:02:57.180> a<00:02:57.209> detent

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
you slide the safety it's like a detent

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.789 
you slide the safety it's like a detent
and<00:02:59.060> it's<00:03:00.060> just<00:03:00.329> a<00:03:00.450> little<00:03:00.900> tiny<00:03:01.109> bearing<00:03:01.680> that

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
and it's just a little tiny bearing that

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.670 
and it's just a little tiny bearing that
you<00:03:01.980> do<00:03:02.190> not<00:03:02.370> want<00:03:02.609> to<00:03:02.700> lose<00:03:03.410> so<00:03:04.410> I'm<00:03:04.470> go<00:03:04.560> ahead

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
you do not want to lose so I'm go ahead

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.039 
you do not want to lose so I'm go ahead
and<00:03:04.859> put<00:03:04.980> that<00:03:05.010> back<00:03:05.340> in<00:03:05.549> there<00:03:05.700> okay<00:03:06.690> so<00:03:06.780> now

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
and put that back in there okay so now

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.449 
and put that back in there okay so now
let's<00:03:07.560> go<00:03:07.620> ahead<00:03:07.739> and<00:03:08.310> remove<00:03:08.819> the<00:03:09.269> blade

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
let's go ahead and remove the blade

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.050 
let's go ahead and remove the blade
there<00:03:11.459> we<00:03:11.579> go

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
there we go

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.710 
there we go
and<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.540> detent<00:03:12.989> ball<00:03:13.909> moved<00:03:14.909> out<00:03:15.060> of<00:03:15.090> place<00:03:15.390> I

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
and the detent ball moved out of place I

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.960 
and the detent ball moved out of place I
have<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:15.989> remove<00:03:16.170> that<00:03:16.319> before<00:03:16.500> so<00:03:17.310> blade

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
have to remove that before so blade

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.089 
have to remove that before so blade
comes<00:03:18.209> off<00:03:18.420> it's<00:03:19.379> got<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.530> little<00:03:19.680> bushing

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
comes off it's got a little bushing

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.819 
comes off it's got a little bushing
system<00:03:20.489> here<00:03:21.299> and<00:03:21.480> here's<00:03:22.079> the<00:03:22.230> coil<00:03:22.440> spring

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
system here and here's the coil spring

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.210 
system here and here's the coil spring
main<00:03:23.430> thing<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:23.760> notice<00:03:23.970> is<00:03:24.299> that<00:03:24.359> the<00:03:25.220> this

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
main thing to notice is that the this

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.650 
main thing to notice is that the this
little<00:03:26.489> part<00:03:26.760> right<00:03:26.910> here<00:03:27.150> this<00:03:27.299> little<00:03:27.540> guy

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
little part right here this little guy

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.920 
little part right here this little guy
sticking<00:03:28.169> up<00:03:28.370> that's<00:03:29.370> facing<00:03:29.700> up<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.690> got<00:03:30.840> to

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
sticking up that's facing up you got to

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.710 
sticking up that's facing up you got to
remember<00:03:31.109> that<00:03:31.519> so<00:03:32.519> if<00:03:32.910> you<00:03:33.030> just<00:03:33.180> replace<00:03:33.329> in

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
remember that so if you just replace in

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.240 
remember that so if you just replace in
the<00:03:33.750> spring<00:03:34.079> or<00:03:34.200> whatever<00:03:34.470> you<00:03:34.650> take<00:03:34.859> this<00:03:35.040> out

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
the spring or whatever you take this out

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.960 
the spring or whatever you take this out
put<00:03:35.280> in<00:03:35.639> the<00:03:35.669> new<00:03:35.849> one<00:03:36.500> here's<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.709> spring<00:03:38.040> now

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
put in the new one here's the spring now

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.449 
put in the new one here's the spring now
when<00:03:39.359> reassembling<00:03:39.859> because<00:03:40.859> basically<00:03:41.069> this

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
when reassembling because basically this

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.190 
when reassembling because basically this
is<00:03:41.609> completely<00:03:42.120> down<00:03:42.540> there's<00:03:43.049> really

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
is completely down there's really

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.220 
is completely down there's really
nothing<00:03:43.590> else<00:03:43.709> this<00:03:43.950> is<00:03:43.980> all<00:03:44.250> solid<00:03:44.519> aluminum

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
nothing else this is all solid aluminum

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.210 
nothing else this is all solid aluminum
you<00:03:46.230> might<00:03:46.379> be<00:03:46.500> able<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.709> take<00:03:46.829> this<00:03:46.980> bushing

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
you might be able to take this bushing

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.000 
you might be able to take this bushing
apart<00:03:47.700> but<00:03:48.660> I'm<00:03:49.230> not<00:03:49.410> going<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.590> get<00:03:49.739> into<00:03:49.889> that

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
apart but I'm not going to get into that

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.069 
apart but I'm not going to get into that
in<00:03:50.220> this<00:03:50.310> video<00:03:50.549> I'm<00:03:51.359> making<00:03:51.690> sure<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:51.870> keep

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
in this video I'm making sure to keep

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.809 
in this video I'm making sure to keep
everything<00:03:52.410> level<00:03:52.739> and<00:03:52.980> flat<00:03:53.129> to<00:03:53.519> not<00:03:53.639> lose

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
everything level and flat to not lose

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.379 
everything level and flat to not lose
this<00:03:53.940> bearing<00:03:54.329> not<00:03:54.510> lose<00:03:54.660> that<00:03:54.690> spring

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
this bearing not lose that spring

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:58.909 
this bearing not lose that spring
obviously<00:03:57.389> that<00:03:57.510> would<00:03:57.629> be<00:03:57.660> bad<00:03:57.900> okay<00:03:58.590> so<00:03:58.650> here

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
obviously that would be bad okay so here

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.349 
obviously that would be bad okay so here
comes<00:03:59.099> the<00:03:59.220> tricky<00:03:59.549> part<00:03:59.579> putting<00:04:00.030> this<00:04:00.120> thing

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
comes the tricky part putting this thing

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.039 
comes the tricky part putting this thing
back<00:04:00.540> together<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:02.510> it<00:04:03.510> can<00:04:03.660> kind<00:04:03.870> of<00:04:03.900> be<00:04:04.019> a

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
back together and it can kind of be a

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.110 
back together and it can kind of be a
pain<00:04:04.319> I<00:04:04.560> mean<00:04:04.709> it's<00:04:04.949> easy<00:04:05.250> in<00:04:05.459> theory<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.940> do

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
pain I mean it's easy in theory to do

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.030 
pain I mean it's easy in theory to do
it's<00:04:06.389> just<00:04:06.449> it<00:04:06.840> takes<00:04:07.230> a<00:04:07.560> little<00:04:07.769> finagling

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
it's just it takes a little finagling

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.710 
it's just it takes a little finagling
and<00:04:08.459> trying<00:04:08.669> to<00:04:08.730> do<00:04:08.819> through<00:04:09.090> camera<00:04:09.449> might<00:04:09.629> be

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
and trying to do through camera might be

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.680 
and trying to do through camera might be
kind<00:04:09.900> of<00:04:09.930> difficult<00:04:10.349> but<00:04:11.150> here's<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.299> gist<00:04:12.480> of

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
kind of difficult but here's the gist of

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.379 
kind of difficult but here's the gist of
it<00:04:13.099> you're<00:04:14.099> dealing<00:04:14.430> with<00:04:14.669> the<00:04:14.790> spring<00:04:15.150> you've

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
it you're dealing with the spring you've

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.330 
it you're dealing with the spring you've
got<00:04:15.629> two<00:04:15.870> end<00:04:16.199> sticking<00:04:16.560> out<00:04:16.859> you've<00:04:17.099> got<00:04:17.220> this

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
got two end sticking out you've got this

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.420 
got two end sticking out you've got this
one<00:04:17.519> here<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.389> this<00:04:18.479> one<00:04:18.660> coming<00:04:18.870> up<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.430> they

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
one here and this one coming up and they

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.970 
one here and this one coming up and they
will<00:04:20.729> interact<00:04:21.060> with<00:04:21.419> this<00:04:21.989> groove<00:04:22.289> here<00:04:23.180> and

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
will interact with this groove here and

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.510 
will interact with this groove here and
this<00:04:26.940> hole<00:04:27.540> in<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:27.990> blade<00:04:28.770> and<00:04:29.190> as<00:04:29.310> you<00:04:29.400> can

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
this hole in the blade and as you can

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.250 
this hole in the blade and as you can
see<00:04:29.580> there's<00:04:29.970> a<00:04:30.030> recess<00:04:30.510> on<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:30.840> side<00:04:31.050> where

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
see there's a recess on the side where

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.220 
see there's a recess on the side where
that<00:04:31.290> spring<00:04:31.680> goes<00:04:31.890> in<00:04:32.720> it's<00:04:33.720> basically<00:04:34.050> what

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
that spring goes in it's basically what

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.780 
that spring goes in it's basically what
you<00:04:34.350> do<00:04:34.530> is<00:04:35.240> pop<00:04:36.240> this<00:04:36.480> in<00:04:36.720> so<00:04:37.470> that<00:04:37.790> this

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
you do is pop this in so that this

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.760 
you do is pop this in so that this
straight<00:04:39.420> piece<00:04:39.660> goes<00:04:40.050> into<00:04:40.380> that<00:04:40.530> groove

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
straight piece goes into that groove

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:48.380 
straight piece goes into that groove
right<00:04:41.010> there<00:04:42.650> just<00:04:43.650> like<00:04:43.890> that<00:04:47.120> actually<00:04:48.120> I

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
right there just like that actually I

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.310 
right there just like that actually I
got<00:04:48.630> a<00:04:49.550> anglich<00:04:50.550> there<00:04:51.000> we<00:04:51.090> go<00:04:51.270> now<00:04:51.960> it's<00:04:52.140> in

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
got a anglich there we go now it's in

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.770 
got a anglich there we go now it's in
there<00:04:52.500> in<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:53.670> open<00:04:53.940> position<00:04:54.090> there's<00:04:54.600> not<00:04:54.750> a

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
there in the open position there's not a

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.420 
there in the open position there's not a
lot<00:04:55.020> of<00:04:55.140> tension<00:04:55.350> on<00:04:55.530> the<00:04:55.590> blade<00:04:55.740> but<00:04:56.040> there<00:04:56.190> is

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
lot of tension on the blade but there is

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.090 
lot of tension on the blade but there is
a<00:04:56.460> little<00:04:57.060> bit<00:04:57.270> of<00:04:57.360> tension<00:04:57.570> so<00:04:58.560> this<00:04:58.830> does<00:04:59.070> not

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
a little bit of tension so this does not

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.340 
a little bit of tension so this does not
just<00:04:59.550> pop<00:04:59.790> straight<00:05:00.270> on<00:05:00.480> there<00:05:00.720> you<00:05:01.020> are<00:05:01.200> gonna

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
just pop straight on there you are gonna

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.410 
just pop straight on there you are gonna
have<00:05:01.470> to<00:05:01.560> muscle<00:05:01.710> it<00:05:02.040> a<00:05:02.070> little<00:05:02.310> so<00:05:03.090> basically

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
have to muscle it a little so basically

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.630 
have to muscle it a little so basically
that<00:05:04.320> piece<00:05:04.620> sticking<00:05:05.040> out<00:05:05.190> you<00:05:05.430> want<00:05:05.580> to

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
that piece sticking out you want to

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.610 
that piece sticking out you want to
align<00:05:05.910> with<00:05:06.210> this<00:05:06.390> hole<00:05:06.660> right<00:05:06.690> here<00:05:09.500> sorry<00:05:10.500> if

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
align with this hole right here sorry if

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.230 
align with this hole right here sorry if
you<00:05:10.710> hear<00:05:10.860> my<00:05:10.980> kid<00:05:11.190> in<00:05:11.250> the<00:05:11.340> background<00:05:11.790> so<00:05:12.210> I

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
you hear my kid in the background so I

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.360 
you hear my kid in the background so I
have<00:05:12.420> it<00:05:12.510> in<00:05:12.570> the<00:05:12.630> hole<00:05:12.840> and<00:05:13.080> then<00:05:14.010> you<00:05:14.040> just

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
have it in the hole and then you just

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.440 
have it in the hole and then you just
kind<00:05:14.580> of<00:05:14.670> want<00:05:14.850> to<00:05:15.000> just<00:05:15.920> push<00:05:16.920> it<00:05:17.130> over<00:05:17.450> onto

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
kind of want to just push it over onto

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.340 
kind of want to just push it over onto
that<00:05:18.570> pivot<00:05:18.900> like<00:05:19.080> that<00:05:20.120> and<00:05:21.120> you<00:05:21.870> are<00:05:21.900> good<00:05:22.260> to

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
that pivot like that and you are good to

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.510 
that pivot like that and you are good to
go<00:05:22.470> with<00:05:22.560> that<00:05:22.650> now<00:05:22.980> you're<00:05:23.130> probably<00:05:23.280> going

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
go with that now you're probably going

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.830 
go with that now you're probably going
to<00:05:23.580> want<00:05:23.730> to<00:05:23.760> hold<00:05:23.940> it<00:05:24.060> like<00:05:24.180> this<00:05:24.450> to<00:05:24.660> keep

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
to want to hold it like this to keep

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.040 
to want to hold it like this to keep
everything<00:05:25.110> in<00:05:25.320> line<00:05:25.760> so<00:05:26.760> next<00:05:27.300> let's<00:05:27.930> go

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
everything in line so next let's go

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:38.000 
everything in line so next let's go
ahead<00:05:28.230> and<00:05:29.990> get<00:05:30.990> the<00:05:31.140> safety<00:05:31.650> on<00:05:31.680> here<00:05:36.860> so<00:05:37.860> as

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
ahead and get the safety on here so as

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.800 
ahead and get the safety on here so as
you<00:05:38.160> can<00:05:38.250> see<00:05:38.310> when<00:05:38.970> you<00:05:39.030> push<00:05:39.210> it<00:05:39.240> forward

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
you can see when you push it forward

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.790 
you can see when you push it forward
that's<00:05:40.710> the<00:05:40.980> detent<00:05:42.320> now<00:05:43.320> this<00:05:43.500> is<00:05:43.620> the<00:05:43.770> other

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
that's the detent now this is the other

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.560 
that's the detent now this is the other
tricky<00:05:44.340> part<00:05:45.050> getting<00:05:46.050> this<00:05:46.140> button<00:05:46.500> in<00:05:46.590> here

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
tricky part getting this button in here

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.150 
tricky part getting this button in here
in<00:05:48.570> theory<00:05:49.050> it<00:05:49.140> should<00:05:49.350> slide<00:05:49.650> right<00:05:49.710> in<00:05:50.040> and

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
in theory it should slide right in and

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.220 
in theory it should slide right in and
out<00:05:50.340> right<00:05:50.580> just<00:05:50.880> like<00:05:51.090> we<00:05:51.630> did<00:05:51.810> when<00:05:51.960> we<00:05:52.080> took

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.230 
out right just like we did when we took

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.030 
out right just like we did when we took
it<00:05:52.290> apart<00:05:53.000> but<00:05:54.000> everything's<00:05:54.360> so<00:05:54.690> tight<00:05:55.050> that

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
it apart but everything's so tight that

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.490 
it apart but everything's so tight that
you've<00:05:56.340> got<00:05:56.580> to<00:05:56.790> get<00:05:56.970> this<00:05:57.240> and<00:05:58.020> of<00:05:58.140> course<00:05:58.380> you

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
you've got to get this and of course you

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.710 
you've got to get this and of course you
want<00:05:58.680> the<00:05:58.770> recess<00:05:59.160> to<00:05:59.460> go<00:05:59.610> on<00:05:59.730> top<00:05:59.970> of<00:06:00.210> the

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
want the recess to go on top of the

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.590 
want the recess to go on top of the
spring<00:06:01.410> there<00:06:01.820> everything<00:06:02.820> is<00:06:02.940> just<00:06:03.030> so<00:06:03.270> tight

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
spring there everything is just so tight

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.980 
spring there everything is just so tight
that<00:06:03.930> it<00:06:04.470> just<00:06:05.250> seems<00:06:06.240> like<00:06:06.360> it<00:06:06.540> takes<00:06:06.690> for

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
that it just seems like it takes for

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.640 
that it just seems like it takes for
freaking<00:06:07.350> ever<00:06:08.000> to<00:06:09.000> get<00:06:09.180> it<00:06:09.330> to<00:06:09.480> go<00:06:09.660> straight

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
freaking ever to get it to go straight

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:16.310 
freaking ever to get it to go straight
in<00:06:10.970> you<00:06:11.970> got<00:06:12.150> to<00:06:12.180> like<00:06:12.390> twist<00:06:12.810> it<00:06:14.990> and<00:06:15.990> this<00:06:16.110> is

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
in you got to like twist it and this is

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.380 
in you got to like twist it and this is
the<00:06:16.410> part<00:06:16.650> I<00:06:16.740> was<00:06:16.860> worried<00:06:17.190> about<00:06:17.280> doing<00:06:18.180> on

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.390 
the part I was worried about doing on

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.860 
the part I was worried about doing on
camera<00:06:19.490> because<00:06:20.490> it<00:06:20.880> just<00:06:21.030> seems<00:06:21.540> like<00:06:21.690> you

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
camera because it just seems like you
