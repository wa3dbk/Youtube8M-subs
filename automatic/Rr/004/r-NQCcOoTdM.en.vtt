00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 good to everyone I am arctic and we are here 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.290
 to learn how to build a generator 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.670
 of snow so let's start this 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.920
 tutorial is going to serve us for any 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.380
 of the minecraft versions so 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.059
 we start first of all we're going to 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.010
 need some pumpkins that you can 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.230
 find randomly by the terrain 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.480
 and we will also need blocks of snow 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.330
 these snow blocks are made by catching 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.609
 snow from these snowy biomes and when 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.949
 you have the balls, you do a fiddle that 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.019
 is a cube of four because there are two 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.870
 for two that is four snow of 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.390
 two by two to make a cube when 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.090
 you have this cube, do not be two so 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.489
 we need a pumpkin two cubes and a 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.129
 any material in this case I'm going 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.899
 to use the stone and slaps the slap 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.579
 It can also be a stone but I 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.950
 I put it with esla because it's pretty 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.460
 better so let's see how 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.170
 we make 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.110
 I'm going to get right here to 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.270
 show you what the trick is, let's say 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.100
 this generator the thing is that you have to 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.469
 be in a snowy biome if it's not in 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.960
 a snowy biome will not work this 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.760
 you can see it with efe 3 with efe 3 veis 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.650
 that there is an area with a 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.260
 I do not know if it will look good now that it is 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.210
 behind the trees there is an area 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.150
 there you will find in the penultimate 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.940
 line that puts explains that means 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.560
 snowy plains or ice plains and 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.530
 in this case, it would be correct for the 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.470
 tutorial but if we go here you see that 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.020
 changes us to plane that would be plains and 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.570
 in the plains no longer because as you see 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.700
 it is not snowed and therefore the golem 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.030
 of snow would not work so we have 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.680
 to go to this language here we go to 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.570
 build it here we're just going to need 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.270
 do as a cage let's put here 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.030
 some blocks laid like this so the snow man 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.160
 will be placed here then we return one by 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.410
 up and you're done 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.650
 I mean mainly this will be now 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.750
 close it like that and we'll have it 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.670
 is missing now to do this well then 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.710
 place the snow man inside we start to 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.930
 build your time here and put a block 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.690
 of snow another block of snow and the 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.490
 pumpkin head and we already have it 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.320
 we have here our ministrers neuman 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.390
 now you can remove this snow from here 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.850
 that will not be of any use to us and with 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.560
 be careful you can remove this snow 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.070
 As I am creative, nothing comes out but 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.110
 if we put ourselves in survival mode you see 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.660
 now we will leave snowballs 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.820
 from around here so perfect 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.730
 now we get here and now we pick up 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.130
 You see perfect, we just have to go 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.690
 doing this you see and if you put 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.380
 with the corner of this one is against the 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.390
 stone you can go giving it fast and 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.970
 perfect or is already generating the 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.160
 snow you put here and look we already have 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.810
 a good amount of snow with this 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.460
 we can continue like this for hours and hours and 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.230
 hours and hours you can even put 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.530
 directly so that you can pick it up 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.330
 just to start over especially be careful 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.130
 to do it here in the corner because if 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.930
 you do it more to the center you have the 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.730
 danger of hitting the snow man and charging 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.890
 oslo and then you will have to look 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.180
 another pumpkin if you have a farm 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.670
 pumpkins is not a problem but 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.320
 moment this is what we have so 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.760
 you see we can already get a big 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.430
 amount of snow without having to spend 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.230
 Not a single other resource is a very 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.510
 very cheap because even this you can 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.000
 do it inside a mountain and so not 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.920
 you need to spend these materials the 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.110
 only difficulty is finding 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.130
 the pumpkin and the snowed biome so 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.710
 this has been everything is that you liked 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.710
 and see you in the next video goodbye
