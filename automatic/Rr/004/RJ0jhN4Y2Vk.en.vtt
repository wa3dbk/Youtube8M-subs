00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
taking ten minutes for each line so even

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.730 
taking ten minutes for each line so even
if<00:02:59.750> when<00:02:59.870> they're<00:02:59.990> working<00:03:00.080> quickly<00:03:00.410> then

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
if when they're working quickly then

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.170 
if when they're working quickly then
work<00:03:00.920> can<00:03:00.950> have<00:03:01.250> a<00:03:01.280> lot<00:03:01.520> of<00:03:01.550> power<00:03:01.820> and

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
work can have a lot of power and

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.210 
work can have a lot of power and
sometimes<00:03:03.110> even<00:03:03.230> more<00:03:03.500> power<00:03:03.710> because<00:03:03.860> they

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
sometimes even more power because they

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.190 
sometimes even more power because they
know<00:03:04.430> it's<00:03:05.000> going<00:03:05.390> up<00:03:05.480> quickly<00:03:05.720> and<00:03:05.960> it's<00:03:06.050> not

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
know it's going up quickly and it's not

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.940 
know it's going up quickly and it's not
going<00:03:06.320> to<00:03:06.440> stay<00:03:06.590> long<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:08.290> so<00:03:09.290> there's

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
going to stay long and so there's

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.290 
going to stay long and so there's
something<00:03:10.130> about<00:03:10.220> that<00:03:10.580> so<00:03:10.760> any<00:03:11.030> of<00:03:11.180> these
