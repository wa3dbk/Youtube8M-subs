00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.640
 Hello everyone 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.640
 It is this time 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.040
 That the hen 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.519
 I'd have a fight 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.950
 balloon 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.950
 How to fight 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.680
 Basics This basic thing 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.250
 Want to think teach about 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.520
 It is a net 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:32.250
 I'm that fight the way first, it is this camera work 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.250
 The camera is advertising when I move the right stick 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.530
 with this 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.840
 First of all to see the other party to move 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.370
 Say not to put your opponent in the camera view 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.130
 But 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:50.690
 There is already a limit just to defeat and look at the camera before this 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.690
 I'm absolutely out of the camera 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.630
 I don't know what movement the other player thinks I'm going to miss from the camera in a sky battle 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.630
 you know 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.630
 It matters a little only that only baked just the body 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:08.190
 Say defeat before this and say what to do bird 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.190
 I'm going to work on camera, but when I'm out of this 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.290
 You can go to the full text by pressing Leastic 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.610
 Like this 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.610
 It is to fight with this 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.170
 It becomes the foundation in the foundation 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.270
 Finally with this camera viewpoint 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.770
 You will be ready for air warfare 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.770
 You will not see the turn and remove it 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.880
 Because it is completely different already with and without empty camera 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:45.180
 I think this will never come 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.720
 It is said that it is in the city to be bobbled 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.260
 It is a use of the Well camera in waiting 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.390
 Considerably with this camera in this of gold this naturally become 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.480
 I think it will take a short time 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:02.480
 This is who I am 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.480
 When you do not have to move to do freely doing in this camera viewpoint 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.310
 I wish I could move 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.080
 Just stick 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.830
 I would like to explain even balloons or detailed commentary videos 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.830
 Such skills as you are by this 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.220
 I bought 3 jobs 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.160
 Because everyone has a skill 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.370
 I would like to explain the 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.360
 It is this time it is against the way in time and how to use this camera 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.330
 Machine gun 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.150
 that 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:37.870
 I 've been catching up with me now, and I came in fifth place behind me 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.490
 I do is do it by the other party do not know even against the back of the nursery 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.900
 In the fighter's back is hard 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.050
 As high as possible 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.870
 White circle is good now 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:51.330
 Until you come to the front 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.330
 White circle and shoot towards you 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.380
 He front side of the front I can only be 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:04.650
 In the direction of the front 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:06.390
 If you try to shoot in the direction of the fighter's fighter's fighter, you will cross the article behind 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.100
 If you hit it, you're an ant 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.100
 I did not act before the item 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.930
 Come out because Saga 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.950
 Maeda is good for articles 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.020
 Front side front lower side 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.950
 Previous one 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.160
 In front of the battle 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.160
 headache 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.260
 Because I can not paint the main 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.260
 It is not a Marine 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.890
 Oh, I have an empty battle like this 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:39.240
 It takes a real time if you get used to this camera c 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:42.240
 I have no idea if I am above or below the beginning 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.360
 Self-destruction 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.140
 later 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.310
 The timing to hit the center 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.819
 I don't know what to beat 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.090
 Practice too 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.090
 If done 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.300
 The first is the camera I this 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.720
 Blow 2 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.560
 Until you get used to Murase 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.560
 Please try together 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.220
 If the flow What length of color is probably 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.770

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.780
 Tea break tea 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.690
 How to rely on 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:38.700
 Well to some degree high It is how to use that use the hand mold where the camera say 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:40.620
 If the other party is about to fit in with nothing done 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.480
 Away 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.820
 When I can't see it I just can't see it 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.260

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.460
 This is all 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:02.569
 I mean 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.260
 Because I 'm in the field of view of the camera 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:07.280
 this 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.280
