00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hello my name is maxim they 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.790
 lynchuk 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.280
 I am leading the monthly price review 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.980
 apartments in Krasnoyarsk and author of books on 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.809
 real estate transactions 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.139
 Today we will analyze a very important video. 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.600
 the question of what the cost of apartments depends on 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.840
 what determines the cost of apartments in 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.250
 a particular city in Krasnoyarsk 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.939
 I will make it very simple to understand 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.760
 in a way using several drawings and 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:32.450
 so what does the cost of jelly depend on 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.620
 The first cost of housing depends on 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.850
 city ​​attractions 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.500
 attractiveness of the region therefore 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:46.379
 the symbol will see him live well in 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:52.140
 this city, the second criterion is income 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.129
 population we draw it with a symbol here 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.079
 so far 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.340
 Ruble sign officially we have not accepted and 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.980
 third character 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.559
 This is the third factor that affects 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.400
 the cost of housing is a promising and 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:10.439
 the possibility of building new housing 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:13.610
 we will visit the house and so let's check 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.840
 in practice, how does this scheme work? 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.939
 factors influence the stand found 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.520
 let's look at several cities for example 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.210
 then go to Krasnoyarsk to present 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.619
 imagine the capital of our homeland Moscow 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.320
 people tend to move there from all over 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.560
 Russian attractiveness does not cause 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.130
 city ​​doubt the second income factor 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.770
 population 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.259
 Objectively, incomes of the population of Moscow are higher 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.090
 than the average for Russia 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.360
 the third factor is prospects 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.770
 construction of new housing knowing the situation 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.380
 in Moscow you need to understand that 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.990
 Much cheaper housing will not be in 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.399
 soon 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.049
 imagine another city city pro 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.759
 which is said to be located at hell on 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.130
 kulichkah 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.130
 people leave from there there are no universities there 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.079
 no normal operation and 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.450
 smiley is not so funny the second 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:07.209
 factor is income 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.890
 people get meager wages work 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.290
 si in one company get 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.810
 salary with delays and very very 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.920
 small get barter in general 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.170
 the situation is also bad 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.370
 Well naturally asters new housing is not 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.700
 region is being built 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:25.180
 fading prospects no natural 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.230
 the cost of apartments will be low now 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.599
 We turn to the growth turnout our main ones 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.390
 despite the fact that we have a bad environment 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.340
 cosnett among the top ten in the top twenty 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.269
 the dirtiest cities of Russia here 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.030
 a lot of people come firstly those 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.220
 who comes to enroll in universities 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.790
 about 15 come to Krasnoyarsk every year 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:52.209
 thousand people from different regions second 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.670
 income level let's say objectively in 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.850
 Krasnoyarsk is the highest level 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.410
 revenues in the Siberian Federal District 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.600
 this also affects the cost of housing and 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.459
 the third factor is perspectivity 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.620
 and the possibility of mass construction 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:11.019
 new housing knowing the situation from the inside can 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.870
 say about what's coming soon 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.459
 next year two some sites on 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.380
 which millions will be built 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.959
 square meters of cheap available 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.819
 there is no such housing in more detail we 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.790
 parse this topic on the pages 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:27.430
 monthly price review therefore this 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.490
 there will be a separate video topic so this 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.720
 will be 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:35.960
 another time so let's summarize by 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.630
 the fact that our city annually come 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.480
 all new and new people looking for the best 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.420
 life due to the fact that the level of wages 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.750
 Our city is higher than in other regions 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.530
 in most regions of Russia the level 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.180
 housing prices corresponds to the present 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.780
 yes he is tall but none the less 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.700
 Krasnoyarsk is not a leader in the ranking of cities 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.520
 we are ranked 15 by some ratings 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.110
 twentieth place 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:07.250
 supply and demand balance each 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:10.280
 friend in this in our list there is no mortgage 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.200
 I did not specifically write did not single it out 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.120
 separate item well first 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.890
 mortgage rates mortgage rates 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.950
 loans they are the same in all regions 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.040
 Russia is an exception when local 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.630
 authorities date 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.880
 offset part of the interest rate in 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.330
 these regions, the rise in prices for apartments 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.690
 very noticeable when we have a mortgage and plyusuem 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.820
 population incomes here it is if 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.040
 man and if man can not accumulate 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.030
 money to buy an apartment, he turns 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.060
 for a bank loan 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.630
 this is directly related to his income to 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.800
 population income, we also attribute 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.370
 maternity capital which is on 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:52.970
 today 80 thousand families in our 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.390
 edge is almost 30 billion rubles 30 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.680
 billion rubles in the hands of people 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.470
 surely these factors are very strong 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.570
 affect the supply and demand is very 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.700
 strongly affect the cost of housing and
