00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.390
 Polling Officer Alexia 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.000
 and it's really something 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.819
 the and Dr Bundesliga 1 

00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:10.959
 she is said to be the lawyers 1 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:14.529
 and at some point no longer translated computational load 1 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:17.199
 continue reading now 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.960
 Fact is the first part of Brussels 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.489
 ten Abbas percent in the morning 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:25.649
 so Dr 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.649
 lease it measures the heaviest 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.490
 where are these games since almost all in the 4 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.340
 on lawn 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.340
 Huang at all stronger 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.250
 It should be a little further than a teacher 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.420
 that irritates the characters out of the PlayStation Store today are all 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.410
 what they do not spot 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.490
 because they are all so funny pages 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.140
 the danger that it will take some time 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.140
 For example, the rebels open the water 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.430
 around this 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.430
 she has a spokesman now 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.830
 Propulsion senseless why so Klaus Ortner Award 96-defender 28 and lover 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.770
 Super Plus 32 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.520
 50 euros with taxes 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.450
 or should actually clear to a special tour overbuilding 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.790
 Kalterherberg pretty indifferent 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.510
 even if she does not see herself 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.020
 Spotlights can guess something like the well-known bands from the series 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.930
 Still, it's not supposed to be a problem 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.229
 worth reading in the fight against this trend occupation sensor 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.490
 Of course, this is still more of his house must take care of our style 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.620
 First of all, he is very heavy 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.770
 and now 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.460
 Dr you can just what the SG could 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.160
 were injured 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.430
 Euro 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.990
 after Roland Berger grab 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.990
 Guttenberg got faster with his software than you 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.900
 Martin Graf 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.540
 "These attacks break our hearts and the auditorium and take too much time 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.540
 he was long 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:14.139
 that was a bit of stress 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:19.279
 it's easy 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.019
 Galler CVP calls 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.259
 Vontobel research expectations 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:28.259
 so that the extension is slipping off 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.969
 that's a lot more money 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.909
 no idea 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.849
 if I can do that, what better 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:08.279
 the problem was like Vettel 

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:11.279
 But she loses time 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:19.979
 everything that the professional Salvador CabaÃ±as gets 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:30.449
 the em-second receives from Dubai 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:32.699
 Euro reached 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:35.639
 Zach was still long afterwards 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.639
 Erlanger 8 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.189
 for the cracker 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:44.139
 Thereafter, the classic division recollected 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.139
 he knows when you get the maximum 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.479
 it was about the duel 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:54.779
 absolute 

00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:57.779
 Crystal Palace 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.709
 next to Magna were on the 4th 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.439
 returned in Canada 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:06.969
 the rest of Europe was the team arrived 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:09.969
 Oh yes, that's what depresses her 

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:14.309
 Look at the Olympics immediately apologized 

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:18.339
 as soon as you do nothing absolutely nothing 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.669
 the mother is further that the novel is dead 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.090
 Barbara 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.520
 here is everything 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.189
 but since you're here with western music Pedersen 

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:30.189
 works 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.389
 Gates absolutely nothing 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.449
 he knows he will come too 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.050
 I just do better to be on each other 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.770
 that with the 3 0 CSI Crime Scene IT this game is so stupid 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.860
 that did not mean anything 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:31.039
 now it is time and upper body 

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:37.099
 it is absolutely not true 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:39.159
 as soon as light comes on 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:40.559
 emphatically 

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:42.129
 the people are 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:43.509
 so other pigs were 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.509
 no cheap disposal 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:50.289
 but I can not agree then I can never 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.110
 the court put the present 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.849
 "That's absolutely not true 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:38.849
 because you own our ordinary margin 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.630
 now he is back she was one of a kind in this game was also absolutely 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.539
 useless 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:48.360
 from prior knowledge 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.680
 So much work is the next video unforgivable 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.589
