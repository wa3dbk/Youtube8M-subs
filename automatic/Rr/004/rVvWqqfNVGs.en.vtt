00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010

these<00:00:17.100> away<00:00:17.160> from<00:00:17.460> surprise<00:00:17.789> um<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.810> video

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
these away from surprise um this video

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.630 
these away from surprise um this video
has<00:00:19.260> been<00:00:19.410> filmed<00:00:19.590> at<00:00:19.740> sequence<00:00:20.220> which<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.550> the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
has been filmed at sequence which is the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.859 
has been filmed at sequence which is the
reason<00:00:20.789> why<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.029> caller<00:00:21.240> has<00:00:21.510> already<00:00:21.660> been

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
reason why the caller has already been

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.990 
reason why the caller has already been
fitted<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.039> video<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> little<00:00:23.640> bit<00:00:23.910> all

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
fitted so the video is a little bit all

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.340 
fitted so the video is a little bit all
over<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.300> place<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.689> do<00:00:24.750> apologize<00:00:25.320> for

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
over the place so I do apologize for

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.810 
over the place so I do apologize for
that<00:00:25.650> but<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:25.980> probably<00:00:26.099> will<00:00:26.340> be<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.550> same

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
that but it probably will be the same

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.160 
that but it probably will be the same
for<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.060> next<00:00:27.269> couple<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.539> videos<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.109> do

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
for the next couple of videos that I do

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.410 
for the next couple of videos that I do
um<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.519> this<00:00:29.580> video<00:00:29.730> I'm<00:00:30.119> going<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.300> take

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
um so in this video I'm going to take

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.490 
um so in this video I'm going to take
you<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.570> look<00:00:30.660> around<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.960> caller<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.380> then

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
you to look around the caller and then

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.350 
you to look around the caller and then
do<00:00:31.590> some<00:00:31.740> performance<00:00:31.859> tests<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:33.090> let's<00:00:33.239> get

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
do some performance tests so let's get

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.760 
do some performance tests so let's get

is<00:02:21.210> very<00:02:21.450> easy<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.810> do<00:02:22.020> but<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:22.380> practice<00:02:22.830> when

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
is very easy to do but in practice when

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.350 
is very easy to do but in practice when
the<00:02:23.130> stuff<00:02:23.310> like<00:02:23.460> foul<00:02:23.640> paste<00:02:23.880> involved<00:02:24.240> in

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
your case is lying down I imagine it

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.190 
your case is lying down I imagine it
could<00:02:26.310> be<00:02:26.400> quite<00:02:26.520> tricky<00:02:26.790> although<00:02:27.780> I'd<00:02:28.020> think

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
could be quite tricky although I'd think

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
could be quite tricky although I'd think
that<00:02:28.320> if<00:02:28.500> you're<00:02:28.620> using<00:02:28.770> something<00:02:29.040> like<00:02:29.130> a

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
that if you're using something like a

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.010 
that if you're using something like a
small<00:02:29.460> icx<00:02:29.970> board<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.570> has<00:02:30.660> been<00:02:30.810> fitted

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.120 
small icx board and it has been fitted
in<00:02:31.080> your<00:02:31.200> case<00:02:31.350> yet<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.740> would<00:02:31.830> be<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.010> lot

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
in your case yet it would be a lot

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.460 
in your case yet it would be a lot
easier<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.430> do<00:02:32.670> so<00:02:33.420> now<00:02:33.870> I'm<00:02:33.960> gonna<00:02:34.170> move<00:02:34.290> on<00:02:34.410> to

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
easier to do so now I'm gonna move on to

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:55.990 
easier to do so now I'm gonna move on to

being<00:02:56.660> honest<00:02:57.080> I'm<00:02:57.350> a<00:02:57.380> little<00:02:57.530> bit

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
being honest I'm a little bit

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
the NHL 9 I I mean it wasn't overly loud

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.610 
the NHL 9 I I mean it wasn't overly loud
but<00:03:02.330> I<00:03:02.360> did<00:03:02.570> notice<00:03:02.780> that<00:03:02.960> we're<00:03:03.260> running<00:03:03.350> off

like<00:04:53.930> small<00:04:54.200> form-factor<00:04:54.530> builds<00:04:55.250> so<00:04:55.760> I<00:04:55.790> think

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
like small form-factor builds so I think

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.550 
like small form-factor builds so I think
that<00:04:56.210> the<00:04:56.360> performance<00:04:56.810> results<00:04:57.169> that<00:04:57.290> I<00:04:57.320> got

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
that the performance results that I got

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.350 
that the performance results that I got
aren't<00:04:57.919> necessarily<00:04:58.340> valid<00:04:58.729> real-world

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
aren't necessarily valid real-world

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.570 
aren't necessarily valid real-world
results<00:04:59.830> but<00:05:00.830> I<00:05:00.860> am<00:05:01.010> going<00:05:01.130> to<00:05:01.190> be<00:05:01.310> doing<00:05:01.400> a

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.100 
results but I am going to be doing a

certain<00:05:03.590> so<00:05:03.800> I<00:05:03.830> am<00:05:04.070> going<00:05:04.250> to<00:05:04.310> wait<00:05:04.430> until<00:05:04.700> then
