 favaloro university nutrition 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:21.609
 right that you have things like 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.920
 change habits to not have 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:27.279
 overweight not being obese I have more 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.429
 difficult it seemed to me not and the stigma that 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:33.370
 we have as weave rooms you are the ones 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.770
 communicators a person when he changes 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.570
 goes through four stages is studied 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.670
 by science in the first stage 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.190
 science the area is pre contemplative 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.559
 I do not have a problem to have the least 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.269
 after new contemplative before that 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.059
 nose problem 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.739
 I do not know but then between the actions of 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:55.239
 pressure before the immense what was seen is 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.559
 that you facilitate a lot in the step 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.690
 of the pre-concentration stage 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.610
 contemplative listeners you who 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.949
 they hear about any topic and 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.259
 according to what happens to me, he calls me for that 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.470
 it's so difficult is that I have a problem 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.979
 and has a solution 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.979
 at least 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.369
 we can not help more specifically to 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.229
 move to market the market in general 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.080
 of years each guideline in the industry 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.210
 pharmaceutical the efficient bicycle at 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.789
 what you can do in the market in the 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.819
 lyrics and culture do not allow them 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:36.490
 keep the uniblocks keep changes 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:38.940
 healthy for example if I work 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.940
 many hours 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.970
 games were perceived 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.480
 that is, it is 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.850
 I do not have to follow the schedule then it's 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.300
 as a joint work between all 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.870
 we're still not doing that 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.640
 As I am Monica and live very well bag 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.400
 is that I do the impossible here trying 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.770
 to put us all in action but good 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.420
 as no one is a prophet in his land is 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.340
 activated that helps us toral has to 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.950
 start people for example but 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.180
 type the purchase of the supermarket and 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.210
 make a minute together in the house 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.980
 grow up I think there are three things with the 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.370
 stories and struggling 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.370
 when someone 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.450
 this asks me what we do each 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.970
 day if we can with the people that start 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.970
 such small things to me 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.240
 is turning out to be ricardo bulgaria him 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.760
 tangible what we want to change 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.950
 then I tell you when you are going to put today 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.540
 at night tomorrow this weekend to 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.700
 Easter 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.370
 Armate a plate with your food a few solos 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.260
 can be more forgiveness are calories or 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.209
 less more or less healthy but a single 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.030
 dish is up to the effort with your 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.850
 cells do not equal all the deadlines 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:03.010
 personal photos to your various dishes 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:05.390
 watch them take charge if it's good or not 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.769
 shared with friends if they were not 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.209
 doctor half I say light oil look 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.209
 what are you people doing in 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.819
 General is seen when evaluating 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.800
 analyze if that comes from adding in the in 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.150
 the assembly of his plan that is a small 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.790
 change that patients can make 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.680
 now get the next one starting where 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.490
 these supplements like the city and not the 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.910
 of dry 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:32.240
 people who do activity so that if 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.810
 then I think this helps because it's 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.370
 a fat inhibitor that is fulfilled and 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.030
 what and when he does physical activity 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.890
 his muscle this one burns him but not maybe 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.470
 handcuffed shown and you can 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.830
 explain all of a sudden that we talk about 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.930
 change and in the change by executing 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.790
 because it is a joint task of all 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.310
 I have to change my food my 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.400
 movement but if I want to add a 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.490
 light more there are necessary supplements are 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.880
 natural ingredients that are in the 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:07.560
 foods 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:10.170
 if someone in a company the highest 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.670
 standards in a capsule and you can 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:17.430
 take basically if we talk from the 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.860
 plan that what we are saying is a 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:24.660
 natural component of milk 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.550
 basically it 's a healthy fat of the 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.980
 milk and what it does always new 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.800
 basically it is that fat decreases 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:34.950
 body but added a change of the sky 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.860
 days and I add it to eat better a single 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.420
 plate by you see not the second third 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.350
 portion because it's our last scene 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:45.210
 and if I move anything at least I 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.630
 I bought into account steps and something 10,000 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.730
 steps per day in the shortest time that 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.750
 you can get to add that amount of 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.080
 steps in my life 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.420

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.320
