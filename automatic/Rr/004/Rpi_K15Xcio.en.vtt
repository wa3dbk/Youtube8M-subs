that point we're ready to combine the
two<00:01:45.090> if<00:01:45.329> we<00:01:45.869> wind<00:01:46.079> up<00:01:46.170> taking<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.619> hot<00:01:46.829> liquid

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
two if we wind up taking this hot liquid

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.770 
two if we wind up taking this hot liquid
however<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.729> we<00:01:47.790> dump<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.149> right<00:01:48.180> into<00:01:48.630> these

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
however and we dump it right into these

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.630 
however and we dump it right into these
eggs<00:01:49.079> what's<00:01:49.470> going<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.680> happen<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.490> hot

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
eggs what's going to happen is the hot

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.789 
eggs what's going to happen is the hot
liquid<00:01:50.880> which<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.240> hovering<00:01:51.630> around<00:01:51.799> 200

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
liquid which is hovering around 200

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.440 
liquid which is hovering around 200
degrees<00:01:53.100> right<00:01:53.369> now<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.759> going<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.210> wind<00:01:54.390> up

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
degrees right now is going to wind up

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.850 
degrees right now is going to wind up
cooking<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.899> eggs<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.409> they're<00:01:55.649> going<00:01:55.799> to

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
cooking the eggs and they're going to

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.069 
cooking the eggs and they're going to
scramble<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.880> one<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.329> things<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.810> we<00:01:57.930> do

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
scramble so one of the things that we do

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.230 
scramble so one of the things that we do
is<00:01:58.290> we<00:01:58.500> gradually<00:01:59.219> introduce<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.759> hot<00:01:59.880> liquid

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
is we gradually introduce the hot liquid

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.880 
is we gradually introduce the hot liquid
into<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.630> eggs<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.439> process<00:02:01.860> called

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
into the eggs in a process called

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.950 
into the eggs in a process called
tempering<00:02:02.670> going<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.000> take<00:02:03.180> my<00:02:03.329> hot<00:02:03.540> liquid

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
tempering going to take my hot liquid

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.770 
tempering going to take my hot liquid
and<00:02:04.170> slowly<00:02:04.680> pour<00:02:05.130> in<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:06.000> hot<00:02:06.149> liquid<00:02:06.390> into

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
and slowly pour in the hot liquid into

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.600 
and slowly pour in the hot liquid into
the<00:02:06.810> bowl<00:02:07.079> while<00:02:07.590> I'm<00:02:07.710> constantly<00:02:08.190> whipping

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
the bowl while I'm constantly whipping

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.339 
the bowl while I'm constantly whipping
it<00:02:08.729> what<00:02:09.119> this<00:02:09.330> does<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.110> going<00:02:10.289> to

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
it what this does is this is going to

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.020 
it what this does is this is going to
bring<00:02:10.560> up<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.860> temperature<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.520> eggs<00:02:11.730> and

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
bring up the temperature of the eggs and

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.830 
bring up the temperature of the eggs and
cool<00:02:12.660> off<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.050> temperature<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.620> the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
cool off the temperature of the

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.729 
cool off the temperature of the
Darry<00:02:14.170> so<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.040> eggs<00:02:15.220> don't<00:02:15.340> scramble<00:02:16.739> very

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
Darry so the eggs don't scramble very

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.199 
Darry so the eggs don't scramble very
have<00:02:17.920> some<00:02:18.129> hot<00:02:18.280> water<00:02:18.519> you<00:02:18.700> can<00:02:18.849> tell<00:02:19.060> from

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
have some hot water you can tell from

the steam that's floating up on top it's
just<00:02:21.190> below<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.670> boil<00:02:22.030> we<00:02:22.480> take<00:02:22.720> our<00:02:22.900> bowl<00:02:23.190> set

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
just below a boil we take our bowl set
