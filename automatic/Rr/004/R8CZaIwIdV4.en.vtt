against<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.620> backer

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
against the backer

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.979 
against the backer
I<00:00:50.280> want<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.850> look<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.149> safety<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.780> way

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
I want to look that safety this way

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.380 
I want to look that safety this way
little<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.530> now<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.710> create<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> hole<00:00:53.550> here<00:00:53.820> this

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
little so now I create a hole here this

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.660 
little so now I create a hole here this
throw<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.989> not<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> big<00:00:55.649> deep<00:00:56.010> down<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.640> field

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
throw is not a big deep down the field

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.420 
throw is not a big deep down the field
throat<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.050> hole<00:00:58.260> shot<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.010> want<00:00:59.340> to

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430

throat it's a hole shot so you want to
maybe<00:00:59.670> even<00:00:59.879> five<00:01:00.270> plan<00:01:00.660> if<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.020> know<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.230> got

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
maybe even five plan if you know you got

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.150 
maybe even five plan if you know you got
what<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.680> want

and that backers tight and you got your
fast<00:01:04.650> guy<00:01:04.890> inside<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.790> he's<00:01:06.240> running<00:01:06.479> past

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
fast guy inside and he's running past

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.140 
fast guy inside and he's running past
him<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.200> might<00:01:07.380> be<00:01:07.560> five<00:01:07.860> plant<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.520> drill<00:01:09.000> it

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
him it might be five plant and drill it

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.789 
him it might be five plant and drill it
right<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.600> hole<00:01:09.840> right<00:01:09.869> here<00:01:10.110> today

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
right in this hole right here today

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.219 
right in this hole right here today
before<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.460> backer<00:01:11.729> can<00:01:12.150> get<00:01:12.330> there<00:01:12.570> there's

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
before that backer can get there there's

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.810 
before that backer can get there there's
usually<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.650> nice<00:01:13.860> little<00:01:14.130> window<00:01:14.430> right<00:01:14.790> there

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
usually a nice little window right there

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.179 
usually a nice little window right there
but<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:15.570> not<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.810> big<00:01:16.110> high<00:01:16.320> arcing<00:01:16.830> throw

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
but it's not a big high arcing throw

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.830 
but it's not a big high arcing throw
where<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.549> free<00:01:17.790> safety<00:01:18.210> can<00:01:18.360> make<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> play

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
where this free safety can make a play

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.620 
where this free safety can make a play
or<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.650> corner<00:01:20.009> can<00:01:20.189> sink<00:01:20.430> inside<00:01:20.850> so

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
or this corner can sink inside so

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.890 
or this corner can sink inside so
against<00:01:22.439> cover<00:01:22.650> three<00:01:22.979> we're<00:01:23.280> thinking

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
against cover three we're thinking

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.749 
against cover three we're thinking
either<00:01:24.900> one<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.350> these<00:01:25.470> inside<00:01:25.920> throws<00:01:26.310> now

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
either one of these inside throws now

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.850 
either one of these inside throws now
four<00:01:27.060> corners<00:01:27.420> getting<00:01:27.689> nosy<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.409> know<00:01:28.770> you

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
four corners getting nosy you know you

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.069 
four corners getting nosy you know you
can<00:01:29.040> always<00:01:29.220> tag<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> come<00:01:30.060> back<00:01:30.270> outside<00:01:30.509> for

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
can always tag a come back outside for

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.200 
can always tag a come back outside for
your<00:01:31.170> outside<00:01:31.530> receiver<00:01:31.950> if<00:01:32.579> they<00:01:32.820> do<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.000> good

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
your outside receiver if they do a good

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.789 
your outside receiver if they do a good
job<00:01:33.270> with<00:01:33.600> their<00:01:33.750> corners<00:01:34.140> but<00:01:34.350> that's<00:01:34.560> down

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
job with their corners but that's down

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.130 
job with their corners but that's down
the<00:01:34.950> line<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.520> single<00:01:36.299> safety<00:01:36.509> we're<00:01:36.810> thinking

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
the line so single safety we're thinking

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.950 
the line so single safety we're thinking
inside<00:01:37.549> all<00:01:38.549> right<00:01:38.640> for<00:01:39.060> verticals<00:01:39.570> versus

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
inside all right for verticals versus

inside all right for verticals versus
cover<00:01:40.200> -<00:01:40.500> now<00:01:40.770> we're<00:01:41.579> keying<00:01:42.000> one<00:01:42.570> side<00:01:42.869> or<00:01:43.049> the

cover - now we're keying one side or the

cover - now we're keying one side or the
other<00:01:43.520> either<00:01:44.520> safety<00:01:45.210> that's<00:01:45.600> our<00:01:45.810> key<00:01:46.020> if<00:01:46.409> I

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
other either safety that's our key if I

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.859
