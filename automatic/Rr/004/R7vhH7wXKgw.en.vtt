hey guys its mysterious tech here today

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.539 
hey guys its mysterious tech here today
we<00:00:03.240> got<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:03.419> pass<00:00:03.720> comparison<00:00:04.350> between<00:00:05.069> an

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
we got a pass comparison between an

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.839 
we got a pass comparison between an

three<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:20.480> you<00:00:21.480> see<00:00:21.720> if<00:00:22.710> everybody<00:00:23.189> saw<00:00:23.730> the

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
three so you see if everybody saw the

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.759 
three so you see if everybody saw the
video<00:00:24.330> before<00:00:24.539> i'm<00:00:24.990> actually<00:00:25.199> going<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.619> pull

video before i'm actually going to pull

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.519 
video before i'm actually going to pull
out<00:00:25.920> my<00:00:26.160> iphone<00:00:26.699> 4<00:00:27.000> as<00:00:27.210> well<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.320> it's

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
out my iphone 4 as well so that it's

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.939 
out my iphone 4 as well so that it's
kind<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.949> through<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.250> comparison<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.800> we<00:00:31.800> got

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
kind of a through a comparison so we got

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.510 
kind of a through a comparison so we got
the<00:00:32.180> legit<00:00:33.180> firmware<00:00:33.600> legit<00:00:34.290> firmware<00:00:34.739> not

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
the legit firmware legit firmware not

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.090 
the legit firmware legit firmware not
legit<00:00:35.969> firmware<00:00:36.420> but<00:00:36.630> looks<00:00:37.020> pretty<00:00:37.350> real<00:00:37.590> so

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
legit firmware but looks pretty real so

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.889 
legit firmware but looks pretty real so
let's<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.489> slide<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.760> unlock<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.390> all<00:00:39.660> these

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
let's just slide to unlock on all these

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.750 
let's just slide to unlock on all these
and<00:00:40.489> we<00:00:41.489> can<00:00:41.670> see<00:00:42.059> how<00:00:42.329> similar<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.350> looks<00:00:43.760> so

right on the home screen they all look
pretty<00:00:46.649> similar<00:00:47.340> i'm<00:00:48.329> just<00:00:48.420> going<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.690> adjust

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
they're all look pretty similar now

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.979 
they're all look pretty similar now
let's<00:00:55.649> just<00:00:55.829> go<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.340> try<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.910> open<00:00:57.390> up<00:00:57.719> some

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
let's just go and try to open up some

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.049 
let's just go and try to open up some
categories<00:01:00.109> right<00:01:01.109> there<00:01:01.350> it's<00:01:02.129> pretty<00:01:02.789> fast

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
categories right there it's pretty fast

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.030 
categories right there it's pretty fast
speed<00:01:03.359> everybody<00:01:03.870> knows<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.049> for<00:01:04.860> some

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
speed everybody knows that for some

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.359 
speed everybody knows that for some
reason<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> iphone<00:01:05.880> 3g<00:01:06.390> has<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:07.140> es<00:01:07.409> slight

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
reason the iphone 3g has a es slight

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.570 
reason the iphone 3g has a es slight
speed<00:01:09.030> reduction<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.869> four<00:01:10.380> point<00:01:10.650> oh<00:01:10.710> now

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
speed reduction in four point oh now

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.609 
speed reduction in four point oh now
this<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.939> not<00:01:12.090> jailbroken<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:13.140> we're<00:01:13.439> going<00:01:13.500> to

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
this is not jailbroken so we're going to

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.600 
this is not jailbroken so we're going to
see<00:01:13.799> how<00:01:14.070> exactly<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.670> handles<00:01:16.130> if<00:01:17.130> we<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.430> go

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
see how exactly it handles if we just go

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.280 
see how exactly it handles if we just go
over<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.880> here<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.240> can<00:01:18.420> see<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.810> i<00:01:18.990> actually

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
over to here you can see that i actually

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.820 
over to here you can see that i actually
have<00:01:20.810> 63<00:01:21.890> megabytes<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.100> ram<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.390> my<00:01:25.320> ipod

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
have 63 megabytes of ram on my ipod

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.859 
have 63 megabytes of ram on my ipod
touch<00:01:25.950> 1g<00:01:26.520> let's<00:01:27.150> just<00:01:27.270> wait<00:01:27.540> for<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.840> to

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
touch 1g let's just wait for that to

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:35.230 
touch 1g let's just wait for that to
focus<00:01:28.939> and<00:01:31.040> it<00:01:32.040> doesn't<00:01:32.579> want<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:33.090> vote<00:01:33.930> guess

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
focus and it doesn't want to vote guess

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:42.550 
focus and it doesn't want to vote guess
so<00:01:36.240> we're<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.659> gonna<00:01:37.020> assume<00:01:37.680> now

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.710 

and<00:01:44.060> well<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.540> says<00:01:46.580> 63<00:01:47.580> megabytes<00:01:48.210> as<00:01:48.450> you

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
and well that says 63 megabytes as you

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.740 
and well that says 63 megabytes as you
can<00:01:48.780> see<00:01:48.930> right<00:01:48.960> there<00:01:49.260> so<00:01:50.190> that's<00:01:50.790> very<00:01:50.970> fast

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
can see right there so that's very fast

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.180 
can see right there so that's very fast
for<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.740> now<00:01:53.700> an<00:01:54.030> iphone<00:01:54.450> 4<00:01:54.750> that's<00:01:55.170> not<00:01:55.440> the

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
for this now an iphone 4 that's not the

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
for this now an iphone 4 that's not the
fastest<00:01:56.940> but<00:01:57.530> for<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.800> device<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.940> is

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
fastest but for this device that is

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.900 
fastest but for this device that is
extremely<00:02:00.870> fast<00:02:01.290> see<00:02:01.650> my<00:02:01.800> iphone<00:02:02.310> 4<00:02:02.580> is<00:02:02.700> going

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
extremely fast see my iphone 4 is going

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.750 
extremely fast see my iphone 4 is going
about<00:02:03.300> 200<00:02:03.690> megabytes<00:02:04.260> on<00:02:04.680> average<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.550> can

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
about 200 megabytes on average you can

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.980 
about 200 megabytes on average you can
get<00:02:06.030> up<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.480> about<00:02:07.010> 400<00:02:08.010> so<00:02:08.760> on<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.330> iphone<00:02:09.690> 3g

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
get up to about 400 so on the iphone 3g

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.270 
get up to about 400 so on the iphone 3g
i<00:02:10.020> can't<00:02:10.380> test<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.770> because<00:02:10.980> it's<00:02:11.100> not

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
i can't test it because it's not

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.670 
i can't test it because it's not
jailbroken<00:02:11.850> yet<00:02:11.910> i'm<00:02:12.320> probably<00:02:13.320> going<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.620> be

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
jailbroken yet i'm probably going to be

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.800 
jailbroken yet i'm probably going to be
doing<00:02:13.830> a<00:02:14.010> tutorial<00:02:14.160> video<00:02:14.730> on<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.210> but<00:02:15.780> i

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
doing a tutorial video on that but i

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.720 
doing a tutorial video on that but i
just<00:02:16.050> wanted<00:02:16.320> to<00:02:16.350> keep<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.650> on<00:02:16.830> jailbroken<00:02:17.250> for

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
just wanted to keep it on jailbroken for

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
just wanted to keep it on jailbroken for
these<00:02:17.850> purposes<00:02:18.200> so<00:02:19.670> let's<00:02:20.670> just<00:02:20.850> watch<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.510> few

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
these purposes so let's just watch a few

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.970 
these purposes so let's just watch a few
apps<00:02:21.960> plus<00:02:22.620> open<00:02:23.220> up<00:02:23.280> settings<00:02:24.920> now<00:02:25.920> the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.100 
iphone 3g does not have multitasking
where<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.710> ipod<00:02:29.070> touch<00:02:29.250> 1st<00:02:29.940> generation<00:02:30.210> does

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
where the ipod touch 1st generation does

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.740 
where the ipod touch 1st generation does
so<00:02:32.100> you<00:02:32.130> can<00:02:32.430> see<00:02:32.640> that<00:02:32.820> there<00:02:33.150> was<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.330> slight

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
so you can see that there was a slight

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.820 
so you can see that there was a slight
advantage<00:02:34.740> on<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.430> iphone<00:02:35.940> 3g<00:02:36.380> but<00:02:37.380> it's<00:02:37.650> not

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
advantage on the iphone 3g but it's not

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.000 
advantage on the iphone 3g but it's not
a<00:02:37.860> huge<00:02:38.040> deal<00:02:38.210> let's<00:02:39.210> see<00:02:39.470> but<00:02:40.470> if<00:02:40.590> we<00:02:40.620> have

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
a huge deal let's see but if we have

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.590 
a huge deal let's see but if we have
multitasking<00:02:41.580> running<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:43.470> obvious<00:02:44.010> winner

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
multitasking running the obvious winner

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.380 
multitasking running the obvious winner
the<00:02:45.600> ipod<00:02:45.900> touch<00:02:46.080> 1g<00:02:46.850> as<00:02:47.850> you<00:02:48.060> can<00:02:48.150> see<00:02:48.360> right

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
the ipod touch 1g as you can see right

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.350 
the ipod touch 1g as you can see right
there<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.920> speed<00:02:50.220> reduction<00:02:50.520> isn't<00:02:51.209> that

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
there and the speed reduction isn't that

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.670 
there and the speed reduction isn't that
huge<00:02:51.720> when<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:52.200> have<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.500> month

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
huge when you have the month

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.699 
huge when you have the month
multitasking<00:02:53.610> running<00:02:54.150> so<00:02:54.959> let's<00:02:55.530> go<00:02:55.680> ahead

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
multitasking running so let's go ahead

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.449 
multitasking running so let's go ahead
and<00:02:56.130> open<00:02:56.550> up<00:02:56.610> photos<00:02:57.890> in<00:02:58.890> case<00:02:59.160> you're<00:02:59.370> right

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
and open up photos in case you're right

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.490 
and open up photos in case you're right
there<00:02:59.750> they<00:03:01.280> use<00:03:02.300> so<00:03:03.300> and<00:03:03.660> this<00:03:04.110> is<00:03:04.260> still

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
there they use so and this is still

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.890 
there they use so and this is still
running<00:03:04.739> multitasking<00:03:05.640> this<00:03:06.300> one<00:03:06.480> does<00:03:06.690> not

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
running multitasking this one does not

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.590 
running multitasking this one does not
have<00:03:06.959> multitasking<00:03:07.790> so<00:03:08.790> that's<00:03:09.450> just

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
have multitasking so that's just

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.050 
have multitasking so that's just
something<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:10.080> keep<00:03:10.230> in<00:03:10.380> mind<00:03:10.700> so<00:03:11.700> if<00:03:11.760> we<00:03:11.910> open

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
something to keep in mind so if we open

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.260 
something to keep in mind so if we open
it<00:03:12.330> up<00:03:12.450> again<00:03:13.610> you<00:03:14.610> can<00:03:14.730> see<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:15.030> obvious

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
it up again you can see the obvious

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.699 
it up again you can see the obvious
winner<00:03:16.459> so<00:03:17.459> that<00:03:18.330> was<00:03:18.570> just<00:03:18.600> a<00:03:19.050> couple<00:03:19.410> little

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
winner so that was just a couple little

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.130 
winner so that was just a couple little
tests<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.820> categories<00:03:21.420> definitely<00:03:21.959> looks

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
tests the categories definitely looks

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.590 
tests the categories definitely looks
pretty<00:03:22.470> good<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:23.250> course<00:03:23.489> you<00:03:23.670> don't<00:03:23.760> have<00:03:24.209> the

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
pretty good of course you don't have the

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.620 
pretty good of course you don't have the
multitasking<00:03:25.590> on<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.830> iphone<00:03:26.220> 3g<00:03:26.640> but<00:03:27.330> trust

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
multitasking on the iphone 3g but trust

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.040 
multitasking on the iphone 3g but trust
me<00:03:27.770> this<00:03:28.770> way<00:03:29.040> is<00:03:29.310> much<00:03:29.970> better<00:03:30.480> than<00:03:30.570> native

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
me this way is much better than native

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.650 
me this way is much better than native
native<00:03:31.650> multitasking<00:03:31.860> on<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.730> iphone<00:03:33.090> 3g<00:03:33.480> i

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.130 
native multitasking on the iphone 3g i
just<00:03:34.380> tested<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.750> multitasking<00:03:36.750> right

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
just tested it and multitasking right

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.130 
just tested it and multitasking right
here<00:03:37.470> is<00:03:37.700> much<00:03:38.700> much<00:03:39.150> better<00:03:41.120> that<00:03:42.120> custom<00:03:43.020> app

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
here is much much better that custom app

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.949 
here is much much better that custom app
switcher<00:03:43.590> that<00:03:43.739> we<00:03:43.860> modified<00:03:44.400> it<00:03:44.959> definitely

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
switcher that we modified it definitely

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.820 
switcher that we modified it definitely
looks<00:03:46.920> and<00:03:47.160> works<00:03:47.370> better<00:03:47.670> and<00:03:48.320> over<00:03:49.320> here<00:03:49.590> is
