how that works first of all you need a

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.580 
how that works first of all you need a
special<00:00:48.120> type<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.360> string<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.930> called<00:00:49.170> twine

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
special type of string is called twine

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.380 
special type of string is called twine
and<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:49.980> can<00:00:50.160> get<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.399> at<00:00:50.520> almost<00:00:50.760> any<00:00:51.090> drug

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
store or hardware store now the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.830 
store or hardware store now the
interesting<00:00:53.489> thing<00:00:53.730> about<00:00:53.879> twine<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.660> it's

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
interesting thing about twine is it's

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.110 
interesting thing about twine is it's
not<00:00:55.079> just<00:00:55.140> one<00:00:55.770> piece<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.250> string<00:00:56.579> it's

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
not just one piece of string it's

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.910 
not just one piece of string it's
actually<00:00:57.660> several<00:00:58.199> different<00:00:58.559> piece<00:00:58.739> of

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
actually several different piece of

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.260 
actually several different piece of
strings<00:00:59.300> all<00:01:00.410> twisted<00:01:01.410> together<00:01:01.879> so<00:01:02.879> here's

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
strings all twisted together so here's

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.960 
strings all twisted together so here's
how<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.600> secret<00:01:04.199> works<00:01:04.549> before<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.610> start

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
how the secret works before you start

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.670 
how the secret works before you start
you<00:01:06.119> do<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.390> secret<00:01:06.810> setup<00:01:07.170> that's<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.470> part

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
you do the secret setup that's the part

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.010 
you do the secret setup that's the part
that<00:01:07.830> nobody's<00:01:08.250> allowed<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.580> see<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.360> you

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
that nobody's allowed to see and you

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.020 
that nobody's allowed to see and you
find<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.380> center<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.070> string<00:01:11.369> now<00:01:11.850> you'll

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
find the center of the string now you'll

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.649 
find the center of the string now you'll
notice<00:01:12.299> if<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.020> twist<00:01:13.590> one<00:01:14.040> way<00:01:14.330> the<00:01:15.330> strings

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
notice if you twist one way the strings

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.570 
notice if you twist one way the strings
become<00:01:16.020> tighter<00:01:16.320> if<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.650> twist<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.130> opposite

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
become tighter if you twist the opposite

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.999 
become tighter if you twist the opposite
way<00:01:17.850> they<00:01:18.659> become<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:19.049> little<00:01:19.350> bit<00:01:19.470> looser<00:01:19.830> what

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
way they become a little bit looser what

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.820 
way they become a little bit looser what
you<00:01:20.130> want<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.430> do<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:21.229> untwist<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.470> strings

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
you want to do is untwist the strings

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.950 
you want to do is untwist the strings
until<00:01:23.310> they're<00:01:23.490> almost<00:01:23.700> all<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.659> straight

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
until they're almost all in a straight

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.800 
until they're almost all in a straight
line<00:01:25.080> together<00:01:25.890> then<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.000> find<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.450> Center

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
line together then you find that Center

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.170 
line together then you find that Center
and<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.020> use<00:01:28.229> your<00:01:28.470> fingernails<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.939> you

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
and you use your fingernails and you

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.460 
and you use your fingernails and you
just<00:01:30.450> separate<00:01:31.229> them

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
just separate them

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.750 
just separate them
now<00:01:33.470> there's<00:01:33.710> different<00:01:33.770> types<00:01:34.310> of<00:01:34.490> twine

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
now there's different types of twine

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.120 
now there's different types of twine
someone<00:01:35.150> before<00:01:35.300> strands<00:01:36.020> I'm<00:01:36.290> only<00:01:36.410> five<00:01:36.680> six

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
someone before strands I'm only five six

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.770 
someone before strands I'm only five six
so<00:01:37.610> you<00:01:37.670> want<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:37.970> do<00:01:38.060> about<00:01:38.150> half<00:01:38.480> and<00:01:38.750> half

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
so you want to do about half and half

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.510 
so you want to do about half and half
this<00:01:39.110> one<00:01:39.350> is<00:01:39.470> four<00:01:39.710> strands<00:01:40.190> so<00:01:40.280> I'm<00:01:40.340> using

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
this one is four strands so I'm using

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.000 
this one is four strands so I'm using
two<00:01:40.850> on<00:01:41.030> each<00:01:41.180> side<00:01:41.480> then<00:01:42.380> what<00:01:42.560> you<00:01:42.650> do<00:01:42.800> is<00:01:42.830> you

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
two on each side then what you do is you

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.400 
two on each side then what you do is you
twist<00:01:43.400> each<00:01:43.670> end<00:01:44.030> back<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:44.990> other<00:01:45.140> way<00:01:45.230> so

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
twist each end back the other way so

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.930 
twist each end back the other way so
they're<00:01:45.770> tight<00:01:45.980> you'll<00:01:46.130> notice<00:01:46.430> this<00:01:46.610> way<00:01:46.790> is

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
they're tight you'll notice this way is

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.730 
they're tight you'll notice this way is
the<00:01:47.090> wrong<00:01:47.240> way<00:01:47.480> because<00:01:47.900> they<00:01:48.020> become<00:01:48.350> looser

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
the wrong way because they become looser

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.430 
the wrong way because they become looser
this<00:01:49.310> way<00:01:49.580> they<00:01:49.970> become<00:01:50.120> tighter<00:01:50.660> so<00:01:51.140> here's

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
this way they become tighter so here's

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.740 
this way they become tighter so here's
where<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:51.740> magic<00:01:51.860> part<00:01:52.280> happens<00:01:52.730> if<00:01:52.940> you

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
where the magic part happens if you

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.440 
where the magic part happens if you
pinch<00:01:54.140> where<00:01:55.130> they<00:01:55.280> intersect<00:01:55.640> it<00:01:56.120> looks<00:01:56.300> like

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
pinch where they intersect it looks like

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.840 
pinch where they intersect it looks like
an<00:01:56.600> X<00:01:56.780> you<00:01:57.440> cover<00:01:57.770> that<00:01:57.890> with<00:01:58.340> your<00:01:58.460> fingers

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
an X you cover that with your fingers

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.730 
an X you cover that with your fingers
you<00:01:59.390> want<00:01:59.540> to<00:01:59.690> create<00:01:59.930> the<00:02:00.140> illusion<00:02:00.380> that

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
you want to create the illusion that

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.800 
you want to create the illusion that
there's<00:02:00.950> two<00:02:01.310> continuous<00:02:01.970> pieces<00:02:02.390> of<00:02:02.510> string

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
there's two continuous pieces of string

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.180 
there's two continuous pieces of string
so<00:02:03.440> you<00:02:03.530> straighten<00:02:04.040> this<00:02:04.220> here<00:02:04.610> and<00:02:04.850> there

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
so you straighten this here and there

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.650 
so you straighten this here and there
then<00:02:07.190> you<00:02:07.340> ask<00:02:07.520> for<00:02:07.790> your<00:02:07.880> spectators<00:02:08.390> hand

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
then you ask for your spectators hand

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.380 
then you ask for your spectators hand
and<00:02:08.930> you<00:02:09.350> place<00:02:09.680> it<00:02:09.890> inside<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.399> head<00:02:10.760> and<00:02:10.970> you

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
and you place it inside the head and you

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.110 
and you place it inside the head and you
have<00:02:11.420> them<00:02:11.870> close<00:02:12.260> that<00:02:13.250> way<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:13.490> can't<00:02:13.850> see

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
have them close that way you can't see

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.910 
have them close that way you can't see
what's<00:02:14.330> actually<00:02:14.630> happening<00:02:15.350> inside<00:02:15.740> the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
what's actually happening inside the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.530 
what's actually happening inside the
hand<00:02:16.930> now<00:02:17.930> what<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.620> do<00:02:18.830> is<00:02:19.100> you<00:02:19.640> pull<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.300> two

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
hand now what you do is you pull the two

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.390 
hand now what you do is you pull the two
pieces<00:02:20.900> of<00:02:21.110> string<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.680> opposite<00:02:22.250> direction

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
pieces of string the opposite direction

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.480 
pieces of string the opposite direction
and<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.660> string<00:02:24.020> restores<00:02:24.800> itself<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.430> if

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
and the string restores itself and if

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.280 
and the string restores itself and if
you<00:02:25.550> open<00:02:25.820> your<00:02:25.910> hand<00:02:26.120> now<00:02:26.660> we<00:02:26.720> can<00:02:27.050> get<00:02:27.170> the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
you open your hand now we can get the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.260 
you open your hand now we can get the
inside<00:02:27.800> look<00:02:28.130> of<00:02:28.310> what's<00:02:28.550> actually<00:02:28.760> happening

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
inside look of what's actually happening

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.880 
inside look of what's actually happening
when<00:02:29.870> your<00:02:30.020> hand<00:02:30.200> is<00:02:30.350> closed<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:32.710> they<00:02:33.710> go

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
when your hand is closed and they go

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.340 
when your hand is closed and they go
right<00:02:34.130> back<00:02:34.190> together<00:02:34.960> and<00:02:35.960> there's<00:02:36.170> no

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
right back together and there's no

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.740 
right back together and there's no
evidence<00:02:36.590> left<00:02:37.070> and<00:02:37.459> that's<00:02:38.270> how<00:02:38.510> you<00:02:38.570> turn

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
evidence left and that's how you turn

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.340 
evidence left and that's how you turn
two<00:02:39.020> pieces<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.470> string<00:02:39.709> into<00:02:40.160> one
