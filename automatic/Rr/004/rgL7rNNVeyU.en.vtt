about was the RPG being able to lock on
to<00:01:56.189> choppers<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.930> has<00:01:58.229> been<00:01:59.130> done<00:01:59.280> away

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
to choppers so that has been done away

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.819 
to choppers so that has been done away
with<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.939> can<00:02:00.090> no<00:02:00.210> longer<00:02:00.240> use<00:02:00.570> an<00:02:00.990> RPG<00:02:01.619> or

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829

with you can no longer use an RPG or
small<00:02:02.610> along<00:02:03.329> with<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.810> laser<00:02:04.020> designator

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
small along with the laser designator

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.910 
small along with the laser designator
they've<00:02:05.490> also<00:02:05.759> fixed<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.659> warnings<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.740> the

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
they've also fixed the warnings in the

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.800 
they've also fixed the warnings in the
vehicles<00:02:08.340> whenever<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.940> are<00:02:09.179> being<00:02:09.509> targeted

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
vehicles whenever you are being targeted

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.660 
vehicles whenever you are being targeted
so<00:02:10.200> now<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.440> will<00:02:10.830> hear<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.160> war

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
so now you will hear a war

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.880 
so now you will hear a war
if<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.030> missile<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.660> incoming<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.380> they've

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
if a missile is incoming and they've

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.610 
if a missile is incoming and they've
also<00:02:14.240> decreased<00:02:15.240> all<00:02:15.810> of<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.440> laser

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
also decreased all of the laser

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.370 
also decreased all of the laser
designated<00:02:17.370> missiles<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.000> originally<00:02:18.599> it<00:02:19.319> was

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
designated missiles so originally it was

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.070 
designated missiles so originally it was
doing<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:20.160> hundred<00:02:20.580> percent<00:02:20.670> damage<00:02:21.030> now<00:02:21.780> it

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
doing a hundred percent damage now it

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.930 
doing a hundred percent damage now it
has<00:02:22.230> dropped<00:02:22.530> down<00:02:22.709> to<00:02:22.770> ninety<00:02:23.310> percent<00:02:23.489> and

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
has dropped down to ninety percent and

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.260 
has dropped down to ninety percent and
that<00:02:24.510> was<00:02:24.690> done<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.140> give<00:02:25.470> pilots<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.730> chance<00:02:27.060> to

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
that was done to give pilots a chance to

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.479 
that was done to give pilots a chance to
use<00:02:27.420> their<00:02:27.630> fire<00:02:27.870> extinguishers<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.739> they

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
use their fire extinguishers and they

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.699 
use their fire extinguishers and they
also<00:02:29.730> mentioned<00:02:30.239> tweaking<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.050> aim<00:02:31.290> assist

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
also mentioned tweaking the aim assist

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.449 
also mentioned tweaking the aim assist
on<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.489> consoles<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.900> xbox<00:02:34.350> 360<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.160> ps3
