00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
interlock it's a I personally think it's

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.610 
interlock it's a I personally think it's
quite<00:00:49.850> cool<00:00:50.180> how<00:00:50.450> the<00:00:50.510> whole<00:00:50.690> wing<00:00:50.960> design<00:00:51.320> was

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
quite cool how the whole wing design was

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.710 
quite cool how the whole wing design was
and<00:00:51.980> then<00:00:52.190> I<00:00:52.250> also<00:00:52.400> let<00:00:52.730> the<00:00:52.880> whole<00:00:53.060> open<00:00:53.570> up

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
and then I also let the whole open up

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.340 
and then I also let the whole open up
therefore<00:00:54.670> that's<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:55.820> actual<00:00:56.120> dye<00:00:56.480> that<00:00:56.870> he

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
therefore that's the actual dye that he

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.780 
therefore that's the actual dye that he
kind<00:00:57.680> of<00:00:57.770> throws<00:00:58.100> it's<00:00:58.400> kind<00:00:58.580> of<00:00:58.610> like<00:00:58.730> a

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
manual throw he's not actually really a

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.250 
manual throw he's not actually really a
dice<00:01:01.190> though<00:01:01.520> it's<00:01:01.940> like<00:01:02.210> he<00:01:02.540> opens<00:01:02.870> up<00:01:03.020> and

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.960 
of pops open like this and as you can
see<00:01:41.900> you<00:01:42.470> can<00:01:42.830> barely<00:01:43.010> see<00:01:43.310> his<00:01:43.400> face<00:01:43.640> when<00:01:43.909> he

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
see you can barely see his face when he

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.789 
see you can barely see his face when he
sideways<00:01:44.360> like<00:01:44.540> this<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:45.409> you'll<00:01:45.530> see<00:01:45.560> the

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
sideways like this and you'll see the

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.530 
sideways like this and you'll see the
dye<00:01:46.010> it's<00:01:46.310> not<00:01:46.549> really<00:01:46.909> gonna<00:01:47.060> like

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
dye it's not really gonna like

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.590 
dye it's not really gonna like
technically<00:01:48.440> it<00:01:48.590> can<00:01:48.860> fall<00:01:49.190> out<00:01:49.220> I<00:01:49.490> think<00:01:49.670> but

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
technically it can fall out I think but

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.270 
technically it can fall out I think but
it<00:01:50.750> doesn't<00:01:51.020> really<00:01:51.170> fall<00:01:51.380> out<00:01:51.620> when<00:01:51.920> it's

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
it doesn't really fall out when it's

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.270 
it doesn't really fall out when it's
just<00:01:52.610> open<00:01:53.030> like<00:01:53.060> this<00:01:53.530> on<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.650> inside<00:01:54.770> the

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
just open like this on the inside the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.800 
just open like this on the inside the
manual<00:01:55.460> parts<00:01:55.880> of<00:01:56.000> these<00:01:56.090> there's<00:01:56.510> two<00:01:56.690> little

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
manual parts of these there's two little

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.570 
manual parts of these there's two little
claw<00:01:57.110> things<00:01:57.470> which<00:01:57.770> kind<00:01:58.159> of<00:01:58.250> just<00:01:58.400> move

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
claw things which kind of just move

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.060 
claw things which kind of just move

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
freely so you can put them however far

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.730 
freely so you can put them however far
you<00:02:01.100> want<00:02:01.250> I<00:02:01.640> guess<00:02:01.850> not<00:02:02.510> really<00:02:02.540> a<00:02:02.869> huge<00:02:03.200> deal

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
position but if he does you're supposed

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.620 
position but if he does you're supposed
to<00:02:46.310> flip<00:02:46.490> these<00:02:46.610> horns<00:02:47.000> forward<00:02:47.420> like<00:02:47.600> that

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
to flip these horns forward like that

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.890 
to flip these horns forward like that
and<00:02:48.580> that's<00:02:49.580> one<00:02:49.970> of<00:02:50.000> that's<00:02:50.270> pretty<00:02:50.570> much<00:02:50.690> the

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
and that's one of that's pretty much the
