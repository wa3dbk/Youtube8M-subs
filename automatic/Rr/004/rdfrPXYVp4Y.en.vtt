the<00:01:01.449> the<00:01:01.780> skytrax<00:01:02.469> is<00:01:02.799> a<00:01:02.829> passive<00:01:03.579> GPS

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
the the skytrax is a passive GPS

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.840 
the the skytrax is a passive GPS
tracking<00:01:04.989> system<00:01:05.199> that<00:01:06.070> can<00:01:06.430> easily<00:01:06.610> be

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
tracking system that can easily be

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.760 
tracking system that can easily be
mounted<00:01:07.330> on<00:01:07.450> a<00:01:07.479> car<00:01:07.780> and<00:01:07.990> what<00:01:08.110> this<00:01:08.229> does<00:01:08.290> is

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
mounted on a car and what this does is

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.480 
mounted on a car and what this does is
receives<00:01:09.509> the<00:01:10.560> GPS<00:01:11.560> signals<00:01:12.009> from<00:01:12.159> satellites

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
receives the GPS signals from satellites

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.910 
receives the GPS signals from satellites
so<00:01:13.210> it<00:01:13.360> records<00:01:13.869> the<00:01:13.960> location<00:01:14.590> of<00:01:14.710> this

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
so it records the location of this

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.029 
so it records the location of this
device<00:01:15.280> at<00:01:15.520> all<00:01:15.640> times<00:01:16.170> once<00:01:17.170> I<00:01:17.469> have<00:01:17.770> all<00:01:17.799> of

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039 
device at all times once I have all of

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.330 
device at all times once I have all of
the<00:01:18.250> data<00:01:18.490> I<00:01:18.850> pull<00:01:19.630> this<00:01:19.780> off<00:01:20.020> and<00:01:20.740> now<00:01:20.979> i<00:01:21.009> plug

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
the data I pull this off and now i plug

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.459 
the data I pull this off and now i plug
it<00:01:21.490> into<00:01:21.609> any<00:01:21.850> USB<00:01:23.490> port<00:01:24.490> on<00:01:24.670> my<00:01:24.820> computer

is<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:55.310> really<00:02:55.640> neat<00:02:55.820> camera<00:02:56.239> because<00:02:56.420> it's<00:02:56.600> a

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
is a really neat camera because it's a

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.720 
is a really neat camera because it's a
two-way<00:02:57.050> system<00:02:57.560> it's<00:02:57.739> two-way<00:02:58.070> video<00:02:58.370> and

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
two-way system it's two-way video and

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.300 
two-way system it's two-way video and
two-way<00:02:59.060> audio<00:02:59.269> so<00:02:59.720> it's<00:02:59.870> more<00:03:00.050> of<00:03:00.230> a<00:03:00.380> webcam

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
two-way audio so it's more of a webcam

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.250 
two-way audio so it's more of a webcam
as<00:03:01.519> opposed<00:03:01.850> to<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.060> surveillance<00:03:02.600> camera<00:03:02.690> but

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
as opposed to a surveillance camera but

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.960 
as opposed to a surveillance camera but
the<00:03:03.650> practical<00:03:03.830> application<00:03:04.190> for<00:03:04.880> this

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
the practical application for this

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.670 
the practical application for this
particular<00:03:05.150> camera<00:03:05.750> is<00:03:08.200> kids<00:03:09.200> that<00:03:09.440> want<00:03:09.590> to

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
the ability to store a lot more so

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.500 
the ability to store a lot more so
instead<00:03:39.980> of<00:03:40.130> just<00:03:40.310> eight<00:03:40.549> hours<00:03:40.579> of<00:03:40.910> recording

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510
