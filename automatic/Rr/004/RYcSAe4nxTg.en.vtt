00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.419
 hi everyone guys are dance games 94 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.279
 and welcome this less video today is 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:21.340
 back here on the out rose network later 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.829
 so long since I did video and I am 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.500
 returned to bring you a tombstone gameplay 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:29.259
 raider and I'm here to tell you about a 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.699
 very much subject we say current 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.439
 in the gaming world 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.860
 but before talking about the topic 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.960
 I wanted to make a premise I was 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.120
 let's say away from the auto smet work e 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.210
 from my channel because I basically have 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.100
 done an upgrade of my pc and i did it 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.199
 because my old video card is me 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.719
 was leaving and I replaced it with 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:54.219
 one we say is more powerful I took a 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:57.879
 amd hd 64 50 from 2 gigabytes of memory 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:00.070
 dedicated and I bought it from amazon.it e 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.410
 I paid 30 euros with the expenses of 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.940
 shipping a great price for one 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.820
 video card for 30 euros 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.740
 honestly it's a big and video card 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.100
 because in the end objectively with 30 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.170
 euro what do you buy let's say i do 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.569
 now it is almost time to hold up 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.250
 in fact all the games are as you can 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:20.740
 see from the gameplay I'm playing tomb 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.190
 raider without even the slightest lag 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.830
 in fact I play it full screen with 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:30.429
 medium and low graphic settings 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.440
 it turns around 35 40 fps but if it doesn't record 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:35.110
 regimes can reach up to 60fps 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.840
 so for me that I was used to 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.770
 let's say an integrated video card of the 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.360
 intel 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.489
 let's say you have this too 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.050
 supporting this game for me is already a 

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:46.090
 big step forward 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.440
 I know it's not my gaming PC 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.479
 however I will put you all 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.280
 description features though 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.050
 let's say that for me I was used to 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.209
 precisely to the intel video card 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.429
 that we say stops me a lot my 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:58.869
 computer because if you don't take the 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.500
 video card I had before was also 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.869
 a discrete pc and now with the new card 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.090
 video for me allows me to play at 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.030
 very very recent games like note 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.550
 tomb raider odette space 3 then batman 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.560
 arkham city is just fine for me here 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.870
 however made this small premise 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.790
 oh my little not so much this must be done 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.000
 premise I wanted to talk to you about the 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.040
 mode e 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.200
 player and single players 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.230
 last of the last videogames here 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.030
 as I believe everyone knows and in 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.430
 last years the multiplayer mode 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.840
 is taking off let's say 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.480
 windward compared to the mode 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.010
 single player in fact almost all 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.410
 games that have come out over the ages 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.570
 last 23 years have almost all the 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.450
 single player mode and many 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.340
 sorry players in fact is becoming 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.190
 a real fashion in fact 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.720
 last the latest games are coming out 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.160
 90 percent proof to normal 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.650
 multiplayer 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.890
 we say that this thing in itself does not 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.780
 the mode is bad indeed 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.900
 multiplayer increases the longevity of 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.840
 but a title up to here is fine with me though 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.550
 honestly it's not good for me maybe 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.030
 ruin a game such as dead 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.920
 space 3 which is not too bad as a game 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.200
 but surely for me at least they are 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.840
 a big fan of the saga is not 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.120
 certainly at the levels of the first of the 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.730
 first chapter because it should be dead space 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.459
 3 state was born as a horror game but to the 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.709
 end we know that the last the space is more 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.040
 what else is an action game here 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.150
 horror however, very little later 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.450
 also introduced the mode 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.519
 multiplayer in the second chapter that 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.480
 more than anything else it was a co op 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:45.110
 in my opinion, however, finds the choice of 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.480
 put a multiplayer mode in 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.910
 a game that was born as an individual 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.400
 player in my opinion is a great bullshit 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.890
 because it doesn't suit me that maybe 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.380
 ruin the story of a video game that 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.959
 was born as a great title as dead 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.640
 space 3 was never dead space to know 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.739
 It was a great game he has 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.090
 revolutionized the video game world 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.430
 horror 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.400
 the third chapter a beautiful game but 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.570
 certainly not excellent and in my opinion 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.459
 this flaw was that i 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.799
 developers have worked more on 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:19.160
 multiplayer coin than single one 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.989
 in fact, if in my opinion they were avoided 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.520
 make it multiplayer mode e 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.220
 they worked a little more on that 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.260
 single really came out great 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.900
 masterpiece as was indeed the 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.680
 first chapter another game that 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.139
 he was introduced to die 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.060
 many players and was born as a single is 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.490
 state tomb raider tomb raider than that 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.259
 that you are seeing now in the gameplay 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.080
 let's say that as soon as it was 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:44.880
 announced I had seen a little what the was like 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.680
 gameplay as I was from the graphics 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.590
 really speechless 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.590
 in fact gameplay also reminds a little 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.960
 uncharted a great exclusive ps3 e 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.460
 even the old and tomb raiders so yes 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.940
 they herald as great great 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:02.580
 masterpiece in fact m is a great game 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.080
 tom rider pro according to me insert a 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.460
 single player mode in a game 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.289
 such 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.490
 let's say it doesn't make any sense at least 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.919
 for me 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.199
 however this is basically mine 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.880
 in fact I do not agree that 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.039
 maybe put it in the mode 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.650
 multiplayer in a born singh game 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.449
 how single to say rip 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.550
 a few more hours in the second campaign 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:25.020
 I don't like it is an account at the end 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.849
 put a multiplayer mode in 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.380
 a call of duty and battlefield that to 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:29.880
 end is who buys cod 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.039
 I buy it for the multiplayer mode 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.990
 or for the zombie mode 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:36.060
 surely there are few who 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.250
 buy cod to play the single 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.620
 player and not playing with the multi 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.169
 here's why guys this was the 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.330
 allocate my opinion and do me 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:48.240
 know how you think by comment 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.039
 and through I like it through visual I in 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.870
 this finished video however I will make others 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.729
 video on the bus and no boyfriend 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.020
 absolute from the gamers and to the next 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.020
 nice video guys
