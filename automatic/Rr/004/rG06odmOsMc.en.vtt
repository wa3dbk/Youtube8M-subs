00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.810
 alte recognized that jorge recognized 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:12.220
 sorry he is very sorry he has 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.650
 dreams 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.350
 according 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.820
 and nothing else to try to understand which 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.820
 was the act committed 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.330
 one 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.460
 and although all the details by 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.800
 legal issues 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.290
 and it is not that it was tomÃ¡s de mattos 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.610
 in her she questions the press that was without 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.610
 study what the nickname is 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:55.030
 I do not have because he witnessed that 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.890
 way to try to find out why 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.610
 when we are 26 years old without any complaint 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:06.070
 of the players from the prologue 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.070
 because it is very clear to me 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:15.950
 certificate of notice but before the lord 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.729
 blacksmith ricardo la volpe recognized a 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.729
 misconduct 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.900
 he said the opposite I for the 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.450
 late 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.580
 but we have not going to say publicly 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.940
 It will affect me 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.710
 and try to have some facts but 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.310
 finally then 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.750
 the envelope of ice 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.480
 did not receive 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.170
 point 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.170
 you are right 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.490
 and that 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:55.190
 the person that meant they left 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.190
 team things 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.560
 although he did not explain why I do not explain it 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.560
 yesterday 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.670
 good but then he took it for granted 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.929
 that recognizing a behavior 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.540
 inappropriate before the blacksmith envelope that is 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.239
 directive in the chivas there were the 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.550
 things and nothing happened and then 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.470
 you make the decision not only of 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.930
 separate it from the position but from the 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.230
 public the case 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.120
 good and Jorge and we know that this 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.920
 question will have to be done locksmith but 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.219
 good is part of the organization that you 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.950
 you lead, I guess this will declare it 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:38.739
 before the public prosecutor must see 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.079
 because he was talking yesterday too 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.329
 ricardo antonio volpe that he did not have 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:46.090
 contract that signed some papers that did not 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.670
 I knew that there is no settlement like 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.620
 It was one month and a half month ago 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.510
 you hired or hired ricardo 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.189
 the volpe its labor situation 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.189
 contractual Jorge in euros 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.680
 like a certain attentive 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.200
 efe we are interested time 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.659
 you can not observe the work of 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.750
 protection have been registered the 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:13.380
 operation in your hands and that is to be 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.590
 perfectly legal established 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.790
 reproduction of 62 years and with which 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:24.400
 we were good I thought 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:29.579
 that is the audience to sound then 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.579
 Of course it is something that is embodied 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.900
 maybe the children do not have 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.570
 the first tips that 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:45.210
 the time in his technical trade well 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:48.930
 I have four witnesses the means 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.910
 where the Lord says to me any 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.590
 pay the salary and give a prize for being 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.590
 champion because we love chivas 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:03.340
 at the end of accounts and the settlement 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.580
 also as befits the elements 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:11.829
 of the operation was carried out the signed 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:14.890
 the signed settlement and of course 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:17.799
 needed a clear settlement that 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:22.090
 when he signed it yesterday on Tuesday already in a 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.979
 Tuesday and 135 in total the value is the 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.139
 volpe signed the settlement and obviously 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.030
 you have you have the food 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.120
 and when signing the settlement I suppose that 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.880
 they made the bank transfer in 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.889
 weight all my contacts corresponded is 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.600
 to say they already paid the settlement not only 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.729
 he signed it but he is paid by the doctors 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.820
 totally everything all liquidated everything 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.190
 that corresponded 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.870
 all contracts made in the 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:50.020
 contract he signed the settlement 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:53.220
 that as an agreement in recognized and I 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.449
 he asked if he was not guilty 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.129
 a reason because it is firm 5 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.979
 who has risen from the table has 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:02.059
 said I do not sign anything we do not have 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:05.870
 they show the british shown 

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:07.940
 think that you are giving correct 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.760
 the institution that we were happy what 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.130
 we have private document 23 have and if 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:17.060
 would like to be able to exhibit it in the 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:20.620
 moment they want good and also not 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.620
 we only see if they did not pay 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:32.980
 the contract was settled we can know 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:32.980
 the amounts jorge only an approximate 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:42.260
 leaving handling of productions that 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.570
 comply with all the requirements of law 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.270
 is to find you while you can be shy 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.330
 but we can write and that 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:55.659
 it shows that he is lying 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:58.810
 just like then listening to you for 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:06:01.060
 second consecutive morning 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.980
 but we have to say that it is the ricardo 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.680
 volpe together with his lawyer lied 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.540
 rudely and in the afternoon totally and 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.210
 we have the clear surprise that 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:13.010
 they have that there is not a complaint 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.260
 here we have the prosecutor's newsletter 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.790
 of the state of Jalisco where it says 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.680
 who received a criminal complaint of 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.390
 find the volpe the complaint was 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.250
 presented the night of April 30 in 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:25.070
 the facilities of the agency x 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:29.050
 etcetera etcetera is a communication 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.050
 officer of the single attorney general's office 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.740
 but that this religion 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.740
 has a criminal and does not report 

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:42.720
 Y 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:44.759
 and I think then if there was a 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.160
 recognition of ricardo volpe de 

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:52.130
 inappropriate behavior in general or 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:55.130
 acknowledged harassment sexual annoyance 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.130
 happy 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:00.510
 so the towel what is 

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:02.400
 they presented a half-naked towel what 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:06.290
 what 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.290
 Well thanks again Jorge
