they're little dolls and there's
actually<00:00:50.280> no<00:00:50.370> cupcake<00:00:50.789> which<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.390> mean<00:00:51.660> it

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
actually no cupcake which I mean it

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.600 
actually no cupcake which I mean it
should<00:00:51.899> be<00:00:51.989> irrelevant<00:00:52.230> because<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:53.160> cake

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
should be irrelevant because just cake

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.189 
should be irrelevant because just cake
but<00:00:53.820> still<00:00:54.059> apparently<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.719> means<00:00:54.809> lots<00:00:55.079> of

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
but still apparently it means lots of

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.500 
but still apparently it means lots of
people<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.590> there's<00:00:55.829> no<00:00:56.010> cupcake<00:00:56.550> that's<00:00:57.300> from

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
people so there's no cupcake that's from

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.279 
people so there's no cupcake that's from
what<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.690> can<00:00:57.840> see<00:00:59.449> when<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.539> gonna<00:01:00.660> see<00:01:00.870> Bonnie

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
sitting there on the desk there's a

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.820 
sitting there on the desk there's a
little<00:01:06.090> bit<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.330> glass<00:01:06.600> wall<00:01:07.140> kind<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.619> thing

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
little bit of a glass wall kind of thing

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.560 
little bit of a glass wall kind of thing
yeah<00:01:08.070> it's<00:01:08.520> actually<00:01:08.760> really<00:01:08.970> cool<00:01:09.330> cuz<00:01:09.540> I

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
yeah it's actually really cool cuz I

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.240 
yeah it's actually really cool cuz I
think<00:01:09.680> maybe<00:01:10.680> there's<00:01:10.920> something<00:01:11.070> like<00:01:11.189> a

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
think maybe there's something like a

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.219 
think maybe there's something like a
flashlight<00:01:11.610> kind<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.210> thing<00:01:12.390> possibly<00:01:13.080> or

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
flashlight kind of thing possibly or

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.469 
flashlight kind of thing possibly or
that<00:01:13.680> light<00:01:13.890> might<00:01:14.100> be<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.369> at<00:01:14.520> all<00:01:14.670> time<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.240> if

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
that light might be on at all time so if

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.270 
that light might be on at all time so if
that's<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.930> case<00:01:16.110> then<00:01:16.320> that's<00:01:16.470> cool<00:01:16.710> too<00:01:16.920> but

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
that's the case then that's cool too but

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.609 
that's the case then that's cool too but
what<00:01:18.000> if<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.869> your<00:01:18.990> camera<00:01:19.229> up<00:01:19.439> or

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
too and if that could happen we've had

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.010 
too and if that could happen we've had
other<00:01:41.430> than<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.700> oh<00:01:44.329> yeah<00:01:45.329> we<00:01:45.570> thought<00:01:45.780> as

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
other than that oh yeah we thought as

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.230 
other than that oh yeah we thought as
well<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.649> about<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.220> window<00:01:47.579> bit<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.000> and

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
well and about the window bit that and

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.149 
well and about the window bit that and
me<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.780> shadow<00:01:48.930> for<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.560> what<00:01:49.740> if<00:01:49.860> Scott

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
me and shadow for that what if Scott

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.069 
me and shadow for that what if Scott
actually<00:01:50.310> puts<00:01:50.700> more<00:01:51.030> animation<00:01:51.750> into<00:01:51.990> this

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
actually puts more animation into this

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.380 
actually puts more animation into this
game<00:01:52.380> where<00:01:53.009> we<00:01:53.130> actually<00:01:53.250> see<00:01:53.670> something<00:01:54.000> run

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
game where we actually see something run

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.690 
game where we actually see something run
across<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.140> window<00:01:55.560> or<00:01:55.860> something<00:01:56.070> like<00:01:56.490> that

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
across the window or something like that

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.109 
across the window or something like that
instead<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.119> just<00:01:57.180> being<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.659> still<00:01:57.990> image<00:01:59.119> yeah

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
instead of just being a still image yeah

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.850 
instead of just being a still image yeah
and<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.930> think<00:02:00.990> that's<00:02:01.290> like<00:02:01.380> one<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.710> main

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
and I think that's like one of the main

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.170 
and I think that's like one of the main
things<00:02:02.130> about<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.549> though<00:02:02.640> like<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.820> can't

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
things about it though like you can't

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.670 
things about it though like you can't
actually<00:02:03.329> see<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.689> animatronics<00:02:04.229> move<00:02:04.439> but

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
actually see the animatronics move but

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.740 
actually see the animatronics move but
then<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:05.280> know<00:02:05.369> there<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.640> foxy<00:02:06.210> when<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.450> need

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
then you know there is foxy when I need

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.949 
then you know there is foxy when I need
you<00:02:06.899> yeah<00:02:07.110> still<00:02:07.829> so

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:14.699 
image from the camera and this time is

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:16.490

actually<00:03:14.849> played<00:03:15.419> it<00:03:15.599> differently<00:03:16.139> I've

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
actually played it differently I've

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.849 
actually played it differently I've
think<00:03:17.190> where<00:03:18.030> you<00:03:18.239> can<00:03:18.449> actually<00:03:18.629> see<00:03:19.230> the

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
think where you can actually see the

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.030 
think where you can actually see the
office<00:03:20.690> behind<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:21.959> while<00:03:22.560> you're<00:03:22.769> looking

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.619 
office behind you while you're looking
at<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.280> cameras<00:03:23.760> if<00:03:23.910> you<00:03:24.030> can<00:03:24.209> see<00:03:24.419> closely

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
at the cameras if you can see closely

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:26.390 
at the cameras if you can see closely
you<00:03:25.139> can<00:03:25.260> actually<00:03:25.349> see<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.859> window<00:03:26.220> on<00:03:26.370> the

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
you can actually see the window on the

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.339 
you can actually see the window on the
Left<00:03:26.730> what<00:03:27.329> you're<00:03:27.449> looking<00:03:27.690> at<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.900> camera

camera you just see randomly then and
I'm<00:03:49.109> trying<00:03:49.349> to<00:03:49.409> quickly<00:03:49.650> run<00:03:49.829> by<00:03:50.010> in<00:03:50.129> the<00:03:50.220> dark

I'm trying to quickly run by in the dark
and<00:03:50.669> I<00:03:50.729> thought<00:03:51.720> that'd<00:03:52.049> be<00:03:52.169> really<00:03:52.319> creepy<00:03:52.590> so

and I thought that'd be really creepy so

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:53.780 
and I thought that'd be really creepy so
you<00:03:52.829> gotta<00:03:52.979> quickly<00:03:53.099> turn<00:03:53.340> your<00:03:53.459> camera<00:03:53.579> off

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
you gotta quickly turn your camera off

you gotta quickly turn your camera off
and<00:03:53.849> one<00:03:54.060> on<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:54.599> I<00:03:54.989> think<00:03:55.079> that'd<00:03:55.290> be<00:03:55.319> really

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
and one on and I think that'd be really

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.800 
and one on and I think that'd be really
creepy<00:03:55.859> and<00:03:56.099> it<00:03:56.430> would<00:03:56.549> make<00:03:57.030> for<00:03:57.239> a<00:03:57.269> very<00:03:57.540> very

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810
