 hello how to become a diver 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.570
 of course it's not about using these 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.330
 equipments that are rather worthy of my 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.950
 great grandfathers but still and 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.839
 he how to become 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.850
 diver if you are completely 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.279
 beginners and there know that it takes 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.100
 first start by becoming a diver 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.189
 you're going to have to go through 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.830
 3 or better the first four levels 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.390
 of diving right away the question that 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.710
 you usually arises is how many 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.840
 time so it takes to spend the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.390
 three levels one must be able to succeed 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.129
 their after that depends on the people 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.469
 close in four to five weeks 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.410
 it must be possible to pass the 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.719
 third level to pass level 4 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.579
 side a lot more time one the most 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.039
 short as I've seen it's pretty much 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.210
 ten weeks to succeed in getting the 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.610
