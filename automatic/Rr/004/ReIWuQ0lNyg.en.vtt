00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 was world or Jurassic world the fourth 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.910
 delivery in the series of 'jurassic park' 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.429
 will be released in the summer and personally 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.080
 I could not be more excited park 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.030
 Jurassic is my favorite movie of 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.610
 all times and I'm very happy that 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.139
 finally get another sequel that's why 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.279
 that today we will talk about the seven things 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.289
 what we would like to see in the movie 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.029
 yeray secure 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.740
 we started with something very personal and 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.510
 favorite dinosaur is the tyrannosaur and 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.920
 It caused me great sadness when I saw it 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.560
 lose against him spinoza opened a 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.580
 Jurassic park 3 in 2001 many years 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.949
 later when I was in college 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.690
 in 2009 a whole class about steven 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.210
 spielberg the director of Jurassic Park 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.090
 and the executive producer of the series and 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.950
 at the end of the semester the same pine for 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.629
 answer our questions and I was one 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.160
 of the lucky ones to be selected 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.629
 to ask him something I told him 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.520
 I have always admired him and that he 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.289
 inspired me to dedicate myself to the 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.329
 entertainment after a small 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.820
 exchange I asked him what both 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.090
 I wanted to know are about to listen 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.240
 the original audio of the question 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.240
 is 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.479
 soini 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.670
 in general 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.530
 Enough 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.170
 Y 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.769
 and there you have it from steven spielberg if 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.450
 by chance you see this please remember 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.430
 of what you said and let the ibex 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.799
 returns to be the star that deserves to be 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.750
 well, I recently checked the site 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.090
 Jurassic park and we can see that the rex 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.459
 of the grass world is the same rex of the 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.290
 first movie the one that saved the 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.819
 protagonists of the rapers so is that 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.860
 hopefully and save it again from the dinosaur 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.970
 hybrid which brings us to the next 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.700
 point 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.530
 - completely new scenes with the 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.180
 hybrid dinosaur obvious that love to do 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.560
 new scenes but I'm talking about 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.329
 new in the sense that we're 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.010
 talking about a dinosaur with the 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.870
 characteristics of the tyrannosaur that has 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.269
 been genetically combined with and this 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.489
 is my hypothesis velociraptors is a 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.840
 dinosaur from 40 feet to height that is 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.310
 able to scale walls 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.989
 we want to see sequences that have been 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.030
 impossible to carry out with other 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.799
 dinosaurs we essentially have a 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.200
 gigantic monster with an activity 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.629
 surprising a normal intelligence and 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.190
 quite violent aside says leave 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.690
 continue with the hybrid dinosaur and do not 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.879
 saves nothing and talking about the 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.609
 dinosaurs continue with the interpretation 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.930
 artistic of dinosaurs there are some 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.519
 critics of the movies they want 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.900
 see more realistic dinosaurs with 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.610
 other words 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.200
 they tried to do this in park 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.209
 Jurassic 3 with combo type feathers 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.459
 jack of the routers but just do not 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.900
 they look so aesthetically intimidating 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.579
 like the original rappers of the 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.860
 first movie we would have had 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:28.769
 so many fears and alexia tim lurked 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.930
 two giant turkeys not towards the director 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.420
 it started weird I think that the pens do not 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.769
 intimidated and applauded his decision if the 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.689
 dinosaurs out more realistic and ccoo 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.700
 celtics could see perfectly well if 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:40.560
 you moved or not the velociraptor would be the 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.239
 size of a hen and the dinosaur does not 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.250
 would have the ability to spit poison and 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.109
 have a flyer like the movie we're going 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.220
 to the cinema to escape from reality and 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.930
 I think they should include the 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.569
 dinosaurs in this 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.069
 for love of dinosaurs do not use 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.250
 the hated but often 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.109
 employee without kike now this is not something 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.790
 that necessarily plagued any of 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.109
 the films of the trilogy as much as 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.180
 something that has plagued all 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:05.280
 modern action movies the geicam 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.750
 completely ruined the movies of 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.670
 action and any sense of 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.709
 audience to be able to stay at 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.569
 day with what the public is going through 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.430
 prefers to see and appreciate a scene from 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.289
 choreographed action and acrobatics that 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.810
 feel as if they were on the scene 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.620
 plastic park 3 did not have psychically 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.090
 yes but I know how to do 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.860
 in some sequences but not what 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.419
 enough to make us sick but it was enough 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.580
 to mention it here so is that 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.160
 sinister favor of the Jurassic world les 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.810
 we implore do not use this style for 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.360
 the good of the public and the integrity of 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.650
 his name in the action genre and how 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.150
 another great action movie like 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.310
 that we suggest in seven things that 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.110
 we want to see star wars 7 keep a 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.210
 balance of practical effects with 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.100
 visual effects the scenes that all 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.630
 we remember with so much love of the first 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.040
 movie like when the exact time 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.600
 with humans for the first time 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.639
 they were made by combining the two 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.620
 techniques never abusing either one or 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.120
 the other unfortunately with each other 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.979
 they came to use the prickly plane 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.539
 little more than necessary with the hawthorn 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.280
 wise attacked seemed more than anything a 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.110
 gigantic robot sinking in a 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.180
 pool would have been better he follows 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.710
 there but so that the basic not everything is 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.570
 deals with the visual effects or the 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.639
 dinosaurs another component very 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.370
 important of the series is the suspense and 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.020
 I hope that this continues assured jesus 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.880
 he thought that spielberg created when they were 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.710
 operating the ibex baby with his parents 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.300
 truck door a little later with it 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.400
 He was turning the glass and he was 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.229
 point of falling the suspense of feeling 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.990
 that at any moment the rappers 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:26.490
 lex could find the kitchen this 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.050
 is what involves us in the movie 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.849
 and it makes us go through the 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.919
 same emotions are going through 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:33.960
 protagonists of movies of this type 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.180
 we all love a good scene of 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.800
 action but those scenes are so tense 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.199
 and more quiet those that always tend 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.210
 be so memorable and finally give us a 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.860
 protagonist that is of the same level that 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.750
 the doctor malcolm the doctor crane 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.819
 we are very fortunate that the very same 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.530
 store word also known as chris 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:50.880
 pratt will be our new protagonist in 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.440
 the movie but he can only 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.210
 interpret the character that 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.039
 they wrote and we all hope it's 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.289
 just like digg matiko in its own way 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:00.720
 Of course, the two previous ones say that 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:02.220
 we will have two harder films because 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.169
 if it would be horrible if it ends 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.430
 being an empty character that only serves 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.139
 to take them to the next scene of 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.819
 good action now that you have heard what 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.409
 what we want to see in the Jurassic world is 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:11.940
 time for us to hear from you what 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:13.740
 is what they most want to see in this new 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.150
 delivery of the gm series will be seen below 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.069
 still on the move and grammy twitter 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.449
 stolen and the rex now you know why 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:20.099
 I have that user number 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:21.539
 and of course subscribe zac the mind to see 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:25.849
 videos like the seven best movies 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:25.849
 of comics of 2014 see you next
