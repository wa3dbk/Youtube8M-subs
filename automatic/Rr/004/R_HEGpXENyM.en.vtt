00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.420
 hello and welcome to my 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.220
 video tealight oven in the summer I wanted 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.860
 Show you today as I am here 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.960
 garden me in the teaspoon of made 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.960
 I usually have a heater man in winter 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.060
 or a cold season but now 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.039
 More and more the question came up on whether one 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.500
 not even the tealight open in the garden 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.420
 or use on the terrace 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.689
 or on the balcony and the answer is 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.900
 Yes 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.699
 The tea is open working everywhere 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.279
 without heating pipes and without electricity 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.460
 you can build it anywhere you can 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.180
 use him in messenger or on the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.489
 high seat or anywhere on the terrace 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.620
 in the garden it is important that it is a 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.379
 The balcony is a bit wind-protected 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.550
 is mostly sheltered from the wind but here 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:51.110
 in the garden is a bit today with me 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.850
 Windy that's why I have here provisionally 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.550
 small windscreen built that the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.600
 lights do not go out 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.230
 otherwise works as well as 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.570
 in the winter 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.449
 the pots will warm the heat 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.090
 stored and discharged laterally and 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.400
 so in the evening, for example, in one 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.560
 cool summer night you can on the 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.290
 terrace several should place here 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.220
 looks nice first there you have like so 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.740
 a small torch are small 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.689
 light effect that does not cost much 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.130
 you can enjoy a light and 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.960
 besides , the pots give up here too 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.009
 still heat up I can you too 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.200
 still show that it works 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.900
 still a bit windy at times 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.040
 I have my meter here 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.900
 brought and we can first 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.900
 Watching pots are still hot 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.120
 pleasant 52 degrees 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.800
 and if I leave it on longer 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.610
 they're about halfway here now 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.960
 hour on 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.670
 then they will be a bit too 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.160
 warmer so you see it works 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.680
 even in summer you can here it 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.230
 please and it looks very decorative 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.990
 I also painted some there 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:59.110
 I also made a video 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.180
 otherwise it looks like that here 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.860
 environmentally friendly cheap blaster the 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.180
 are also once again protect a bit 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.870
 again in front of the wind when the 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.040
 burnt down candles and that 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.950
 whole is a great thing and that's why 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.600
 because you show yourself today 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.080
 Have fun with it and have a nice one 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.500
