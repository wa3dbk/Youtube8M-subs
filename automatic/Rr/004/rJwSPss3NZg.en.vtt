your<00:01:16.170> lawn<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.860> need<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.100> prepare<00:01:17.280> an<00:01:17.640> area

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
your lawn you need to prepare an area

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.670

where<00:01:18.180> there's<00:01:18.360> soil<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.110> then<00:01:19.560> you're

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
where there's soil and then you're

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.560 
where there's soil and then you're
supposed<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.159> break<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.580> up<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
supposed to break it up so that the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.060 
supposed to break it up so that the
roots<00:01:21.900> will<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.200> an<00:01:22.320> easier<00:01:22.409> time<00:01:22.619> growing

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
roots will have an easier time growing

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.490 
roots will have an easier time growing
in<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.430> well<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:24.210> takes<00:01:24.689> as<00:01:24.930> long<00:01:25.049> as<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.350> takes

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
in it well it takes as long as it takes

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.249 
in it well it takes as long as it takes
these<00:01:25.710> vegetables<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.670> come<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.540> maturation

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
these vegetables to come to maturation

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.710 
these vegetables to come to maturation
so<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.590> guess<00:01:28.920> well<00:01:29.340> no<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:29.880> harvest<00:01:30.299> time<00:01:30.509> I'll

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
so I guess well no in harvest time I'll

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
you know do another video and follow up

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.910 
you know do another video and follow up
and<00:01:32.549> let<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.820> know<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.840> couple<00:01:34.259> months<00:01:34.560> and

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
see if we're actually getting something

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.060 
see if we're actually getting something
from<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.600> well<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.049> might<00:01:37.409> do<00:01:37.560> one<00:01:37.680> sooner

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
from this well I might do one sooner

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.560 
from this well I might do one sooner
we'll<00:01:38.220> see<00:01:38.340> you've<00:01:38.430> actually<00:01:38.610> getting<00:01:38.880> plants

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
we'll see you've actually getting plants

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.230 
we'll see you've actually getting plants
first<00:01:39.930> let<00:01:40.829> alone<00:01:41.040> after<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.790> then<00:01:42.090> we'll

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
first let alone after that then we'll

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.240 
first let alone after that then we'll
see<00:01:42.390> if<00:01:42.420> they<00:01:42.600> actually<00:01:42.630> produce<00:01:43.259> something

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
see if they actually produce something

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.679 
see if they actually produce something
that<00:01:44.430> we<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:44.670> eat<00:01:44.790> let<00:01:45.210> me<00:01:45.270> show<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.450> what's

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.389 
that we can eat let me show you what's
in<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.869> box<00:01:46.079> there's<00:01:46.799> really<00:01:46.920> not<00:01:47.159> much<00:01:47.340> to

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
in the box there's really not much to

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.639 
in the box there's really not much to
this<00:01:47.670> as<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.420> there's<00:01:48.990> nothing<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.500> box

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
this as in there's nothing in the box

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.580 
this as in there's nothing in the box
but<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.250> rollout<00:01:50.790> pad<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.540> instructions<00:01:52.409> and

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
but the rollout pad the instructions and

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.830 
but the rollout pad the instructions and
everything<00:01:52.649> are<00:01:53.189> on<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.729> box<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.329> it's

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
everything are on the box and it's

everything are on the box and it's
pretty<00:01:54.960> simple<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.470> roll<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.159> out<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.640> put

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
pretty simple you roll it out you put

pretty simple you roll it out you put
the<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:58.049> fibery<00:01:58.530> green<00:01:58.920> side<00:01:59.219> down<00:01:59.520> the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
the the fibery green side down the

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.370 
the the fibery green side down the
fabric<00:02:00.210> side<00:02:00.420> up<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.899> put<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:01.259> the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
fabric side up you put it on the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.020 
fabric side up you put it on the
prepared<00:02:01.740> soil<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.369> water<00:02:02.579> water<00:02:02.880> water

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
prepared soil and you water water water

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.700 
prepared soil and you water water water
and<00:02:03.390> that's<00:02:03.899> what<00:02:04.020> you're<00:02:04.140> supposed<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.530> do

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
now this is lettuce and cucumbers and

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.020 
now this is lettuce and cucumbers and
there<00:02:10.619> are<00:02:10.709> two<00:02:10.860> roles<00:02:11.129> in<00:02:11.580> here

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
there are two roles in here

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.480 
there are two roles in here
and<00:02:12.780> nicely<00:02:13.230> enough<00:02:13.680> they<00:02:13.890> labeled<00:02:14.310> one

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
and nicely enough they labeled one

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.430 
and nicely enough they labeled one
lettuce<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.150> they<00:02:15.240> labeled<00:02:15.870> one<00:02:16.020> cucumber

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
lettuce and they labeled one cucumber

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.559 
lettuce and they labeled one cucumber
let<00:02:17.280> me<00:02:17.370> open<00:02:17.520> it<00:02:17.700> up<00:02:17.819> and<00:02:17.880> take<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.090> peek<00:02:18.330> at

instructions<00:03:17.850> and<00:03:18.120> then<00:03:18.209> I'm<00:03:18.299> going<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.480> do<00:03:18.660> it

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
instructions and then I'm going to do it

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:19.910 
instructions and then I'm going to do it
the<00:03:18.959> way<00:03:19.049> that<00:03:19.079> other<00:03:19.470> people<00:03:19.799> have

it<00:04:22.810> wet<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:23.050> everything<00:04:23.530> will<00:04:23.650> be<00:04:23.740> great<00:04:23.889> but

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
it wet and everything will be great but

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.190

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
to have figured out you actually cover

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.000 
to have figured out you actually cover
up<00:04:28.480> the<00:04:28.690> fabric<00:04:29.110> with<00:04:29.260> just<00:04:29.440> a<00:04:29.500> very<00:04:29.680> thin

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
up the fabric with just a very thin

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.860 
up the fabric with just a very thin
amount<00:04:30.220> of<00:04:30.400> topsoil<00:04:30.820> like<00:04:31.090> a<00:04:31.120> eighth<00:04:31.540> of<00:04:31.780> an

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
amount of topsoil like a eighth of an

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.750 
amount of topsoil like a eighth of an
inch<00:04:31.930> or<00:04:32.110> quarter<00:04:32.440> of<00:04:32.530> an<00:04:32.620> inch<00:04:32.710> and<00:04:33.040> that

inch or quarter of an inch and that

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.920 
inch or quarter of an inch and that
makes<00:04:33.970> all<00:04:34.150> the<00:04:34.300> difference<00:04:34.450> and<00:04:34.660> they're<00:04:34.840> the
