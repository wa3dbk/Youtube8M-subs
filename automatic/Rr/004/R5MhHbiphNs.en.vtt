00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello to you with you and this is a 10 series 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.839
 on industrial craft 2 experiments in 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.550
 which I will tell you about the generator 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.860
 the generator is a special device 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.139
 which generates electricity in 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.630
 this fashion 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.760
 generator can be said in two ways 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.730
 the first way we take the battery 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.820
 three iron plates and an iron stove 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.640
 we get a second way generator 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.640
 we take the battery base case 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.630
 mechanism and oven we also have half an hour 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.640
 generator after we with a brief and 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.309
 install the generator it was from here there is 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.920
 in this way he has 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.450
 its own internal interface to it 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.300
 get to right click 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.030
 click on the generator here we see 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.260
 here is its interface here we have two 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.320
 cell and school 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.730
 This school is an internal reserve. 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.960
 electricity which he can 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.579
 save that is at the moment 0 here 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.710
 here are the items that 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.409
 need to charge i.e. it can 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.930
 be any batteries or 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.909
 electrical device to start 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.740
 producing 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.979
 electricity you need to put any 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.600
 combustible material eg wood block 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.330
 or boards or coal from a single unit 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.770
 wood 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.909
 produced in 750 units 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.990
 electricity also from one unit 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.120
 the boards 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.840
 then the electricity produced by 750 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:44.110
 there is profitable from kraft wood block 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.110
 from it we take for example boards 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:51.650
 block of wood and a workbench from it 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:54.440
 Scratch 4 boards that is with us 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.540
 four times more 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.600
 electricity if we craft 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:05.300
 boards they light up entirely one in the forehead 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:11.450
 wood for example one unit of coal 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:13.340
 gives 4000 electricity you can also 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.360
 use charcoal from it we 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.280
 in the same way we put 4,000 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.300
 electricity 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:26.600
 so this we Powell was not coal other 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:31.160
 tanner coke put and not all 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.630
 right so cause 4125 then rather 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.230
 just had electricity 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.230
 anyway 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.280
 if we put charcoal then by 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.400
 the completion of the process we will also get 4 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.890
 thousands of electricity connect 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.830
 generator is best either using 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.150
 tin insulated wire either to 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.920
 put him close 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.400
 energy keeper or any other 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.550
 the device doesn't matter with which 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.890
 hand you put energy keeper 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.810
 or which side did you pull from 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.540
 wire to the device or the device itself 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.350
 which side to stand on all sides 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.340
 generator 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:15.300
 outgoing therefore you can safely bet with 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.860
 any side if you have installed 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.800
 third-party mod called 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.680
 real craft then he adds coke 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.459
 coal and coke shoe block 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.290
 they can also be used in the generator 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:32.790
 for example from one unit of coking coal 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:36.860
 can get 8000 electricity a of 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.860
 one coke unit for 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.030
 all 7600 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.430
 I am checking you here right now 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.560
 almost already burned out I will tell you for sure 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.090
 how much electricity is produced from 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.090
 one block coking coal 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:03.209
 this will be mine for more than 10 7000 if already 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.209
 almost 600k 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:10.959
 as a servant yes here is coke coal me 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:16.810
 simple almost burned out we see we 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:19.650
 got 8000 electricity a from the unit 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.650
 like an owl of coal 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.530
 somewhere 68 I think thousands 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.530
 electricity 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.470
 maybe a little bit more 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:47.409
 or 70 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:05:00.630
 she let while the generator is also lit 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.630
 later you liked for crafting 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.500
 almost all other all others 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.290
 electricity generators 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.180
 such as a solar panel or 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:14.970
 liquid generator or 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:18.480
 nuclear reactor so that's all burned out 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.570
 we see that is from one coke block 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.540
 coal we get 72 thousand 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:26.450
 electricity but in my opinion everyone 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:31.080
 more profitable to use this board 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:33.420
 pipe tree no problem from sweat blocks 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.680
 the dress of the wood on the grass of the boards is also not 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:38.640
 the problem is enough for you at first 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.190
 electricity generated by the data 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.600
 a generator then it will be better to build either 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.800
 solar panels 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:50.370
 either windmills or water 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:55.440
 mill that is go to generator 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:57.270
 energy better on it all 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.460
 Thank you for your attention put huskies 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.700
 subscribe to my channel and see you soon 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.700
 meeting
