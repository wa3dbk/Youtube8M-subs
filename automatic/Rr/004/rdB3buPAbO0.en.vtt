00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.570
 funk background music the background 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.220
 medley of scorpio verse that comes out at 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.190

 you have good on the platform where 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.000
 we put the games of the terms the 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.670
 dolls that automatically appear 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.229
 on the screen of your console according 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.090
 the good part becomes controllable 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.619
 is that we can collect the figures 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.090
 the bad part is that we can collect 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.710
 the figures therefore we will 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.180
 generate a little bit of addiction 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.680
 get them all and get the 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.320
 base platforms a little bit is going to be 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.030
 entertaining the truth you have to know what 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.860

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.750
