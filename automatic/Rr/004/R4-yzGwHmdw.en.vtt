00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:49.989
 the energy 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.879
 You went running quickly to get the cell phone. 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.460
 to have something electronic in hand 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.500
 for the future when it was small 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.110
 I thought that in 2011 we are in a 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.019
 super future I think the cars in a 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.960
 to fly instead of walking on the street and 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:07.540
 trolley for all places 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.260
 I wonder the mingo to sleep in 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.470
 he sleeping in the tocantins is the 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.730
 champion and sleeping the Tocantins is the thing 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.590
 acrid nÃ© 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.380
 but also good for those who take the 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.620
 dog poop in other people's house 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.210
 the dog is cocoa away and I came to stop at 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.700
 own owner's house 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.240
 finally arrived in 2011 is the same 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.210
 Shit 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.500
 Speaking of this electronic will also 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.730
 The shower in my house burned out the week. 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.190
 but is that it simply stopped 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.110
 not lie down and my 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.250
 boyfriend went to take a shower and a 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:48.070
 wife a bathroom there I heard an explosion 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.050
 a shout the journey gets there commit suicide 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.000
 in the bath it is possible for the person to be 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.260
 both remind us every time someone 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.780
 will commit suicide 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.300
 the person warns before only one to kill me in 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.580
 opel there from up here in eggs give 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.530
 head shot at deep-sea mango with 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.830
 milk powder I will touch the country leave 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.440
 running upstairs ringing the bell and 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.690
 going running 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.490
 I think the person wants to kill himself. 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.220
 I think the person who wants to kill himself 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.130
 If you kill yourself soon, you 're going to be looking at everything. 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.750
 world called the press no police know 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.060
 which is what appeared on tv before 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.390
 die 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.210
 out in the newspaper on the police page when 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.000
 the person who in fact the only person 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.730
 that now if you are not a depressive and 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.200
 that slimy fringe glued to the forehead 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.620
 I think you should kill yourself more 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.390
 fast you do not deserve consideration I 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.740
 I was small I also thought my house 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.870
 it was magic and leave a dirty glass in the room 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.350
 10 thousand later it was clean in the closet 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.240
 leave the practical food on the table and ten 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.390
 minutes later to clean in the closet 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.040
 I woke up late and suddenly there appears 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.020
 ready meal on the stove 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.750
 then I went to live alone was 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:05.670
 try the same magic as the dirty dinnerware 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.590
 after a week I was washing dishes 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.810
 or the dish I was expelled from home 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.420
 I had plenty of crockery in will take 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.830
 all here I throw in the trash with your 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.709
 mother has no desire to take all the 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.660
 crockery in the sink and throw in the trash or other 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.350
 Go get that underwear I 'm going to be yours. 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.269
 father leaves the braking and throwing garbage and 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.730
 women I still want to live in a world 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.620
 and women still want to continue living 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.660
 in the world where I think women 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.660
 do not leave braces in the panties 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.070
 still talking about electronic things 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.900
 I think your parents think the 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.450
 computer is a real devil in the 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.459
 Your life is all computer fault 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.459
 Your brother at school blames the computer 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.690
 You do not eat the computer blame you. 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.549
 do not sleep 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.590
 computer guilt I think in the 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.900
 True, parents are jealous of the computer. 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.519
 They wanted to go out all day and you 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.130
 Do not leave your account at home. 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.780
 if it were the opposite your parents would not 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.299
 get off the computer 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.260
 the world would be different I think instead 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:11.260
 to receive sex facebook spam and already 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:15.519
 has received facebook cookie spam 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.989
 mothers or they do not wake up and there 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.810
 wake up with the electronic that is the 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.970
 viewer will drink coffee and even 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.240
 coffee maker making coffee and 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.940
 then remove dishwashers from 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.820
 Do you turn on the electric cooker? 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.600
 food or use the electric cooker 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.510
 waves 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.160
 Then the crockery came and put the dishes in the 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.230
 dishwasher 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.240
 There you get a laundry washed in the machine. 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.330
 washing machine with electric iron 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.210
 then washed in the same machine that washed the 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.080
 band your life around beer machines 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.220
 matrix 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.600
 We live in the teaching of the movie. 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.910
 wondering what was the best electronic 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.250
 who invented find a conclusion that 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.710
 electronic is connected to another that 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.560
 an electronic in your life to do 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.210
 a difference in women the best of 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.230
 that they invented was the vibrator 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:10.740
 and pros guys know the dvd to watch 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:12.810
 pornography on the TV or computer 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.870
 Anyway, I think a person like that 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.850
 for a month really 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.740
 I would commit suicide nowadays only 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.040
 The more electronic the person has 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.170
 fat at the time she does two things well 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.390
 doubts doubts doubts to whom I had 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.580
 a great conspiracy of machines that 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:32.040
 who dominate the world and why they 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.710
 interconnect one electronic in the other 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.150
 the coffee maker keeps an eye on me 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.430
 your blender when you go 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:42.150
 night boy door eye on 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.800
 your bilal definitely the world of 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:49.860
 home appliances is the world says 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:52.200
 trust you can even keep trying 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.450
 cut the wrists with electric shot 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.390
 wine that alone can save 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:06:00.720
 time in water bath gel put 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:03.270
 all electronics inside and outside 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.630
 then through there you save 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:10.140
 time and energy, right? 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:13.080
 At least you do not care for me on the street, right? 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:15.360
 I'm talking but the line that counts 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:20.720
 a sex toy 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.720
