00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.510
 5 things that you should not do during 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.510
 a thunderstorm 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.970
 vampirella 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:36.070
 Thunderstorms are phenomena 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.410
 extremely powerful natural 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.990
 can present almost anywhere 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.720
 of the world 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.810
 although many can cause a 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.690
 intense fear and even panic the certain 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.880
 is that we are not few who 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.200
 We usually enjoy the spectacle of 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:57.040
 lightning and thunder that yes always from 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.470
 a safe place 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.350
 whatever the case with which you 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.560
 identify you must avoid for all 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.800
 means do any of these five things 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.810
 if you are witnessing a powerful 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.209
 electric storm 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.209
 [Applause] 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.320
 and wash clothes or shower dishes 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.960
 one of the ways that lightning enters 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.659
 in a structure after hitting it 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.250
 is traveling through the system 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.680
 pipelines 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.020
 clean water pipes and those of 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.420
 wastewater are excellent 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.550
 electrical conductors 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.740
 the latter are usually even 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.140
 loaded with impurities that can help 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.730
 to drive electricity with greater 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.860
 ease 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.380
 if you download lightning and you are using 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.140
 a faucet of water could you 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.090
 electrocute or at least take you 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.430
 dangerous scare 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.770
 therefore take the opportunity 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.460
 as a perfect excuse to avoid 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.880
 do your housework at least 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.120
 temporarily 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.120
 [Applause] 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.050
 talk on a landline 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.980
 probably during a storm 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.870
 electrical is the least appropriate moment 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.360
 to talk on a landline 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.849
 if by chance a lightning bolt fell on the 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.269
 pole that supports the telephone cable in 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:44.000
 the moment you speak this could cause 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.250
 a power surge that will be transmitted 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.400
 through the lines to your 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.020
 earphone from there to your ear and the rest 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.860
 of your body 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.600
 [Applause] 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.460
 because the risk of being 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.730
 electrocuted by a landline 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.860
 comes from the capacity of a beam of 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.470
 travel through the wiring to the air 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.050
 free cell phones and 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.990
 Cordless phones in general are 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.900
 sure to use an exception to this 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:15.350
 would be to use them outdoors or in a 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.270
 car in which case they become a 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.050
 danger just like any other 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.050
 metal object 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.840
 watch television or use devices 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.840
 electric 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.660
 similar to how lightning travels to 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.330
 through telephone wires also 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.230
 travels through electric cables 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.720
 and the plugs 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.810
 It is not only important that you disconnect 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.120
 those electrical appliances to protect you 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.330
 but also to protect their own 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.010
 Short circuit devices due to 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.159
 Tension overloads 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.439
 laptops the tablets and 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:08.599
 the electronic readers are 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:11.510
 Generally safe to use in 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:14.829
 interiors as long as they are not 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.829
 connected to the current 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.100
 but no 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.590
 driving or traveling in a convertible 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.410
 you think you're safe from the rays in 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.480
 any vehicle thanks to its 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.660
 rubber tires 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.670
 Well, it's not like that, it's really the 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.650
 metal structure of the car the one 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.009
 keeps the driver and passengers to 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.650
 except inside 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:50.110
 in case lightning struck the 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.689
 metal structure of the car drive to 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.240
 the electric current through the 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:57.999
 outside towards the earth leaving everyone 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.699
 Soeurs in the case of vehicles 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:03.339
 convertibles the lack of a roof 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:06.430
 metallic could make lightning 

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:08.589
 will hit directly on you and you're welcome 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.189
 would be worth their rubber tires for 

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:11.189
 prevent it 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:27.460
 [Music] 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.790
 touch electrical or metallic objects in 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.449
 the interior of the vehicle 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.430
 [Applause] 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:35.979
 even if you are inside a vehicle 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.569
 covered there is still a small risk 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:41.839
 of being electrocuted 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:43.909
 if lightning strikes your vehicle some 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:45.319
 remnants of electric current can 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:48.559
 influence through their systems 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:50.749
 electrical and metal parts such as 

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:54.229
 radio cell phone charger 

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:57.529
 the usb connectors the gps units 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:06:01.550
 the door handles the pedals 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:04.009
 and even the steering wheel therefore the 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.429
 The best way to keep yourself safe is to 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:09.050
 bringing you to the side of the road 

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:12.800
 turning on the emergency lights and 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:15.680
 turning off the engine then keep your hands 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.889
 in your lap the closed windows and 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:21.139
 wait until the storm has passed 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:22.560
 before continuing your trip or leaving the 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:26.870
 car 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.870
 [Applause] 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.590
 do not 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:33.789
 now
