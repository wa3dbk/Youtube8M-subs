welcome<00:00:00.510> back<00:00:00.659> settling<00:00:01.140> here<00:00:01.410> I<00:00:01.589> was

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
welcome back settling here I was

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.130 
welcome back settling here I was
watching<00:00:02.669> a<00:00:02.730> video<00:00:02.970> by<00:00:03.149> squirt<00:00:03.540> dude<00:00:03.810> about

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
watching a video by squirt dude about

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.860 
watching a video by squirt dude about
how<00:00:04.319> to<00:00:04.380> use<00:00:04.819> fishing<00:00:05.819> rods<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.509> trigger

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
how to use fishing rods to trigger

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.110 
how to use fishing rods to trigger
levers<00:00:07.529> in<00:00:07.830> Minecraft<00:00:08.250> and<00:00:08.700> gave<00:00:08.849> me<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.030> idea

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
levers in Minecraft and gave me the idea

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.240 
levers in Minecraft and gave me the idea
for<00:00:09.750> grappling<00:00:10.320> hooks<00:00:10.500> using<00:00:10.800> fishing<00:00:11.070> rods

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
for grappling hooks using fishing rods

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.749 
for grappling hooks using fishing rods
and<00:00:11.519> so<00:00:12.389> here<00:00:12.630> we've<00:00:12.780> got<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.700> grappling<00:00:14.700> hook

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
and so here we've got the grappling hook

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.460 
and so here we've got the grappling hook
using<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.210> fishing<00:00:15.420> rod<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:15.900> whenever<00:00:16.289> you

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
using the fishing rod and whenever you

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.130 
using the fishing rod and whenever you
see<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:17.300> pressure<00:00:18.300> plate<00:00:18.449> on<00:00:18.630> top<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:18.990> fence

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
see a pressure plate on top of the fence

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.500 
see a pressure plate on top of the fence
like<00:00:19.350> this<00:00:19.380> it's<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.640> post<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.240> can<00:00:21.390> hook

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
like this it's a post that you can hook

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.080 
like this it's a post that you can hook
on<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.900> with<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.590> grappling<00:00:23.189> hook<00:00:23.310> pretty

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
on to with that grappling hook pretty

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.609 
on to with that grappling hook pretty
cool<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.390> works<00:00:24.539> both<00:00:24.750> up<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.140> down<00:00:25.230> although

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
cool it works both up and down although

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.900 
cool it works both up and down although
honestly<00:00:25.830> it's<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.310> little<00:00:26.460> bit<00:00:26.550> easier<00:00:26.880> to

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
honestly it's a little bit easier to

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.019 
honestly it's a little bit easier to
trigger<00:00:27.240> when<00:00:28.109> going<00:00:28.560> upwards<00:00:28.980> but<00:00:29.760> there<00:00:29.939> we

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
trigger when going upwards but there we

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.460 
trigger when going upwards but there we
go<00:00:30.179> got<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.599> requires<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.199> little<00:00:31.289> bit<00:00:31.380> of

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
go got it requires a little bit of

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.990 
go got it requires a little bit of
precise<00:00:31.800> timing<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.550> aim<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:34.820> pretty<00:00:35.820> cool

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
precise timing and aim so pretty cool

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.030 
precise timing and aim so pretty cool
though<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.360> let<00:00:36.989> me<00:00:37.079> hop<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.410> creative<00:00:37.890> mode

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
though I let me hop in a creative mode

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.319 
though I let me hop in a creative mode
and<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.250> can<00:00:38.430> kind<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.850> show<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.090> what's<00:00:39.270> going

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.069 
that's the new command in week 37 it's
basically<00:01:50.579> testing<00:01:51.090> for<00:01:51.360> depressed<00:01:51.750> pressure

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
basically testing for depressed pressure

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.620 
basically testing for depressed pressure
plates<00:01:52.409> here<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.310> when<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.700> press<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.390> pressure

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
plates here so when I press the pressure

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.420 
plates here so when I press the pressure
plate<00:01:54.930> you'll<00:01:55.110> see<00:01:55.350> we<00:01:56.070> get<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.219> little

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
plate you'll see we get a little

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.030 
plate you'll see we get a little
monostable<00:01:56.790> pulse<00:01:57.180> out<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:58.079> one<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.560> and

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
monostable pulse out of that one and and

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.359 
monostable pulse out of that one and and
similarly<00:01:59.700> for<00:02:00.000> these<00:02:00.149> two<00:02:01.100> you<00:02:02.100> see<00:02:02.280> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
similarly for these two you see the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.550 
similarly for these two you see the
piston<00:02:02.640> go<00:02:02.729> up<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.030> there's<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.180> little<00:02:03.360> pulse

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
piston go up and there's a little pulse

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.170 
piston go up and there's a little pulse
so<00:02:04.560> testing<00:02:05.009> for<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.280> pressed<00:02:05.820> pressure

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
so testing for that pressed pressure

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.940 
so testing for that pressed pressure
plate<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:06.659> we<00:02:06.689> can<00:02:06.899> actually<00:02:07.049> sense<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.860> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
plate so we can actually sense that the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.350 
plate so we can actually sense that the
pressure<00:02:08.160> plate<00:02:08.399> has<00:02:08.520> been<00:02:08.550> pressed<00:02:08.910> from<00:02:09.149> far

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
pressure plate has been pressed from far

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.990 
pressure plate has been pressed from far
away<00:02:09.539> which<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:09.899> pretty<00:02:10.020> cool<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:11.000> we're

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
away which is pretty cool and so we're

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.130 
away which is pretty cool and so we're
testing<00:02:12.300> for<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.540> there's<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.780> little<00:02:12.959> pulse

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
testing for that there's a little pulse

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.820 
testing for that there's a little pulse
out<00:02:13.349> here

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
out here

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.350 
out here
now<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.310> goes<00:02:14.460> through<00:02:14.700> this<00:02:14.760> comparator<00:02:15.240> in

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
now it goes through this comparator in

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.000 
now it goes through this comparator in
subtraction<00:02:15.870> mode<00:02:16.080> which<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:16.710> currently

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
subtraction mode which is currently

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.040 
subtraction mode which is currently
being<00:02:17.100> suppressed<00:02:17.580> by<00:02:17.730> these<00:02:18.000> torches<00:02:18.390> it's

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
being suppressed by these torches it's

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.270 
being suppressed by these torches it's
not<00:02:19.170> gonna<00:02:19.290> be<00:02:19.410> able<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.620> output<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.040> pulse

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
not gonna be able to output a pulse

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.000 
not gonna be able to output a pulse
because<00:02:20.760> there's<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.480> there's<00:02:22.260> an<00:02:22.350> input<00:02:22.440> of<00:02:22.680> 15

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
because there's a there's an input of 15

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.360 
because there's a there's an input of 15
on<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.220> side<00:02:24.410> but<00:02:25.410> remember<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:25.890> that

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
on the side but remember that that

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.190 
on the side but remember that that
redstone<00:02:26.700> block<00:02:27.060> that's<00:02:27.390> fun<00:02:27.570> here<00:02:27.960> when<00:02:28.140> you

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
redstone block that's fun here when you

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.520 
redstone block that's fun here when you
use<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.500> fishing<00:02:28.770> rod<00:02:30.050> it'll<00:02:31.050> basically<00:02:31.170> turn

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
use the fishing rod it'll basically turn

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.860 
use the fishing rod it'll basically turn
off<00:02:31.650> these<00:02:31.830> torches<00:02:32.160> so<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:33.030> allows<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.660> pulse

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
off these torches so it allows the pulse

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.980 
off these torches so it allows the pulse
to<00:02:33.990> go<00:02:34.110> through<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.350> comparator<00:02:34.770> and<00:02:35.900> let<00:02:36.900> me

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
to go through the comparator and let me

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.380 
to go through the comparator and let me
again<00:02:37.110> show<00:02:37.320> you<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:37.920> so<00:02:38.790> when<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:38.940> pull<00:02:39.180> that

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
again show you that so when I pull that

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.720 
again show you that so when I pull that
the<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.350> redstone<00:02:40.710> line<00:02:40.860> here<00:02:41.070> turns<00:02:41.280> off<00:02:41.460> the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
the the redstone line here turns off the

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.970 
the the redstone line here turns off the
comparator<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.450> can<00:02:42.600> now<00:02:42.720> pull<00:02:43.260> through<00:02:43.590> if<00:02:43.830> it

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
comparator it can now pull through if it

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.480 
comparator it can now pull through if it
has<00:02:44.100> an<00:02:44.220> input<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:45.560> what<00:02:46.560> what<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.010> end<00:02:47.160> result

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
has an input so what what the end result

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.090 
has an input so what what the end result
is<00:02:47.640> if<00:02:47.940> you<00:02:48.120> have<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:49.170> pressure<00:02:49.620> plate<00:02:49.920> of

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
is if you have the pressure plate of

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.280 
is if you have the pressure plate of
thier<00:02:50.280> getting<00:02:50.580> depressed<00:02:50.970> at<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.660> same<00:02:51.959> time

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
thier getting depressed at the same time

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.699 
thier getting depressed at the same time
as<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:53.310> fishing<00:02:53.670> rod<00:02:53.850> getting<00:02:54.390> used<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:55.530> get

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
as the fishing rod getting used you get

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.230 
as the fishing rod getting used you get
a<00:02:55.740> pulse<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.160> goes<00:02:56.340> all<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.730> way<00:02:56.820> through<00:02:57.120> to

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
a pulse that goes all the way through to

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.490 
a pulse that goes all the way through to
this<00:02:57.330> command<00:02:57.630> block<00:02:57.690> which<00:02:57.959> teleports<00:02:58.230> the

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
this command block which teleports the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.710 
this command block which teleports the
player<00:02:58.680> onto<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.040> platform<00:02:59.520> and<00:02:59.760> it<00:03:00.600> always

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
player onto the platform and it always

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.300 
player onto the platform and it always
teleports<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.410> player<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.830> same<00:03:01.980> spot<00:03:02.280> on

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
teleports the player to the same spot on

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.920 
teleports the player to the same spot on
the<00:03:02.430> platform<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:03.000> doesn't<00:03:03.300> like<00:03:03.480> choose<00:03:03.900> the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
the platform it doesn't like choose the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.420 
the platform it doesn't like choose the
nearest<00:03:04.260> side<00:03:04.590> of<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:04.830> player<00:03:05.010> or<00:03:05.220> something

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
nearest side of the player or something

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.670 
nearest side of the player or something
oops<00:03:05.900> was<00:03:06.900> interesting<00:03:08.480> and<00:03:09.480> yeah<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:10.560> does

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
oops was interesting and yeah it does

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.320 
oops was interesting and yeah it does
require<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:11.010> bit<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.190> precise<00:03:11.520> timing<00:03:11.910> so<00:03:12.090> if

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
require a bit of precise timing so if

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.660 
require a bit of precise timing so if
you<00:03:12.480> manage<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.440> get<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:13.770> in<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.130> thing<00:03:14.340> but

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
you manage to get it in the thing but

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.910 
you manage to get it in the thing but
don't<00:03:14.940> pull<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.390> back<00:03:15.630> soon<00:03:15.900> enough<00:03:16.170> it's<00:03:16.709> not

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
don't pull it back soon enough it's not

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.090 
don't pull it back soon enough it's not
gonna<00:03:17.100> teleport<00:03:17.700> you<00:03:17.850> so<00:03:18.620> you<00:03:19.620> do<00:03:19.769> have<00:03:19.800> to

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
gonna teleport you so you do have to

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.770 
gonna teleport you so you do have to
pull<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.459> back<00:03:20.580> very<00:03:20.880> quickly<00:03:21.090> there<00:03:21.600> we<00:03:21.690> go

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
pull it back very quickly there we go

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.870 
pull it back very quickly there we go
like<00:03:21.930> that<00:03:22.080> but<00:03:22.980> it's<00:03:23.100> pretty<00:03:23.190> cool<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:23.670> can

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
like that but it's pretty cool you can

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.060 
like that but it's pretty cool you can
you<00:03:24.300> can<00:03:24.480> build<00:03:25.320> a<00:03:25.440> grappling<00:03:25.769> hook<00:03:25.830> in

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
you can build a grappling hook in

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.890 
you can build a grappling hook in
Minecraft<00:03:26.519> using<00:03:26.910> this<00:03:26.970> technique<00:03:27.269> very

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
Minecraft using this technique very

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.870 
Minecraft using this technique very
useful<00:03:28.140> for<00:03:28.290> adventure<00:03:28.650> map<00:03:28.800> this<00:03:28.980> is<00:03:29.160> very

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
useful for adventure map this is very

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.280 
useful for adventure map this is very

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040
