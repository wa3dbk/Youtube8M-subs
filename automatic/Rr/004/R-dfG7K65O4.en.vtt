 from Mirko as has fulfilled a dream of own house we have long 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.739
 Cookies consider whether they opt for an energy-saving passive house 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:27.190
 should 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.859
 but then 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.880
 they came across a house concert with the help of the sun power yet 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.379
 is more energy efficient 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:36.060
 the so-called bio sauna house 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.330
 Photo only clouds well with the power of the sun 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.270
 You can also heat up in the transitional apartment 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.680
 Save us marshalls attempt and dissolve the hot water in summer 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.480
 simple reason but then still in the team without the over the ring Spencer 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.470
 the terrorist group since injury Schumann the values 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.490
 and where ever they are, both in the summer and summer, but we should 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.100
 why Anton Mindl at the heating 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.020
 we have fewer and fewer consumers 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.010
 He finds it bio-solar house and founder of the same name company 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.040
 Klaus Becher 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.980
 Klaus Becher has been the technical manager of industrial companies 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.190
 his entire working life with non-functioning machines for 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.289
 his age, he wanted a house that fits without technology 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.289
 Energy-saving and healthy 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.930
 so he developed a design principle that itself 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.020
 fundamentally different from conventional passive houses 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.150
 the beer solar house works on the principle house in the house 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.560
 also a weather protection could 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.990
 a particularly heat-insulated it in the house 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.630
 this construction solves the central problem of all conventional ones 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.250
 passive houses 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.190
 the emergence of water vapor in an average household arise 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.950
 daily up to seven liters of water vapor 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.920
 in a conventional passive house, the walls must be steam tight around 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.250
 to keep the heat 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.740
 that makes your and susceptible ventilation technology different in 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.929
 bio-solar house 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.309
 the inmates protected from the house in the house are 

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:07.450
 Water vapor permeability so the official can escape naturally 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.070
 into the natural insulating materials let the water vapor escape 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.419
 but keep the heat in the house 

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:17.709
 the water vapor must not condense on the wall water condenses 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.729
 Band warm enough the power of the sun warms the interior walls of the biosauna 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:26.249
 House of water vapor rises and escapes through vents 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:27.039
 Interact 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:30.539
 In order for this to work, the glazing of the conservatory must be extra special 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:32.009
 be translucent 

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:36.520
 optimally meet these requirements Plexiglas place whether steak acts 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.240
 they have a light transmission of 91 percent and rear v and 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.320
 It is therefore weather-resistant, unlike other plastics 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.710
 not even after decades 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.999
 The manufacturer gives a 30-year warranty 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:52.239
 the jetty had a good thermal insulation 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.499
 and at the same time a low weight 

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:58.459
 Video translucency of plexiglass is also important for 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.670
 the preparation of hot water under the non-band in the roof 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.749
 There are black tubes filled with water 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:09.269
 the heated water is collected in a hot water tank and the 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.839
 Industrial water or for the railway road heating used first outside temperatures 

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:18.180
 from below five degrees Celsius must be heated with the wood stove too 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.430
 As a result, the heating costs are low our total consumption and Rogers 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.669
 Nelson years were all high on Overweight and were 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:28.659
 all product and was fetched by four points 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.940
 Thousands of euros can be said to raise about 80 euros that way 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:35.279
 Hay get fortune for 50 euros 

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:39.999
 So they also have a maximum so over 4000 been so Bauwerk want 

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:43.039
 that consumer a family in Germany with three people approximately 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:47.439
 4000 further ways only a house ban that we have in total with shark fins 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:48.399
 gave 

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:52.569
 the super low heating costs thanks to environmentally friendly solar energy 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.610
 so that the inner walls and hot water hoses are optimally heated 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.890
 need the glazed surfaces of the bio-solar house where translucent as 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.510
 be possible that makes special demands on the material of the 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.510
 Glazing Willi Baumhöver Smirnow Priaulx 

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:10.919
 and a particular density would be assured 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:12.539
 always more 

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:16.430
 made the condition that the test flights be coating so that 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.959
 it rains clean again 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.989
 Investors can and maintenance Grimm has 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.989
 all around healthy vegetables thermal insulation 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:30.039
 and the best Klaus still has the advantage that percent one in Celle around there 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.559
 arrived yes and that the plasticine is longer with us are also dogs very often 

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:37.319
 4 Nadal 4 with the 50s 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:38.990
 Remodeling can 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.449
 and with a real balance and I'm back 2 4 degrees 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:43.279
 from 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:46.350
 Architect and energy consultant Udo Gebhardt 1 by 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.820
 has already worked together with bio- solar-Haus GmbH to develop several bio- 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.130
 He also uses solar plexiglas in his designs 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:59.349
 Plexiglas to the factory leadership is just the weight of percent very well 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.510
 process around it can hardly be moved 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.900
 um and I have a very good compared to a normal course 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.009
 so that the property of the weight 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.439
 Properties completely glazed are actually better than percent 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:19.269
 a glass structure as well allowed percent the plexiglass too 

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:22.430
 certain Open Moscow was ten percent 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.560
 In the wooden construction Mölders 9 9% can forgive themselves 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.159
 or essays and what about glass 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:34.909
 the 4 0 dollar thing against Volkhard per cent persecuted destruction 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:36.120
 to lead 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.210
 Andy Roeser after a short time the architect not only the energy concept 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.070
 Also that healthy indoor climate plays an important role 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.900
 Mold, for example, can not be produced in the bio-solar house 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.250
 the reason lies in the patented wall construction with its natural and 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.839
 therefore vapor permeable insulating materials 

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:57.830
 there is no stale heating air even in the yards the problem is not 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.039
 by the closeness of the shipment open end 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:01.960
 and also in cans or come back 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.909
 it's always great air 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:07.369
 "Me so close" Houses are now available in many countries 

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:11.339
 because the principle also works in different Teamer regions 

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:15.059
 here again the most important characteristics of the bio solar house in the 

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:19.830
 Overview The bio-solar house is constructed according to the principle house in the house 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.610
 an involved outer shell protects the naturally insulated in house 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.849
 This allows water vapor to naturally set course 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:30.530
 and harmful condensation water is avoided, the animal is Ahlhaus 

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:34.839
 especially low energy costs because it uses the power of the sun to heat 

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:39.229
 For this, each animal solar house has a conservatory and light bands in the 8 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:43.209
 Plexiglas is optimal for the glazing because it is special 

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:44.319
 important is possible 

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:47.319
 and weather resistant
