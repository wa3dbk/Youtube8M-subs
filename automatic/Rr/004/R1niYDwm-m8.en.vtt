or just mean to transpose these same
chords<00:00:59.030> that<00:00:59.150> I<00:00:59.180> teach<00:00:59.420> you<00:00:59.540> for<00:00:59.720> the<00:00:59.810> chorus

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
chords that I teach you for the chorus

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.260 
chords that I teach you for the chorus
up<00:01:00.380> one<00:01:01.010> whole<00:01:01.280> step<00:01:01.460> and<00:01:01.760> then<00:01:01.850> you<00:01:01.940> can<00:01:02.120> play

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
up one whole step and then you can play

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.479 
up one whole step and then you can play
it<00:01:02.450> exactly<00:01:03.050> along<00:01:03.260> with<00:01:03.440> a<00:01:03.500> Mario<00:01:03.739> Rivera<00:01:03.890> but

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
it exactly along with a Mario Rivera but

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.649 
it exactly along with a Mario Rivera but
I'm<00:01:04.579> guessing<00:01:04.729> that<00:01:04.970> most<00:01:05.149> people<00:01:05.509> who<00:01:05.600> are

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
I'm guessing that most people who are

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.570 
I'm guessing that most people who are
going<00:01:05.899> to<00:01:06.020> be<00:01:06.110> playing<00:01:06.380> this<00:01:06.620> are<00:01:06.979> only<00:01:07.280> going

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
going to be playing this are only going

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.520 
going to be playing this are only going
to<00:01:07.670> be<00:01:07.760> playing<00:01:08.090> it<00:01:08.300> with<00:01:08.870> the<00:01:09.020> one<00:01:09.260> key

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
to be playing it with the one key

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.080 
to be playing it with the one key
without<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.040> extra<00:01:10.370> key<00:01:10.520> change<00:01:10.760> at<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.060> end

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
without the extra key change at the end

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.480 
without the extra key change at the end
like<00:01:11.420> I<00:01:11.540> did<00:01:11.720> in<00:01:11.840> my<00:01:11.870> cover<00:01:12.200> so<00:01:13.190> you're<00:01:13.370> going

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
like I did in my cover so you're going

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.250 
like I did in my cover so you're going
to<00:01:13.550> start<00:01:13.760> off<00:01:13.909> with<00:01:14.360> a<00:01:14.390> C<00:01:14.690> chord<00:01:14.960> which

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
to start off with a C chord which

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.539 
to start off with a C chord which
everybody<00:01:15.650> knows

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.279 

and<00:01:19.210> then<00:01:20.200> go<00:01:20.380> to<00:01:20.920> AG<00:01:21.399> major<00:01:21.789> over<00:01:22.420> B<00:01:22.689> so<00:01:23.170> this

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
and then go to AG major over B so this

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:26.490 
and then go to AG major over B so this
is<00:01:23.439> a<00:01:23.469> G<00:01:23.770> major<00:01:23.979> chord<00:01:24.130> with<00:01:24.520> B<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.210> bass

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
is a G major chord with B and the bass

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.370 
is a G major chord with B and the bass
