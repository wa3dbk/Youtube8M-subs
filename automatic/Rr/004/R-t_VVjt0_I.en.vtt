hello youtube this is MC unleashed and

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.789 
hello youtube this is MC unleashed and
I'm<00:00:04.110> gonna<00:00:04.319> show<00:00:04.620> you<00:00:05.390> the<00:00:06.390> Emerald<00:00:07.109> generator

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
I'm gonna show you the Emerald generator

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.310 
I'm gonna show you the Emerald generator
that<00:00:08.250> I<00:00:08.280> just<00:00:09.179> made<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:09.750> it's<00:00:10.710> very<00:00:11.099> simple<00:00:12.320> it

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
that I just made and it's very simple it

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.970 
that I just made and it's very simple it
looks<00:00:13.580> difficult<00:00:14.580> but<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.480> really<00:00:15.780> isn't<00:00:16.220> so

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
looks difficult but it really isn't so

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.390 
looks difficult but it really isn't so
basically<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.279> way<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.580> works<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:22.070> there<00:00:23.070> a

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
basically the way it works is there a

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.720 
basically the way it works is there a
stream<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.570> water<00:00:25.550> there<00:00:26.550> are<00:00:26.580> villagers<00:00:28.730> that

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
stream of water there are villagers that

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.500 
stream of water there are villagers that
are<00:00:30.090> trapped<00:00:31.040> in<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.399> water<00:00:32.750> and<00:00:35.510> this

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
are trapped in the water and this

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.959 
are trapped in the water and this
villager<00:00:37.110> traits<00:00:37.700> pork<00:00:38.700> chop<00:00:39.020> for<00:00:40.020> emeralds

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
villager traits pork chop for emeralds

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.119 
villager traits pork chop for emeralds
doesn't<00:00:41.969> matter<00:00:42.149> how<00:00:42.480> much<00:00:43.170> pork<00:00:43.590> shop<00:00:43.860> and

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
doesn't matter how much pork shop and

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.380 
doesn't matter how much pork shop and
then<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.460> have<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.030> piston<00:00:45.629> here<00:00:49.129> that<00:00:50.129> will<00:00:50.579> be

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
then I have a piston here that will be

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.020 
then I have a piston here that will be
set<00:00:51.750> off<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:53.149> that<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.530> key<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.829> all<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.820> these

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
set off and that is key so all of these

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.889 
set off and that is key so all of these
villagers<00:00:57.780> trade<00:00:58.379> 17<00:00:59.219> pork<00:00:59.609> shop<00:00:59.910> for<00:01:00.359> an

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
villagers trade 17 pork shop for an

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.520 
villagers trade 17 pork shop for an
emerald<00:01:01.489> so<00:01:02.489> at<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.449> end<00:01:03.600> here<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.110> had<00:01:04.350> two

many emeralds per minute you want based
based<00:01:54.000> on<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.299> rate<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:56.060> fire<00:01:57.060> from<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
based on the rate of fire from the

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.120 
based on the rate of fire from the
dispenser<00:01:59.810> so<00:02:00.810> I'll<00:02:01.229> teach<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.799> how<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.890> make

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
blinking light and then it'll lead up to

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.050 
blinking light and then it'll lead up to
the<00:02:23.490> Pistons<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.570> dispenser<00:02:25.260> so<00:02:26.070> all

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
the Pistons and to the dispenser so all

00:02:27.060 --> 00:03:10.040 
the Pistons and to the dispenser so all
you<00:02:27.210> have<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.360> do<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:27.900> you<00:03:08.450> pork<00:03:09.450> traps<00:03:09.720> come

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
you have to do is you pork traps come

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.870 
you have to do is you pork traps come
back<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.590> then<00:03:10.740> they'll<00:03:10.980> just<00:03:11.010> drop<00:03:11.610> down

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
back and then they'll just drop down

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:20.120 
back and then they'll just drop down
right<00:03:12.150> there<00:03:14.150> minute<00:03:15.320> so<00:03:18.080> back<00:03:19.080> to<00:03:19.110> this<00:03:19.440> if<00:03:19.830> I

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
right there minute so back to this if I

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.600 
right there minute so back to this if I
set<00:03:20.790> this<00:03:21.080> at<00:03:23.390> 100<00:03:24.390> also<00:03:24.570> plus<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.590> 40<00:03:25.950> I<00:03:26.190> would

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
set this at 100 also plus the 40 I would

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.100 
set this at 100 also plus the 40 I would
mean<00:03:26.790> that<00:03:27.000> there<00:03:27.240> would<00:03:27.330> be<00:03:27.390> a<00:03:27.570> hundred<00:03:27.840> and

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
mean that there would be a hundred and

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.420 
mean that there would be a hundred and
forty<00:03:28.650> emeralds<00:03:29.160> per<00:03:29.430> minute<00:03:31.070> but<00:03:32.070> you<00:03:32.220> don't

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
forty emeralds per minute but you don't

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.610 
forty emeralds per minute but you don't
want<00:03:32.610> that<00:03:32.790> because<00:03:32.970> it<00:03:33.210> produces<00:03:34.080> quite<00:03:34.560> a

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
want that because it produces quite a

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.450 
want that because it produces quite a
bit<00:03:34.830> of<00:03:34.950> lag<00:03:37.400> most<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.520> you<00:03:38.580> can<00:03:38.730> do<00:03:38.850> is<00:03:38.970> like

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
bit of lag most of you can do is like

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.960 
bit of lag most of you can do is like
400<00:03:41.460> per<00:03:42.210> minute<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:42.690> then<00:03:42.960> I'll<00:03:43.200> just<00:03:43.470> go

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
400 per minute and then I'll just go

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:53.540 
400 per minute and then I'll just go
crazy<00:03:46.010> so<00:03:47.010> here<00:03:47.520> they<00:03:47.910> start<00:03:48.300> to<00:03:48.420> come<00:03:52.340> they<00:03:53.340> go

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
crazy so here they start to come they go

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.280 
crazy so here they start to come they go
down<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:53.940> stream<00:03:54.240> quite<00:03:54.930> a<00:03:54.960> bit<00:03:55.200> slower<00:03:55.440> cuz

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
down the stream quite a bit slower cuz

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:07.520 
down the stream quite a bit slower cuz
the<00:03:58.290> piston<00:03:59.450> but<00:04:00.450> if<00:04:00.600> you<00:04:00.780> turn<00:04:01.230> this<00:04:01.650> off<00:04:06.530> it

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
the piston but if you turn this off it

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.880 
the piston but if you turn this off it
goes<00:04:07.800> quite<00:04:08.790> a<00:04:08.820> bit<00:04:09.030> faster<00:04:10.459> so<00:04:11.459> you<00:04:12.320> can<00:04:13.320> see

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
goes quite a bit faster so you can see

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.940 
goes quite a bit faster so you can see
there<00:04:14.280> are<00:04:14.550> emeralds<00:04:15.480> all<00:04:16.230> the<00:04:16.799> way<00:04:16.980> and<00:04:18.950> this

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
there are emeralds all the way and this

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.120 
there are emeralds all the way and this
does<00:04:20.220> work<00:04:20.489> so

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.110
