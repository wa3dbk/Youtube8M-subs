00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
one of the lanyards that we make here

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.530 
one of the lanyards that we make here
I'll<00:00:18.680> tell<00:00:18.860> you<00:00:18.920> a<00:00:19.040> little<00:00:19.070> bit<00:00:19.340> about<00:00:19.910> all<00:00:20.330> the

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.530 
I'll tell you a little bit about all the
knots<00:00:21.230> and<00:00:21.500> such<00:00:21.880> we'll<00:00:22.880> start<00:00:23.240> on<00:00:23.360> this<00:00:23.510> end

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:25.540 
knots and such we'll start on this end

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:31.060 
knots and such we'll start on this end
we<00:00:26.540> use<00:00:26.660> a<00:00:26.689> lobster<00:00:27.290> clasp<00:00:29.290> it's<00:00:30.290> plated<00:00:30.740> it's

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
we use a lobster clasp it's plated it's

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.140 
we use a lobster clasp it's plated it's
nickel<00:00:31.430> plated<00:00:32.590> then<00:00:33.590> we<00:00:33.800> we<00:00:34.670> we've<00:00:34.940> not<00:00:35.780> a

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
nickel plated then we we we've not a

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.369 
nickel plated then we we we've not a
round<00:00:38.170> crown<00:00:39.170> Senate<00:00:40.629> into<00:00:41.629> a<00:00:41.660> terminal<00:00:41.989> knot

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
round crown Senate into a terminal knot

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.180 
round crown Senate into a terminal knot
and<00:00:43.809> then<00:00:44.809> we<00:00:44.930> do<00:00:45.050> a<00:00:45.080> double<00:00:45.170> land<00:00:45.710> you're<00:00:45.949> not

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
and then we do a double land you're not

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.990 
and then we do a double land you're not
here<00:00:46.760> so<00:00:47.690> it<00:00:47.810> looks<00:00:47.960> like<00:00:48.110> this<00:00:48.410> on<00:00:48.760> the<00:00:49.760> end

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
here so it looks like this on the end

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.400 
here so it looks like this on the end
and<00:00:50.680> then<00:00:51.680> we<00:00:51.770> do<00:00:51.920> a<00:00:51.950> four<00:00:52.660> strand<00:00:53.680> round<00:00:54.680> braid

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
and then we do a four strand round braid

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:05.020 
and then we do a four strand round braid
that<00:01:00.219> then<00:01:01.219> we<00:01:01.399> do<00:01:01.610> a<00:01:02.059> couple<00:01:02.780> of<00:01:04.030> crown

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
that then we do a couple of crown

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.840 
that then we do a couple of crown
senate's<00:01:05.600> just<00:01:06.290> the<00:01:06.410> regular<00:01:06.590> ones<00:01:07.009> and<00:01:07.280> then

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
senate's just the regular ones and then

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.749 
senate's just the regular ones and then
a<00:01:07.880> terminal<00:01:08.390> knot<00:01:08.600> and<00:01:09.280> then<00:01:10.280> we<00:01:10.430> run<00:01:10.640> it

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
a terminal knot and then we run it

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:19.270 
a terminal knot and then we run it
through<00:01:11.740> into<00:01:12.740> our<00:01:13.539> breakaway<00:01:16.660> for<00:01:17.660> safety<00:01:18.280> so

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
through into our breakaway for safety so

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.210 
through into our breakaway for safety so
there's<00:01:19.549> a<00:01:19.610> lot<00:01:19.760> of<00:01:19.880> people<00:01:20.000> that<00:01:20.210> need<00:01:20.420> that
