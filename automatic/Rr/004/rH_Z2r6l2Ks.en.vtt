00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.550

of the roller into the corner here as

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:37.250 
of the roller into the corner here as
far<00:03:05.810> as<00:03:05.870> possible<00:03:06.260> here

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.170 

okay<00:03:38.260> so<00:03:38.380> I'm<00:03:39.010> just<00:03:39.160> going<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.400> continue<00:03:39.640> to

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
okay so I'm just going to continue to

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.840 
okay so I'm just going to continue to
roll<00:03:40.450> out<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:41.050> rest<00:03:41.830> of<00:03:42.100> the<00:03:42.220> ceiling<00:03:42.670> there

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
roll out the rest of the ceiling there

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.500 
roll out the rest of the ceiling there
and<00:03:43.240> this<00:03:43.930> is<00:03:44.020> gonna<00:03:44.140> need<00:03:44.320> one<00:03:44.800> more<00:03:45.070> coat

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510
