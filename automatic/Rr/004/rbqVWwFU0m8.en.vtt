it's<00:02:35.890> just<00:02:35.980> something<00:02:36.430> that<00:02:36.459> pretty<00:02:37.209> honored

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
it's just something that pretty honored

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
to be involved in I mean it's a selected

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.460 
to be involved in I mean it's a selected

corners and then some fast stuff too so

00:02:49.150 --> 00:03:11.240 
corners and then some fast stuff too so
that<00:02:49.390> made<00:02:49.599> an<00:02:49.690> exciting<00:02:49.959> event

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.880 

the<00:03:12.250> quad<00:03:12.490> itself<00:03:12.880> on<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.480> tarmac<00:03:13.720> I<00:03:13.930> mean<00:03:14.230> was

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
the quad itself on the tarmac I mean was

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.530 
the quad itself on the tarmac I mean was
a<00:03:14.920> learning<00:03:15.160> curve<00:03:15.310> and<00:03:15.730> certainly<00:03:16.209> the<00:03:16.330> first

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
a learning curve and certainly the first

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.570 
a learning curve and certainly the first
day<00:03:16.780> we<00:03:16.959> had<00:03:17.110> absolutely<00:03:17.530> too<00:03:18.040> much<00:03:18.250> traction

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
day we had absolutely too much traction

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.040 
day we had absolutely too much traction
then<00:03:18.880> it<00:03:19.000> was<00:03:19.120> a<00:03:19.150> real<00:03:19.450> handful

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
then it was a real handful

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.170 
then it was a real handful
you<00:03:20.500> changed<00:03:20.860> some<00:03:20.980> tires<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.430> tried<00:03:21.970> some

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
you changed some tires and tried some

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.550 
you changed some tires and tried some
things<00:03:22.450> and<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:22.750> second<00:03:23.080> day<00:03:23.140> it<00:03:23.200> was<00:03:23.350> quite

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
things and the second day it was quite

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.460 
things and the second day it was quite
slick<00:03:23.890> and<00:03:24.069> there<00:03:24.340> not<00:03:24.459> to<00:03:24.610> a<00:03:24.640> couple<00:03:24.940> of<00:03:24.970> spins

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
slick and there not to a couple of spins

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.530 
slick and there not to a couple of spins
and<00:03:26.470> then<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:26.980> in<00:03:27.100> Sunday<00:03:27.700> morning<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.209> final

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
and then and in Sunday morning the final

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.840 
and then and in Sunday morning the final
day<00:03:28.740> the<00:03:29.740> first<00:03:29.950> run<00:03:30.160> was<00:03:30.310> in<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.520> weed<00:03:30.670> and<00:03:30.790> we

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
day the first run was in the weed and we

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.100 
day the first run was in the weed and we
had<00:03:30.940> a<00:03:30.970> pretty<00:03:31.150> good<00:03:31.300> wet<00:03:31.450> setup<00:03:31.720> which<00:03:31.959> was

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
had a pretty good wet setup which was

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.050 
had a pretty good wet setup which was
surprising<00:03:32.320> with<00:03:33.190> limited<00:03:33.550> limited

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
surprising with limited limited

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.600 
surprising with limited limited
experience<00:03:34.540> but<00:03:34.990> and<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:36.220> the<00:03:36.280> boy<00:03:36.400> it<00:03:36.520> was

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
experience but and and the boy it was

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.800 
experience but and and the boy it was
pretty<00:03:36.820> close<00:03:37.030> on<00:03:37.390> the<00:03:37.600> final<00:03:37.959> run<00:03:39.150> we<00:03:40.150> managed

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
pretty close on the final run we managed

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.720 
pretty close on the final run we managed
to<00:03:40.930> get<00:03:41.020> it<00:03:41.140> pretty<00:03:41.350> good<00:03:41.500> plot<00:03:42.100> itself<00:03:42.459> was

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
to get it pretty good plot itself was

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.520 
don't don't keep an eye on them they
tend<00:04:12.459> themselves<00:04:12.940> in<00:04:13.060> two<00:04:13.239> and<00:04:13.450> two<00:04:13.989> dishes<00:04:14.200> so

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
tend themselves in two and two dishes so

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.960 
tend themselves in two and two dishes so
we've<00:04:14.709> had<00:04:14.860> to<00:04:15.010> put<00:04:15.190> some<00:04:15.310> cooling<00:04:15.670> into<00:04:15.820> the

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
we've had to put some cooling into the

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.130 
we've had to put some cooling into the
brake<00:04:16.180> system<00:04:16.419> so<00:04:16.690> I<00:04:16.720> think<00:04:16.930> quite<00:04:17.079> a

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
brake system so I think quite a

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.800 
brake system so I think quite a
challenge<00:04:17.560> to<00:04:17.620> get<00:04:17.829> it<00:04:17.950> to<00:04:18.940> where<00:04:19.359> it<00:04:19.510> is<00:04:19.600> and

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
challenge to get it to where it is and

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.449 
challenge to get it to where it is and
be<00:04:19.900> competitive<00:04:20.229> up<00:04:20.530> the<00:04:20.650> hill<00:04:20.829> I<00:04:21.070> mean

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
be competitive up the hill I mean

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.890 
be competitive up the hill I mean
obviously<00:04:21.579> there's<00:04:22.150> there's<00:04:22.450> 100<00:04:22.780> other

obviously there's there's 100 other

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.780 
obviously there's there's 100 other
