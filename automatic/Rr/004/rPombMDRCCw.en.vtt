00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
going to be using let's say for example

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.539 
going to be using let's say for example
an<00:01:54.420> otterbox<00:01:54.930> one<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.770> those<00:01:55.920> heavy<00:01:56.250> duty

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
an otterbox one of those heavy duty

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.209 
an otterbox one of those heavy duty
cases<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.479> provide<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.500> lot<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.950> impact

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
cases that provide a lot of impact

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.679 
cases that provide a lot of impact
resistance<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.820> in<00:01:59.909> some<00:02:00.090> cases<00:02:00.299> or<00:02:00.509> even

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
resistance and in some cases or even

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.499 
resistance and in some cases or even
waterproof<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.969> let's<00:02:02.969> look<00:02:03.030> at<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.299> some

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
waterproof so let's look at this some

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.679 
waterproof so let's look at this some
armband<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.200> first<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.799> all<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:05.540> it's<00:02:06.540> no

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
armband and first of all it's it's no

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.210 
armband and first of all it's it's no
different<00:02:06.899> than<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.409> árbenz<00:02:07.740> i've<00:02:07.950> seen

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
different than the árbenz i've seen

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.460 
different than the árbenz i've seen
there<00:02:08.429> except<00:02:08.940> for<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.270> size<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.959> oversized

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.550 
there except for the size the oversized
nature<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.640> has<00:02:11.849> some<00:02:12.420> good<00:02:12.540> fellow

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
nature of it so it has some good fellow

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.100

phone tends to press against the plastic

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.190 
phone tends to press against the plastic
when<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:04.769> take<00:03:05.010> out<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:06.150> phone<00:03:06.360> I've<00:03:06.989> had

when you take out the the phone I've had

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.350 
when you take out the the phone I've had
situations<00:03:07.440> like<00:03:07.920> with<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.280> zagg<00:03:08.640> for<00:03:08.910> example

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
situations like with a zagg for example

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.520 
situations like with a zagg for example
screen<00:03:09.569> protector<00:03:10.019> where<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.290> screen

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
screen protector where the screen

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.530 
screen protector where the screen
protector<00:03:10.980> comes<00:03:11.190> off<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.030> like<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.390> fact

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
protector comes off so I like the fact

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.150 
protector comes off so I like the fact
that<00:03:12.720> it<00:03:12.900> has<00:03:13.080> some<00:03:13.260> plan<00:03:13.380> and<00:03:13.830> that<00:03:13.950> things

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
that it has some plan and that things

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.070 
that it has some plan and that things
aren't<00:03:14.340> really<00:03:14.580> really<00:03:14.940> tight<00:03:15.180> so<00:03:15.720> let's<00:03:15.959> take

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
aren't really really tight so let's take

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.620 
aren't really really tight so let's take
a<00:03:16.110> look<00:03:16.349> at<00:03:16.410> what<00:03:16.470> does<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.400> phone<00:03:18.209> look<00:03:18.450> like

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
a look at what does the phone look like

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.690 
a look at what does the phone look like
inside<00:03:18.989> of<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.290> armband<00:03:19.739> so<00:03:20.160> what<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.310> do<00:03:20.400> is<00:03:20.519> I

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
inside of the armband so what I do is I

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.909 
usable so it does to go around a little
bit<00:05:00.479> but<00:05:00.840> when<00:05:00.990> it's<00:05:01.110> connected<00:05:01.320> to<00:05:01.530> my<00:05:01.620> arm

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
bit but when it's connected to my arm

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.950 
bit but when it's connected to my arm
you<00:05:02.340> know<00:05:02.430> it<00:05:02.610> does<00:05:02.820> get<00:05:02.970> pressed<00:05:03.389> like<00:05:03.690> this
