such big patches why didn't they do it

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.790 
such big patches why didn't they do it
in<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.149> small<00:00:42.390> one<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.719> I've<00:00:42.870> saw<00:00:43.110> said<00:00:43.410> oh<00:00:43.559> well

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
in a small one and I've saw said oh well

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.040 
in a small one and I've saw said oh well
because<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.730> know<00:00:44.879> they<00:00:45.390> have<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.780> take<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
because you know they have to take the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.779 
because you know they have to take the
time<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.410> do<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:46.920> makes<00:00:47.070> more<00:00:47.250> sense<00:00:47.550> to

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
time to do it and it makes more sense to

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.580 
time to do it and it makes more sense to
do<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.120> one<00:00:48.300> thing<00:00:48.690> rather<00:00:49.289> than<00:00:49.379> make

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
do it in one thing rather than make

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.990 
do it in one thing rather than make
small<00:00:49.950> tweaks<00:00:50.960> but<00:00:51.960> i<00:00:52.020> have<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.289> say<00:00:52.590> i<00:00:52.890> do<00:00:53.550> try

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
small tweaks but i have to say i do try

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.400 
small tweaks but i have to say i do try
to<00:00:54.030> look<00:00:54.270> at<00:00:54.360> things<00:00:54.480> from<00:00:54.570> both<00:00:54.840> sides<00:00:55.170> always

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
to look at things from both sides always

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.170 
to look at things from both sides always
because<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.520> know<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.670> try<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.940> be<00:00:57.090> an

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
because you know I try to be an

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.450 
because you know I try to be an
objective<00:00:57.570> person<00:00:57.780> obviously<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:59.219> always

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
objective person obviously you always

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
a case of how long it takes it's a fact

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.580 
a case of how long it takes it's a fact
that<00:01:39.299> you've<00:01:39.570> got<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.810> leave<00:01:39.990> your<00:01:40.200> system

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
that you've got to leave your system

that you've got to leave your system

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
online updating and it's the fact that

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.870 
online updating and it's the fact that
sometimes<00:01:43.500> we<00:01:43.920> all<00:01:43.950> know<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.399> Internet<00:01:44.729> can

sometimes we all know the Internet can

sometimes we all know the Internet can
kind<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.119> glitch<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.509> then<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.720> might<00:01:45.869> have

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
kind of glitch and then you might have

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.510 
kind of glitch and then you might have
to<00:01:46.110> start<00:01:46.350> again<00:01:46.530> or<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.130> could<00:01:47.310> cause<00:01:47.490> a

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
to start again or it could cause a

to start again or it could cause a
problem<00:01:47.970> or<00:01:48.570> anything<00:01:48.750> like<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.399> giving

problem or anything like this giving

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
patches and not only that but you know

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.170 
patches and not only that but you know
people's<00:01:52.439> system<00:01:53.250> storage<00:01:53.520> unit<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.060> know

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
people's system storage unit you know

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.700 
people's system storage unit you know
I've<00:01:54.600> changed<00:01:54.630> out<00:01:55.020> my<00:01:55.140> hard<00:01:55.320> drive<00:01:55.500> for<00:01:55.619> my

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
I've changed out my hard drive for my

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.429 
I've changed out my hard drive for my
ps3<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.460> if<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.850> PC<00:01:57.570> users<00:01:57.960> as<00:01:58.140> well<00:01:58.170> they

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
ps3 and if a PC users as well they

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.590 
ps3 and if a PC users as well they
probably<00:01:58.500> have<00:01:58.770> large<00:01:58.979> hard<00:01:59.189> drives<00:01:59.430> but<00:02:00.420> not

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
probably have large hard drives but not

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.959 
probably have large hard drives but not
everyone<00:02:00.960> again<00:02:01.290> has<00:02:01.560> such<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.009> large<00:02:02.310> hard

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
everyone again has such a large hard

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.459 
everyone again has such a large hard
drive<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.329> can<00:02:03.420> be<00:02:03.450> taken<00:02:03.750> up<00:02:03.810> space<00:02:03.990> as<00:02:04.439> a

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
drive and it can be taken up space as a

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.999 
drive and it can be taken up space as a
massive<00:02:04.950> patch<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:06.390> just<00:02:07.259> think<00:02:07.560> it's<00:02:07.890> a

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
massive patch and I just think it's a

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.619 
massive patch and I just think it's a
little<00:02:08.160> bit<00:02:08.310> unreasonable<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:09.030> be<00:02:09.270> giving

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
little bit unreasonable to be giving

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.260 
little bit unreasonable to be giving
these<00:02:09.720> epic<00:02:10.560> patches<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.819> be<00:02:11.879> honest<00:02:12.090> I

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
these epic patches and to be honest I

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.740 
these epic patches and to be honest I
mean<00:02:12.599> I<00:02:12.750> think<00:02:13.080> as<00:02:13.230> well

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
mean I think as well

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.780 
mean I think as well
this<00:02:13.840> large<00:02:14.110> patches<00:02:14.470> it's<00:02:14.950> so<00:02:15.190> large<00:02:15.370> also

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
this large patches it's so large also

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.010 
this large patches it's so large also
because<00:02:15.940> I<00:02:16.030> reckon<00:02:16.270> it's<00:02:16.390> still<00:02:16.600> laying<00:02:16.840> like

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
because I reckon it's still laying like

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.230 
because I reckon it's still laying like
a<00:02:17.050> foundation<00:02:17.770> for<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:18.040> upcoming<00:02:18.400> DLC<00:02:18.700> s<00:02:19.090> and

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
a foundation for the upcoming DLC s and

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.190 
a foundation for the upcoming DLC s and
things<00:02:19.420> like<00:02:19.510> that<00:02:19.570> they've<00:02:19.960> done<00:02:20.080> that

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
things like that they've done that

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.200 
things like that they've done that
before<00:02:20.560> they<00:02:20.710> often<00:02:20.950> sort<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.490> plug<00:02:21.730> in<00:02:21.910> some

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
before they often sort of plug in some

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.300 
before they often sort of plug in some
kind<00:02:22.480> of<00:02:22.570> stuff<00:02:22.840> that<00:02:23.020> you<00:02:23.770> know<00:02:23.860> allows<00:02:24.130> that

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
kind of stuff that you know allows that

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.980 
kind of stuff that you know allows that
to<00:02:24.370> function<00:02:24.910> when<00:02:25.120> people<00:02:25.450> download<00:02:25.810> it

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
to function when people download it

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.810 
to function when people download it
cetera<00:02:26.410> they<00:02:26.560> sort<00:02:26.830> of<00:02:26.860> they<00:02:27.280> put<00:02:27.550> some<00:02:27.670> things

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
cetera they sort of they put some things

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.640 
cetera they sort of they put some things
and<00:02:27.970> they<00:02:28.120> did<00:02:28.270> that<00:02:28.420> with<00:02:28.540> Vietnam<00:02:29.290> for<00:02:29.500> bad

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
and they did that with Vietnam for bad

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.830 
and they did that with Vietnam for bad
company<00:02:29.800> 2<00:02:30.220> as<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.490> massive<00:02:30.760> massive<00:02:31.209> patch<00:02:31.630> and

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
company 2 as a massive massive patch and

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.660 
company 2 as a massive massive patch and
then<00:02:31.930> you<00:02:32.020> just<00:02:32.170> download<00:02:32.500> it<00:02:32.530> small<00:02:33.130> update<00:02:33.310> I

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
then you just download it small update I

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.390 
then you just download it small update I
don't<00:02:34.180> know<00:02:34.300> but<00:02:34.510> my<00:02:35.290> point<00:02:35.590> is<00:02:35.709> that<00:02:35.770> it's<00:02:36.250> a

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
don't know but my point is that it's a

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.320 
don't know but my point is that it's a
huge<00:02:36.940> huge<00:02:37.570> patch<00:02:38.050> and<00:02:38.410> I<00:02:39.130> just<00:02:39.970> think<00:02:40.240> that

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
huge huge patch and I just think that

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.090 
huge huge patch and I just think that
you<00:02:40.930> know<00:02:41.050> from<00:02:41.260> some<00:02:41.500> people's<00:02:41.830> point<00:02:42.040> of

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
you know from some people's point of

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.830 
you know from some people's point of
view<00:02:42.310> it's<00:02:42.520> going<00:02:42.700> to<00:02:42.760> make<00:02:42.880> things<00:02:42.940> then<00:02:43.690> make

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
view it's going to make things then make

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.449 
view it's going to make things then make
their<00:02:43.990> life<00:02:44.140> really<00:02:44.560> difficult<00:02:44.980> when<00:02:45.370> it

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
their life really difficult when it

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.460 
their life really difficult when it
comes<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.820> downloading<00:02:46.330> I<00:02:46.480> would<00:02:47.290> just<00:02:47.410> like

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
comes to downloading I would just like

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.530 
comes to downloading I would just like
to<00:02:47.590> hear<00:02:47.770> from<00:02:48.070> anyone<00:02:48.280> just<00:02:48.790> hear<00:02:49.239> you<00:02:49.450> know

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.060 
to hear from anyone just hear you know
if<00:02:49.690> you've<00:02:49.840> got<00:02:50.020> a<00:02:50.050> bad<00:02:50.260> connection<00:02:50.530> how<00:02:51.010> do

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
if you've got a bad connection how do

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.110 
if you've got a bad connection how do
you<00:02:51.190> find<00:02:51.489> it<00:02:51.700> when<00:02:51.790> you're<00:02:51.910> trying<00:02:52.030> to

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
you find it when you're trying to

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.540 
you find it when you're trying to
download<00:02:52.330> these<00:02:52.660> massive<00:02:53.080> patches<00:02:53.530> as<00:02:54.250> I<00:02:54.310> say

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
download these massive patches as I say

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.420 
download these massive patches as I say
you<00:02:55.030> know<00:02:55.180> for<00:02:55.540> me<00:02:55.680> my<00:02:56.680> connection<00:02:56.709> is<00:02:57.190> good

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
you know for me my connection is good

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.729 
you know for me my connection is good
and<00:02:57.640> so<00:02:57.940> it's<00:02:58.090> not<00:02:58.239> such<00:02:58.660> a<00:02:58.870> big<00:02:58.930> deal<00:02:59.140> which<00:02:59.620> is

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
and so it's not such a big deal which is

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.590 
and so it's not such a big deal which is
probably<00:02:59.980> why<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.370> sort<00:03:00.880> of<00:03:00.940> say<00:03:01.090> oh<00:03:01.120> well<00:03:01.390> you

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
probably why I sort of say oh well you

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.699 
probably why I sort of say oh well you
know<00:03:01.660> they've<00:03:01.989> got<00:03:02.140> to<00:03:02.230> do<00:03:02.320> what<00:03:02.440> they<00:03:02.530> got<00:03:02.680> to

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
know they've got to do what they got to

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.920 
know they've got to do what they got to
do<00:03:02.970> but<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.060> thing<00:03:04.209> is<00:03:04.239> even<00:03:04.480> for<00:03:04.720> me<00:03:04.810> is

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
do but the thing is even for me is

I know people where it isn't good it can

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.210 
I know people where it isn't good it can
be<00:03:12.220> unbelievably<00:03:13.209> frustrating<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:14.980> just

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
be unbelievably frustrating so I just

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.710 
be unbelievably frustrating so I just
wanted<00:03:15.550> to<00:03:15.610> I<00:03:15.760> didn't<00:03:16.270> really<00:03:16.360> want<00:03:16.540> to<00:03:16.600> have<00:03:16.690> a

wanted to I didn't really want to have a

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.199 
wanted to I didn't really want to have a
rent<00:03:16.989> because<00:03:17.200> I'm<00:03:17.410> not<00:03:17.560> having<00:03:17.799> a<00:03:17.890> go<00:03:17.920> I<00:03:18.400> just

think<00:03:19.390> that<00:03:19.630> it's<00:03:20.380> important<00:03:20.769> to<00:03:20.830> think<00:03:20.890> about

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
think that it's important to think about

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.860 
think that it's important to think about
these<00:03:21.340> things<00:03:21.610> and<00:03:21.910> I<00:03:22.000> don't<00:03:22.180> know<00:03:22.299> whether

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
these things and I don't know whether

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.270

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
was the only way they could do it but I
