especially these bats they go in random
order<00:00:54.739> and<00:00:55.739> even<00:00:55.860> things<00:00:56.219> like<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.550> pogo

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
like the pogo stick it's still a

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.299 
like the pogo stick it's still a
difficult<00:01:04.470> challenge

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
difficult challenge

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.740 
difficult challenge
oh<00:01:06.500> but<00:01:07.500> like<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.400> say<00:01:08.580> they've<00:01:08.790> dang<00:01:09.420> it

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
oh but like I say they've dang it

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.560 
oh but like I say they've dang it
see<00:01:10.080> I'm<00:01:10.320> not<00:01:10.470> I'm<00:01:10.860> not<00:01:10.950> taking<00:01:11.369> my<00:01:11.490> time<00:01:11.729> I'm

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
see I'm not I'm not taking my time I'm

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.480 
see I'm not I'm not taking my time I'm
getting<00:01:12.720> impatient<00:01:13.189> but<00:01:14.189> they've<00:01:14.310> taken

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
getting impatient but they've taken

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.600 
getting impatient but they've taken
things<00:01:15.110> like<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.290> pretty<00:01:16.590> simple<00:01:16.979> looking<00:01:17.250> jump

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
things like a pretty simple looking jump

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.780 
things like a pretty simple looking jump
a<00:01:17.880> pretty<00:01:18.360> simple<00:01:19.320> looking<00:01:19.560> obstacle<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.400> a

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
a pretty simple looking obstacle and a

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.490 
a pretty simple looking obstacle and a
pretty<00:01:21.000> simple<00:01:21.330> looking<00:01:21.540> enemy<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.140> they've

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
pretty simple looking enemy and they've

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.899 
pretty simple looking enemy and they've
put<00:01:22.710> them<00:01:22.799> together<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.790> actually

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
put them together and it actually

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:31.270 
put them together and it actually
creates<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.659> decent<00:01:25.439> challenge

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.620 

I<00:01:31.310> guess<00:01:31.910> you<00:01:32.030> could<00:01:32.150> say<00:01:32.330> there's<00:01:32.570> a

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
I guess you could say there's a

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.210 
I guess you could say there's a
difference<00:01:32.690> between<00:01:33.320> this<00:01:33.650> level<00:01:34.010> in<00:01:34.130> the

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
difference between this level in the

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.040 
difference between this level in the
last<00:01:34.370> one<00:01:34.700> it's<00:01:34.970> not<00:01:35.180> completely<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.810> same

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
last one it's not completely the same

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.240 
last one it's not completely the same
but<00:01:36.350> as<00:01:36.470> as<00:01:36.680> you<00:01:37.280> can<00:01:37.430> see<00:01:37.670> it's<00:01:37.940> uh<00:01:39.250> it's

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
but as as you can see it's uh it's

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.060 
but as as you can see it's uh it's
pretty<00:01:40.400> stem<00:01:41.000> pretty<00:01:41.660> well<00:01:42.110> it<00:01:42.530> looks<00:01:42.800> good<00:01:43.010> I

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
pretty stem pretty well it looks good I

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.190 
pretty stem pretty well it looks good I
guess<00:01:43.400> you<00:01:43.520> could<00:01:43.640> say<00:01:43.670> I<00:01:44.030> don't<00:01:44.420> have<00:01:44.750> scripts

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
guess you could say I don't have scripts

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.580 
guess you could say I don't have scripts
for<00:01:45.380> mine<00:01:45.590> maybe<00:01:45.800> I<00:01:45.920> should<00:01:46.580> start<00:01:47.500> but<00:01:48.500> I

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
for mine maybe I should start but I

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.190 
for mine maybe I should start but I
don't<00:01:48.740> know<00:01:48.800> it<00:01:48.920> just<00:01:49.040> seems<00:01:49.310> so<00:01:50.200> contrived

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
don't know it just seems so contrived

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.130 
don't know it just seems so contrived
whenever<00:01:52.240> you<00:01:53.240> know<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.480> guys<00:01:53.630> reading<00:01:53.930> off<00:01:54.110> a

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
whenever you know the guys reading off a

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.020 
whenever you know the guys reading off a
script<00:01:54.260> and<00:01:54.860> acting<00:01:55.160> like<00:01:55.190> he's<00:01:55.490> pissed<00:01:55.790> when

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
script and acting like he's pissed when

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.000 
script and acting like he's pissed when
he<00:01:56.060> hits<00:01:56.300> a<00:01:56.450> spider<00:01:56.750> it's<00:01:57.080> like<00:01:57.290> is<00:01:57.590> he<00:01:57.770> pissed

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
he hits a spider it's like is he pissed

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.860 
he hits a spider it's like is he pissed
that<00:01:58.220> he<00:01:58.430> knew<00:01:58.550> he<00:01:58.700> was<00:01:58.820> gonna<00:01:58.880> hit<00:01:59.180> it<00:01:59.300> and<00:01:59.540> he

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
that he knew he was gonna hit it and he

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.480 
that he knew he was gonna hit it and he
had<00:01:59.960> already<00:02:00.050> written<00:02:00.350> down<00:02:00.620> how<00:02:00.980> pissed<00:02:01.310> he

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
had already written down how pissed he

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.950 
had already written down how pissed he
was<00:02:01.640> gonna<00:02:01.760> be<00:02:02.000> and<00:02:02.240> what<00:02:02.360> he<00:02:02.420> was<00:02:02.510> gonna<00:02:02.660> say

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
was gonna be and what he was gonna say

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.350 
was gonna be and what he was gonna say
so<00:02:03.770> how<00:02:03.920> how<00:02:04.280> could<00:02:04.490> he<00:02:04.610> actually<00:02:04.940> be<00:02:05.060> pissed

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
so how how could he actually be pissed
