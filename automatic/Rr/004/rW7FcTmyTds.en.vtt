00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
step of turn of events so it's solar

under the biggest or most powerful that
would<00:01:35.710> be<00:01:35.799> the<00:01:35.890> x-class<00:01:36.520> flare<00:01:37.000> and<00:01:37.270> just<00:01:37.840> a

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
would be the x-class flare and just a

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.859 
would be the x-class flare and just a
little<00:01:38.680> while<00:01:38.860> ago<00:01:39.010> the<00:01:39.670> Sun<00:01:39.970> fired<00:01:40.299> off<00:01:40.570> its

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
little while ago the Sun fired off its

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.920 
little while ago the Sun fired off its
third<00:01:41.350> x-class<00:01:42.220> flare<00:01:42.729> this<00:01:43.240> shot<00:01:43.570> like<00:01:43.780> an

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
third x-class flare this shot like an

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.740 
third x-class flare this shot like an
arrow<00:01:44.170> right<00:01:44.830> at<00:01:45.040> comet<00:01:45.460> ison<00:01:45.880> yeah<00:01:46.330> you<00:01:46.390> heard

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
arrow right at comet ison yeah you heard

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.289 
arrow right at comet ison yeah you heard
me<00:01:46.810> that's<00:01:47.470> right<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:48.010> Sun<00:01:48.340> just<00:01:48.820> fired<00:01:49.150> a

kill<00:01:49.510> shot<00:01:49.720> right<00:01:50.229> at<00:01:50.260> comet<00:01:50.830> Ison<00:01:51.400> will<00:01:51.850> it

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
kill shot right at comet Ison will it

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.120 
kill shot right at comet Ison will it
break<00:01:52.119> it<00:01:52.180> to<00:01:52.360> pieces<00:01:52.390> will<00:01:52.930> it<00:01:53.110> destroy<00:01:53.500> comet

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
break it to pieces will it destroy comet

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.190 
break it to pieces will it destroy comet
Ison<00:01:54.280> and<00:01:54.760> we<00:01:54.909> will<00:01:55.030> all<00:01:55.150> go<00:01:55.360> deja<00:01:55.630> vu<00:01:55.900> Ellen

in one piece will ice and stay intact I

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.270 
in one piece will ice and stay intact I
don't<00:04:07.080> know<00:04:07.200> but<00:04:07.440> I<00:04:07.739> do<00:04:07.799> you<00:04:07.980> know<00:04:08.100> that

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
don't know but I do you know that

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.270 
don't know but I do you know that
science<00:04:08.760> is<00:04:08.910> long-held<00:04:09.720> theory<00:04:10.080> that<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.650> small

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
science is long-held theory that a small

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.449 
science is long-held theory that a small
comet<00:04:11.820> as<00:04:11.940> a<00:04:12.200> negligible<00:04:13.200> effect<00:04:13.410> on<00:04:13.890> the<00:04:14.220> sun

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
comet as a negligible effect on the sun

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.300 
comet as a negligible effect on the sun
is<00:04:14.730> probably<00:04:15.150> wrong<00:04:15.780> I<00:04:16.200> mean<00:04:16.590> isn't<00:04:16.739> it<00:04:16.890> kind

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
is probably wrong I mean isn't it kind

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.360 
is probably wrong I mean isn't it kind
of<00:04:17.340> like<00:04:17.519> quantum<00:04:18.030> relativity<00:04:18.840> and<00:04:19.440> string<00:04:20.160> I

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
of like quantum relativity and string I

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.070 
of like quantum relativity and string I
think<00:04:20.790> there's<00:04:20.970> some<00:04:21.120> chapters<00:04:21.390> missing<00:04:21.900> out

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
think there's some chapters missing out

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.140 
think there's some chapters missing out
of<00:04:22.140> that<00:04:22.229> book<00:04:22.470> dude<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:22.979> on<00:04:23.400> that<00:04:23.520> note<00:04:23.760> I'm

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
of that book dude and on that note I'm

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.540 
of that book dude and on that note I'm
watched<00:04:24.570> NASA's<00:04:25.169> videos<00:04:25.500> and<00:04:25.800> they<00:04:26.190> say<00:04:26.220> that

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
watched NASA's videos and they say that

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.970 
watched NASA's videos and they say that
like<00:04:26.700> an

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
like an

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.890 
like an
Tron<00:04:27.220> star<00:04:27.520> is<00:04:27.790> like<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.240> size<00:04:28.450> of<00:04:28.600> New<00:04:28.720> York

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
Tron star is like the size of New York

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.830 
Tron star is like the size of New York
and<00:04:29.380> well<00:04:29.680> I<00:04:29.950> imagine<00:04:30.160> a<00:04:30.580> neutron<00:04:30.970> star<00:04:31.000> could

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
and well I imagine a neutron star could

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.690 
and well I imagine a neutron star could
I<00:04:31.870> have<00:04:31.960> some<00:04:32.050> effect<00:04:32.350> on<00:04:32.620> the<00:04:32.740> Sun<00:04:33.040> and

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
I have some effect on the Sun and

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.020 
I have some effect on the Sun and
neutron<00:04:34.300> stars<00:04:34.630> tanning<00:04:35.380> I<00:04:35.590> understand<00:04:36.580> it's

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
neutron stars tanning I understand it's

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.910 
neutron stars tanning I understand it's
all<00:04:37.150> relative<00:04:37.660> I<00:04:37.870> used<00:04:38.110> to<00:04:38.200> fist<00:04:38.470> by<00:04:38.620> a<00:04:38.650> lot

when I was young people would start

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.450 
when I was young people would start
fights<00:04:40.900> with<00:04:40.990> me<00:04:41.200> I<00:04:41.440> guess<00:04:41.860> I'd<00:04:42.040> say<00:04:42.070> dumb

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
fights with me I guess I'd say dumb

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.430 
fights with me I guess I'd say dumb
stuff<00:04:42.490> that<00:04:43.030> made<00:04:43.180> him<00:04:43.300> mad<00:04:43.540> anyway<00:04:44.140> and<00:04:44.410> that
