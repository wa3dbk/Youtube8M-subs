00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
had never heard of SMA and so we knew we

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.199 
had never heard of SMA and so we knew we
were<00:02:12.040> dealing<00:02:12.190> with<00:02:12.370> something<00:02:12.640> very<00:02:12.910> unique

were dealing with something very unique

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.809 
were dealing with something very unique
we<00:02:14.080> just<00:02:14.290> felt<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.160> pulmonary<00:02:15.520> team

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
we just felt that the pulmonary team

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.059 
we just felt that the pulmonary team
which<00:02:16.120> was<00:02:16.330> her<00:02:16.690> number<00:02:16.959> one<00:02:17.110> team<00:02:17.350> and<00:02:17.650> the

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
which was her number one team and the

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.070 
which was her number one team and the
other<00:02:18.220> teams<00:02:18.489> involved<00:02:19.239> could<00:02:19.569> give<00:02:19.840> her<00:02:19.989> the

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
other teams involved could give her the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.800 
other teams involved could give her the
best<00:02:20.230> chance<00:02:20.410> at<00:02:20.739> survival<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.640> so<00:02:22.569> we<00:02:22.690> were

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
best chance at survival and so we were

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.210 
best chance at survival and so we were
willing<00:02:22.989> to<00:02:23.110> try<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.680> they<00:02:23.769> were<00:02:23.830> willing<00:02:24.069> to
