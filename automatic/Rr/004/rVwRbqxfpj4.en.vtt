00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.889
 I have just come from our post office 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.269
 and it's a bit like christmas 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.370
 already on the iaa the company has more 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.800
 if there was a test binoculars promised that 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.349
 neo pro hd gets it if it's in here 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.599
 the sender matches this at four 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.640
 colleagues talk about work quite like 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:27.000
 Now the question is where is the scissors me 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:33.120
 believe that is fast though here 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.989
 on the package so that looks 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.989
 very neat 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.380
 I've never been good at packing 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.010
 filigree can be that it is 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.570
 The upper one looks a bit rough 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.680
 layer 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:55.020
 that was pretty much a lot 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.530
 protection that could really be optic 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.230
 his 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.379
 oh yeah that makes me look outside too 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:09.299
 just move up the garbage 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:13.200
 and now here from the pack the 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.490
 original carton thing out that you 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.799
 really nice from nice blue euro 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.829
 pro hd topic 42 that's exactly what we have 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.469
 ordered an allround glass should it be 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.090
 he also rides for entry 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:31.920
 for the stalking and slight changes 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.020
 make it pretty chic 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.350
 sorted 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.179
 here is a kind of guarantee the card 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.020
 Probably and instructions yes 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:45.359
 that looks good and here everything 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.229
 very very high quality wonderful because of that 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:48.149
 again to the side 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.969
 who now comes the real one 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.549
 probably the binoculars here are the ones 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:55.109
 pack 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.789
 I'm not a tailor that's why I say 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:02:00.779
 Now nothing about the material but 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:02.929
 at least looks very protective and 

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:02.929
 here 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:11.400
 short cloth and there it is quiet that was 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.690
 scarce if they strapped topic anyway 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.840
 Always nice in the rain then do it 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.860

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.120

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.860
 segment of me if there 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.560
 Brand new in the market 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.380

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.780
 scrap lentils incorporated 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.770
 our very good color fidelity and beautiful 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.020
 deliver quality 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.270
 we are curious that the practice test 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.710
 especially in the morning and during the shooting and 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.820
 We'll try that out too 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.380

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.750

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.750
