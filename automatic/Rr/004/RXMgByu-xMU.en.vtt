00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
favorite choice because they offer a

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.060 
favorite choice because they offer a
really<00:01:14.240> good<00:01:14.420> balance<00:01:14.900> among<00:01:15.200> pistols<00:01:15.830> for

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
really good balance among pistols for

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.950 
really good balance among pistols for
example<00:01:16.550> the<00:01:16.640> nine<00:01:16.790> millimeters<00:01:17.360> has<00:01:17.540> really

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
magazine but you like the stopping power

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.250 
magazine but you like the stopping power
while<00:01:22.880> this<00:01:23.180> weapon<00:01:23.630> has<00:01:23.660> a<00:01:23.810> really<00:01:24.140> good

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
while this weapon has a really good

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.530 
while this weapon has a really good
stopping<00:01:24.680> power<00:01:25.010> or<00:01:25.490> something<00:01:26.270> like<00:01:26.390> the

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
stopping power or something like the

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.140

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
kappa rino the 44 Magnum it's really

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.040 
kappa rino the 44 Magnum it's really
high<00:01:29.390> damage<00:01:29.750> but<00:01:30.290> really<00:01:31.220> limited<00:01:32.050> magazine

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
high damage but really limited magazine

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.080 
high damage but really limited magazine
and<00:01:33.290> if<00:01:33.560> you<00:01:33.680> miss<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.040> shot<00:01:34.310> is<00:01:34.610> going<00:01:34.820> to<00:01:34.910> be

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
and if you miss the shot is going to be

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.120 
and if you miss the shot is going to be
really<00:01:35.480> difficult<00:01:35.720> to<00:01:36.260> hit<00:01:36.410> the<00:01:36.590> second<00:01:36.979> one

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
really difficult to hit the second one

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.610 
really difficult to hit the second one
and<00:01:37.520> also<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.090> rounds<00:01:38.390> per<00:01:38.510> minute<00:01:38.690> on<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.140> 44

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.950 
and also the rounds per minute on the 44
Magnum<00:01:39.650> are<00:01:40.220> really<00:01:40.520> slow<00:01:40.790> so<00:01:41.030> you<00:01:41.420> may<00:01:41.780> need

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
Magnum are really slow so you may need

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.200 
Magnum are really slow so you may need
more<00:01:42.229> time<00:01:42.530> to<00:01:42.800> take<00:01:43.010> the<00:01:43.160> shot<00:01:43.430> a<00:01:43.460> really<00:01:44.060> high

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
more time to take the shot a really high

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.420 
more time to take the shot a really high
recoil<00:01:44.780> I<00:01:45.050> don't<00:01:45.590> really<00:01:45.740> like<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.100> kind<00:01:46.370> of

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
recoil I don't really like the kind of

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.790 
recoil I don't really like the kind of
weapon<00:01:46.820> this<00:01:47.060> one<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:47.780> 90<00:01:48.080> 11<00:01:48.440> the<00:01:48.530> keeper

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
weapon this one the 90 11 the keeper

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.219 
weapon this one the 90 11 the keeper
night<00:01:48.979> warrior<00:01:49.400> after<00:01:50.210> offer<00:01:50.420> a<00:01:50.600> really<00:01:51.020> nice

night warrior after offer a really nice

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.180 
night warrior after offer a really nice
balance<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:53.030> only<00:01:53.390> problem<00:01:53.720> I<00:01:54.200> encounter<00:01:55.100> it

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
balance the only problem I encounter it

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.520 
balance the only problem I encounter it
is<00:01:55.760> that<00:01:56.120> you<00:01:56.330> have<00:01:56.360> a<00:01:56.540> really<00:01:56.870> good<00:01:57.020> runs<00:01:57.320> per

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
is that you have a really good runs per

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.080 
is that you have a really good runs per
minute<00:01:57.860> and<00:01:58.070> they<00:01:58.310> recall<00:01:58.670> that<00:01:58.790> you<00:01:58.940> can

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
minute and they recall that you can

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.030 
minute and they recall that you can
manage<00:01:59.330> pretty<00:01:59.720> easily<00:01:59.990> with<00:02:00.229> those<00:02:00.410> pistol

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
manage pretty easily with those pistol

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.340 
manage pretty easily with those pistol
the<00:02:01.550> problem<00:02:01.940> is<00:02:02.060> you<00:02:02.270> have<00:02:02.570> a<00:02:02.810> limited

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
the problem is you have a limited

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.710 
the problem is you have a limited
magazine<00:02:03.920> so<00:02:04.610> you<00:02:04.700> need<00:02:04.970> to<00:02:05.090> be<00:02:05.119> really<00:02:05.540> happy

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
magazine so you need to be really happy

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.870 
magazine so you need to be really happy
that<00:02:06.050> when<00:02:06.229> shooting<00:02:06.440> shooting<00:02:07.430> a<00:02:07.640> really

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
that when shooting shooting a really

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.690 
that when shooting shooting a really
long<00:02:08.060> distance<00:02:08.780> and<00:02:08.989> you<00:02:09.800> can<00:02:09.950> also<00:02:10.100> find<00:02:10.429> the

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
long distance and you can also find the

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.210 
long distance and you can also find the
bigger<00:02:11.090> magazine<00:02:12.080> for<00:02:12.410> this<00:02:12.560> weapon<00:02:12.950> but<00:02:13.100> the

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
bigger magazine for this weapon but the

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.729 
bigger magazine for this weapon but the
problem<00:02:13.580> is<00:02:13.700> finding<00:02:14.120> them<00:02:14.450> I<00:02:14.660> often<00:02:15.350> found

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
problem is finding them I often found

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.080
