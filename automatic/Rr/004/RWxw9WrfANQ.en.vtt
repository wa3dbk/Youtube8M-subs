00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello guys this is one of the videos 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.410
 team collection for your showdown for 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.190
 the date that will appear written in 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.940
 overlay so let's start right away 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.190
 explaining some small rules 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.800
 you have to send me the informed team 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.390
 showdown so open your theme 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.119
 builder do the new team 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.689
 add the pokémon you want to put 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.300
 a pikachu because he likes us 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:34.530
 we put all the various crap things 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.530
 neither the object the skill moves and then 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.480
 finally the statistics 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.820
 ok once you have done this for 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.050
 all of your team members must 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.480
 click on import export team will remain 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.250
 out so obviously much larger 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.129
 of this because he had done two seconds 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.550
 all the data simply 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.219
 copy it all the way down 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.039
 copy and send me what you have 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.070
 copied into a comment by pasting it into 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.840
 whose commentary of events and nothing I 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.340
 I will simply take it from yours 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.760
 comment 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.340
 your team's stuff though 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.409
 the reverse operation I will paste and then 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.570
 save and then yours will come out 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.630
 team and this was really basic 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.729
 because I received comments with writings 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.159
 by hand guys it takes a lot that is 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.040
 I imagine how many hours have been 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.040
 people to write me all the team love 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.040
 given for given don't do it takes two 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.600
 seconds made and copy paste end 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.049
 easy 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.180
 then other little rules I can't 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.220
 choosing all obviously I will choose two 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.590
 or three teams a week 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.659
 try to be original does not propose 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.580
 team themes with pokémon over used 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.100
 very used with seven between used and 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.930
 Hungarian piadina smog one look for maybe 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.049
 to be a bit original with using 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:06.420
 pokémon good or otherwise still gods 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:10.170
 cute set is another thing still me 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.750
 I recommend I don't want this to remain 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.300
 a showdown just between you and me 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.230
 but I would also like it to be among you 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.690
 to you 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.510
 this means you could take 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.060
 considering the teams you send and 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.709
 use them yourself and maybe in the comments 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.600
 write hey hello you know i have 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.330
 used your team the other day is 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.540
 liked too nice seizure and pits 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.489
 therefore an opportunity to grow a 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:41.220
 a community around these by 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:44.280
 video I would like so quiet not 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.980
 I would opt for color preferences 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.610
 I saw that a movie was a lot 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.980
 I always go for a bit of style 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:57.209
 having said that another thing still me 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.850
 I recommend guys don't propose themes 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.120
 other teams if you have already been chosen for 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.040
 at least a month let's face it seriously 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.380
 chosen you propose me other teams me 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.239
 I could even take off forever 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.840
 the right to participate in yours 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.900
 showdown 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.430
 said this one last thing the most part 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.879
 important 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:21.780
 every week I will choose two or three themes 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:24.689
 and those themes will have to be followed for 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.670
 teams propose for the following week 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:28.970
 for example I could say week 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.250
 next I would like 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.400
 of the teams that are part of these 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.520
 two point categories over used or under 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.200
 used or monotype then all teams 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.200
 proposed for the following week 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.800
 they will have to be teams over used or 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.710
 under used or monotype any team that 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.860
 will not follow the theme chosen per week 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:54.230
 later this will simply be ignored 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.720
 to vary a little it is also to put a 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.060
 little more order in what I would like 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.920
 do during the various weeks 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.660
 I will try to find interesting themes ri 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.390
 maybe over time but now let's start 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.340
 with the standard ones and nothing this is 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.970
 all this and a standard video that 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.230
 will be played every week 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.810
 simply by changing some small ones 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.750
 things then listen quietly 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.190
 only the beginning is only the end if there is 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.549
 they bore to tick all over again 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.940
 rest 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:26.169
 well from here the themes of the 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:29.810
 next week superimposed 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.200
 you will find written what I expect from 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.350
 you 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:37.370
 very robotic point ok 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.300
 Let's start two points next week 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:44.920

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:48.960
