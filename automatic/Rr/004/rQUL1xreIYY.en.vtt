let's<00:00:00.900> start<00:00:01.230> with<00:00:01.439> a<00:00:01.500> pre-flight<00:00:02.070> inspection

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
let's start with a pre-flight inspection

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.760 
let's start with a pre-flight inspection
of<00:00:02.970> our<00:00:03.270> aircraft<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:04.110> reason<00:00:04.470> that<00:00:04.500> we're

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
of our aircraft the reason that we're

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.130 
of our aircraft the reason that we're
conducting<00:00:05.130> a<00:00:05.430> pre-flight<00:00:05.930> examination<00:00:06.930> of

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
conducting a pre-flight examination of

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.009 
conducting a pre-flight examination of
the<00:00:07.259> aircraft<00:00:07.649> is<00:00:08.300> that<00:00:09.300> it's<00:00:09.540> not<00:00:09.780> an

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
the aircraft is that it's not an

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.690 
the aircraft is that it's not an
automobiles<00:00:10.650> so<00:00:10.980> we<00:00:11.099> won't<00:00:11.309> be<00:00:11.400> able<00:00:11.519> to

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
automobiles so we won't be able to

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.879 
automobiles so we won't be able to
exactly<00:00:12.090> pull<00:00:12.840> off<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.049> side<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.650> road

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
exactly pull off the side of the road

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.750 
exactly pull off the side of the road
and<00:00:14.340> repair<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.120> broken<00:00:15.299> wire<00:00:15.719> or<00:00:16.490> fix<00:00:17.490> the

we're<00:00:23.340> going<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.550> do<00:00:23.670> is<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.880> pre-flight

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
we're going to do is a pre-flight

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.500 
we're going to do is a pre-flight
inspection<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.800> aircraft<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.460> we<00:00:27.330> want

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
inspection of the aircraft and we want

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.060 
inspection of the aircraft and we want
to<00:00:27.630> check<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:28.019> make<00:00:28.170> sure<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.890> aircraft

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
to check to make sure that the aircraft

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.720 
to check to make sure that the aircraft
is<00:00:29.490> air<00:00:29.699> worthy<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.269> mechanically<00:00:30.960> sound<00:00:31.320> and

is air worthy and mechanically sound and
obviously<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.790> few<00:00:33.120> things<00:00:33.420> like<00:00:33.719> there's<00:00:34.110> air

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
obviously a few things like there's air

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.889 
obviously a few things like there's air
in<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.530> tires<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.160> gas<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.880> tanks<00:00:36.360> when

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
in the tires and gas and the tanks when

which is our control panel here we want
to<00:01:44.759> assure<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.000> our<00:01:45.270> throttle<00:01:45.689> lever

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
to assure that our throttle lever

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.920 
to assure that our throttle lever
