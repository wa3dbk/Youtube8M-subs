checking your tire tread is quick and
easy<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.260> here<00:00:34.620> are<00:00:34.770> three<00:00:35.129> ways<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.400> do<00:00:35.850> it

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
easy and here are three ways to do it

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.720 
easy and here are three ways to do it
first<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:37.170> can<00:00:37.470> check<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.890> tread<00:00:38.190> wear<00:00:38.250> bars

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
first you can check the tread wear bars

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.510 
first you can check the tread wear bars
on<00:00:38.970> your<00:00:39.210> tire<00:00:39.480> these<00:00:40.290> are<00:00:40.590> raised<00:00:40.980> features

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
on your tire these are raised features

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.310 
on your tire these are raised features
located<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.330> the<00:00:42.449> bottom<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.840> tread<00:00:43.140> grooves

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
located on the bottom of tread grooves

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.710 
located on the bottom of tread grooves
and<00:00:43.710> are<00:00:44.309> flat<00:00:44.610> with<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.970> face<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.480> tire

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
and are flat with the face of the tire

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.780 
and are flat with the face of the tire
when<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.290> remaining<00:00:46.769> tread<00:00:47.070> depth<00:00:47.339> is<00:00:47.489> worn

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
when the remaining tread depth is worn

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.970 
when the remaining tread depth is worn
down<00:00:47.850> 2<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.239> 30<00:00:48.629> seconds<00:00:49.019> of<00:00:49.110> an<00:00:49.199> inch<00:00:49.350> so

down 2 to 30 seconds of an inch so

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.040 
down 2 to 30 seconds of an inch so
you'll<00:00:50.280> know<00:00:50.489> when<00:00:50.730> your<00:00:50.850> tire<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.089> bald<00:00:51.510> but
