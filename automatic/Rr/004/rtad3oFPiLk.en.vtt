00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.709
 hello everyone in the facebook whose taylor 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.110
 who speaks to you this is another 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:20.259
 argued is not my gap her all 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:24.610
 the matte earth cells also came 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:27.099
 from a hot hallucinating cheekbone barry tv 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.340
 for the reborn while we are four 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:34.030
 you are always the same even I don't have 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.860
 need a whole year that I mark here 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.930
 beautiful piece of furniture starts with a building you 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:44.440
 then move absurd stuff because it's one 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.750
 new absurd because it calls the mob without 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.559
 no reward so he is better than 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.070
 you this really no this is you have one 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.719
 star 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.730
 This is really really test 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.489
 because even what came first 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.620
 in the top ten episode 12 I think in which 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.890
 fa7 head shot with rss 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.050
 what is this called to the masters in five 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.039
 mass is an open star to the challenge 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.039
 how much of are taken 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.750
 I think he plays on a pizzeria anyway 

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:16.420
 we say that if the peer is reunited with us 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.950
 who is able to play with and I have to 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.619
 tell guys you know the difference 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.729
 it is easier there and there did 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.439
 ass to taylor that politics 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:30.189
 no no no alex but unfortunately I have it 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:32.200
 as soon as ok for a kill is the canvas 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.220
 let's start a few days with the most 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.090
 pure taste to know that I do not even have 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.729
 played is not fair infiltration no 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.490
 anyway you need is a beautiful me 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.590
 He loved it because it has 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.810
 not even from a sky specialist does not have 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.030
 nothing to say mercal over the area of 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.060
 launch because there was nothing though 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.729
 barrett event is doing because it bars 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.520
 thunder shoots him for barletta and doesn't 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.759
 correct bar on the ground but it also goes 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:06.159
 of toma bars never hear that radar scale 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.159
 they are truly perverted to the os 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.730
 however it is the fact that he finishes the shots 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.400
 let's say the bar when it calls fashion 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:21.440
 we have 10 in office we do not know if 12 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.239
 find the 4 to 10 in the ternate loader 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.860
 not correct if it practically means 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.870
 who must must always shoot 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.519
 center understood to call fashion but no 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.340
 really to kill to take them 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.440
 also never understood because he knows no jackal 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.550
 and therefore every shade of cars triple of 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.260
 about a week ago he says ours 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.850
 your license because we will have luck what 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.440
 it is a triple of anyway we remember 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.750
 even to everyone who finally 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.130
 we should ever mp3 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.739
 play with us if we are of course 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.739
 if 24 hours a day 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.440
 I sometimes sleep too 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.300
 clones that already do so on purpose 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.090
 someone who entered my name 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.190
 the investigations are publicly humiliated 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.980
 really only take when there is 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.540
 This computer is what you 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.709
 also makes a good figure that happens 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.390
 but a little on this that I am bullshit 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.620
 anyway I want to say that a reward 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.500
 killing not because he chose him 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.270
 because in the drop zone they are not 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.820
 what I did with the voice of 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:29.060
 crowd hunted relationship are a jerk 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.980
 it's huge, so I'm more chickens 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.050
 also consider that then perhaps its own 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.920
 he said the hen has never passed 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:39.950
 stefano in the subject because where you have to 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.180
 understand that he denies now I have learned to 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:46.310
 raise human police 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.860
 no no no no almost settled on another site 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.420
 where you live past by game case 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.950
 i'm losing tree name days that 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.300
 when he passed me to talk about mom 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.190
 wait for what pasteur has me 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.989
 gameplay to graft told me I don't know 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.420
 if you like it because of the field points 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:02.060
 rom to me no longer seems to have is not 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.590
 bell that is there because there is low giuba 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.510
 let's say up and down at this point but 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.730
 you have to understand that he doesn't know he doesn't either 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.070
 the blows there are those who look who really are 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.320
 difficult to take a mom buildings 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.510
 though not to blows because he must 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.570
 always doing it helps us with our eyes and 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.120
 it is not yet the thing is a little and it is not 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.970
 even if then march here with a 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.610
 neck with sea lights not harward if 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.270
 will want with ep and they were that is what inspiration 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:32.600
 more messy file but now it really is 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.330
 there is a great sense in never dying 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.250
 but it's always hit me six strokes a 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.600
 last 6 things anyway you were right 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.010
 is true if in the launch area 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.060
 then gently with three cases 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.130
 can of 0 1 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.810
 it is true then he would have cashed office 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.990
 all stupid caesar sees that you have not 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.910
 a fit and budget area and therefore not 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.440
 you are compensated you learned why 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.510
 I had already played a few times zone of 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.400
 I don't think there were any throws 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:59.480
 what the fuck that the king as a lever on 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:02.390
 name the cupcake however precision 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:05.870
 girls always the same questions asked 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.760
 many as loaded as you upload clips 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.770
 the clips is always the one in the 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:16.840
 description maybe find a nice one 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:19.700
 first time but in short it is unpleasant and 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.950
 I reply at all to 20 different people 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.590
 every time the same question is true 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.660
 godfather however it is very simple where 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.110
 back on the site there are guides 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:32.900
 where you can learn to load if you are 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:36.440
 are the people there are guides like 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.060
 feeling guide where you explain how it is but 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.640
 then the fact that they ask is never dared 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.500
 on consoles but very good are you 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:50.630
 guides also to load from console from 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:53.410
 playstation 3 xbox from dianne or pass 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:56.570
 that thousand euros for console products 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.670
 senes console and pc obviously put the 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:01.490
 difference also does not exist as 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.830
 consultant from pietro is something else 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.050
 do not know yet I did not understand is not that 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.640
 you have to load on the site can 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.620
 if you have a youtube channel ce 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.630
 you have it on your youtube channel a 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.610
 the exact link has been copied ie 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.470
 enough about the Syria site you can 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.000
 choose to upload the file it sees 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.490
 directly into the computer or in vivo 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.860
 only where you have it or link 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:25.370
 cement them to the link if you link 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.960
 we will read calls her from woodwind po 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.270
 strange anyway you can put the 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.890
 your video link is then another case 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.920
 to tell us to pass on 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:36.620
 canal of genius because of the masters 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.510
 which in addition to passing me clips absurd for 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.880
 the top ten often decentralized him into the 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.940
 really hallucinating concrete top ten 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:46.380
 we reiterate it is alien 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:48.970
 eh no 66 years is however alien they had to 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.160
 though and then when I'm trying on sight 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:59.170
 he moves like a slut but how the fuck he did 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:07:01.540
 really so oh well I almost certain that 

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:03.370
 in reality I do not put it own port 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:06.160
 other things like it's the most talented 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.690
 because the comment we don't say anymore 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.160
 nothing we don't really say not there 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.830
 we do there if we no longer blaspheme a 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.510
 ie more is not committed well 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:16.000
 the commentary flows , I cut the audio 

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.500
 I assure you that I cut the audio 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 because they come out of those things that 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.160
 we almost come close to love 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.140
 I would have put them but you can't that is not 

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.600
 I would never catch me but reports 

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.460
 vip then they are not yes because we have said 

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.810
 and let's put it to the beat no no it would be everything 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.350
 a whole lot different would be deed would be 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:33.490
 all another intention carefully 

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:37.680
 seegarten do not waste to blame the 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:41.110
 who looks great applause to this 4 

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:43.240
 michael barrett without rewards counts 

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:45.580
 but that the call c4 doing practically 

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.070
 a percentage and precision of 100 per 

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:50.530
 a hundred and something absurd a beautiful one 

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:52.690
 events that flat mob also kills the 

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:55.330
 hammers because he's on the right cock 

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:56.440
 he has a lot of balls he has done 

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:00.700
 really burst all this year 

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:02.800
 lower one with barrett and without 

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.930
 reward arrived at the emblem is over 

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.790
 if you defined them b2 series liked it 

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:08.050
 click on the continuous squares writes 

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.780
 another channel to do must say something 

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:13.300
 we give and greet the friends of udine in 

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:17.520
 course of one because we are all 

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.520
 Friulians hello to everyone from staff
