00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.300 
remember if I mentioned it bring the rat
of<00:02:03.330> the<00:02:03.420> water<00:02:03.660> just<00:02:04.200> even<00:02:04.650> with<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.920> top<00:02:05.130> of

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
of the water just even with the top of

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.920 
of the water just even with the top of
the<00:02:05.340> rice<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.790> don't<00:02:05.970> want<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.210> overdo<00:02:06.780> it

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
the rice you don't want to overdo it

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.830 
the rice you don't want to overdo it
because<00:02:07.200> then<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.740> becomes<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.630> end<00:02:09.690> up

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
because then it becomes it you end up

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.620 
because then it becomes it you end up
with<00:02:09.959> too<00:02:10.050> much<00:02:10.170> liquid<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.590> there<00:02:11.420> and<00:02:12.420> that

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
with too much liquid in there and that

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.980 
with too much liquid in there and that
is<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:13.020> microwave<00:02:13.970> Uncle<00:02:14.970> Ben's<00:02:15.150> but<00:02:15.900> it

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
is the microwave Uncle Ben's but it

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.210 
is the microwave Uncle Ben's but it
doesn't<00:02:16.230> taste<00:02:16.350> as<00:02:16.470> good<00:02:16.530> in<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.830> microwave

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
doesn't taste as good in the microwave

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.190 
doesn't taste as good in the microwave
so<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:17.910> suggest<00:02:18.510> doing<00:02:18.570> it<00:02:18.840> this<00:02:18.930> way<00:02:18.990> it

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
so I suggest doing it this way it

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.110
