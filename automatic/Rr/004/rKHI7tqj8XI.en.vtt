00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.990
 plus an official apple store here at 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.389
 brazil also has the possibility of 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.980
 have a paid version of YouTube and 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.890
 other highlights 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.890
 Then stay connected, lady, stay. 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.890
 updated 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.840
 apple will inaugurate its first 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.880
 store in São Paulo, the second in Brazil in the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.439
 next April 18th 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.630
 the company did not reveal many details 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.390
 but the store will open at the mall 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.610
 morumbi and should follow the same pattern of 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.250
 all apple stores around the world to 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.190
 expectation that some models of the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.829
 lot are on display at the inauguration 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.690
 this store there is not yet a date for 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.110
 smart watch sales start 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.860
 here with information from the site g1 and 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.969
 rafael fischmann to macmagazine site 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.550
 we commented on the possibility 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.910
 of an apple hote to be displayed in this store 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.680
 in são paulo and the international press 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.049
 seems to be dividing in relation to 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.570
 to this device the épo hote is already sold 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.240
 stores in the United States and some 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.460
 vehicles already have reviews of it seems to me 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.950
 that it has a consensus that it is 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.140
 the best smart watch ever released 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.390
 our opinions differ so far 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.119
 when it comes to the real utility of 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.520
 gadget yahoo for example say you 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.610
 do not need a great apple blumberg 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.189
 states that he is pretty cool powerful and 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.200
 easy to use only that is not essential 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.850
 already said that it is a product for 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.460
 those who like to have something in the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.680
 launch and yet considered 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.900
 incomplete apple hotel 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.579
 Let's follow today's video with 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.579
 news that youtube will have a 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.369
 paid version and no ads brian eno o 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.439
 mec lucas it rains the site bloomberg affirmed 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.420
 that the subscription will cost 10 dollars 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.979
 monthly this converted into reais 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.100
 currently gives thirty-two reais 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.200
 but this value may be different and then the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.020
 subscriber can enjoy video without any 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.540
 The announcement may be that offline access on 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.240
 tablets and smartphones of playlists 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.619
 saved is also a function included 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.810
 for subscribers 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.459
 the launch of this signature has not yet 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.630
 It can happen in the next 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.870
 months 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.480
 by the end of 2015 content creators 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.880
 will have to accept new terms of use 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.710
 but will receive 55 percent of revenue 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.240
 generated by signatures 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.640
 only the value that a creator of 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.380
 content you will receive will depend on the 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.600
 time that subscribers spend 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.270
 watching videos on the channel 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.850
 now let's talk about the charm manufacturer 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.890
 Chinese is arriving in Brazil and one of the 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.080
 the company's top-of-the-line 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.290
 cost one thousand and four hundred reais here 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.050
 br.youtube.com site is being 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.810
 prepared for the launch of mp4 and 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.480
 it looks like they missed this page 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.340
 the value of the apparatus that would be thousand 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.290
 three hundred and ninety-nine reais and 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.200
 ninety-nine cents to be more 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.770
 exact price is attractive because I am 4 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.530
 has snapdragon processor 801 screen of 5 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.290
 inch and 3 GB of RAM 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.780
 only the page was removed from the air 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.870
 sharp said it was a test and 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.630
 that the values are not definitive 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.570
 we still have more highlights in the video of 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.300
 today as gta 5 and will be released 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.370
 finally for pcs on April 14th 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.870
 but already gives to find a version 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.820
 pirate out there 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.300
 look this is a big download around 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:33.360
 of 60 giga and it is worth remembering that 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.160
 cases there is always a 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.200
 downloads have malicious files 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.150
 viruses etc. 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.209
 it was like this is a very very play 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.890
 expected it can be used as bait 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.170
 to spread malware 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.110
 So you have to think about whether it's worth it. 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.140
 make a gigantic download and then 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.180
 I'll chip in and we'll finish the video. 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.800
 today with a curiosity 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.100
 knows why the letter c is usually 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.800
 associated with the computer's main hpv 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:05.490
 Look, it's only a short story. 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.709
 the following there in the 1960s the 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.630
 ibm system began with the idea of 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.470
 identify storage drives with 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.530
 letters 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.600
 there in the 1980s, Microsoft 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.989
 acquired a license to create a 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.780
 system based on that of IBM was 86 C's 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.230
 computers became popular 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.490
 but the first of it 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.760
 had no storage options 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.730
 internal who will be expensive at the time they 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.430
 had a floppy disk drive of 5.25 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.950
 inches that were labeled as drive 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.570
 but the fact is that some machines 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.450
 they had two drives 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.090
 then they used the letter b when 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.860
 3-inch and 6- inch floppy disk 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.890
 shall be included in the 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.830
 computers left the letters a and b 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:54.070
 to the floppy disks and there they picked up the letter c 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.290
 to the hard drive and that's it this was 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.910
