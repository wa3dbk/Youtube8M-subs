 we need chicken breast fillet 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.610
 butterschmalz the energy namely 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.010
 The substitute could also be quite normal 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.839

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.750
 I forgot here now 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.320
 onion and garlic cloves become small 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.640
 honed and ginger, too 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.000

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.649
 become 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.030
 and here's a little trick for you 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.429
 he thinks he does that with the 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.520
 That's a lot with a spoon 

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:12.520
 easier 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:16.160
 The spoon does not have to be anyhow 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.740
 be particularly sharp 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.970
 the skin can be removed from the ginger 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.890
 excellently remove yourself from these 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.640
 rundungen bulges on the in may 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.640
 some job has 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.210
 then also cut this small 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.450
 the washed and dry docked 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.440
 Chicken breast fillet now longitudinally and transversely in 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.440
 cut bite-sized pieces 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.619
 from the washed and dry 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:54.200
 shaken coriander play the 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:57.070
 pluck leaves and only the 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.070
 roughly chop walnuts 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.070
 so that's the preparation 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.190
 necessary for the tasks already 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.909
 filled in a pan that 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.909
 heat butterfloss 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:19.040
 and the meat money to give these 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:21.170
 and stir-fry salt and stir 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.910
 about five minutes in Austria easily 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.090
 this is tanned from the pan 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.090
 to take 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:33.140
 dripping into the onions to always 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.990
 and the finely chopped garlic clove 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.970
 pour in and everything else the 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:45.990
 spices add coriander curry 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:49.730
 cayenne and turmeric are all beautiful 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:53.840
 sweat and stir but and 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.840
 Add the meat again 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.400
 Now with about 100 milliliters of water 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:06.450
 Deglaze and everything for about five 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.489
 then simmer for a few minutes 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.500
 Take hot plate and yogurt 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.160
 stir in 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:17.459
 the curry is no longer bought 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:23.400
 the hunted walnuts also give it over 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:26.220
 Liberias perform everything thoroughly and 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.670
 so that 's our curry we charge 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.290
 can serve so 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.110
 and, as I said, it fits naturally 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.120
 great as a garnish and for 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.280
 rounding off the taste of the rip- off 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.989
 give calendar sheets about it and then 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.910
 can be eaten i wish you 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.299

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.299
 Enjoy your meal 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.080
 and who likes poultry curry though 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.300
 maybe a completely different variant 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.190
 I want to try this 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.870
 South African turkeys recommend curry 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.970
 and very different again and again 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.970
 Mexican touch are the chickens 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.900

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.700
