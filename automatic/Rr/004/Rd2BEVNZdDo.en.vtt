00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.690 

so<00:00:00.390> in<00:00:00.510> this<00:00:00.659> module<00:00:00.900> as<00:00:01.439> we<00:00:01.979> said<00:00:02.310> we're<00:00:02.550> going

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
so in this module as we said we're going

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.430 
so in this module as we said we're going
to<00:00:02.760> look<00:00:02.909> at<00:00:03.030> some<00:00:03.210> fundamental<00:00:03.810> concepts

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
to look at some fundamental concepts

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.010 
to look at some fundamental concepts
that<00:00:04.710> underlie<00:00:05.160> embedded<00:00:05.910> systems<00:00:06.420> but

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
that underlie embedded systems but

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.709 
that underlie embedded systems but
before<00:00:07.410> we<00:00:07.529> get<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:08.510> components<00:00:09.510> of<00:00:09.570> an

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
before we get to components of an

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.660 
before we get to components of an
embedded<00:00:10.019> system<00:00:10.290> we<00:00:11.070> want<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.340> get<00:00:11.460> some

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
embedded system we want to get some

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.839 
embedded system we want to get some
basics<00:00:12.150> out<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.480> way<00:00:12.620> the<00:00:13.849> first

basics out of the way the first
important<00:00:15.420> concept<00:00:15.960> we<00:00:16.199> are<00:00:16.289> going<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.529> look

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
important concept we are going to look

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.200 
important concept we are going to look
at<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:17.100> number<00:00:18.000> systems<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.939> all

position has a place value that is when

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.170 
position has a place value that is when
I<00:01:07.080> say<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:08.460> our<00:01:08.790> number<00:01:09.710> number<00:01:10.710> of

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
I say that I have our number number of

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.600 
I say that I have our number number of
five<00:01:12.180> digit<00:01:12.570> number<00:01:12.600> each<00:01:13.500> digit<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.549> a

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
five digit number each digit is a

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.640 
five digit number each digit is a
position<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:15.960> opposite<00:01:16.530> each<00:01:16.710> position<00:01:17.250> has<00:01:17.520> a

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
position so opposite each position has a

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.499 
position so opposite each position has a
place<00:01:19.650> value

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.149 

and<00:01:23.219> the<00:01:24.219> value<00:01:25.500> attributed<00:01:26.500> to<00:01:26.619> each<00:01:26.799> place

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
and the value attributed to each place

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:40.420 
and the value attributed to each place
is<00:01:27.430> a<00:01:28.090> power<00:01:29.049> of<00:01:29.439> 10<00:01:30.570> which<00:01:31.570> is<00:01:31.929> a<00:01:33.509> power<00:01:34.509> of

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.859 

then

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.130 

the<00:01:44.710> second<00:01:45.130> characteristic<00:01:46.000> of<00:01:46.509> any<00:01:46.750> number

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
the second characteristic of any number

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.100 
the second characteristic of any number
system<00:01:47.560> is<00:01:47.710> what<00:01:48.520> are<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.759> valid<00:01:49.000> values<00:01:49.240> that

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
system is what are the valid values that

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.020 
system is what are the valid values that
is<00:01:50.290> when<00:01:51.009> we<00:01:51.189> the<00:01:51.490> valued<00:01:52.390> values<00:01:52.810> are<00:01:53.020> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
is when we the valued values are the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.889 
is when we the valued values are the
coefficients<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.869> case<00:01:59.110> of<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:01.270> base<00:02:01.479> 10

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
coefficients in the case of the base 10

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:10.729 
coefficients in the case of the base 10
system<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.729> valued<00:02:04.030> values<00:02:04.479> are<00:02:05.490> 0<00:02:06.490> 1<00:02:07.149> 2<00:02:07.960> 3<00:02:08.759> 4<00:02:09.759> 5

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
system the valued values are 0 1 2 3 4 5

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:22.410 
system the valued values are 0 1 2 3 4 5
6<00:02:11.739> 7<00:02:12.670> 8<00:02:13.209> and<00:02:13.660> 9<00:02:17.610> so<00:02:18.610> for<00:02:19.150> example<00:02:20.250> when<00:02:21.250> I<00:02:21.420> look

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
6 7 8 and 9 so for example when I look

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.979 
6 7 8 and 9 so for example when I look
at<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.569> number<00:02:23.400> like<00:02:24.400> 4<00:02:24.910> 7<00:02:25.510> 2<00:02:26.049> 3<00:02:26.080> in<00:02:26.799> base<00:02:27.790> 10<00:02:28.540> so

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
at a number like 4 7 2 3 in base 10 so

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.789 
at a number like 4 7 2 3 in base 10 so
we<00:02:29.170> do<00:02:29.860> a<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:31.090> represent<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.840> number<00:02:32.019> in<00:02:32.260> base<00:02:32.440> 10

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
we do a to represent a number in base 10

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.160 
we do a to represent a number in base 10
we<00:02:32.980> simply<00:02:33.340> write<00:02:33.489> it<00:02:33.730> this<00:02:33.880> way<00:02:34.120> we<00:02:34.810> say<00:02:34.989> that

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
we simply write it this way we say that

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.120 
we simply write it this way we say that
this<00:02:35.260> number<00:02:35.470> represents<00:02:36.569> 4<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:38.620> each<00:02:39.099> of

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
this number represents 4 so each of

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.479 
this number represents 4 so each of
these<00:02:39.400> positions<00:02:39.670> so<00:02:40.120> we<00:02:40.150> have<00:02:40.390> 4<00:02:40.890> 7<00:02:41.910> 2<00:02:42.910> &amp;<00:02:43.120> 3<00:02:43.410> &amp;<00:02:44.410> 3

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
these positions so we have 4 7 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 3

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:51.030 
these positions so we have 4 7 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 3
has<00:02:45.489> a<00:02:45.700> place<00:02:46.480> value<00:02:46.959> which<00:02:47.080> is<00:02:47.260> 10<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.700> 0<00:02:50.040> 2

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
has a place value which is 10 to the 0 2

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.449 
has a place value which is 10 to the 0 2
has<00:02:51.280> a<00:02:51.310> place<00:02:51.640> value<00:02:51.880> which<00:02:52.299> is<00:02:52.420> 10<00:02:52.660> to<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.959> 1<00:02:53.470> 7

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
has a place value which is 10 to the 1 7

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.000 
has a place value which is 10 to the 1 7
has<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.820> place<00:02:55.209> value<00:02:55.660> which<00:02:55.780> is<00:02:55.959> 10<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.320> 2<00:02:56.739> &amp;

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
has a place value which is 10 to the 2 &amp;

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.030 
has a place value which is 10 to the 2 &amp;
4<00:02:57.730> has<00:02:58.000> a<00:02:58.030> place<00:02:58.390> value<00:02:58.870> which<00:02:58.959> is<00:02:59.140> 10<00:02:59.350> to<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.650> 3

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
4 has a place value which is 10 to the 3

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.960 
4 has a place value which is 10 to the 3
so<00:03:00.850> when<00:03:01.450> we<00:03:01.600> add<00:03:01.810> these<00:03:02.140> together<00:03:02.470> we<00:03:03.459> get<00:03:03.700> the

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
so when we add these together we get the

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:14.340 
so when we add these together we get the
number<00:03:04.750> so<00:03:04.989> which<00:03:05.200> is<00:03:10.980> 4720<00:03:11.980> +<00:03:12.280> 3<00:03:13.239> so<00:03:14.049> this

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
number so which is 4720 + 3 so this

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.250 
number so which is 4720 + 3 so this
number<00:03:14.530> represents<00:03:15.280> 4<00:03:15.549> 7<00:03:16.060> 2<00:03:16.569> 3

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
number represents 4 7 2 3

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:27.170 
number represents 4 7 2 3
in<00:03:17.739> base<00:03:18.209> 10

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.449 

so<00:03:28.180> let's<00:03:28.719> take<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:28.959> look<00:03:29.170> at<00:03:29.409> the<00:03:30.040> binary

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
so let's take a look at the binary

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.179 
so let's take a look at the binary
number<00:03:30.879> system<00:03:31.739> which<00:03:32.739> is<00:03:33.069> a<00:03:33.510> base<00:03:34.709> to<00:03:35.709> number

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:36.189 
number system which is a base to number

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:42.570 
number system which is a base to number
system

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.390 

so<00:03:43.540> again<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.470> first<00:03:44.710> thing<00:03:44.980> is<00:03:45.330> we<00:03:46.330> have

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
so again the first thing is we have

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:54.620 
so again the first thing is we have
place<00:03:48.400> values<00:03:48.880> which<00:03:49.060> are<00:03:49.180> powers<00:03:49.690> of<00:03:51.420> two<00:03:52.650> and

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
place values which are powers of two and

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:01.080 
place values which are powers of two and
the<00:03:55.630> valid<00:03:56.080> values

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:14.520 

ah<00:04:02.190> zero<00:04:03.190> and<00:04:03.810> one

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.840 

so<00:04:15.100> for<00:04:15.460> example<00:04:15.550> then<00:04:17.100> if<00:04:18.100> I'm<00:04:18.340> given<00:04:18.760> a

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
so for example then if I'm given a

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:29.640 
so for example then if I'm given a
number<00:04:21.150> 1<00:04:22.150> 1<00:04:22.690> 0<00:04:23.590> 1<00:04:23.860> to<00:04:24.670> the<00:04:24.790> base<00:04:25.230> 2<00:04:26.230> so<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:28.960> number

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
number 1 1 0 1 to the base 2 so a number

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.700 
number 1 1 0 1 to the base 2 so a number
1<00:04:30.490> 1<00:04:30.760> 0<00:04:31.210> 1<00:04:31.240> to<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:31.750> base<00:04:31.900> 2<00:04:32.640> represents<00:04:33.640> the

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
1 1 0 1 to the base 2 represents the

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.860 
1 1 0 1 to the base 2 represents the
coefficients<00:04:35.710> 1<00:04:36.120> 0<00:04:37.120> 1<00:04:37.990> and<00:04:38.320> 1<00:04:39.070> and<00:04:39.430> this<00:04:40.180> one

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
coefficients 1 0 1 and 1 and this one

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.890 
coefficients 1 0 1 and 1 and this one
has<00:04:41.110> a<00:04:41.140> place<00:04:41.500> value<00:04:42.010> of<00:04:42.190> 2<00:04:42.400> to<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:42.610> 0<00:04:43.060> this<00:04:43.750> 0

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
has a place value of 2 to the 0 this 0

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.920 
has a place value of 2 to the 0 this 0
has<00:04:44.380> a<00:04:44.410> place<00:04:44.710> value<00:04:44.950> of<00:04:45.190> 2<00:04:45.340> to<00:04:45.370> the<00:04:45.490> 1<00:04:45.850> this<00:04:46.630> one

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
has a place value of 2 to the 1 this one

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.880 
has a place value of 2 to the 1 this one
has<00:04:47.169> a<00:04:47.200> place<00:04:47.560> value<00:04:48.010> of<00:04:48.040> 2<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:48.520> 2<00:04:48.790> and<00:04:49.090> this

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
has a place value of 2 to the 2 and this

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.490 
has a place value of 2 to the 2 and this
one<00:04:50.890> has<00:04:51.160> a<00:04:51.190> place<00:04:51.520> value<00:04:51.940> of<00:04:52.060> 2<00:04:52.270> to<00:04:52.390> the<00:04:52.419> 3<00:04:52.780> so<00:04:53.470> I

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
one has a place value of 2 to the 3 so I

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.409 
one has a place value of 2 to the 3 so I
add<00:04:53.980> them<00:04:54.220> up<00:04:54.400> I<00:04:54.790> get<00:04:55.210> an<00:04:55.330> 8<00:04:55.680> plus<00:04:56.680> of<00:04:56.890> 4<00:04:57.419> plus

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
add them up I get an 8 plus of 4 plus

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.659 
add them up I get an 8 plus of 4 plus
that's<00:04:58.690> a<00:04:58.900> 0<00:04:59.350> times<00:04:59.650> 2<00:04:59.950> to<00:05:00.070> the<00:05:00.100> 1<00:05:00.340> that's<00:05:00.490> 0

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
that's a 0 times 2 to the 1 that's 0

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:09.690 
that's a 0 times 2 to the 1 that's 0
plus<00:05:01.300> 1<00:05:01.600> which<00:05:02.410> is<00:05:02.740> a<00:05:04.020> 13<00:05:05.020> in<00:05:05.470> base<00:05:06.600> 10<00:05:08.580> so<00:05:09.580> now

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
plus 1 which is a 13 in base 10 so now

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.450 
plus 1 which is a 13 in base 10 so now
that<00:05:09.760> we<00:05:10.000> understand<00:05:10.630> how<00:05:10.930> a<00:05:11.320> base<00:05:11.680> 2<00:05:12.010> system

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
that we understand how a base 2 system

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.010 
that we understand how a base 2 system
works<00:05:12.730> and<00:05:12.940> how<00:05:13.330> a<00:05:13.630> base<00:05:14.730> 10<00:05:15.730> system<00:05:15.970> works<00:05:16.480> we

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
works and how a base 10 system works we

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.440 
works and how a base 10 system works we
can<00:05:17.140> actually<00:05:17.500> generalize<00:05:17.860> this<00:05:18.340> to<00:05:18.640> any<00:05:19.030> base

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
can actually generalize this to any base

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:25.969 
can actually generalize this to any base
for<00:05:20.050> example<00:05:20.110> if<00:05:20.740> I<00:05:20.890> look<00:05:21.130> at<00:05:21.640> a<00:05:21.669> base<00:05:22.000> n<00:05:22.240> system

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:33.350 

if<00:05:26.979> I<00:05:27.130> look<00:05:27.310> at<00:05:27.430> a<00:05:27.460> base<00:05:27.729> n<00:05:28.110> system<00:05:29.110> where<00:05:30.930> my

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
if I look at a base n system where my

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.530 
if I look at a base n system where my
it's<00:05:34.360> n<00:05:34.750> can<00:05:35.050> be<00:05:35.080> the<00:05:35.350> 2<00:05:35.620> or<00:05:35.919> 10<00:05:36.640> in<00:05:36.940> this<00:05:37.210> case

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 
it's n can be the 2 or 10 in this case

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.770 
it's n can be the 2 or 10 in this case
then<00:05:38.290> the<00:05:38.770> valid<00:05:39.250> values<00:05:39.820> are<00:05:40.210> going<00:05:40.630> to<00:05:40.720> be

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
then the valid values are going to be

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.350 
then the valid values are going to be
from<00:05:41.229> 0<00:05:41.740> 1<00:05:42.610> 2<00:05:43.510> all<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:44.260> way<00:05:44.350> up<00:05:44.560> to<00:05:44.950> n<00:05:45.160> minus<00:05:46.120> 1

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
from 0 1 2 all the way up to n minus 1

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.860 
from 0 1 2 all the way up to n minus 1
so<00:05:46.840> for<00:05:47.380> example<00:05:47.860> here<00:05:48.250> it's<00:05:48.490> 10<00:05:49.180> minus<00:05:49.630> 1

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
so for example here it's 10 minus 1

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.610 
so for example here it's 10 minus 1
which<00:05:50.110> is<00:05:50.229> 9<00:05:50.500> here<00:05:51.310> it<00:05:51.490> is<00:05:51.750> 2<00:05:52.750> minus<00:05:52.960> 1<00:05:53.320> which<00:05:53.560> is

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
which is 9 here it is 2 minus 1 which is

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.760 
which is 9 here it is 2 minus 1 which is
1<00:05:53.950> so<00:05:55.020> as<00:05:56.020> we<00:05:56.440> as<00:05:57.130> we<00:05:57.270> move<00:05:58.270> on<00:05:58.510> any<00:05:58.810> base<00:05:59.229> system

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
1 so as we as we move on any base system

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.450 
1 so as we as we move on any base system
can<00:06:00.010> be<00:06:00.160> easily<00:06:01.560> deciphered<00:06:02.560> based<00:06:03.190> on

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
can be easily deciphered based on

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.150 
can be easily deciphered based on
understanding<00:06:04.030> what<00:06:04.090> the<00:06:04.330> what<00:06:04.930> the

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
understanding what the what the

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:12.630 
understanding what the what the
coefficients<00:06:06.160> are<00:06:06.340> and<00:06:07.590> what<00:06:08.590> the<00:06:09.270> base<00:06:10.270> is
