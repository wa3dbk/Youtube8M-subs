herself in today I know that my

loving but at the same time I have to

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:05.249 
loving but at the same time I have to
wonder<00:02:03.729> if<00:02:03.909> maybe<00:02:04.119> her<00:02:04.359> doctors<00:02:04.749> never<00:02:05.049> took

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
wonder if maybe her doctors never took

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.989 
wonder if maybe her doctors never took
the<00:02:05.439> time<00:02:05.469> to<00:02:05.920> explain<00:02:05.950> to<00:02:06.429> her<00:02:06.549> all<00:02:06.759> of<00:02:06.880> the

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
benefits of a knee replacement maybe

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.670 
benefits of a knee replacement maybe
they<00:02:09.280> didn't<00:02:09.520> have<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.850> time<00:02:10.000> at<00:02:10.179> all<00:02:10.680> maybe

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
they didn't have the time at all maybe

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.080 
they didn't have the time at all maybe
there's<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:11.980> way<00:02:12.040> doctors<00:02:12.520> can<00:02:12.730> work<00:02:12.880> better

some of the gaps in the quality of

inadequate<00:03:28.790> continuity<00:03:29.690> of<00:03:29.720> care<00:03:29.810> I<00:03:30.730> wish<00:03:31.730> we

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
inadequate continuity of care I wish we

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.130 
inadequate continuity of care I wish we
could<00:03:32.090> build<00:03:32.209> a<00:03:32.360> system<00:03:32.540> that<00:03:32.900> allowed

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
professionals so no one burns out and so

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.880 
professionals so no one burns out and so
they<00:03:38.569> can<00:03:38.630> all<00:03:38.900> stay<00:03:39.140> persistent<00:03:39.350> and

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
they can all stay persistent and

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.610 
they can all stay persistent and
empathetic<00:03:40.690> maybe<00:03:41.690> a<00:03:41.810> system<00:03:42.200> that<00:03:42.350> is<00:03:42.470> built

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
empathetic maybe a system that is built

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.170 
empathetic maybe a system that is built

time or guidance to get the help that
they<00:03:48.380> need<00:03:48.470> it<00:03:49.400> could<00:03:49.580> have<00:03:49.700> different<00:03:50.060> modes

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
they need it could have different modes
