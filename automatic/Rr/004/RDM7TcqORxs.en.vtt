consistent<00:00:56.699> color<00:00:56.850> throughout<00:00:57.590> we're<00:00:58.590> going

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
consistent color throughout we're going

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.270 
consistent color throughout we're going
to<00:00:58.770> go<00:00:58.859> through<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.129> few<00:00:59.280> different<00:00:59.340> wallpapers

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
to go through a few different wallpapers

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.670 
to go through a few different wallpapers
that<00:01:02.280> we've<00:01:02.430> set<00:01:02.699> up<00:01:02.780> to<00:01:03.780> demonstrate<00:01:04.559> the

that we've set up to demonstrate the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.840 
that we've set up to demonstrate the
differences<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.309> colors<00:01:05.610> we've

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
differences in the colors we've

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.660 
differences in the colors we've
calibrated<00:01:06.090> both<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.780> these<00:01:06.900> monitors<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:08.030> be

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
calibrated both of these monitors to be

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.149 
calibrated both of these monitors to be
accurate<00:01:11.670> using<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:13.170> HP<00:01:13.380> my<00:01:13.740> display

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.980 
accurate using the HP my display
software<00:01:14.670> that's<00:01:14.790> included<00:01:15.330> with<00:01:15.360> monitor

software that's included with monitor
here<00:01:18.990> we<00:01:19.140> have<00:01:19.320> just<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.650> gradient<00:01:20.100> from<00:01:20.280> solid

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
here we have just a gradient from solid

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.210 
here we have just a gradient from solid
black<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.240> top<00:01:22.130> to<00:01:23.130> solid<00:01:23.549> white<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:23.939> bottom

black on top to solid white on bottom
again<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.549> 24<00:01:28.369> you<00:01:29.369> can<00:01:29.579> see<00:01:29.850> by<00:01:30.720> my

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
again this is the 24 you can see by my

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.370 
again this is the 24 you can see by my
cursor<00:01:31.350> that's<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.920> top<00:01:32.900> it<00:01:33.900> fades<00:01:34.200> into

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
cursor that's the top it fades into

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.560 
cursor that's the top it fades into
oblivion<00:01:35.040> they're<00:01:35.360> considering<00:01:36.360> we're<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.540> a

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
oblivion they're considering we're in a

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.480 
oblivion they're considering we're in a
dark<00:01:36.780> room<00:01:38.090> it's<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> pretty<00:01:39.329> solid<00:01:39.600> black<00:01:40.490> and

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
dark room it's a pretty solid black and

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.090 
dark room it's a pretty solid black and
then<00:01:41.790> here<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.299> have<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.720> 22<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.740> anilox

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
then here we have the 22 the anilox

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.889 
then here we have the 22 the anilox
panel<00:01:44.600> which<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:46.259> good<00:01:46.649> bit<00:01:46.799> bluer<00:01:47.899> in

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
panel which is a good bit bluer in

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.970 
panel which is a good bit bluer in
comparison

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.230 

you'll<00:01:53.980> skip<00:01:56.010> the<00:01:57.010> next<00:01:57.250> one<00:01:57.580> will<00:01:57.820> go<00:01:57.940> on<00:01:58.060> to

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
you'll skip the next one will go on to

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:07.760 
you'll skip the next one will go on to
the<00:01:58.360> our<00:01:58.450> gpas<00:02:03.480> here<00:02:04.480> we<00:02:04.660> have<00:02:05.820> just<00:02:06.820> an<00:02:06.970> RGB

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
the our gpas here we have just an RGB

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.970 
the our gpas here we have just an RGB
it's<00:02:08.770> going<00:02:08.980> to<00:02:09.010> look<00:02:09.310> like<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:11.440> Samsung

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
it's going to look like the Samsung

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.640 
it's going to look like the Samsung
panel<00:02:12.370> is<00:02:12.520> faded<00:02:13.260> that's<00:02:14.260> because<00:02:14.500> it's

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
panel is faded that's because it's

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.100 
panel is faded that's because it's
blinding<00:02:15.280> my<00:02:15.460> camera<00:02:15.970> it's<00:02:16.420> extremely

solid line I don't know if we can pick
that<00:02:44.080> up<00:02:45.690> yeah<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:47.110> looks<00:02:47.260> about<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.620> same<00:02:47.770> on

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
that up yeah it looks about the same on

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.680 
that up yeah it looks about the same on
both<00:02:47.980> in<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.370> video<00:02:48.580> but<00:02:48.850> there's<00:02:49.270> a<00:02:49.360> major

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
both in the video but there's a major

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.370 
both in the video but there's a major
major<00:02:49.990> difference<00:02:50.530> I<00:02:51.750> can<00:02:52.750> barely<00:02:52.870> stand<00:02:53.260> to

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
major difference I can barely stand to

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.470 
major difference I can barely stand to
look<00:02:53.590> at<00:02:53.710> the<00:02:53.830> red<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:57.130> then<00:02:57.550> this<00:02:58.090> one<00:02:58.150> was

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
look at the red and then this one was

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.340 
look at the red and then this one was
giving<00:02:58.690> us<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.840> little<00:02:58.959> bit<00:02:59.080> more<00:02:59.200> of<00:02:59.290> a

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
giving us a little bit more of a

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.060 
giving us a little bit more of a
dramatic<00:02:59.470> effect<00:03:00.780> this<00:03:01.780> is<00:03:01.959> a<00:03:01.990> gradient<00:03:02.620> from

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
dramatic effect this is a gradient from

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.750 
dramatic effect this is a gradient from
a<00:03:03.220> red<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:03.760> agreeing<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:04.330> a<00:03:04.360> blue<00:03:04.660> and<00:03:05.610> you<00:03:06.610> can

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
a red to agreeing to a blue and you can

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.250 
a red to agreeing to a blue and you can
see<00:03:07.860> possibly<00:03:08.860> hopefully<00:03:09.370> in<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.520> video<00:03:10.260> that

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
see possibly hopefully in the video that

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.580 
see possibly hopefully in the video that
the<00:03:11.590> gradient<00:03:12.580> between<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.420> two<00:03:13.630> colors<00:03:13.930> for

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
the gradient between the two colors for

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.930 
the gradient between the two colors for
the<00:03:14.800> three<00:03:15.040> colors<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.760> two<00:03:15.970> gradients<00:03:16.890> it<00:03:17.940> is

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
the three colors the two gradients it is

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.860 
the three colors the two gradients it is
extremely<00:03:19.360> good<00:03:19.840> on<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.890> Samsung<00:03:21.310> panel

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
extremely good on the Samsung panel

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.870 
extremely good on the Samsung panel
where<00:03:22.870> as<00:03:22.959> it<00:03:23.230> fades<00:03:23.440> to<00:03:23.770> rather<00:03:24.430> between

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
where as it fades to rather between

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.660 
where as it fades to rather between
their<00:03:25.180> being<00:03:25.440> mid<00:03:26.440> shades<00:03:26.800> of<00:03:27.040> red<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:27.280> green

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
their being mid shades of red and green

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.070 
their being mid shades of red and green
and<00:03:28.080> green<00:03:29.080> and<00:03:29.290> blue<00:03:29.500> on<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:31.690> intellects

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
and green and blue on the intellects

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.710 
and green and blue on the intellects
panel<00:03:32.410> it<00:03:32.620> fades<00:03:33.340> to<00:03:33.580> almost<00:03:33.820> a<00:03:34.000> grey<00:03:34.360> in<00:03:34.630> the

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
panel it fades to almost a grey in the

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.340 
panel it fades to almost a grey in the
middle<00:03:34.989> as<00:03:35.760> opposed<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:36.940> whatever<00:03:37.600> I<00:03:38.080> don't

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
middle as opposed to whatever I don't

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:45.170 
middle as opposed to whatever I don't
know<00:03:38.410> if<00:03:38.530> that<00:03:38.680> would<00:03:38.770> be<00:03:38.890> an<00:03:38.950> orange

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.720
