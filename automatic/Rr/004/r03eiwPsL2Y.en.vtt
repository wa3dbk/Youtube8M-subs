00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
works as running out from confinement

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.590 
works as running out from confinement
and<00:00:35.969> them<00:00:36.120> being<00:00:36.360> for<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:38.149> just<00:00:39.149> go<00:00:39.360> wherever

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.180 
they wanted to go there sitting on walls
is<00:00:42.510> if<00:00:42.660> they<00:00:42.870> find<00:00:43.079> like<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> good<00:00:43.620> place<00:00:43.890> to

it seems right this one here it is
inclined<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.259> crunch<00:01:28.610> this<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.790> what<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.060> don't

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
inclined to crunch this is what I don't

inclined to crunch this is what I don't
like<00:01:30.750> about<00:01:31.369> making<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.520> work<00:01:32.729> every<00:01:33.360> month

at this point I don't have the budget
like<00:01:38.789> hire<00:01:39.780> people<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.410> do<00:01:40.679> all<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.100> for<00:01:41.369> me

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.170 

the<00:01:45.940> first<00:01:46.180> high<00:01:46.390> specific<00:01:47.550> mural<00:01:48.550> sculpture

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
the first high specific mural sculpture

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.600 
the first high specific mural sculpture
that<00:01:49.420> I<00:01:49.450> did<00:01:49.840> I<00:01:50.320> made<00:01:50.770> it<00:01:50.920> directly<00:01:51.370> on<00:01:51.580> the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
that I did I made it directly on the

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.060 
that I did I made it directly on the
wall<00:01:51.970> like<00:01:52.330> there<00:01:52.540> was<00:01:52.660> no<00:01:52.900> wood<00:01:53.290> backing<00:01:53.620> so

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
wall like there was no wood backing so

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.160 
wall like there was no wood backing so
at<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.580> end<00:01:54.730> of<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:54.940> show<00:01:55.150> all<00:01:55.390> of<00:01:55.540> those<00:01:55.810> all

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
at the end of the show all of those all

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.770 
at the end of the show all of those all
of<00:01:56.380> that<00:01:56.560> piece<00:01:56.770> it<00:01:56.950> was<00:01:57.040> like<00:01:57.220> 48<00:01:57.940> feet<00:01:58.270> I<00:01:58.600> had

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
of that piece it was like 48 feet I had

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.530 
of that piece it was like 48 feet I had
to<00:01:58.900> throw<00:01:59.080> them<00:01:59.260> out<00:01:59.820> whereas<00:02:00.820> these<00:02:01.060> pieces

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
to throw them out whereas these pieces

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.390 
to throw them out whereas these pieces
now<00:02:01.750> I<00:02:01.780> think<00:02:01.990> about<00:02:02.500> how<00:02:02.650> to<00:02:02.710> make<00:02:02.980> them<00:02:03.190> in<00:02:03.220> a

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
now I think about how to make them in a

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.570 
now I think about how to make them in a
way<00:02:03.520> that<00:02:03.550> I<00:02:03.940> can<00:02:04.210> they<00:02:05.200> can<00:02:05.410> live<00:02:05.830> after<00:02:06.190> the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
way that I can they can live after the

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.139 
way that I can they can live after the
show<00:02:08.010> now<00:02:09.010> I<00:02:09.040> have<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.460> deal<00:02:09.610> with<00:02:09.640> keeping

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
show now I have to deal with keeping

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.420 
show now I have to deal with keeping
back<00:02:11.760> hey<00:02:12.760> good<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.210> see<00:02:13.240> you<00:02:13.890> good<00:02:14.890> morning<00:02:14.920> I

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
back hey good to see you good morning I

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.660 
back hey good to see you good morning I
know<00:02:15.550> I<00:02:15.730> can<00:02:16.030> really<00:02:16.240> we're<00:02:16.450> taking<00:02:16.810> them<00:02:16.990> down

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
know I can really we're taking them down

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.760 
know I can really we're taking them down
so<00:02:21.210> it's<00:02:22.210> obviously<00:02:22.540> sad<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:23.200> take<00:02:23.410> down<00:02:23.620> the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
so it's obviously sad to take down the

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.530 
so it's obviously sad to take down the
pieces<00:02:24.010> from<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.550> place<00:02:24.760> where<00:02:24.790> they<00:02:25.120> look<00:02:25.330> so

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
pieces from a place where they look so

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:38.760 
pieces from a place where they look so
good<00:02:35.460> the<00:02:36.460> works<00:02:36.730> are<00:02:37.030> made<00:02:37.210> out<00:02:37.420> of<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:38.020> window

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
good the works are made out of a window

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.740 
good the works are made out of a window
screen<00:02:38.830> and<00:02:39.310> then<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.520> cover<00:02:39.820> it<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.270> layer<00:02:40.510> it

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
screen and then I cover it and layer it

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.260 
screen and then I cover it and layer it
with<00:02:41.020> um<00:02:41.260> joint<00:02:42.190> compound<00:02:42.850> and<00:02:43.360> glue<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:44.290> and

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
with um joint compound and glue and and

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.940 
with um joint compound and glue and and
polymer<00:02:46.270> to<00:02:46.480> make<00:02:46.630> it<00:02:46.810> harder<00:02:47.320> and<00:02:47.560> then<00:02:47.830> I

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
polymer to make it harder and then I

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.100 
polymer to make it harder and then I
paint<00:02:48.250> on<00:02:48.340> them<00:02:48.520> afterwards<00:02:49.090> those<00:02:49.780> pieces

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
paint on them afterwards those pieces

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.130 
paint on them afterwards those pieces
over<00:02:50.380> there<00:02:50.560> like<00:02:50.920> strong<00:02:51.520> and<00:02:51.989> kind<00:02:52.989> of

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
over there like strong and kind of

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.260 
over there like strong and kind of
sturdy<00:02:53.410> these<00:02:54.220> ones<00:02:54.550> are<00:02:54.760> meant<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.030> be<00:02:55.239> more

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
sturdy these ones are meant to be more

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.540 
sturdy these ones are meant to be more
flexible<00:02:55.690> because<00:02:56.140> they<00:02:56.500> go<00:02:56.680> in<00:02:56.860> between<00:02:56.980> and

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
flexible because they go in between and

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:07.110 
flexible because they go in between and
they<00:02:57.730> create<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.660> illusion<00:02:58.930> of<00:02:59.290> volume

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:18.900 

good<00:03:08.530> perfect

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.430

when<00:04:41.380> we<00:04:41.440> put<00:04:41.770> it<00:04:41.919> up<00:04:42.070> first<00:04:43.139> there<00:04:44.139> were<00:04:44.290> a

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
when we put it up first there were a

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.750 
when we put it up first there were a
couple<00:04:44.560> things<00:04:44.949> that<00:04:45.160> you<00:04:45.250> said<00:04:45.460> would<00:04:45.729> be

couple things that you said would be

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.150 
couple things that you said would be
like<00:04:46.330> would<00:04:46.540> have<00:04:46.660> been<00:04:46.780> easier<00:04:47.229> the<00:04:47.919> best

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
like would have been easier the best

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.909 
like would have been easier the best
thing<00:04:48.460> at<00:04:48.669> this<00:04:48.880> point<00:04:49.150> might<00:04:49.389> be<00:04:49.630> take<00:04:50.290> some

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
thing at this point might be take some

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.040 
thing at this point might be take some
colored<00:04:51.220> tape<00:04:51.430> and<00:04:51.729> try<00:04:51.970> to<00:04:52.030> tape<00:04:52.389> off<00:04:52.600> the<00:04:52.840> set

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
colored tape and try to tape off the set

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.020 
colored tape and try to tape off the set
of<00:04:53.139> periphery<00:04:54.070> so<00:04:54.100> we<00:04:54.370> have<00:04:54.490> like<00:04:54.639> an<00:04:54.729> outline

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
of periphery so we have like an outline

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.879 
of periphery so we have like an outline
mm-hmm<00:04:55.750> I'm<00:04:55.810> just<00:04:55.990> like<00:04:56.169> you<00:04:56.590> know<00:04:56.620> like<00:04:56.740> a

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
mm-hmm I'm just like you know like a

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.300 
mm-hmm I'm just like you know like a
murder<00:04:57.280> scene<00:04:57.370> they<00:04:57.729> do<00:04:57.789> the<00:04:58.000> outline<00:04:59.130> if<00:05:00.130> we

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
murder scene they do the outline if we

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.640 
murder scene they do the outline if we
take<00:05:00.490> the<00:05:00.699> pieces<00:05:00.880> off<00:05:01.210> then<00:05:01.810> we'll<00:05:02.350> have<00:05:02.500> an

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
take the pieces off then we'll have an

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.350 
take the pieces off then we'll have an
outline<00:05:02.919> of<00:05:02.949> what<00:05:03.160> the<00:05:03.250> shape<00:05:03.460> was<00:05:03.789> so<00:05:04.270> we

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
outline of what the shape was so we

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.180 
outline of what the shape was so we
could<00:05:04.479> take<00:05:04.750> a<00:05:04.810> piece<00:05:05.020> of<00:05:05.050> plastic<00:05:05.590> trace<00:05:05.979> the

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
could take a piece of plastic trace the

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.010 
could take a piece of plastic trace the
outline<00:05:06.520> and<00:05:06.699> also<00:05:07.000> trace<00:05:07.270> the<00:05:07.449> positions<00:05:07.870> of

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
outline and also trace the positions of

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.900 
outline and also trace the positions of
the<00:05:08.169> pleats<00:05:08.800> that<00:05:08.919> way<00:05:09.130> you<00:05:09.190> have<00:05:09.400> a<00:05:09.460> template

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
the pleats that way you have a template

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:30.029 
the pleats that way you have a template
and<00:05:10.060> you<00:05:10.120> can<00:05:10.270> install<00:05:10.539> it<00:05:10.750> wherever<00:05:11.260> you<00:05:11.500> want

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:33.100 

we'll<00:05:31.039> put<00:05:31.280> one<00:05:31.580> ladder<00:05:32.090> here<00:05:32.419> one<00:05:32.690> there

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
we'll put one ladder here one there

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.110 
we'll put one ladder here one there
we'll<00:05:33.889> hold<00:05:34.130> it<00:05:34.280> up<00:05:34.430> and<00:05:34.669> then<00:05:34.819> we'll<00:05:34.880> see

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
we'll hold it up and then we'll see

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:44.050 
we'll hold it up and then we'll see
exactly<00:05:35.419> where<00:05:35.810> you<00:05:36.020> want<00:05:36.259> it<00:05:42.610> it<00:05:43.610> just<00:05:43.819> looks

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
exactly where you want it it just looks
