recommend<00:00:17.279> setting<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.699> shutter<00:00:17.970> priority

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
recommend setting the shutter priority

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.440 
recommend setting the shutter priority
mode<00:00:18.570> instead<00:00:19.140> in<00:00:20.130> which<00:00:20.340> case<00:00:20.610> you<00:00:21.180> want<00:00:21.360> to

give you control over things like ISO

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.760

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
and white balance to do that I would

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.170 
and white balance to do that I would
recommend<00:00:56.190> setting<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.670> shutter<00:00:56.969> priority

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
recommend setting the shutter priority

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.080 
recommend setting the shutter priority
mode<00:00:57.540> instead<00:00:58.340> go<00:00:59.340> ahead<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.670> turn<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.910> mode

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090

what this allows you to do is set an
appropriate<00:01:07.049> shutter<00:01:07.530> speed<00:01:07.859> so<00:01:08.039> that<00:01:08.429> the

will really depend on how fast your

subject is moving you may need to

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.919 
subject is moving you may need to
increase<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.920> even<00:01:26.249> further<00:01:26.600> because<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929 
increase this even further because the

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:29.959 
increase this even further because the
