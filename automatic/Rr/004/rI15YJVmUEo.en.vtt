00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
were walking with problems with like

heel pain shins plans problems like that

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.839 
heel pain shins plans problems like that
on<00:00:25.380> top<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.949> fact<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.189> their<00:00:26.460> shoes<00:00:26.670> are

on top of the fact that their shoes are

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.839 
on top of the fact that their shoes are
uncomfortable<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:28.170> orthotics<00:00:29.010> can<00:00:29.220> solve<00:00:29.609> a

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
uncomfortable so orthotics can solve a

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.970 
uncomfortable so orthotics can solve a
lot<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:30.060> foot<00:00:30.359> problems<00:00:30.869> but<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.439> problem<00:00:31.800> was

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
lot of foot problems but the problem was

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.889 
lot of foot problems but the problem was
that<00:00:32.489> when<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:32.969> went<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.329> visit<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.719> lot<00:00:33.840> of

safety shoe companies by the time I got

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.750 
safety shoe companies by the time I got
my<00:00:36.540> orthotic<00:00:36.930> inside<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.710> boot<00:00:37.890> but<00:00:38.550> it

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
my orthotic inside of the boot but it

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.549 
my orthotic inside of the boot but it
was<00:00:38.850> way<00:00:39.090> too<00:00:39.120> tight<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.809> uncomfortable<00:00:39.870> it

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
was way too tight and uncomfortable it

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.889 
was way too tight and uncomfortable it
just<00:00:40.710> didn't<00:00:41.010> work<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.520> then<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.210> finally<00:00:42.600> came

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
just didn't work and then I finally came

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.290 
just didn't work and then I finally came
across<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.230> company<00:00:43.770> called<00:00:43.950> cofre<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.879> I

into the boots but it's the technology
that<00:01:23.369> goes<00:01:23.520> into<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.970> shoes<00:01:24.210> they<00:01:24.990> try<00:01:25.259> to

make the safest possible using the most
modern<00:01:28.320> technology<00:01:28.619> I'll<00:01:29.009> show<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.369> little

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
modern technology I'll show you a little

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.980 
modern technology I'll show you a little
bit<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:31.009> here's<00:01:32.009> an<00:01:32.159> example<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.960> some<00:01:33.960> of

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
bit of that here's an example of some of

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.690 
bit of that here's an example of some of
the<00:01:34.140> technology<00:01:34.710> that's<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.070> cofre<00:01:35.490> shoe

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700

the technology that's in a cofre shoe
first<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.600> all<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.810> outsole<00:01:37.320> on<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> shoes

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
first of all the outsole on the shoes

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.179 
first of all the outsole on the shoes
will<00:01:38.189> stand<00:01:38.869> 572<00:01:39.869> degrees<00:01:39.900> Fahrenheit<00:01:40.890> so

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
will stand 572 degrees Fahrenheit so

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.260 
will stand 572 degrees Fahrenheit so
incredibly<00:01:41.549> high<00:01:42.090> heat<00:01:42.450> resistant<00:01:42.990> shoes<00:01:43.259> and

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
that's some of the technology that goes

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.100 
that's some of the technology that goes
into<00:04:26.020> a<00:04:26.169> cofre<00:04:26.650> shoe<00:04:26.910> and<00:04:27.910> then<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:28.960> other
