00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.910

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.500
 and also the new ones 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.810
 definitely of lamps 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.700
 I took the sandwich crackers 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.470
 cheese and tomato don't even know the 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.990
 cheese version are doing me 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.849
 a scary advertisement of your self 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.170
 thought that with whom of you would have been 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:30.820
 tempted to buy then product 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.760
 then he was sure I say that 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.340
 pack is already 6 and inside 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.420
 contains these six sandwiches 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.190
 priest 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.860
 the thing that intrigued me most was 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.260
 understand if it actually does this extension 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.070
 it was as earthquake as it seemed 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:52.690
 first read the ingredients 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:55.600
 of the stomach that no one is here then 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.710
 in 3d wheat flour vegetable oils 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.870
 non-hydrogenated and non-specific syrup 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.420
 glucose fructose extracted a lot 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.240
 sweet but now agents for the many 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.369
 in Rome then the cream is made up of 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.770
 powdered cheese thanks women 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.960
 non-hydrogenated vegetable tomato 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.210
 dehydrated river friend 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.220
 Trento and Rome produced in one 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.200
 stably also uses solid fruit 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.159
 in new shell I could do it with 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.619
 take us fresh and dry then like 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:31.180
 these oils always disappoint us a little 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:33.100
 let's see the grown-ups a little bit 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.420
 then we all say that another 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:41.290
 news that calories are per serving 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:44.280
 118 calories per 100 grams 517 who knows 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.360
 here is the portion packaging 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.979
 honestly I expected an audience 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.080
 bigger instead rather small 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.289
 month exactly than on the big three 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:01.300
 let's look at it a little bit like an effect 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:03.970
 then already first thing at first glance vi 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:08.500
 I would like to point out the difference between the 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:11.739
 photo and product cheese not 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.640
 overflowing from crackers how to do it 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.940
 see here 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.280
 this thing makes me surprise so I have them 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.130
 seen why they put a picture and then it 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.560
 but they obviously do the other 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.190
 product should always be tasted then 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.070
 the smell is quite intense of tomato 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:34.470
 and the inner compound is worth cutting it by 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:37.330
 see if it's actually creamy 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.510
 cutting it, it crushed I don't know if 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.950
 and is quite creamy I go to 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.950
 to break it and to taste 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:56.050
 then one does not particularly hear the 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.200
 taste of cheese but you can hear a lot 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.470
 intense was in the tomato 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:06.100
 I find it very tasty among a flavor 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.319
 sect type so to speak but a compound 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.600
 as it is actually creamy 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:14.290
 as you can see after that ross 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:17.560
 blinded very well in the mouth not from 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.920
 this feeling of creamy however in 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.590
 reality 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.230
 I find it tastes good then 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.640
 let's go and pull some sun I paid 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:30.069
 the package 2 euros and 50 for this 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.069
 type of product I think is a price 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.630
 on average I would give enough for 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.150
 what concerns the appearance as 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.600
 I'm not always happy to do much 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:45.000
 much to scratch the difference between 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:47.440
 the image is the real mirror then 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.720
 I can't give enough because 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.900
 I don't always like this thing 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.300
 you know it was never while the flavor is me 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.270
 really liked to give a 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.550
 with eight and a half because above all 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.410
 what I love pizza reminds me 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.400
 just this tomato the taste a little 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:11.410
 aromatic of the pizzetta then mine 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:14.140
 general vote for this product is a 7 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.430
 to the step of very much the general vote because 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.090
 as I told you 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.190
 the appearance disappoints me a little, but the taste 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.980
 it is worth trying because as a snack it will be 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.770
 I think this can be fine in the evening 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.300
 review helps everyone and a kiss 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.920
 we see the passion of review 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.730
 Saturday a ridiculous search 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.730
 bye Bye
