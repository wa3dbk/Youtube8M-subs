you<00:01:50.430> switch<00:01:50.970> 8<00:01:51.960> cards<00:01:52.520> or<00:01:53.750> they<00:01:54.750> might<00:01:55.020> let<00:01:55.350> you

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
you switch 8 cards or they might let you

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.960 
you switch 8 cards or they might let you
move<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.320> other<00:01:58.410> person's<00:01:58.830> Bakugan<00:01:59.460> to

move the other person's Bakugan to

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.800 
move the other person's Bakugan to
another<00:02:00.210> gate<00:02:00.479> card<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.050> know<00:02:01.140> battle<00:02:02.810> if

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
another gate card so you know battle if

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.420 
another gate card so you know battle if
like<00:02:04.170> that's<00:02:04.410> the<00:02:04.590> last<00:02:04.740> background<00:02:05.220> you<00:02:05.399> know

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
like that's the last background you know

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.130 
like that's the last background you know
you're<00:02:05.700> probably<00:02:05.910> gonna<00:02:06.090> lose<00:02:06.360> now<00:02:06.869> see<00:02:07.080> you

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
you're probably gonna lose now see you

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.169 
you're probably gonna lose now see you
can<00:02:07.289> use<00:02:07.410> ability<00:02:07.740> cards<00:02:08.009> then

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
can use ability cards then

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.420 
can use ability cards then
but<00:02:09.689> I<00:02:09.899> said<00:02:10.170> I'm<00:02:10.319> going<00:02:10.469> to<00:02:10.560> try<00:02:10.769> again<00:02:11.099> I

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
but I said I'm going to try again I

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.330 
but I said I'm going to try again I
could<00:02:12.269> use<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:13.500> bring<00:02:13.650> back<00:02:13.829> this<00:02:14.069> back

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
could use that to bring back this back

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.160 
could use that to bring back this back
on<00:02:14.640> because<00:02:14.849> I<00:02:15.030> think<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.480> might<00:02:15.689> lose<00:02:15.930> that

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
on because I think I might lose that

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.520 
on because I think I might lose that
