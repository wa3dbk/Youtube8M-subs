00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.930 

okay<00:03:16.460> so<00:03:16.520> this<00:03:16.790> is<00:03:16.940> how<00:03:17.060> it<00:03:17.210> comes<00:03:17.330> back<00:03:17.600> out

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
okay so this is how it comes back out

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:27.210 
okay so this is how it comes back out
just<00:03:19.940> kind<00:03:20.240> of<00:03:20.300> those<00:03:21.760> kind<00:03:22.760> of<00:03:22.850> collapses<00:03:25.570> now

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
just kind of those kind of collapses now

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.920 
just kind of those kind of collapses now
the<00:03:28.220> one<00:03:28.490> I'm<00:03:28.670> going<00:03:28.880> to<00:03:28.940> put<00:03:29.120> in<00:03:29.270> next<00:03:29.540> is

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
the one I'm going to put in next is

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.640 
the one I'm going to put in next is
actually<00:03:30.170> our<00:03:31.040> regulator<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:33.380> next

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
actually our regulator and the next

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.020 
actually our regulator and the next
thing<00:03:33.740> we're<00:03:33.860> going<00:03:33.950> to<00:03:34.010> do<00:03:34.160> is<00:03:34.310> test<00:03:34.610> it<00:03:34.790> and

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
thing we're going to do is test it and

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.610 
thing we're going to do is test it and
make<00:03:35.150> sure<00:03:35.180> that<00:03:35.510> it's<00:03:35.690> actually<00:03:35.900> effectively

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
make sure that it's actually effectively

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.310 
make sure that it's actually effectively
good<00:03:36.860> before<00:03:37.040> I<00:03:37.220> waste<00:03:37.400> all<00:03:37.610> this<00:03:37.760> time<00:03:38.320> but

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
good before I waste all this time but

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.420 
good before I waste all this time but
you<00:03:39.470> can<00:03:39.620> clearly<00:03:39.800> see<00:03:41.770> some<00:03:42.770> of<00:03:42.890> these<00:03:42.950> proper

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
you can clearly see some of these proper

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.180 
you can clearly see some of these proper
this<00:03:43.610> can<00:03:43.790> really<00:03:44.000> be<00:03:44.150> a<00:03:44.300> pain<00:03:45.010> that's<00:03:46.010> why<00:03:46.130> you

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
this can really be a pain that's why you

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.430 
this can really be a pain that's why you
want<00:03:46.400> to<00:03:46.430> use<00:03:46.490> those<00:03:46.700> titanium<00:03:47.120> bits<00:03:47.690> of

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
want to use those titanium bits of

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.460 
want to use those titanium bits of
course<00:03:48.680> this<00:03:48.830> is<00:03:48.980> just<00:03:49.190> trash<00:03:49.340> anyway<00:03:49.910> but<00:03:50.470> no

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
course this is just trash anyway but no

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.660 
course this is just trash anyway but no
you're<00:03:51.650> probably<00:03:51.770> going<00:03:52.040> to<00:03:52.100> reuse<00:03:52.280> whatever

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
you're probably going to reuse whatever

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.170 
you're probably going to reuse whatever
you're<00:03:53.000> doing<00:03:54.070> all<00:03:55.070> right<00:03:55.250> so<00:03:55.700> if<00:03:55.850> you<00:03:55.940> pause

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
you're doing all right so if you pause

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.990 
you're doing all right so if you pause
that<00:03:56.210> for<00:03:56.450> a<00:03:56.630> second
