example we can see that the changes have

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.900 
example we can see that the changes have
filtered<00:05:11.650> through<00:05:11.890> so<00:05:12.430> we<00:05:12.520> just<00:05:12.700> need<00:05:12.820> to

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
filtered through so we just need to

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.340 
filtered through so we just need to

confirm and the domain name will be

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.860 
confirm and the domain name will be
