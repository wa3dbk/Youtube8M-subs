apparently the quintuplets I'm like whoa

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.230 
apparently the quintuplets I'm like whoa
you<00:03:03.170> know<00:03:03.200> so<00:03:03.500> that<00:03:03.650> battery<00:03:04.160> for<00:03:04.400> a<00:03:04.430> loop<00:03:04.610> and

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
you know so that battery for a loop and

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.410 
you know so that battery for a loop and
basically<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:07.070> finger<00:03:07.970> they<00:03:08.090> need<00:03:08.240> for

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
basically the the finger they need for

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.410 
basically the the finger they need for
the<00:03:08.510> El<00:03:08.870> Monte<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.760> aisle<00:03:10.760> is<00:03:11.000> called<00:03:11.240> the

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
the El Monte the aisle is called the

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.160 
the El Monte the aisle is called the
nori<00:03:11.690> not<00:03:12.230> too<00:03:12.350> sure<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:13.070> echo<00:03:13.610> yeah<00:03:14.060> yeah<00:03:14.990> the

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
nori not too sure the echo yeah yeah the

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.140 
nori not too sure the echo yeah yeah the
Eco<00:03:15.410> nori<00:03:15.680> which<00:03:16.130> is<00:03:16.250> like<00:03:16.370> a<00:03:16.430> seaweed<00:03:16.880> on

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
Eco nori which is like a seaweed on

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.020 
Eco nori which is like a seaweed on
basically<00:03:18.020> this<00:03:18.860> turtle<00:03:19.280> has<00:03:19.490> because<00:03:19.880> they

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
basically this turtle has because they

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.910 
basically this turtle has because they
go<00:03:20.240> talk<00:03:20.540> to<00:03:20.570> mochi<00:03:21.050> about<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.290> few<00:03:21.500> things

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
go talk to mochi about a few things

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.190 
go talk to mochi about a few things
and<00:03:22.070> then<00:03:22.550> apparently<00:03:22.880> you<00:03:23.210> know<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.900> way<00:03:24.050> it

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
and then apparently you know the way it

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.990 
and then apparently you know the way it
is<00:03:24.320> that<00:03:24.620> there's<00:03:24.920> a<00:03:24.980> turtle<00:03:25.310> that<00:03:25.580> absorbs

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
is that there's a turtle that absorbs

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.850 
is that there's a turtle that absorbs
sunlight<00:03:26.240> and<00:03:26.540> then<00:03:26.660> it<00:03:26.840> uses<00:03:27.020> the<00:03:27.290> summer<00:03:27.650> has

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
sunlight and then it uses the summer has

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.550 
sunlight and then it uses the summer has
electricity<00:03:28.310> so<00:03:29.210> mochi<00:03:29.780> has<00:03:29.930> that<00:03:30.200> but<00:03:30.530> a

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
electricity so mochi has that but a

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.620 
electricity so mochi has that but a
number<00:03:31.070> no<00:03:31.250> Chi<00:03:31.430> ask<00:03:31.580> that<00:03:31.790> but<00:03:32.330> apparently

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
number no Chi ask that but apparently

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.150 
number no Chi ask that but apparently
you<00:03:32.840> won't<00:03:32.990> give<00:03:33.110> it<00:03:33.200> or<00:03:33.350> go<00:03:33.470> just<00:03:33.650> yet<00:03:33.770> cuz<00:03:33.980> yes

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
you won't give it or go just yet cuz yes

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.920 
you won't give it or go just yet cuz yes
actually<00:03:34.460> not<00:03:34.610> pump<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:35.030> turtle<00:03:35.390> so<00:03:35.810> he

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
actually not pump the turtle so he

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.330 
actually not pump the turtle so he
spends<00:03:36.170> three<00:03:36.440> days<00:03:36.470> he's<00:03:36.770> coming<00:03:37.040> up<00:03:37.130> like

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
spends three days he's coming up like

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.070 
spends three days he's coming up like
like<00:03:37.850> other<00:03:38.060> people's<00:03:38.420> turtles<00:03:38.750> and<00:03:38.900> then<00:03:38.990> he

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
like other people's turtles and then he

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.760 
like other people's turtles and then he
goes<00:03:39.170> in<00:03:39.290> a<00:03:39.380> bunch<00:03:39.650> of<00:03:40.330> eco<00:03:41.330> nori<00:03:41.630> alright<00:03:42.230> and

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
goes in a bunch of eco nori alright and

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.700 
goes in a bunch of eco nori alright and

to complete this Aramaki and this

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.200 
to complete this Aramaki and this
actually<00:04:37.930> might<00:04:38.080> be<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.260> next<00:04:38.650> step<00:04:38.830> to<00:04:39.210> this

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
actually might be the next step to this

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.950 
actually might be the next step to this
actually<00:04:40.780> at<00:04:40.900> this<00:04:41.110> point<00:04:41.610> they<00:04:42.610> made<00:04:43.000> cuz<00:04:43.840> I

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
actually at this point they made cuz I

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.570 
actually at this point they made cuz I
don't<00:04:44.020> know<00:04:44.260> else<00:04:44.560> think<00:04:44.740> about<00:04:44.950> me<00:04:45.040> it's<00:04:45.340> Tori

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.010 
don't know else think about me it's Tori
called<00:04:45.790> me<00:04:45.880> there's<00:04:46.150> always<00:04:46.270> something<00:04:46.810> to<00:04:46.840> do

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
called me there's always something to do

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.720 
called me there's always something to do
in<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.200> human<00:04:47.440> world<00:04:47.470> but<00:04:48.310> this<00:04:48.520> actually

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
in the human world but this actually

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.430 
in the human world but this actually
this<00:04:49.270> actually<00:04:49.450> might<00:04:49.750> be<00:04:49.780> nearing<00:04:50.200> the<00:04:50.410> point

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
this actually might be nearing the point

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.560 
this actually might be nearing the point
where<00:04:51.280> they<00:04:51.400> might<00:04:51.610> take<00:04:51.850> that<00:04:52.030> leap<00:04:52.210> forward

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
where they might take that leap forward

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.520 
where they might take that leap forward
into<00:04:52.720> the<00:04:52.840> gurning<00:04:53.169> world

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
into the gurning world

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.530 
into the gurning world
maybe<00:04:54.070> I'm<00:04:54.430> just<00:04:54.460> saying<00:04:54.880> maybe<00:04:55.150> alright

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
maybe I'm just saying maybe alright

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.659 
maybe I'm just saying maybe alright
because<00:04:56.020> they<00:04:56.410> their<00:04:56.770> cells<00:04:57.130> have<00:04:57.280> evolved

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
because they their cells have evolved

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.760 
because they their cells have evolved
towards<00:04:58.150> like<00:04:58.389> a<00:04:58.600> certain<00:04:59.260> level<00:04:59.440> where<00:04:59.740> I

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
towards like a certain level where I

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.070 
towards like a certain level where I
think<00:05:00.190> they<00:05:00.340> might<00:05:00.490> be<00:05:00.610> able<00:05:00.669> to<00:05:00.760> handle<00:05:01.080> some

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
think they might be able to handle some

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.659 
think they might be able to handle some
of<00:05:02.110> the<00:05:02.229> girly<00:05:02.560> world<00:05:02.830> even<00:05:03.070> of<00:05:03.160> Toriko<00:05:03.520> we

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
of the girly world even of Toriko we

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.640 
of the girly world even of Toriko we
tried<00:05:03.880> one<00:05:04.060> at<00:05:04.210> one<00:05:04.300> time<00:05:04.510> got<00:05:05.080> fucked<00:05:05.350> up<00:05:05.440> read

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
from that point and maybe I'm just

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.430 
from that point and maybe I'm just
saying<00:05:09.280> maybe<00:05:09.490> all<00:05:09.760> right<00:05:09.910> maybe<00:05:10.440> possibility
