for torsional support and a little
rigidity<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.259> would<00:01:16.590> think<00:01:17.360> and<00:01:18.360> moving<00:01:18.689> on<00:01:18.840> to

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
rigidity I would think and moving on to

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.530 
rigidity I would think and moving on to
the<00:01:19.259> biggest<00:01:20.780> aspect<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.110> shoe<00:01:23.360> it's<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
the biggest aspect of this shoe it's the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.690 
the biggest aspect of this shoe it's the
boost<00:01:24.840> technology<00:01:27.140> being<00:01:28.340> utilized<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.640> a

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
boost technology being utilized in a

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.749 
boost technology being utilized in a
basketball<00:01:30.360> shoe<00:01:30.860> that<00:01:31.860> happened<00:01:32.310> earlier

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
basketball shoe that happened earlier

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.390 
basketball shoe that happened earlier
this<00:01:33.680> year<00:01:34.680> with<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.430> crazy<00:01:36.060> light<00:01:37.100> which<00:01:38.100> was

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
this year with the crazy light which was

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.399 
this year with the crazy light which was
a<00:01:38.759> disappointment<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.689> my<00:01:39.810> opinion<00:01:40.259> because

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
a disappointment in my opinion because

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.100 
a disappointment in my opinion because
it<00:01:40.680> was<00:01:40.860> in<00:01:41.100> capsule<00:01:41.729> boost<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> heel

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
it was in capsule boost just in the heel

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.819 
it was in capsule boost just in the heel
and<00:01:43.880> standard<00:01:44.880> evie<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> which<00:01:45.869> ended<00:01:46.259> up<00:01:46.380> being

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
and standard evie a which ended up being

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:53.440 
and standard evie a which ended up being
very<00:01:47.840> dense<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.659> DeRose<00:01:52.110> which<00:01:52.439> is

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
very dense and in the DeRose which is

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.090 
very dense and in the DeRose which is
really<00:01:54.450> comparable<00:01:55.079> in<00:01:55.320> price<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.770> think<00:01:55.799> it's

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
really comparable in price I think it's

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.310 
really comparable in price I think it's
only<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.369> couple<00:01:56.610> dollars<00:01:56.850> more<00:01:57.140> you<00:01:58.140> get<00:01:58.259> a

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
only a couple dollars more you get a

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.609 
only a couple dollars more you get a
full<00:01:58.770> length<00:01:59.159> unit<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.380> obviously<00:02:01.380> it's

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
full length unit and obviously it's

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.170 
full length unit and obviously it's
tapered<00:02:02.100> from<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.399> back<00:02:02.610> where<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.000> says

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
tapered from the back where it says

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.660 
tapered from the back where it says
thickest<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.770> moves<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.280> center

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
thickest and it moves to the center

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.479 
thickest and it moves to the center
portion<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.780> forefoot<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.590> in<00:02:08.369> the

portion in the forefoot and in the

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.070 
portion in the forefoot and in the
forefoot<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:08.940> looks<00:02:09.119> like<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:09.629> capsule

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080

a sweat pant material a little irregular

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.970 
a sweat pant material a little irregular
but<00:04:33.380> very<00:04:33.980> comfortable<00:04:35.320> the<00:04:36.320> DeRose<00:04:36.710> logo

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
inside of a shoe and on the inside it

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.340 
inside of a shoe and on the inside it

the<00:04:48.350> Star<00:04:48.680> of<00:04:48.860> David<00:04:48.890> I<00:04:49.430> assume<00:04:50.590> not<00:04:51.590> sure<00:04:52.360> of

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
the Star of David I assume not sure of

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.690 
the Star of David I assume not sure of
the<00:04:53.510> significance<00:04:53.630> of<00:04:54.200> that<00:04:54.260> is<00:04:54.410> but<00:04:55.100> overall

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
the significance of that is but overall

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.990 
the significance of that is but overall
I<00:04:56.120> think<00:04:57.080> this<00:04:57.380> issue<00:04:57.560> is<00:04:57.920> a<00:04:57.950> game<00:04:58.250> changer<00:04:58.790> and

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
I think this issue is a game changer and

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.200 
I think this issue is a game changer and
is<00:04:59.720> very<00:05:00.290> very<00:05:00.770> very<00:05:02.500> cost<00:05:03.500> effective

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
is very very very cost effective

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.720 
is very very very cost effective
compared<00:05:05.210> to<00:05:05.480> save<00:05:06.380> the<00:05:06.530> Jordan<00:05:06.919> 29<00:05:07.130> coming

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730
