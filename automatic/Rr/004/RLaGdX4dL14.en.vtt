you haven't even got to undo the sphere
you<00:00:31.090> know<00:00:31.300> just<00:00:32.110> the<00:00:32.230> front<00:00:32.470> steering<00:00:32.769> on<00:00:33.690> much

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
you know just the front steering on much

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.540 
you know just the front steering on much
of<00:00:34.870> unloosen<00:00:35.320> that<00:00:35.350> it<00:00:35.769> allows<00:00:35.949> that<00:00:36.160> to<00:00:36.220> sweep

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
of unloosen that it allows that to sweep

of unloosen that it allows that to sweep
away<00:00:36.670> I<00:00:36.820> brought<00:00:37.090> that<00:00:37.680> drop<00:00:38.680> down<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:40.719> I

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
away I brought that drop down so I

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.830 
away I brought that drop down so I
thought<00:00:40.930> it's<00:00:41.320> gonna<00:00:41.410> be<00:00:41.559> on<00:00:41.649> your<00:00:41.739> car<00:00:42.840> same

for this one okay so if you've got your

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:51.510 
for this one okay so if you've got your
actual<00:00:50.050> stands<00:00:50.410> there<00:00:50.710> which<00:00:51.070> is<00:00:51.250> you<00:00:51.430> know

roughly where you go from doing the job

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.380 
roughly where you go from doing the job
that<00:00:53.649> stop<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.190> arm<00:00:54.699> from<00:00:54.940> sliding<00:00:55.180> all<00:00:55.360> the

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
that stop the arm from sliding all the

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
pulled it out there by went up the same

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:05.670 
pulled it out there by went up the same
breaker<00:01:04.449> that<00:01:04.660> there's<00:01:04.839> obviously<00:01:05.259> a<00:01:05.320> cutter

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
breaker that there's obviously a cutter

pipes<00:01:05.920> in<00:01:06.070> this<00:01:06.160> one<00:01:06.369> cause<00:01:06.550> we're<00:01:06.670> putting

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
pipes in this one cause we're putting

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:09.540 
pipes in this one cause we're putting
new<00:01:07.539> ones<00:01:07.840> on<00:01:08.020> but<00:01:08.770> it's<00:01:08.890> unlikely<00:01:09.310> you'll

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
new ones on but it's unlikely you'll

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.370 
new ones on but it's unlikely you'll
even<00:01:09.729> that<00:01:09.849> same<00:01:10.060> break<00:01:10.300> have<00:01:10.539> resorted<00:01:10.840> to<00:01:11.080> do

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
even that same break have resorted to do

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.800 
even that same break have resorted to do
that<00:01:11.619> because<00:01:12.459> you<00:01:12.759> haven't<00:01:12.970> even<00:01:13.149> released

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
that because you haven't even released

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.330 
that because you haven't even released
the<00:01:14.050> pressure<00:01:14.259> off<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:14.679> springs<00:01:15.009> if<00:01:15.220> you've

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
the pressure off the springs if you've

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.859 
the pressure off the springs if you've
jacks<00:01:15.580> it<00:01:15.700> out<00:01:15.880> under<00:01:16.149> the<00:01:16.240> axle<00:01:16.599> but<00:01:16.810> you

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
jacks it out under the axle but you

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.719 
jacks it out under the axle but you
should<00:01:17.020> pull<00:01:17.200> it<00:01:17.229> away<00:01:17.410> under<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:17.800> axle<00:01:18.160> there

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
should pull it away under the axle there

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.430 
should pull it away under the axle there
with<00:01:18.849> then<00:01:19.060> you're<00:01:19.209> played<00:01:19.420> in<00:01:19.630> did<00:01:20.200> you<00:01:20.229> don't

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440

a stretcher both works right okay

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:25.499 
a stretcher both works right okay
brilliant<00:01:23.380> what<00:01:24.250> quick<00:01:24.789> thing<00:01:25.060> is<00:01:25.179> a<00:01:25.209> heavy

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
brilliant what quick thing is a heavy

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.089 
brilliant what quick thing is a heavy
thing<00:01:25.750> but<00:01:25.929> it's<00:01:26.050> a<00:01:26.080> quick<00:01:26.319> things<00:01:28.020> where

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:29.099 
thing but it's a quick things where

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:31.770 
thing but it's a quick things where
there's<00:01:30.099> ten<00:01:30.459> or<00:01:30.640> eleven<00:01:30.910> bolts<00:01:31.209> around<00:01:31.330> if

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
there's ten or eleven bolts around if

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.320 
there's ten or eleven bolts around if
this<00:01:32.709> is<00:01:32.860> differential<00:01:33.489> so<00:01:34.000> after<00:01:34.239> you've

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
this is differential so after you've

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.990 
this is differential so after you've
done<00:01:34.450> a<00:01:34.509> prop<00:01:34.810> shaft<00:01:35.020> and<00:01:35.610> I'm<00:01:36.610> doing<00:01:36.819> your

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
done a prop shaft and I'm doing your

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.790 
done a prop shaft and I'm doing your
nuts<00:01:37.209> around<00:01:37.360> there<00:01:37.720> which<00:01:38.200> I<00:01:38.349> have<00:01:38.590> them

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
nuts around there which I have them

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.150 
nuts around there which I have them
already

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
already

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.749 
already
here's<00:01:39.340> one<00:01:39.520> I<00:01:39.550> prepared<00:01:39.640> earlier<00:01:41.399> last<00:01:42.399> nut

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
here's one I prepared earlier last nut

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.270 
here's one I prepared earlier last nut
now<00:01:43.750> that's<00:01:44.140> another<00:01:44.470> thing<00:01:44.709> that<00:01:44.920> usually

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
now that's another thing that usually

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.210 
now that's another thing that usually
it's<00:01:46.000> glued<00:01:46.330> in<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.890> you've<00:01:48.429> got<00:01:48.580> a<00:01:48.610> choice<00:01:50.220> you

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
it's glued in so you've got a choice you

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.990 
it's glued in so you've got a choice you
can<00:01:51.250> put<00:01:51.550> a<00:01:51.580> block<00:01:51.789> of<00:01:51.940> wood<00:01:51.970> there<00:01:52.509> beat<00:01:53.229> it

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
can put a block of wood there beat it

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.779 
can put a block of wood there beat it
beat<00:01:55.000> it<00:01:55.030> sideways<00:01:55.450> and<00:01:56.020> then<00:01:56.920> maybe<00:01:57.160> get<00:01:57.459> some

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
beat it sideways and then maybe get some

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.750 
beat it sideways and then maybe get some
form<00:01:58.000> of<00:01:58.030> leader<00:01:58.270> in<00:01:58.479> there

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
form of leader in there

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
how was that that was pretty quick and

00:02:50.090 --> 00:03:00.630 
how was that that was pretty quick and
very<00:02:51.090> quick<00:02:51.270> effect
