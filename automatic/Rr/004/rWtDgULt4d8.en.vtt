00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.860 

we<00:00:00.539> have<00:00:00.719> to<00:00:01.350> full<00:00:01.920> drive<00:00:02.159> two<00:00:02.460> pedals<00:00:02.909> side<00:00:03.659> by

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
we have to full drive two pedals side by

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.230 
we have to full drive two pedals side by
side<00:00:04.110> and<00:00:04.350> we'll<00:00:04.980> compare<00:00:05.400> how<00:00:05.759> they<00:00:05.940> sound

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
side and we'll compare how they sound

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.960 
side and we'll compare how they sound
together<00:00:06.660> on<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.620> right<00:00:07.740> we<00:00:07.950> have<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.189> 2001

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
together on the right we have a 2001

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.669 
together on the right we have a 2001
early<00:00:09.809> version<00:00:11.570> pull<00:00:12.570> drive<00:00:12.809> -<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.410> then<00:00:13.530> on

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
early version pull drive - and then on

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.630 
early version pull drive - and then on
the<00:00:13.799> Left<00:00:14.009> we<00:00:14.099> have<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.400> latest<00:00:15.089> MOSFET<00:00:15.990> and

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
the Left we have the latest MOSFET and

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.090 
the Left we have the latest MOSFET and
I've<00:00:17.640> set<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.240> MOSFET<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:19.070> the<00:00:20.449> FM<00:00:22.100> setting

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
I've set the MOSFET to the FM setting

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.340 
I've set the MOSFET to the FM setting
here<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.880> standard<00:00:24.449> setting<00:00:25.140> on<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
here and the standard setting on the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.820 
here and the standard setting on the
MOSFET

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
MOSFET

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.519 
MOSFET
and<00:00:25.980> then<00:00:26.670> here<00:00:27.119> we<00:00:27.269> don't<00:00:27.390> have<00:00:27.539> any<00:00:27.689> switches

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
and then here we don't have any switches

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.319 
and then here we don't have any switches
besides<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.689> push-pull<00:00:30.720> on<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.289> volume

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
besides the push-pull on the volume

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.110 
besides the push-pull on the volume
that's<00:00:33.329> for<00:00:33.660> comp<00:00:33.960> cut<00:00:34.230> which<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.700> upper

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
that's for comp cut which is the upper

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.170 
that's for comp cut which is the upper
position<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.190> switch<00:00:38.460> here

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
position in this on this switch here

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.510 
position in this on this switch here
okay<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:39.629> I'm<00:00:39.960> playing<00:00:40.200> through<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.530> Marshall

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
okay so I'm playing through a Marshall

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.940 
okay so I'm playing through a Marshall
JMP<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:43.020> 412<00:00:43.920> cab<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.960> Stratocaster<00:00:45.960> here's

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
JMP of 412 cab and a Stratocaster here's

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.670 
JMP of 412 cab and a Stratocaster here's
a<00:00:47.039> clean<00:00:47.370> signal

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:08.980 

start<00:00:54.680> with<00:00:54.860> the<00:00:55.129> older<00:00:56.059> full<00:00:56.870> drive

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:02:25.690 

let's<00:01:09.990> go<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.350> MOSFET

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.170 

so<00:02:26.540> they<00:02:26.660> sound<00:02:26.930> pretty<00:02:27.230> close<00:02:27.850> let's<00:02:28.850> crank

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
so they sound pretty close let's crank

00:02:29.180 --> 00:03:00.530 
so they sound pretty close let's crank
the<00:02:29.390> overdrive<00:02:29.870> all<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.290> way<00:02:30.440> up

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:25.300 

let's<00:03:00.990> go<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.319> vintage<00:03:01.560> mode

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.680 

MOSFET<00:03:26.310> has<00:03:26.459> just<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.819> little<00:03:27.060> more<00:03:27.209> gain<00:03:27.450> in

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
MOSFET has just a little more gain in

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.720 
MOSFET has just a little more gain in
the<00:03:27.810> vintage<00:03:28.049> mode<00:03:28.470> but<00:03:29.190> it<00:03:29.280> sounds<00:03:29.580> real

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
the vintage mode but it sounds real

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:40.650 
the vintage mode but it sounds real
close<00:03:30.030> in<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.360> FM<00:03:30.870> mode

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.540 

now<00:03:41.560> let's<00:03:41.860> hit<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:43.560> hit<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.590> boost<00:03:45.040> on<00:03:45.370> both

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
now let's hit the hit the boost on both

00:03:45.550 --> 00:04:20.319 
now let's hit the hit the boost on both
of<00:03:45.730> them

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.280 

you

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.890 

some<00:04:26.290> really<00:04:26.680> close<00:04:26.950> if<00:04:27.790> we<00:04:27.970> go<00:04:28.150> to<00:04:28.210> the<00:04:28.330> MOSFET

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
some really close if we go to the MOSFET

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.030 
some really close if we go to the MOSFET
it<00:04:29.740> gets<00:04:29.950> a<00:04:30.070> little<00:04:30.310> louder<00:04:30.550> and<00:04:31.410> a<00:04:32.410> little

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
it gets a little louder and a little

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:59.940 
it gets a little louder and a little
more<00:04:33.190> juicier

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.969 

you

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.999 

and<00:05:05.539> that<00:05:06.539> is<00:05:06.720> the<00:05:06.870> comparison<00:05:07.229> between<00:05:07.590> the

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
and that is the comparison between the

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.210 
and that is the comparison between the
two<00:05:08.039> overdrive<00:05:08.849> pedals
