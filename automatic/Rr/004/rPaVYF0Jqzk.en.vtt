even I know why they've gone amok but

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.950 
even I know why they've gone amok but
they<00:01:16.680> appear<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.159> be<00:01:17.340> following<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:18.060> leader<00:01:18.420> a

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
they appear to be following a leader a

they appear to be following a leader a
leader

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.000 

well<00:01:23.600> I<00:01:23.630> guess<00:01:24.020> for<00:01:24.230> now<00:01:24.290> we'll<00:01:24.650> buy<00:01:24.830> that

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
well I guess for now we'll buy that

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.040 
well I guess for now we'll buy that
Eggman<00:01:25.430> isn't<00:01:25.910> involved<00:01:27.250> hmm<00:01:28.300> so<00:01:29.300> maybe<00:01:29.570> that

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
Eggman isn't involved hmm so maybe that

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.230 
Eggman isn't involved hmm so maybe that
has<00:01:30.380> nothing<00:01:30.620> to<00:01:30.979> do<00:01:31.190> with<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:31.610> robots<00:01:32.000> that

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
has nothing to do with the robots that

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:40.680 
has nothing to do with the robots that
attacked<00:01:32.660> us<00:01:34.840> where<00:01:35.840> did<00:01:35.990> you<00:01:36.110> get<00:01:36.290> that

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.020 

so<00:01:41.530> you<00:01:41.590> were<00:01:41.920> holding<00:01:42.220> out<00:01:42.520> on<00:01:42.550> us<00:01:42.850> Eggman

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
so you were holding out on us Eggman

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.300 
so you were holding out on us Eggman
spill<00:01:46.030> everything<00:01:46.330> you<00:01:46.630> know<00:01:46.810> now<00:01:50.040> very<00:01:51.040> well
