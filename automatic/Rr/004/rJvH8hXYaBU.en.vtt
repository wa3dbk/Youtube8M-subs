00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 the court ruled that a candidate for 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.240
 councilor of the capital remove from the 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.550
 campaign material because it considers 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.260
 makes apology for drug use 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.389
 he can still be convicted of crime 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.340
 I talked to the candidate 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.940
 that the campaign is within the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.060
 law 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.789
 on stickers and bottons representation 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.430
 Cannabis Leaf Sativa Canister 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.460
 has the same figure and inside 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.949
 silk on videos posted on the internet there 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.140
 is it the leaf that gives birth to marijuana 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.059
 prohibited drug in brazil 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.710
 for the candidate lucas de oliveira do 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.960
 psdb from florianÃ³polis 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.090
 this would be a reflection of the freedom 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.989
 expression in a democratic state of 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.820
 right 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.980
 for this prosecutor, however. 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.590
 the candidate's actions characterize a 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.750
 incentive to use drugs as well as crime 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.030
 election because the boxes would be 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.559
 being distributed what hurts the law 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.170
 the public prosecution filed an action 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.879
 against lucas de oliveira and has already 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.949
 a court order determining the 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.989
 withdrawal of campaign material with 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.989
 image of the plant that the supreme left 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.600
 very clear that you can discuss and 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.220
 to hold a march in favor of the 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.500
 decriminalization of drugs and not 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.140
 encourages the use of the drug by distributing 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.020
 silk to wrap marijuana to make 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.240
 based distribute as the player who is 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.890
 the drug crusher and do not even drug you 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.689
 within your home and much less 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.700
 use adolescents to make the 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.590
 distribution of this distributed material 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.869
 no kind of toast we've always been 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.579
 led by the party and coalition 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.200
 that it was not possible then we 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.259
 we made this material to collect 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.420
 in the first process 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.729
 was mistakenly characterized as 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.799
 toast and would be toast if it were 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.020
 distributed on the big emblems we 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.729
 we sell the process that supposedly 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.530
 practice of electoral crime 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.240
 distribution of gifts during the 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.009
 campaign had its first audience 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.090
 this Wednesday here in the forum of 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.579
 florianÃ³polis 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.710
 the judge antonio augusto bass and ubaldo 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.990
 which analyzes the case does not give a 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.939
 decision and gave it a period of two 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.310
 for the defense of the candidate to 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.170
 councilor to present the final allegations 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.110
 only after this period is the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.330
 Judge delivered a judgment in this case. 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.240
 case of conviction Lucas 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.490
 could have the void electoral register 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.620
 It's unfeasible for the ministry 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.870
 still asked for investigations into 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.640
 a possible crime of drug trafficking 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.130
 the prosecution awaits the end of the investigation 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.940
 to decide whether or not to file a complaint 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.940
 against the candidate
