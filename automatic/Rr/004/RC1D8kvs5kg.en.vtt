you<00:03:00.040> should<00:03:00.609> be<00:03:00.940> fine<00:03:01.319> otherwise<00:03:02.319> the<00:03:03.250> in<00:03:03.579> this

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
you should be fine otherwise the in this

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.400 
you should be fine otherwise the in this
case<00:03:03.760> is<00:03:04.150> just<00:03:04.390> great<00:03:04.599> you<00:03:04.629> shouldn't<00:03:05.230> have

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
case is just great you shouldn't have

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.990
