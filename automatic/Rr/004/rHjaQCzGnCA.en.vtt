to not comfortable at yet and especially
the<00:02:40.650> Christ<00:02:40.920> of<00:02:41.130> our<00:02:41.310> of<00:02:41.640> our<00:02:41.790> faith<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.780> what

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
the Christ of our of our faith so what

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.750 
the Christ of our of our faith so what
we've<00:02:43.110> chosen<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.590> do<00:02:43.830> is<00:02:44.040> I<00:02:44.070> will<00:02:44.550> take<00:02:44.730> a

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
we've chosen to do is I will take a

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.150 
we've chosen to do is I will take a
wonderful<00:02:45.420> picture<00:02:46.410> that<00:02:46.560> they<00:02:46.680> can<00:02:46.890> relate

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
wonderful picture that they can relate

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.250 
wonderful picture that they can relate
to<00:02:47.220> that<00:02:47.460> will<00:02:47.820> draw<00:02:48.150> them<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:49.020> something

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
to that will draw them to something

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.540 
to that will draw them to something
they're<00:02:49.530> familiar<00:02:49.710> with<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.430> then

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
they're familiar with and then

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.980 
they're familiar with and then
underneath<00:02:50.850> it<00:02:51.120> will<00:02:51.270> write<00:02:51.450> something<00:02:51.870> how

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
underneath it will write something how

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.900 
underneath it will write something how
were<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.260> bear<00:02:52.650> one<00:02:52.890> another's<00:02:52.920> burdens<00:02:53.280> and

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
were to bear one another's burdens and

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.790 
were to bear one another's burdens and
so<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.150> takes<00:02:54.330> a<00:02:54.480> natural<00:02:55.230> event<00:02:55.530> in<00:02:55.650> their

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
so it takes a natural event in their

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.160 
so it takes a natural event in their
life<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.430> puts<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:57.000> spiritual<00:02:57.570> twist<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:58.140> it

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
life and puts a spiritual twist to it

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.740 
life and puts a spiritual twist to it
that<00:02:58.440> that's<00:02:58.920> subtle<00:02:59.310> enough<00:02:59.640> but<00:03:00.300> yet<00:03:00.480> drives

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
that that's subtle enough but yet drives

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.410 
that that's subtle enough but yet drives
a<00:03:00.900> message<00:03:01.290> home<00:03:01.530> from<00:03:01.890> there

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.449
