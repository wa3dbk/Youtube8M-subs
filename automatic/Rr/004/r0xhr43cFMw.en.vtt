 it's something like any other from the same year 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.400
 only that Brazilians today are one of the biggest consumers of meat in the world 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.680
 today is not argentina - garroni guarani after brazil 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.700

 are two cards that are extremely linked 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.579
