down so I'm working my hair upward into
a<00:01:12.060> ponytail<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:15.320> I'm<00:01:16.320> really<00:01:16.830> making<00:01:17.040> sure

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
a ponytail so I'm really making sure

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.340 
a ponytail so I'm really making sure
that<00:01:17.400> everything<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.090> smooth<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.810> back<00:01:19.080> so

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
that everything is smooth in the back so

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.800 
that everything is smooth in the back so
I'm<00:01:19.470> checking<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:21.150> opted<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.630> go

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
I'm checking that and I opted to go

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.929 
I'm checking that and I opted to go
ahead<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.470> just<00:01:22.650> brush<00:01:23.009> any<00:01:23.280> loose<00:01:23.580> hairs

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
ahead and just brush any loose hairs

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:33.380 
ahead and just brush any loose hairs
that<00:01:24.270> may<00:01:24.540> be<00:01:25.500> down<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.920> back<00:01:32.000> so<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.030> take

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
that may be down in the back so I take

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.899 
that may be down in the back so I take
my<00:01:33.420> little<00:01:33.689> relevance<00:01:34.079> crunchy<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.640> put

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
my little relevance crunchy and I put

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.240 
my little relevance crunchy and I put
that<00:01:36.030> around<00:01:36.360> my<00:01:36.509> ponytail<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.439> I'm<00:01:38.040> being

that around my ponytail and I'm being
really<00:01:38.579> careful<00:01:38.790> with<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.240> because<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.720> does

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
really careful with this because it does

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.080 
really careful with this because it does
have<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.409> actual<00:01:40.829> metal<00:01:41.100> piece<00:01:41.400> on<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.060> I

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
have the actual metal piece on it so I

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.289 
have the actual metal piece on it so I
am<00:01:42.360> holding<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.649> metal<00:01:43.979> piece<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.460> my<00:01:44.490> hand<00:01:45.000> as

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
am holding the metal piece in my hand as

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.230 
am holding the metal piece in my hand as
to<00:01:45.509> not<00:01:45.659> snag<00:01:46.140> my<00:01:46.380> hair<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.549> I'm<00:01:47.640> fluffing<00:01:48.090> out

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
to not snag my hair so I'm fluffing out

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.050 
to not snag my hair so I'm fluffing out
my<00:01:48.479> ponytail<00:01:49.110> here<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:50.399> take<00:01:50.670> my<00:01:50.700> ponytail

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060
