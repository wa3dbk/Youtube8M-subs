important thing about using the yellows

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.170 
important thing about using the yellows
is<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.629> base<00:00:46.379> coat<00:00:46.800> for<00:00:47.190> shaping<00:00:47.550> your<00:00:47.850> trees

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
is a base coat for shaping your trees

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.540 
is a base coat for shaping your trees
using<00:00:48.690> your<00:00:48.989> imagination<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.800> order<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.129> get<00:00:50.309> a

using your imagination in order to get a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.580 
using your imagination in order to get a
sense<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:52.219> fall<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.460> trees<00:00:54.110> in<00:00:55.110> order<00:00:55.410> to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
sense of the fall of trees in order to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.099 
sense of the fall of trees in order to
not<00:00:56.370> be<00:00:56.579> attached<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> amount<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.719> details

not be attached to the amount of details
that<00:00:58.289> are<00:00:58.680> always<00:00:59.190> evident<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.789> trees<00:01:00.890> an

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
that are always evident in trees an

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.889 
that are always evident in trees an
important<00:01:02.399> aspect<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.820> using<00:01:03.180> yellows<00:01:03.510> is

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
important aspect of using yellows is

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.899 
important aspect of using yellows is
that<00:01:04.260> yellow<00:01:04.769> really<00:01:05.100> wants<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.369> be<00:01:05.400> closest

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
that yellow really wants to be closest

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.179 
that yellow really wants to be closest
to the<00:01:06.090> paper<00:01:06.680> you'd<00:01:07.680> seen<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.100> previous

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
to the paper you'd seen in the previous

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.010 
to the paper you'd seen in the previous
exercises<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.240> did<00:01:09.420> go<00:01:09.540> back<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:09.990> with

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
exercises that I did go back in with

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.070 
exercises that I did go back in with
yellow<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.710> top<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> field<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.610> blue<00:01:11.850> in

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
yellow on top of the field of blue in

yellow or orange combinations but in
order<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.630> get<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> vibrancy<00:01:16.530> for<00:01:16.920> your

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
order to get a vibrancy for your

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.640 
order to get a vibrancy for your
paintings<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.420> yellow<00:01:18.689> should<00:01:19.049> be<00:01:19.170> closest

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
paintings the yellow should be closest

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.670 
paintings the yellow should be closest
to the<00:01:19.890> paper<00:01:22.790> because<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.259> yellow<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.409> going

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
to the paper because the yellow is going

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.469 
to the paper because the yellow is going
to<00:01:25.860> absorb<00:01:26.220> into<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.850> paper<00:01:27.060> it's<00:01:27.299> going<00:01:27.420> to

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
to absorb into the paper it's going to

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.850 
to absorb into the paper it's going to
give<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.840> luminosity<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.740> you're

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
give you that luminosity that you're

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.530 
give you that luminosity that you're
looking<00:01:28.979> for<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.790> degree<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.090> brightness

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
looking for and a degree of brightness

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.679 
looking for and a degree of brightness
there<00:01:31.340> one<00:01:32.340> we<00:01:32.460> hope<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.759> achieve<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.299> suggest

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689

there<00:02:57.480> are<00:02:57.570> many<00:02:57.690> painters<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.140> are<00:02:58.500> a

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
there are many painters that are a

any type of tree and have a certain

any type of tree and have a certain
style<00:03:07.710> that<00:03:08.070> results<00:03:08.490> from<00:03:09.170> handling<00:03:10.170> the

watercolor via the representation that
way<00:03:13.140> here<00:03:14.040> I'm<00:03:14.280> using<00:03:14.459> some<00:03:14.790> strokes<00:03:15.150> and

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
way here I'm using some strokes and

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.270 
way here I'm using some strokes and
experimenting<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.800> idea<00:03:17.070> of<00:03:17.160> using

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
experimenting the idea of using

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.620 
experimenting the idea of using
different<00:03:17.730> brushes<00:03:17.910> and<00:03:18.239> using<00:03:18.510> these

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
different brushes and using these

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.770 
different brushes and using these
studies<00:03:19.200> is<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.890> allow<00:03:20.880> yourself<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.390> luxury

studies is to allow yourself the luxury

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.880 
studies is to allow yourself the luxury
of<00:03:22.350> this<00:03:23.070> level<00:03:23.670> of<00:03:23.730> experimentation<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:25.080> in

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
of this level of experimentation and in

of this level of experimentation and in

feel fit in being able to increase the

alone sometimes leaving things alone is
good<00:03:47.959> again<00:03:48.959> this<00:03:49.110> is<00:03:49.320> all<00:03:49.440> just<00:03:49.920> first<00:03:50.340> pass

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
good again this is all just first pass

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.449 
good again this is all just first pass
on<00:03:52.489> execution<00:03:53.489> and<00:03:53.580> the<00:03:54.019> degree<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.230> which<00:03:55.260> you

on execution and the degree to which you

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.920 
on execution and the degree to which you

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
previous tree exercises is another step

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:10.270 
previous tree exercises is another step
in<00:04:03.780> another<00:04:04.019> exercise

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.400 

and<00:04:11.280> we'll<00:04:11.400> let<00:04:11.520> that<00:04:11.580> one<00:04:11.880> shift<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:12.990> sit<00:04:13.260> and

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
and we'll let that one shift and sit and

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.920 
and we'll let that one shift and sit and
go<00:04:13.620> where<00:04:13.800> it<00:04:13.860> needs<00:04:14.010> to<00:04:14.070> go<00:04:14.450> I'll<00:04:15.450> try<00:04:15.630> one

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
go where it needs to go I'll try one

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.280 
go where it needs to go I'll try one
more<00:04:16.110> area<00:04:17.010> really<00:04:17.940> strong<00:04:18.239> down<00:04:18.570> here<00:04:18.959> I

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.580 

wanted<00:04:22.290> to<00:04:22.410> suggest<00:04:22.590> a<00:04:22.920> ground<00:04:24.230> just<00:04:25.230> using

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
wanted to suggest a ground just using

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.610 
wanted to suggest a ground just using
the<00:04:25.680> blue<00:04:28.400> and<00:04:29.400> also<00:04:29.670> are<00:04:29.790> many<00:04:29.940> ways<00:04:30.120> to<00:04:30.620> apply

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
the blue and also are many ways to apply

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.580 
the blue and also are many ways to apply
the<00:04:31.740> brush<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.250> paper<00:04:33.050> many<00:04:34.050> ways<00:04:34.290> to<00:04:34.470> get

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
the brush to paper many ways to get

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.260 
the brush to paper many ways to get
effects<00:04:34.980> here<00:04:35.370> I'm<00:04:35.580> letting<00:04:35.940> the<00:04:36.060> color

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
effects here I'm letting the color

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.090 
effects here I'm letting the color
actually<00:04:36.480> run<00:04:36.810> out<00:04:36.990> I'm<00:04:37.380> getting<00:04:37.530> this<00:04:37.770> dry

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
actually run out I'm getting this dry

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:47.300 
actually run out I'm getting this dry
brush<00:04:38.660> effect<00:04:39.660> at<00:04:39.960> the<00:04:40.140> base<00:04:40.290> of<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:40.530> tree<00:04:46.310> the

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
brush effect at the base of the tree the

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.090 
brush effect at the base of the tree the
nice<00:04:47.460> thing<00:04:47.490> about<00:04:47.720> this<00:04:48.950> combination<00:04:49.950> is

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
nice thing about this combination is

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.890 
nice thing about this combination is
that<00:04:50.160> both<00:04:50.490> colors<00:04:50.850> are<00:04:51.030> high<00:04:51.210> chroma<00:04:51.600> colors

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
that both colors are high chroma colors

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.450
