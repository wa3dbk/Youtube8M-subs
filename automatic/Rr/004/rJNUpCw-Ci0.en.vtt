00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
dynamic I think is going to appeal to a

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.880 
dynamic I think is going to appeal to a
lot<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.329> players<00:00:45.570> no<00:00:45.989> one's<00:00:46.170> really<00:00:46.379> ever<00:00:46.590> done

a<00:00:47.250> system<00:00:48.059> where<00:00:48.270> your<00:00:48.629> characters<00:00:49.050> have

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
a system where your characters have

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.349 
a system where your characters have
these<00:00:49.680> ties<00:00:49.890> people<00:00:50.730> sometimes<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.239> to

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359 
these ties people sometimes like to

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:53.330 
these ties people sometimes like to
imagine<00:00:51.510> their<00:00:51.899> characters<00:00:52.289> are<00:00:52.859> related<00:00:53.309> to

imagine their characters are related to
each<00:00:53.430> other<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:54.420> been<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> part<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.050> our

in our system can actually build sort of
