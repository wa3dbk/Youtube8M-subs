00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
them on the ground reduces the time even

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.429 
them on the ground reduces the time even
more<00:01:40.820> but<00:01:41.179> if<00:01:41.270> you<00:01:41.390> direct<00:01:41.750> hit<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.170> splash

to six points or three hearts now those
things<00:03:07.080> are<00:03:07.970> effective<00:03:08.970> on<00:03:09.150> things<00:03:09.540> such<00:03:09.720> as

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
things are effective on things such as

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.040 
things are effective on things such as
skeletons<00:03:10.680> Xabi<00:03:11.340> pigmen<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:12.180> wither<00:03:12.420> in<00:03:12.720> the

skeletons Xabi pigmen the wither in the
wither<00:03:13.200> skeleton<00:03:14.030> so<00:03:15.030> if<00:03:15.120> you're<00:03:15.239> making<00:03:15.600> a

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
wither skeleton so if you're making a

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.930 
wither skeleton so if you're making a
mob<00:03:15.959> form<00:03:16.320> it<00:03:16.590> might<00:03:16.830> be<00:03:16.980> crucial<00:03:17.520> to<00:03:17.550> make<00:03:17.790> it

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
mob form it might be crucial to make it

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.630 
mob form it might be crucial to make it
like<00:03:18.270> a<00:03:18.300> pushing<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.989> piston<00:03:19.500> crusher<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.100> then

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
like a pushing a piston crusher and then

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.280 
like a pushing a piston crusher and then
just<00:03:20.820> use<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.030> potion<00:03:21.300> to<00:03:21.510> kill<00:03:21.750> everything<00:03:21.989> at

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
just use a potion to kill everything at

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.800 
just use a potion to kill everything at
once<00:03:22.470> it<00:03:22.650> much<00:03:22.830> much<00:03:23.100> easier<00:03:23.160> but<00:03:24.090> my<00:03:24.209> last<00:03:24.420> tip

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
once it much much easier but my last tip

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.810 
once it much much easier but my last tip
for<00:03:25.110> making<00:03:25.140> potions<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:26.040> minecraft<00:03:26.519> is<00:03:26.670> not

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
for making potions and minecraft is not

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.820 
for making potions and minecraft is not
actually<00:03:26.970> making<00:03:27.299> potions<00:03:27.660> at<00:03:27.989> all<00:03:28.140> I<00:03:28.350> don't

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
them with looting sword there is a

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.130 
them with looting sword there is a
chance<00:03:59.340> you<00:03:59.670> can<00:04:00.090> get<00:04:00.330> that<00:04:00.510> potion<00:04:00.750> that

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
chance you can get that potion that

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.270 
chance you can get that potion that
they're<00:04:01.290> drinking<00:04:01.709> but<00:04:01.860> you<00:04:01.980> have<00:04:02.070> to<00:04:02.160> be

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
they're drinking but you have to be

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.310 
they're drinking but you have to be
really<00:04:02.670> really<00:04:02.700> fast<00:04:03.180> about<00:04:03.510> it<00:04:03.690> so<00:04:04.140> what<00:04:04.290> I

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
really really fast about it so what I

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.820 
really really fast about it so what I
suggest<00:04:04.410> doing<00:04:05.100> is<00:04:05.400> harming<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.120> witch<00:04:06.269> first

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
suggest doing is harming the witch first
