my<00:02:13.830> archer<00:02:14.190> queen<00:02:14.460> is<00:02:14.730> finishing<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.600> base<00:02:15.780> so

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
my archer queen is finishing the base so

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.340 
my archer queen is finishing the base so
it's<00:02:17.010> no<00:02:17.850> way<00:02:18.090> going<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.420> be<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.750> three-star

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
it's no way going to be a three-star

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.220 
it's no way going to be a three-star
because<00:02:19.710> there's<00:02:19.950> only<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.310> few<00:02:20.550> troops

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
because there's only a few troops

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.020 
because there's only a few troops
available<00:02:22.230> right<00:02:22.350> now<00:02:22.410> but<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:23.190> hope<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.730> my

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030

archer<00:02:24.330> queen<00:02:24.540> is<00:02:24.780> going<00:02:24.960> to<00:02:25.110> get<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.620> loot

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
archer queen is going to get the loot

archer queen is going to get the loot
the<00:02:27.240> thing<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.600> hate<00:02:27.630> is<00:02:28.170> when<00:02:28.200> she<00:02:29.390> should<00:02:30.390> at<00:02:30.630> a

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
the thing I hate is when she should at a

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.470 
the thing I hate is when she should at a
wall<00:02:31.050> especially<00:02:31.770> level<00:02:32.370> 11<00:02:32.940> wolves<00:02:33.270> and<00:02:33.360> it

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
wall especially level 11 wolves and it

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.690 
wall especially level 11 wolves and it
takes<00:02:33.720> forever<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.470> then<00:02:34.950> at<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.340> end<00:02:35.370> she

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
takes forever and then at the end she

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.390 
takes forever and then at the end she
change<00:02:36.210> she<00:02:36.600> changes<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.290> target<00:02:38.010> which<00:02:38.190> is<00:02:38.370> a

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
change she changes the target which is a

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.260 
change she changes the target which is a
pain<00:02:38.760> so<00:02:39.660> we<00:02:40.140> are<00:02:40.320> at<00:02:41.240> seventy-three<00:02:42.240> percent

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
pain so we are at seventy-three percent

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.940 
pain so we are at seventy-three percent
of<00:02:42.750> overall<00:02:43.080> damage<00:02:43.320> we<00:02:44.160> have<00:02:44.450> taken<00:02:45.450> 400<00:02:46.410> k<00:02:46.650> of

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950

of overall damage we have taken 400 k of
gold<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:48.320> 390<00:02:49.320> k<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.860> elixir<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.750> still

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
gold and 390 k of elixir and I still

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.610 
gold and 390 k of elixir and I still
have<00:02:52.200> two<00:02:52.560> archers<00:02:52.950> remaining<00:02:53.550> so<00:02:54.390> I<00:02:54.720> put<00:02:55.110> one

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
have two archers remaining so I put one

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.520 
have two archers remaining so I put one
on<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.910> Elector<00:02:57.360> pump<00:02:57.630> right<00:02:57.780> there<00:02:58.050> so<00:02:58.380> we

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
on the Elector pump right there so we

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
on the Elector pump right there so we
can<00:02:58.710> get<00:02:58.890> at<00:02:59.130> 400<00:02:59.970> k<00:03:00.240> da<00:03:00.990> lxr<00:03:01.920> stolen<00:03:02.370> which

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
can get at 400 k da lxr stolen which

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.150 
can get at 400 k da lxr stolen which
isn't<00:03:02.940> bad<00:03:02.970> plus<00:03:03.960> the<00:03:04.230> bonus<00:03:04.500> league<00:03:04.890> in

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
isn't bad plus the bonus league in

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.480 
isn't bad plus the bonus league in
Champions<00:03:05.970> League<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.660> was<00:03:06.840> almost<00:03:07.110> a<00:03:07.740> 1

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
Champions League so that was almost a 1

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.270 
Champions League so that was almost a 1
million<00:03:09.030> loot<00:03:09.450> right<00:03:09.840> if<00:03:10.140> we<00:03:10.650> include<00:03:10.980> the

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
million loot right if we include the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.180 
million loot right if we include the
bonus<00:03:11.790> loot<00:03:12.080> so<00:03:13.080> it's<00:03:13.290> going<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.560> be<00:03:13.680> at<00:03:14.010> the

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
bonus loot so it's going to be at the

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.580 
bonus loot so it's going to be at the
second<00:03:14.640> trade<00:03:14.850> right<00:03:15.120> now<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:15.630> basically

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
second trade right now and basically

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.970 
second trade right now and basically
it's<00:03:16.920> it<00:03:17.250> looks<00:03:17.550> pretty<00:03:17.820> much<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.090> same<00:03:18.330> as

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
it's it looks pretty much the same as

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.930 
it's it looks pretty much the same as
the<00:03:19.980> base<00:03:20.160> before<00:03:20.460> I<00:03:20.970> put<00:03:21.420> exactly<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:23.670> two

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
the base before I put exactly the two

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.180 
the base before I put exactly the two
jump<00:03:24.300> spell<00:03:24.540> in<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.990> same<00:03:25.170> position<00:03:25.740> the<00:03:25.980> to

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
jump spell in the same position the to

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.820

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
golem as you can see this guy has one

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.250 
golem as you can see this guy has one
pecker<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.310> ten<00:03:32.730> archers<00:03:33.240> in<00:03:33.480> his<00:03:34.020> clan

pecker and ten archers in his clan
castle<00:03:34.470> which<00:03:34.890> is<00:03:35.070> pretty<00:03:35.280> weird<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:35.940> it<00:03:36.480> was

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
castle which is pretty weird and it was

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.850 
castle which is pretty weird and it was
pretty<00:03:37.290> easy<00:03:37.440> to<00:03:37.830> destroy<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.310> then<00:03:39.150> i<00:03:39.210> put<00:03:39.330> my

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
pretty easy to destroy it then i put my

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.580 
pretty easy to destroy it then i put my
free<00:03:40.860> spell<00:03:41.190> on<00:03:41.460> one<00:03:42.030> inferno<00:03:42.900> set<00:03:43.230> up<00:03:43.380> on

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
free spell on one inferno set up on

free spell on one inferno set up on
single<00:03:44.160> targets<00:03:44.610> and<00:03:44.820> I<00:03:45.030> think<00:03:45.540> honestly<00:03:45.810> it

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
single targets and I think honestly it

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.970 
single targets and I think honestly it
was<00:03:47.010> um<00:03:47.450> too<00:03:48.450> early<00:03:48.930> to<00:03:49.110> put<00:03:49.290> that<00:03:49.440> free<00:03:49.680> spell

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
and you will see later the consequences

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.390 
and you will see later the consequences
of<00:03:53.010> that<00:03:53.100> free<00:03:53.700> spell<00:03:54.030> so<00:03:54.750> now<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:54.960> have<00:03:55.170> uses<00:03:56.160> I

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.260 
of that free spell so now I have uses I

have used my barbarian King ability and
it's<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:01.260> have<00:04:01.980> used<00:04:02.220> it<00:04:02.490> too<00:04:03.000> early<00:04:03.030> as<00:04:03.480> well<00:04:03.750> as

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
it's I have used it too early as well as

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.950 
it's I have used it too early as well as
because<00:04:04.470> as<00:04:04.590> you<00:04:04.680> can<00:04:04.710> see<00:04:04.860> the<00:04:05.160> inferno<00:04:05.520> tower

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
because as you can see the inferno tower

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.870 
because as you can see the inferno tower
destroyed<00:04:06.960> him<00:04:07.290> in<00:04:07.590> a<00:04:08.010> matter<00:04:08.190> of<00:04:08.280> seconds

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
destroyed him in a matter of seconds

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.170 
destroyed him in a matter of seconds
which<00:04:09.150> was<00:04:09.360> a<00:04:09.390> pain<00:04:09.720> so<00:04:10.130> we<00:04:11.130> still<00:04:11.550> had<00:04:11.820> the<00:04:12.000> two

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
which was a pain so we still had the two

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.020 
which was a pain so we still had the two
stars<00:04:12.570> but<00:04:13.350> now<00:04:13.710> let's<00:04:14.130> try<00:04:14.430> to<00:04:14.460> get<00:04:14.820> the

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
stars but now let's try to get the

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.750 
stars but now let's try to get the
three-star<00:04:15.630> because<00:04:16.020> we<00:04:16.200> still<00:04:16.470> have<00:04:16.760> three

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
three-star because we still have three

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.210 
three-star because we still have three
huge<00:04:18.420> golems<00:04:18.900> on<00:04:19.140> the<00:04:19.320> left<00:04:19.560> side<00:04:19.739> of<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:20.040> base

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
huge golems on the left side of the base

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.240 
huge golems on the left side of the base
my<00:04:20.790> archer<00:04:21.120> queen<00:04:21.450> is<00:04:21.720> slowly<00:04:22.109> dying<00:04:22.470> by<00:04:23.010> those

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
don't think we're going to make it but

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.140 
don't think we're going to make it but
that<00:05:11.300> was<00:05:11.479> so<00:05:11.719> close<00:05:12.020> if<00:05:12.259> I<00:05:12.979> have<00:05:13.190> used<00:05:13.550> my

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
that was so close if I have used my

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.920 
that was so close if I have used my
barbarian<00:05:14.990> King<00:05:15.409> ability<00:05:16.190> better<00:05:16.610> and<00:05:17.029> if<00:05:17.659> I

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
barbarian King ability better and if I

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.820 
barbarian King ability better and if I
had<00:05:18.110> make<00:05:18.650> made<00:05:19.279> a<00:05:19.490> better<00:05:20.289> placement<00:05:21.289> of<00:05:21.740> that

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
had make made a better placement of that

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.469 
had make made a better placement of that
free<00:05:22.310> spell<00:05:22.639> and<00:05:22.909> maybe<00:05:23.860> later<00:05:24.860> on<00:05:25.210> we<00:05:26.210> could

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
free spell and maybe later on we could

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.839 
free spell and maybe later on we could
have<00:05:26.719> got<00:05:27.110> the<00:05:27.529> 3<00:05:27.830> stars<00:05:28.159> so<00:05:28.460> it<00:05:28.610> was<00:05:28.819> a

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:28.849 
have got the 3 stars so it was a

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:33.100 
have got the 3 stars so it was a
ninety-three<00:05:29.750> percent<00:05:30.310> right<00:05:31.310> with<00:05:31.639> 500<00:05:32.389> k

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
ninety-three percent right with 500 k

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.399 
ninety-three percent right with 500 k
gold<00:05:33.800> so<00:05:34.159> it<00:05:34.310> wasn't<00:05:34.580> bad<00:05:34.819> at<00:05:34.969> all<00:05:35.150> but<00:05:35.960> we

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409 
gold so it wasn't bad at all but we

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:38.110 
gold so it wasn't bad at all but we
could<00:05:36.620> have<00:05:36.889> a<00:05:37.099> three<00:05:37.370> star<00:05:37.610> dead<00:05:37.849> base

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120
