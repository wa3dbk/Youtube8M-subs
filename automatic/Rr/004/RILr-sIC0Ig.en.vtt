40s but I have right now it's disease so

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.179 
40s but I have right now it's disease so
I<00:00:26.730> need<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> little<00:00:27.420> bit<00:00:27.570> longer<00:00:27.840> glove<00:00:28.260> if<00:00:28.920> you

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
I need a little bit longer glove if you

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.730 
I need a little bit longer glove if you
have<00:00:29.429> really<00:00:30.179> sensitive<00:00:30.420> hands<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.470> cold

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
have really sensitive hands to the cold

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.610 
have really sensitive hands to the cold
then<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.550> may<00:00:32.730> not<00:00:33.000> find<00:00:33.840> these<00:00:34.050> warm<00:00:34.380> enough

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
then you may not find these warm enough

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.370 
then you may not find these warm enough
they're<00:00:35.190> billed<00:00:35.489> as<00:00:35.640> three<00:00:35.940> season<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.660> think<00:00:37.260> I

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
they're billed as three season I think I

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.990 
they're billed as three season I think I
could<00:00:37.530> probably<00:00:37.739> wear<00:00:38.160> these<00:00:38.340> if<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.760> was<00:00:38.879> in

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
could probably wear these if it was in

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.569 
could probably wear these if it was in
the<00:00:39.059> 50s<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:40.469> do<00:00:40.530> need<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.219> wear<00:00:41.399> gloves

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
the 50s and I do need to wear gloves

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.049 
the 50s and I do need to wear gloves
when<00:00:41.879> it's<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.210> 50s<00:00:43.340> the<00:00:44.340> idea<00:00:44.820> behind

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
when it's in the 50s the idea behind

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.119 
when it's in the 50s the idea behind
these<00:00:45.390> gloves<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.500> there's<00:00:46.739> windproof

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
these gloves is that there's windproof

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.459 
these gloves is that there's windproof
protection<00:00:47.219> on<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.879> back<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.420> there's<00:00:49.110> mesh

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
protection on the back and there's mesh

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.250 
protection on the back and there's mesh
on<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.190> palm<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.239> if<00:00:51.570> your<00:00:51.930> hands<00:00:52.110> are

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
on the palm and so if your hands are

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.020 
on the palm and so if your hands are
cold<00:00:52.440> then<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.579> know<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:53.910> your

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
cold then you you know you have your

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.979 
cold then you you know you have your
fists<00:00:54.360> closed

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
fists closed

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.939 
fists closed
they<00:00:55.289> say<00:00:55.500> clenched<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:57.949> description

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
they say clenched on the the description

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.319 
they say clenched on the the description
but<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.219> don't<00:00:59.550> really<00:00:59.670> want<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.940> run<00:01:00.090> with

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
but you don't really want to run with

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.849 
but you don't really want to run with
your<00:01:00.449> fists<00:01:00.840> clenched<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.590> have<00:01:01.770> your

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
your fists clenched so you have your

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.039 
your fists clenched so you have your
fists<00:01:02.129> closed<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.699> then<00:01:03.239> if<00:01:03.390> your<00:01:03.600> hands<00:01:03.840> get

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
fists closed and then if your hands get

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.630 
fists closed and then if your hands get
hot<00:01:04.290> then<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.650> open<00:01:04.979> them<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.220> then<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.430> have

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
hot then you open them and then you have

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.320 
hot then you open them and then you have
the<00:01:05.850> breathable<00:01:06.270> mesh<00:01:07.400> it<00:01:08.400> has<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> nice<00:01:08.970> watch

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
the breathable mesh it has a nice watch

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.899 
the breathable mesh it has a nice watch
cutout<00:01:09.840> which<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.530> liked<00:01:10.740> then<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.700> don't<00:01:11.820> have

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
cutout which I liked then you don't have

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.690 
cutout which I liked then you don't have
to<00:01:11.970> pull<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.360> watch<00:01:12.540> down<00:01:13.130> it<00:01:14.130> has<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> keyed

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
to pull the watch down it has a keyed

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.080 
to pull the watch down it has a keyed
pocket<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.330> one<00:01:15.540> palm<00:01:15.810> but<00:01:16.140> I'm<00:01:16.740> not<00:01:16.920> sure<00:01:17.220> if<00:01:17.700> I

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
pocket on one palm but I'm not sure if I

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.539 
pocket on one palm but I'm not sure if I
would<00:01:18.570> ever<00:01:18.600> really<00:01:19.140> use<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:20.220> does<00:01:20.400> it

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
would ever really use that it does it

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.609 
would ever really use that it does it
really<00:01:21.330> seemed<00:01:21.720> very<00:01:21.869> functional<00:01:22.409> because

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
really seemed very functional because

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.780 
really seemed very functional because
it's<00:01:22.890> pretty<00:01:23.100> small<00:01:24.530> well<00:01:25.530> one<00:01:26.040> thing<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.549> also

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
it's pretty small well one thing I also

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.620 
it's pretty small well one thing I also
noticed<00:01:27.420> about<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:29.390> have<00:01:30.390> velcro

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
noticed about it is that I have velcro

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.649 
noticed about it is that I have velcro
on<00:01:31.229> my<00:01:31.500> hike<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:31.950> my<00:01:32.130> hydration<00:01:32.610> pack<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.479> get

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
on my hike on my hydration pack to get

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.890 
on my hike on my hydration pack to get
it<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.470> get<00:01:34.619> my<00:01:34.740> views<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.220> things<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.900> I

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
it and to get my views and things and I

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.660 
it and to get my views and things and I
thought<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.799> just<00:01:38.040> my<00:01:38.130> first<00:01:38.369> time

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
thought this is just my first time

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.310 
thought this is just my first time
wearing<00:01:38.939> them<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.360> it's<00:01:39.509> already<00:01:39.869> starting

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
wearing them and it's already starting

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.039 
wearing them and it's already starting
to<00:01:40.500> fray<00:01:40.829> because<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.060> velcro<00:01:42.270> gets<00:01:42.750> caught

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
to fray because the velcro gets caught

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.789 
to fray because the velcro gets caught
on<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:44.570> fingertips<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:46.140> that's<00:01:46.439> probably

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
on the fingertips so that's probably

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.530 
on the fingertips so that's probably
going<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.189> not<00:01:47.549> last<00:01:47.850> very<00:01:48.000> long

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
going to not last very long

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.690 
going to not last very long
for<00:01:48.689> me<00:01:48.840> but<00:01:49.380> if<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.680> don't<00:01:49.829> have<00:01:49.950> velcro<00:01:50.159> then

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
for me but if you don't have velcro then

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.969 
for me but if you don't have velcro then
it's<00:01:51.360> not<00:01:51.570> going<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.780> matter<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.259> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
it's not going to matter to you the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.130 
it's not going to matter to you the
other<00:01:53.100> thing<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.630> doesn't<00:01:54.990> have

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
other thing is is that it doesn't have

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.139 
other thing is is that it doesn't have
the<00:01:55.170> e<00:01:55.380> tip<00:01:55.770> where<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.369> can<00:01:56.549> use<00:01:56.820> your

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
the e tip where you can use your

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.350 
the e tip where you can use your
smartphone<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.549> I<00:01:59.549> have<00:01:59.729> another<00:01:59.969> pair<00:02:00.240> of

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
smartphone and I have another pair of

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.560 
smartphone and I have another pair of
North<00:02:00.509> Face<00:02:00.719> gloves<00:02:01.049> that

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
North Face gloves that

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.930 
North Face gloves that
you<00:02:01.659> have<00:02:01.900> that<00:02:02.170> and<00:02:02.440> I<00:02:03.010> probably<00:02:03.490> will<00:02:03.790> never

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
you have that and I probably will never

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.670 
you have that and I probably will never
buy<00:02:04.240> another<00:02:04.540> pair<00:02:04.840> again<00:02:05.080> without<00:02:05.320> it

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
buy another pair again without it

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.609 
buy another pair again without it
because<00:02:06.640> you<00:02:07.479> know<00:02:07.570> I<00:02:07.600> do<00:02:07.990> have<00:02:08.229> a<00:02:08.289> smartphone

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
because you know I do have a smartphone

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.980 
because you know I do have a smartphone
and<00:02:09.009> I<00:02:09.190> was<00:02:09.340> out<00:02:09.460> on<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.759> trail<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:10.420> I<00:02:10.810> used

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
and I was out on the trail and I used

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.510 
and I was out on the trail and I used
the<00:02:11.110> RunKeeper<00:02:11.440> app<00:02:11.709> and<00:02:11.950> I<00:02:11.980> needed<00:02:12.160> to<00:02:12.370> adjust

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
the RunKeeper app and I needed to adjust

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.230 
the RunKeeper app and I needed to adjust
something<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:13.600> I<00:02:14.410> could<00:02:14.650> not<00:02:14.890> get<00:02:15.850> it<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.120> do

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
something and I could not get it to do

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.030 
something and I could not get it to do
anything<00:02:16.780> so<00:02:17.110> I<00:02:17.140> had<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.380> take<00:02:17.470> my<00:02:17.650> glove<00:02:17.860> off

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
anything so I had to take my glove off

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.190 
anything so I had to take my glove off
and<00:02:18.459> then<00:02:18.580> my<00:02:18.730> hands<00:02:18.940> were<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:19.300> frozen<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:19.959> I

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
and then my hands were so frozen that I

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.160 
and then my hands were so frozen that I
couldn't<00:02:20.709> get<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.980> glove<00:02:21.160> back<00:02:21.400> on<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:22.170> so

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
couldn't get the glove back on and so

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.780 
couldn't get the glove back on and so
it's<00:02:23.560> something<00:02:23.740> else<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.100> think<00:02:24.340> about<00:02:24.459> if

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
it's something else to think about if

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.330 
it's something else to think about if
you<00:02:25.000> if<00:02:25.360> you<00:02:25.900> have<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.230> smartphone<00:02:26.709> that<00:02:27.100> they

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
you if you have a smartphone that they

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.400 
you if you have a smartphone that they
are<00:02:27.520> difficult<00:02:27.820> to<00:02:28.150> use<00:02:28.270> with<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.110> smartphone

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
are difficult to use with the smartphone

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.800 
are difficult to use with the smartphone
but<00:02:30.220> I'm<00:02:30.580> going<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:30.820> try<00:02:30.970> them<00:02:31.090> again<00:02:31.150> with

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
but I'm going to try them again with

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.990 
but I'm going to try them again with
temperatures<00:02:32.440> in<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.590> 50s<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:33.280> see<00:02:33.760> how<00:02:33.850> they

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
temperatures in the 50s and see how they

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.520 
temperatures in the 50s and see how they
do

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.710

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
uglies but as far as gloves go they're

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.730 
uglies but as far as gloves go they're
probably<00:03:00.700> one<00:03:01.090> of<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.300> better<00:03:01.450> ones<00:03:01.780> I<00:03:02.050> almost

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
probably one of the better ones I almost

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
the 40s or less but these um these were

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.030 
the 40s or less but these um these were
pretty<00:03:07.570> good<00:03:07.780> what<00:03:08.020> I'd<00:03:08.110> really<00:03:08.500> like<00:03:08.800> about

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040

pretty good what I'd really like about
them<00:03:09.460> is<00:03:09.490> that<00:03:09.880> it<00:03:09.970> has<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.300> e<00:03:10.330> tip<00:03:11.160> technology

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
I took a few pictures and I just I use

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.280 
I took a few pictures and I just I use
the<00:03:21.550> RunKeeper<00:03:21.940> app<00:03:22.240> and<00:03:22.570> I<00:03:22.600> was<00:03:22.720> able<00:03:22.870> to<00:03:23.050> do

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
the RunKeeper app and I was able to do

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.700 
the RunKeeper app and I was able to do
some<00:03:23.470> stuff<00:03:23.710> on<00:03:23.860> that<00:03:24.100> so<00:03:25.110> um<00:03:26.110> it<00:03:26.320> works

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
some stuff on that so um it works

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.340 
some stuff on that so um it works
definitely<00:03:27.490> works<00:03:27.730> that<00:03:28.300> silicone<00:03:28.840> treated

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
definitely works that silicone treated

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.890 
definitely works that silicone treated
palms<00:03:29.680> for<00:03:30.130> a<00:03:30.190> grip<00:03:30.430> which<00:03:31.030> I<00:03:31.210> am<00:03:31.360> going<00:03:31.570> to<00:03:31.660> try

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
palms for a grip which I am going to try

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.350 
palms for a grip which I am going to try
I<00:03:31.930> don't<00:03:32.650> get<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:33.070> ride<00:03:33.250> outside<00:03:33.670> very<00:03:33.940> much<00:03:34.150> in

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
I don't get to ride outside very much in

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.560 
I don't get to ride outside very much in
the<00:03:34.420> winter<00:03:34.540> because<00:03:34.900> of<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:35.230> cold<00:03:35.320> but<00:03:36.250> I<00:03:36.790> am

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
the winter because of the cold but I am

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.450 
the winter because of the cold but I am
going<00:03:37.750> to<00:03:37.810> try<00:03:37.990> riding<00:03:38.440> with<00:03:38.560> these<00:03:38.770> because<00:03:39.340> I

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460 
going to try riding with these because I

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.250 
going to try riding with these because I
think<00:03:39.730> that<00:03:39.910> it<00:03:40.120> would<00:03:40.210> have<00:03:40.360> good<00:03:40.570> grip<00:03:41.730> the

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
think that it would have good grip the

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.550 
think that it would have good grip the
the<00:03:44.260> gloves<00:03:44.590> come<00:03:44.800> up<00:03:44.980> over<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.490> watch<00:03:46.560> which

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
the gloves come up over the watch which

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.110 
the gloves come up over the watch which
survived<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.070> North<00:03:48.190> Face<00:03:48.490> gloves<00:03:48.850> don't

survived the North Face gloves don't
have<00:03:49.210> a<00:03:49.240> little<00:03:49.450> cutout<00:03:49.840> for<00:03:50.050> the<00:03:50.110> watch<00:03:50.320> so<00:03:50.620> I

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
have a little cutout for the watch so I

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.530 
have a little cutout for the watch so I
did<00:03:50.890> have<00:03:51.010> to<00:03:51.130> pull<00:03:51.310> it<00:03:51.400> down<00:03:51.460> but<00:03:51.970> if<00:03:52.210> it's

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
did have to pull it down but if it's
