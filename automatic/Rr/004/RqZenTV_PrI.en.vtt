hey youtube so today is my watch day and

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.680 
hey youtube so today is my watch day and
I<00:00:04.020> thought<00:00:04.319> I<00:00:04.819> go<00:00:05.819> ahead<00:00:05.910> and<00:00:06.000> make<00:00:06.180> my<00:00:06.330> video

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
I thought I go ahead and make my video

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.459 
I thought I go ahead and make my video
and<00:00:07.589> I<00:00:08.189> was<00:00:08.309> thinking<00:00:08.580> about<00:00:09.320> people<00:00:10.320> out

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
and I was thinking about people out

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.379 
and I was thinking about people out
there<00:00:10.769> who<00:00:11.099> are<00:00:11.130> either<00:00:11.400> thinking<00:00:12.240> about

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
there who are either thinking about

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.870 
there who are either thinking about
going<00:00:12.509> natural<00:00:12.780> or<00:00:13.290> if<00:00:13.769> you're<00:00:14.219> doing<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.700> big

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
going natural or if you're doing the big

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.680 
going natural or if you're doing the big
cut<00:00:15.260> big<00:00:16.260> chop<00:00:16.529> whatever<00:00:16.949> it's<00:00:17.250> called<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.699> I

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
cut big chop whatever it's called and I

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.290 
cut big chop whatever it's called and I
just<00:00:19.230> think<00:00:19.439> how<00:00:19.529> much<00:00:19.560> all<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:19.980> started<00:00:20.760> fan

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
just think how much all I started fan

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.320 
just think how much all I started fan
maybe<00:00:22.199> there<00:00:22.529> are<00:00:22.800> some<00:00:22.859> tips<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:24.000> can

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
maybe there are some tips that I can

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.920 
maybe there are some tips that I can
give<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.660> someone<00:00:25.260> going<00:00:25.710> natural<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:26.930> i'll

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
give to someone going natural so i'll

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.620 
give to someone going natural so i'll
list<00:00:28.380> maybe<00:00:28.619> five<00:00:29.369> or<00:00:29.400> six<00:00:29.760> things<00:00:29.849> that'll<00:00:30.539> be

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
list maybe five or six things that'll be

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.659 
list maybe five or six things that'll be
good<00:00:30.779> for<00:00:31.080> someone<00:00:31.320> who<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.769> going<00:00:32.070> natural<00:00:32.309> so

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
good for someone who is going natural so

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.310 
good for someone who is going natural so
the<00:00:32.790> first<00:00:33.059> thing<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.899> think<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.230> very

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
the first thing that I think is very

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.380 
the first thing that I think is very
important<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:36.950> if<00:00:37.950> you're<00:00:38.489> holding<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.030> to

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
important is if you're holding on to

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.350 
important is if you're holding on to
your<00:00:39.540> natural<00:00:39.780> hair<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.399> relax<00:00:41.730> ends

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
your natural hair and the relax ends

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.279 
your natural hair and the relax ends
your<00:00:43.260> hair<00:00:43.680> texture<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.280> going<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.730> appear

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
your hair texture is going to appear

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.750 
your hair texture is going to appear
different<00:00:46.289> than<00:00:46.559> what<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.860> actually<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
different than what it actually is the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.479 
different than what it actually is the
reason<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.420> say<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.840> because<00:00:49.280> with<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
reason I say that is because with the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.619 
reason I say that is because with the
extra<00:00:51.440> relaxed<00:00:52.440> ends<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.070> end<00:00:53.489> its<00:00:54.300> kind

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
extra relaxed ends on the end its kind

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.740 
extra relaxed ends on the end its kind
of<00:00:54.750> weighing<00:00:55.020> down<00:00:55.440> your<00:00:55.800> natural<00:00:56.579> texture<00:00:57.149> so

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
of weighing down your natural texture so

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.270 
of weighing down your natural texture so
it<00:00:58.109> may<00:00:58.379> coin<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> different<00:00:59.460> way<00:00:59.670> with<00:01:00.270> those

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
it may coin a different way with those

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.100 
it may coin a different way with those
relaxed<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:02.969> don't<00:01:03.420> be<00:01:03.510> surprised<00:01:03.870> when

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
relaxed in so don't be surprised when

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.140 
relaxed in so don't be surprised when
you<00:01:04.260> cut<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.769> relax<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.369> off<00:01:05.729> if<00:01:06.119> you're

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
you cut the relax in off if you're

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.820 
you cut the relax in off if you're
texture<00:01:06.659> does<00:01:06.840> something<00:01:07.290> completely

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
texture does something completely

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.679 
texture does something completely
different<00:01:08.040> than<00:01:08.250> what<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.580> did<00:01:08.729> with<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
different than what it did with the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.800 
different than what it did with the
weight<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.790> relaxed<00:01:11.790> ends<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.659> that's

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
weight of the relaxed ends so that's

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.730 
weight of the relaxed ends so that's
number<00:01:12.990> one<00:01:13.580> number<00:01:14.580> two<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:16.110> know<00:01:16.530> in

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
number one number two is that I know in

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.859 
number one number two is that I know in
my<00:01:16.770> experience<00:01:18.200> when<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.500> did<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> big<00:01:20.189> chop

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
my experience when I did the big chop

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.899 
my experience when I did the big chop
and<00:01:21.869> as<00:01:22.049> my<00:01:22.229> hair<00:01:22.530> started<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.979> grow<00:01:23.369> and

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
and as my hair started to grow and

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.450 
and as my hair started to grow and
started<00:01:24.600> growing<00:01:24.810> down<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.650> mean<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.369> could

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
started growing down I mean you could

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.609 
started growing down I mean you could
probably<00:01:26.520> tell<00:01:26.790> like<00:01:27.479> with<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.810> my<00:01:28.380> hair

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
probably tell like with this my hair

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.390 
probably tell like with this my hair
grows<00:01:29.040> down<00:01:29.460> now<00:01:29.880> rather<00:01:30.390> than<00:01:30.540> out<00:01:31.320> like<00:01:32.130> when

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
grows down now rather than out like when

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.170 
grows down now rather than out like when
I<00:01:32.430> first<00:01:32.670> had<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.390> afro<00:01:34.610> it<00:01:35.610> would<00:01:35.759> grow<00:01:35.939> cut

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
I first had the afro it would grow cut

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.630 
I first had the afro it would grow cut
it<00:01:36.299> up<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.990> was<00:01:37.049> growing<00:01:37.290> up<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.860> out<00:01:38.220> and

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
it up and it was growing up and out and

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.690 
it up and it was growing up and out and
so<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.570> hope<00:01:39.750> I'm<00:01:39.900> making<00:01:39.930> sense<00:01:40.470> as<00:01:41.280> my<00:01:41.520> hair

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
so I hope I'm making sense as my hair

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.880 
so I hope I'm making sense as my hair
started<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.090> grow<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.659> started<00:01:43.380> flattening

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
started to grow it started flattening

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.700 
started to grow it started flattening
out<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.399> growing<00:01:44.820> like<00:01:45.540> when<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.750> wash<00:01:46.380> my<00:01:46.560> hair

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
out and growing like when I wash my hair

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.340 
out and growing like when I wash my hair
I<00:01:46.920> can<00:01:47.610> see<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.000> flopping<00:01:48.390> down<00:01:48.570> instead<00:01:49.290> of

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
I can see it flopping down instead of

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.950 
I can see it flopping down instead of
flopping<00:01:49.649> out<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.369> that's<00:01:50.880> number<00:01:51.240> two<00:01:51.600> is

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
flopping out so that's number two is

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.959 
flopping out so that's number two is
that<00:01:52.140> as<00:01:52.409> your<00:01:52.649> hair<00:01:52.860> grows<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:55.820> texture<00:01:56.820> will

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
that as your hair grows the texture will

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.179 
that as your hair grows the texture will
change<00:01:57.240> as<00:01:57.420> well<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.899> no<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.619> said<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.979> it'll

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
change as well I no I said that it'll

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.039 
change as well I no I said that it'll
roll<00:01:59.340> down<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.030> think<00:02:00.270> also<00:02:00.420> like<00:02:00.750> with<00:02:00.930> my

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
roll down and I think also like with my

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.870 
roll down and I think also like with my
hair<00:02:01.320> my<00:02:01.740> texture<00:02:02.130> started<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.549> change<00:02:02.729> I

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
hair my texture started to change I

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.590 
hair my texture started to change I
guess<00:02:03.890> with<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.040> being<00:02:05.070> more<00:02:05.670> like<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.360> said

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
guess with it being more like I said

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.469 
guess with it being more like I said
going<00:02:06.840> downward<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:07.829> number<00:02:08.819> three

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
going downward so number three

tell<00:06:27.450> you<00:06:27.510> this<00:06:27.660> one<00:06:27.870> story<00:06:28.730> when<00:06:29.730> I<00:06:29.760> was

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
tell you this one story when I was

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.480 
tell you this one story when I was
relaxed<00:06:30.750> I<00:06:30.840> had<00:06:31.080> a<00:06:31.110> piece<00:06:31.470> of<00:06:31.500> hair<00:06:31.920> right<00:06:32.280> in

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
relaxed I had a piece of hair right in

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.580 
relaxed I had a piece of hair right in
the<00:06:32.610> back<00:06:32.760> of<00:06:32.940> my<00:06:32.970> hair<00:06:33.330> and<00:06:33.510> back<00:06:34.139> of<00:06:34.260> my<00:06:34.350> head

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 
the back of my hair and back of my head

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.280 
the back of my hair and back of my head
and<00:06:34.740> it<00:06:35.250> would<00:06:35.430> not<00:06:35.669> grow<00:06:35.940> I<00:06:35.970> tell<00:06:36.300> you<00:06:36.450> it

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:37.290 
and it would not grow I tell you it

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.920 
and it would not grow I tell you it
probably<00:06:37.500> would<00:06:37.860> grow<00:06:38.070> maybe<00:06:38.340> two<00:06:39.270> inches<00:06:39.480> at

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
probably would grow maybe two inches at

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.590 
probably would grow maybe two inches at
the<00:06:40.050> most<00:06:40.260> I'm<00:06:40.590> not<00:06:40.919> kidding<00:06:40.980> two<00:06:41.970> inches<00:06:42.419> and

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 
the most I'm not kidding two inches and

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.190 
the most I'm not kidding two inches and
that's<00:06:42.810> it<00:06:43.110> and<00:06:43.880> my<00:06:44.880> mother<00:06:45.150> actually<00:06:45.510> told<00:06:46.080> me

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.200 
that's it and my mother actually told me

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.960 
that's it and my mother actually told me
maybe<00:06:46.740> it<00:06:46.860> was<00:06:46.950> the<00:06:47.010> way<00:06:47.160> I<00:06:47.190> was<00:06:47.310> sleeping

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:47.970 
maybe it was the way I was sleeping

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.370 
maybe it was the way I was sleeping
because<00:06:48.270> I<00:06:48.450> was<00:06:48.480> always<00:06:48.720> sleeping<00:06:49.230> on<00:06:49.320> the

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 
because I was always sleeping on the

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.230 
because I was always sleeping on the
back<00:06:49.560> of<00:06:49.590> my<00:06:49.800> head<00:06:50.010> and<00:06:50.610> I<00:06:50.730> just<00:06:50.970> kind<00:06:51.180> of

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 
back of my head and I just kind of

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.629 
back of my head and I just kind of
believes<00:06:51.840> if<00:06:52.050> that's<00:06:52.230> what<00:06:52.440> it<00:06:52.530> was<00:06:52.680> and<00:06:52.980> in

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 
believes if that's what it was and in

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:57.020 
believes if that's what it was and in
actuality<00:06:54.300> that<00:06:55.280> one<00:06:56.280> little<00:06:56.520> piece<00:06:56.790> it

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
actuality that one little piece it

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.780 
actuality that one little piece it
wouldn't<00:06:57.419> take<00:06:57.570> a<00:06:57.600> perm<00:06:57.900> either<00:06:58.200> so<00:06:59.070> it<00:06:59.610> was

00:06:59.780 --> 00:06:59.790 
wouldn't take a perm either so it was

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.300 
wouldn't take a perm either so it was
really<00:07:00.060> two<00:07:00.419> inches<00:07:00.780> short<00:07:01.020> and<00:07:01.260> it<00:07:02.100> would<00:07:02.280> not

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.310 
really two inches short and it would not

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.680 
really two inches short and it would not
relax<00:07:02.880> so<00:07:03.750> when<00:07:04.470> I<00:07:04.500> had<00:07:04.740> a<00:07:04.770> relaxer<00:07:05.430> the<00:07:06.180> hair

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:06.690 
relax so when I had a relaxer the hair

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.330 
relax so when I had a relaxer the hair
would<00:07:07.080> the<00:07:07.740> rest<00:07:07.860> of<00:07:07.980> my<00:07:08.040> hair<00:07:08.220> would<00:07:08.310> be

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.340 
would the rest of my hair would be

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.490 
would the rest of my hair would be
straight<00:07:08.700> and<00:07:08.910> that<00:07:09.450> one<00:07:09.720> piece<00:07:09.960> would<00:07:10.260> just

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500 
straight and that one piece would just

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.980 
straight and that one piece would just
be<00:07:11.250> lazy<00:07:11.520> and<00:07:12.120> so<00:07:13.370> that<00:07:14.370> one<00:07:14.640> piece<00:07:14.910> now<00:07:15.270> it's

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:15.990 
be lazy and so that one piece now it's

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.810 
be lazy and so that one piece now it's
the<00:07:16.229> same<00:07:16.470> length<00:07:16.860> as<00:07:17.070> the<00:07:17.100> rest<00:07:17.400> of<00:07:17.490> my<00:07:17.610> hair

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:17.820
