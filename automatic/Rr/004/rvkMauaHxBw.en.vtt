00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Translator: Bader Alhaddad Checker: Ayman Mahmoud 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.126
 She was born and raised in Sierra Leone 

00:00:17.126 --> 00:00:19.371
 Very small and beautiful state 

00:00:19.371 --> 00:00:21.076
 In West Africa, 

00:00:21.076 --> 00:00:23.980
 A country full of material resources 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.312
 Creative talents. 

00:00:26.312 --> 00:00:28.274
 However, her reputation has worsened 

00:00:28.274 --> 00:00:30.688
 In the decade-long rebel war in the 1990s 

00:00:30.688 --> 00:00:33.778
 When entire villages were burned. 

00:00:33.778 --> 00:00:37.990
 And about 8,000 men, women and children 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.256
 Their arms and legs were amputated during that time. 

00:00:42.256 --> 00:00:45.240
 When I fled with my family for our safety 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.932
 From one such attack, I was about 12 years old, 

00:00:47.932 --> 00:00:51.364
 I resolved to do everything in my power 

00:00:51.364 --> 00:00:53.644
 To ensure that my children 

00:00:53.644 --> 00:00:57.030
 They will not go through the same experiences we have experienced. 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.644
 But will, in fact, become part of Sierra Leone 

00:00:59.644 --> 00:01:02.132
 When war is not amputation 

00:01:02.132 --> 00:01:06.838
 Strategy to seize power. 

00:01:06.838 --> 00:01:10.571
 As I follow people I know, love them, 

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:12.462
 Recovering from this destruction, 

00:01:12.462 --> 00:01:15.126
 There was one thing that deeply saddened me 

00:01:15.126 --> 00:01:17.630
 Which is that most of the amputees in the state 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.686
 They did not use prostheses. 

00:01:19.686 --> 00:01:21.642
 The reason, which I tried to find 

00:01:21.642 --> 00:01:24.147
 It was that quarry prostheses 

00:01:24.147 --> 00:01:27.547
 They were hurting because they did not fit their limb limbs. 

00:01:29.437 --> 00:01:31.623
 Artificial limestone quarry is that part 

00:01:31.623 --> 00:01:35.019
 In which a person puts the rest of his amputated limb in it, 

00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:37.299
 Which is attached to the artificial ankle. 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.037
 Even in the developed world, 

00:01:39.037 --> 00:01:42.529
 It takes from 3 weeks to several years 

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:46.791
 The patient gets a comfortable quarry, if not forever. 

00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:49.673
 The prostheses are still using conventional procedures 

00:01:49.673 --> 00:01:52.029
 Such as molding and casting 

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:55.747
 For the manufacture of artificial quarry of one material. 

00:01:55.747 --> 00:01:58.535
 Such quarries caused an intolerable amount 

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:01.363
 Of pressure on the patient's limbs, 

00:02:01.363 --> 00:02:05.663
 Leaves skin ulcers. 

00:02:05.663 --> 00:02:07.775
 Did not matter 

00:02:07.775 --> 00:02:10.997
 How strong is your artificial ankle. 

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:13.693
 If the quarry is uncomfortable, 

00:02:13.693 --> 00:02:15.265
 You will not use your foot, 

00:02:15.265 --> 00:02:18.725
 This is simply unacceptable in our time. 

00:02:18.725 --> 00:02:21.980
 The day I met Professor Hugh Hier 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.435
 About two and a half years ago, 

00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:25.880
 He asked me if Macnet had found a solution to the problem, 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.177
 I said, "No, not yet, 

00:02:27.177 --> 00:02:29.777
 But I am very happy to try it. " 

00:02:29.777 --> 00:02:32.927
 When I was attending my doctorate at MIT, 

00:02:32.927 --> 00:02:36.377
 Designed artificial quarry rate 

00:02:36.377 --> 00:02:38.730
 Quickly and cheaply 

00:02:39.747 --> 00:02:43.242
 More comfortable than conventional prostheses. 

00:02:44.412 --> 00:02:46.799
 Magnetic resonance rays were used 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.851
 To capture the real shape of the patient's limbs, 

00:02:49.851 --> 00:02:53.900
 Then limited molding elements were used to better predict 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.754
 Internal pressure and voltage 

00:02:55.754 --> 00:02:57.717
 On normal forces, 

00:02:57.717 --> 00:03:00.865
 Then an artificial quarry was designed for manufacturing. 

00:03:02.135 --> 00:03:04.508
 We used three-dimensional printers 

00:03:04.628 --> 00:03:08.432
 To make a multi-material artificial quarry 

00:03:09.312 --> 00:03:12.128
 Relieves pressure on some areas when needed 

00:03:12.128 --> 00:03:14.204
 According to patient details. 

00:03:15.424 --> 00:03:17.596
 In short, we used data 

00:03:17.596 --> 00:03:21.157
 For making new quarries cheap and fast. 

00:03:21.817 --> 00:03:24.196
 In a modern experience we covered 

00:03:24.196 --> 00:03:25.162
 In our laboratory, 

00:03:25.162 --> 00:03:28.194
 The case of one of the patients, an American soldier 

00:03:28.194 --> 00:03:30.774
 Truncated limb of about 20 years 

00:03:30.774 --> 00:03:33.340
 He has tried dozens of prostheses, 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.802
 He said about one of our printed artificial limbs, 

00:03:38.372 --> 00:03:41.760
 "It's soft, as if I walk on a pillow, 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.534
 And also very attractive. " 

00:03:44.534 --> 00:03:48.210
 ( Laughter ) 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.558
 Disability in our time 

00:03:51.558 --> 00:03:53.614
 Supposedly do not prevent anyone 

00:03:53.614 --> 00:03:55.677
 To live a meaningful life. 

00:03:55.907 --> 00:03:59.360
 My hope and desire are tools and processes 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.413
 Which we developed in the research group 

00:04:01.413 --> 00:04:04.491
 They are used to provide artificial limbs 

00:04:04.491 --> 00:04:05.929
 For those who need it. 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:07.943
 For me 

00:04:09.043 --> 00:04:11.777
 The starting point for the treatment of souls 

00:04:11.777 --> 00:04:15.451
 Those with war and illness 

00:04:15.801 --> 00:04:20.800
 Are producing comfortable and affordable interfaces for their bodies 

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:24.635
 Whether it is in Surreal or Boston, 

00:04:25.115 --> 00:04:28.283
 I hope that this is not just a restoration 

00:04:28.283 --> 00:04:31.869
 But a certain shift in their sense of human potential. 

00:04:31.869 --> 00:04:33.110
 Thank you very much . 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.054
