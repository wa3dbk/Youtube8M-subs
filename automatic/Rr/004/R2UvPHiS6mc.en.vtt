00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.240
 Father Francisco has asked the church 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.640
 Catholic and the religions of the world a 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.220
 day of prayer and fasting to get the 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.050
 peace in Middle East and all the 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.420
 world 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.700
 the best way to meet in prayer 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.240
 is in family with close relatives 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.730
 and neighbors 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.650
 the parishes can be organized and in 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.840
 prayer times worship 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.360
 Eucharistic but they can also go out to 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.790
 the periphery organize in their neighborhoods and 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.850
 colonies houses of prayer for 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:38.030
 multiply the participants 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.600
 you can meditate the pacem in encyclical 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.240
 Terris of Pope John 23 or other texts 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.420
 about peace 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.580
 the important thing is to reflect on everything 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.920
 with the younger ones the more 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:55.920
 builds on four values 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:01:01.180
 fundamental truth justice love 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.340
 sorry the prayer is also accompanied 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.550
 for fasting 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:11.310
 the Catholic fast is to deprive oneself 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.310
 of something to offer the sacrifice 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.060
 dear parents do not have 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.020
 fear in proposing to the children a 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.210
 austere lunch and minimum will be the 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.490
 occasion to explain what is 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.950
 happening in the world and like these 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.950
 facts can not leave us indifferent 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.930
 do not forget to invite the elderly 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.610
 to this activity is the moment that 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.820
 young people listen to their testimonies 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.340
 the orthodox Roman Catholics and the 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.130
 Eastern Christian churches 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.090

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.710
