00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:09.410
 You want only one video to demonstrate 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:13.799
 where rectifier works here 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:17.699
 transformer the children was the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:24.330
 transformer 220 transforms the 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:34.940
 case here for 12 volts transformer 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:34.940
 of the bridges are 25 perez points 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.800
 the stitches I put four I'm 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.430
 using the 12 of the reserve team 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:55.510
 If I needed a separator, I put it on. 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:01:05.010
 to improve the curve 12 itself with a cooler 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:05.010
 volts also from intel if focus make 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:17.800
 12 points of the intel 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:23.100
 I called the bridge directly. It works. 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:25.780
 is used to cool the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.080
 observer and is already with a serves as 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:35.170
 test turn is working to 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:41.350
 rectifier here is the engine the engine 12 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:44.259
 volts motor bosh and wiper 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.649
 Put windshield one who can 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.649
 Tue 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:02.210
 you can see 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:06.020
 motor 12 volts to this motor 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:12.200
 operates at two speeds two wires 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:14.629
 the land itself and a wire in the 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.510
 low speed and another note 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:22.629
 I'll call at the time you eat 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.629
 more current is red 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:38.079
 Thank you and we are going to test that a 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:38.079
 is working or even at home 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:46.299
 if everything works, it will turn 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.189
 good 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.189
 the short turning 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.189
 consequently the motor 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:21.510
 I'm going to take a break and I'll show you the 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:26.940
 resulting consumption requires that the reason and 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:32.310
 already resumed the good video by returning here 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:34.760
 cooler on but the engine 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.760
 stopped 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:46.530
 I connected a positive wire on a wire 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.110
 red I will not go high 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:04:02.390
 speed when I left it stuck here 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:04:05.850
 with the point of the last day 05 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:10.940
 so lay here on earth in the house he 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.940
 will turn a motor see consumption 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.830
 the consumption 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:43.660
 I do not stay behind 2.3.4 estatiza 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.660
 we were calling children ii 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.919
 this is it but everything working
