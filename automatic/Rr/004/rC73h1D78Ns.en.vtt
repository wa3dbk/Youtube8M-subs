a<00:02:25.110> absolute<00:02:26.040> awesome<00:02:26.250> time<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:27.000> saw<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.630> look

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
a absolute awesome time I saw the look

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.920 
a absolute awesome time I saw the look
on<00:02:27.989> her<00:02:28.140> face<00:02:28.170> when<00:02:28.709> she<00:02:28.890> saw<00:02:29.130> his<00:02:29.370> excitement
