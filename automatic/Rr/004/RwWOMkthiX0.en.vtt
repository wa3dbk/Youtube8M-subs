hi<00:00:06.270> I'm<00:00:06.450> Barry<00:00:06.660> with<00:00:06.840> ICANN<00:00:07.280> today<00:00:08.280> we're

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
hi I'm Barry with ICANN today we're

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.740 
hi I'm Barry with ICANN today we're
going<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:08.580> talk<00:00:08.670> about<00:00:08.790> calibrating<00:00:09.269> your<00:00:09.389> VX

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
going to talk about calibrating your VX

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.680 
going to talk about calibrating your VX
7<00:00:10.049> or<00:00:10.170> VX<00:00:10.469> 9<00:00:10.650> monitor<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:12.030> in<00:00:12.150> doing<00:00:12.270> so<00:00:12.389> you're

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
7 or VX 9 monitor and in doing so you're

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.650 
7 or VX 9 monitor and in doing so you're
in<00:00:12.780> use<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.680> blue<00:00:13.949> gun<00:00:14.580> or<00:00:14.820> blue<00:00:15.059> only<00:00:15.420> feature

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
in use the blue gun or blue only feature

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.200 
in use the blue gun or blue only feature
on<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.350> monitor<00:00:16.680> itself<00:00:17.010> what<00:00:17.640> that<00:00:17.789> does<00:00:18.000> is

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
on the monitor itself what that does is

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.820 
on the monitor itself what that does is
it<00:00:18.330> separates<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.840> blue<00:00:19.140> from<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.500> rest<00:00:19.710> of

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
it separates the blue from the rest of

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.800 
it separates the blue from the rest of
the<00:00:19.920> colors<00:00:20.220> on<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.789> monitor<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.419> can<00:00:21.599> set

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
the colors on the monitor so you can set

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.140 
the colors on the monitor so you can set
the<00:00:22.199> monitor<00:00:22.380> up<00:00:22.619> correctly<00:00:22.919> for<00:00:23.160> our

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
the monitor up correctly for our

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.880 
the monitor up correctly for our
purposes<00:00:24.509> today<00:00:24.689> we've<00:00:25.109> actually<00:00:25.320> assigned

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
purposes today we've actually assigned

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.210 
purposes today we've actually assigned
the<00:00:26.070> blue<00:00:26.220> only<00:00:26.339> to<00:00:26.640> f1<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:28.079> that<00:00:28.289> we<00:00:28.410> can<00:00:28.650> just

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
the blue only to f1 so that we can just

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.189 
the blue only to f1 so that we can just
turn<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.550> on<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:30.480> can<00:00:30.599> assign<00:00:30.839> pretty<00:00:31.109> much

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
turn it on you can assign pretty much

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.600 
turn it on you can assign pretty much
anything<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.560> want<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.099> either<00:00:32.310> one<00:00:32.520> of

anything you want to to either one of

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.660 
anything you want to to either one of
the<00:00:32.669> function<00:00:33.030> keys<00:00:33.380> now<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.980> get<00:00:35.100> started<00:00:35.220> you

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
the function keys now to get started you

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.180 
the function keys now to get started you
have<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.850> have<00:00:36.180> color<00:00:37.050> bars<00:00:37.290> into<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.770> monitor

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
have to have color bars into the monitor

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.700 
have to have color bars into the monitor
and<00:00:38.490> by<00:00:39.120> doing<00:00:39.330> so<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.660> can<00:00:39.810> either<00:00:40.050> have<00:00:40.530> that

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
and by doing so you can either have that

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.950 
and by doing so you can either have that
come<00:00:40.890> from<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.130> camera<00:00:41.370> or<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:42.390> can<00:00:42.570> actually

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
come from a camera or you can actually

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.990 
come from a camera or you can actually
point<00:00:43.560> the<00:00:43.680> camera<00:00:43.830> at<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> color<00:00:44.550> bar<00:00:44.730> chart

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
point the camera at a color bar chart

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.610 
point the camera at a color bar chart
let's<00:00:45.510> talk<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> little<00:00:45.780> bit<00:00:45.960> about<00:00:46.050> setting<00:00:46.530> up

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
let's talk a little bit about setting up

your monitor now on the ICANN vx7 or VX

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.990 
your monitor now on the ICANN vx7 or VX
9<00:00:49.230> we<00:00:49.500> have<00:00:49.620> four<00:00:49.980> separate<00:00:50.430> buttons<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.910> help

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
9 we have four separate buttons to help

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.690 
9 we have four separate buttons to help
you<00:00:51.210> set<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.570> up<00:00:51.780> we<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.650> the<00:00:53.130> brightness

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
you set this up we have the brightness

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.870 
you set this up we have the brightness
contrast<00:00:54.380> chroma<00:00:55.380> and<00:00:55.620> tint<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.730> you're

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
contrast chroma and tint and you're

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.310 
contrast chroma and tint and you're
going<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.090> use<00:00:57.180> all<00:00:57.390> four<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.810> these<00:00:57.990> buttons

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
going to use all four of these buttons

to set it up correctly so you get the

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.910 
to set it up correctly so you get the
proper<00:01:00.750> color<00:01:00.960> calibration<00:01:01.170> from<00:01:01.800> your

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
proper color calibration from your

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.860 
proper color calibration from your
monitor<00:01:02.250> let's<00:01:03.240> start<00:01:03.480> with<00:01:03.600> brightness

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870

monitor let's start with brightness
which<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.830> really<00:01:05.040> your<00:01:05.129> black<00:01:05.430> level<00:01:05.820> now<00:01:06.420> to

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
which is really your black level now to

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.719 
which is really your black level now to
the<00:01:07.200> right<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.650> down<00:01:07.920> at<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.189> bottom<00:01:08.400> here

there<00:01:08.759> are<00:01:09.090> three<00:01:09.570> small<00:01:10.289> bars<00:01:10.909> from<00:01:11.909> left<00:01:12.509> to

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
there are three small bars from left to

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.800 
there are three small bars from left to
right<00:01:12.960> there's<00:01:13.740> blacker<00:01:14.130> than<00:01:14.340> black<00:01:14.810> black

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
right there's blacker than black black

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.919 
right there's blacker than black black
and<00:01:16.109> slightly<00:01:16.979> gray<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:18.240> those<00:01:18.450> three<00:01:18.689> bars

00:01:18.919 --> 00:01:18.929 
and slightly gray in those three bars

and slightly gray in those three bars
you're<00:01:19.439> going<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.619> set<00:01:19.829> up<00:01:19.859> the<00:01:20.039> brightness<00:01:20.249> by

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
you're going to set up the brightness by

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.469 
you're going to set up the brightness by
pushing<00:01:21.359> it<00:01:21.569> in<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.749> monitor<00:01:23.179> so<00:01:24.179> that<00:01:24.210> you

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
pushing it in the monitor so that you

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.370 
pushing it in the monitor so that you
can<00:01:24.630> only<00:01:24.840> really<00:01:25.229> see<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:26.369> slightly<00:01:26.789> gray

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.899 

now<00:01:31.380> you've<00:01:31.590> set<00:01:31.799> your<00:01:31.920> black<00:01:32.159> level<00:01:32.490> let's

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
now you've set your black level let's

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.550 
now you've set your black level let's
talk<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> little<00:01:33.210> bit<00:01:33.359> about<00:01:33.630> contrast<00:01:34.229> and

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
talk a little bit about contrast and

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.760 
talk a little bit about contrast and
tint<00:01:35.189> or<00:01:35.609> sometimes<00:01:35.999> known<00:01:36.149> as<00:01:36.179> phase<00:01:36.770> with
