 of commercials when under the machine is 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.750
 not used to operate commands 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.820
 from the ground 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.370
 it is enough for the operator to turn the 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.020
 key to the ground position and to act on the 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.010
 joysticks in the same way as for 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:02.140
 controls in the pod a button

 machine in case of emergency either from the 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.920
 ground either from the nacelle 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.320
 a simple key on the control station 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.240
 on the ground allows the operator to isolate 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.370
 orders in the carrycot and prohibit 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.010
 any abuse of use from 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.260
 ground controls 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.750
 so here's the nive 620 profitable and 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.000
 easy to maintain the speed of the
