we produce a lot of melanin that's the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
use or a chemical or a rash we can get

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.700 
use or a chemical or a rash we can get
these<00:00:50.770> extra<00:00:51.040> pigment<00:00:51.870> cells<00:00:52.870> in<00:00:53.170> our<00:00:53.260> body<00:00:53.500> to

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
these extra pigment cells in our body to

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.100 
these extra pigment cells in our body to
produce<00:00:53.860> more<00:00:54.430> melanin<00:00:54.820> more<00:00:55.059> pigment<00:00:55.510> and<00:00:55.690> we

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
produce more melanin more pigment and we

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.500 
produce more melanin more pigment and we
can<00:00:56.290> get<00:00:56.469> what's<00:00:56.680> called<00:00:56.890> post<00:00:57.820> inflammatory

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
can get what's called post inflammatory

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.830 
can get what's called post inflammatory
hyperpigmentation<00:00:59.790> which<00:01:00.790> is<00:01:01.030> really<00:01:01.570> not<00:01:01.780> a

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
hyperpigmentation which is really not a

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.510 
hyperpigmentation which is really not a
good<00:01:02.079> idea<00:01:02.230> because<00:01:02.590> the<00:01:02.829> pigment<00:01:03.010> is<00:01:03.250> really

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
good idea because the pigment is really

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.520 
good idea because the pigment is really
deep<00:01:03.760> and<00:01:03.940> it's<00:01:04.329> very<00:01:04.600> hard<00:01:04.869> to<00:01:04.929> get<00:01:05.109> rid<00:01:05.259> of<00:01:05.319> it

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
deep and it's very hard to get rid of it

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.639 
deep and it's very hard to get rid of it
so<00:01:06.039> the<00:01:06.219> key<00:01:06.459> is<00:01:06.729> not<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.209> fastest<00:01:07.719> but<00:01:07.959> is<00:01:08.439> the

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
so the key is not the fastest but is the

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:12.330 
so the key is not the fastest but is the
safest<00:01:09.189> way<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.569> way<00:01:11.049> I<00:01:11.319> always<00:01:11.859> take<00:01:12.189> care

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
safest way so the way I always take care

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.789 
safest way so the way I always take care
of<00:01:12.459> my<00:01:12.639> ethnic<00:01:13.030> population<00:01:13.689> is<00:01:13.899> to<00:01:14.409> start<00:01:14.649> them

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
of my ethnic population is to start them

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.709 
of my ethnic population is to start them
on<00:01:14.889> a<00:01:14.920> very<00:01:15.310> good<00:01:15.520> skin<00:01:15.850> regimen<00:01:16.060> we

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:16.719 
on a very good skin regimen we

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:18.929 
on a very good skin regimen we
absolutely<00:01:17.229> have<00:01:17.649> to<00:01:17.679> minimize<00:01:18.279> the<00:01:18.609> effects

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
absolutely have to minimize the effects

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.480 
absolutely have to minimize the effects
of<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.299> Sun<00:01:19.539> in<00:01:19.840> terms<00:01:20.409> of<00:01:20.649> how<00:01:20.829> much<00:01:20.950> it<00:01:21.009> tans

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
of the Sun in terms of how much it tans

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.249 
of the Sun in terms of how much it tans
and<00:01:21.880> how<00:01:22.029> much<00:01:22.179> UV<00:01:22.420> radiation<00:01:22.990> is<00:01:23.020> being

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
and how much UV radiation is being

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.769 
and how much UV radiation is being
absorbed<00:01:23.649> by<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.369> skin<00:01:24.639> so<00:01:25.240> good<00:01:25.539> sun

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:25.779 
absorbed by the skin so good sun

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:28.010 
absorbed by the skin so good sun
protection<00:01:26.139> and<00:01:26.469> good<00:01:26.649> SPF<00:01:27.130> is<00:01:27.310> a<00:01:27.340> must

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
protection and good SPF is a must

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.199 
protection and good SPF is a must
secondly<00:01:29.020> I<00:01:29.439> like<00:01:30.069> to<00:01:30.189> put<00:01:30.340> people<00:01:30.639> on<00:01:30.759> a<00:01:30.819> good
