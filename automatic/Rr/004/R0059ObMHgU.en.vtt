guys how cool this thing looks ok so

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.170 
guys how cool this thing looks ok so
here<00:00:29.680> is<00:00:29.710> how<00:00:30.220> it<00:00:30.370> looks<00:00:30.610> inside<00:00:30.910> the<00:00:31.330> box<00:00:31.570> as

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
here is how it looks inside the box as

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.139 
here is how it looks inside the box as
you<00:00:34.180> can<00:00:34.360> see<00:00:34.690> there<00:00:35.199> really<00:00:35.379> isn't<00:00:35.850> much<00:00:36.850> in

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
you can see there really isn't much in

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:37.619 
you can see there really isn't much in
here

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
here

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:39.959 
here
except<00:00:38.379> for<00:00:38.499> an<00:00:38.589> upper<00:00:38.949> left-hand<00:00:39.280> corner<00:00:39.489> and

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:39.969 
except for an upper left-hand corner and

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:41.340 
except for an upper left-hand corner and
I'll<00:00:40.030> get<00:00:40.210> to<00:00:40.239> that<00:00:40.359> here<00:00:40.659> shortly

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
I'll get to that here shortly

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.520 
I'll get to that here shortly
got<00:00:42.100> the<00:00:42.219> plane<00:00:42.489> it<00:00:42.789> is<00:00:43.179> striking<00:00:43.989> it's<00:00:44.350> a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
got the plane it is striking it's a

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.959 
got the plane it is striking it's a
beautiful<00:00:45.219> color<00:00:45.460> scheme<00:00:46.210> on<00:00:46.480> this<00:00:46.659> thing<00:00:46.899> and

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
beautiful color scheme on this thing and

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.939 
beautiful color scheme on this thing and
it<00:00:48.969> should<00:00:49.269> be<00:00:49.390> very<00:00:49.420> easy<00:00:49.690> to<00:00:50.050> see<00:00:50.379> in<00:00:50.499> the<00:00:50.530> sky

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
it should be very easy to see in the sky

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:53.910 
it should be very easy to see in the sky
and<00:00:51.280> I<00:00:52.149> like<00:00:52.390> that<00:00:52.539> because<00:00:52.780> not<00:00:53.319> every<00:00:53.649> plan<00:00:53.890> I

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
and I like that because not every plan I

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.160 
and I like that because not every plan I
have<00:00:54.280> is<00:00:54.550> easy<00:00:55.089> to<00:00:55.269> see<00:00:55.449> in<00:00:55.539> the<00:00:55.600> sky<00:00:55.870> and<00:00:56.079> that

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
have is easy to see in the sky and that

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.959 
have is easy to see in the sky and that
can<00:00:56.800> be<00:00:56.920> a<00:00:56.949> big<00:00:57.159> problem<00:00:57.339> very<00:00:57.699> quickly

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
can be a big problem very quickly

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.759 
can be a big problem very quickly
especially<00:00:58.809> is<00:00:59.379> dynamic<00:00:59.979> as<00:01:00.100> this<00:01:00.280> plane<00:01:00.579> is

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
especially is dynamic as this plane is

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.790 
especially is dynamic as this plane is
here<00:01:02.769> are<00:01:02.979> the<00:01:03.519> side<00:01:03.819> force<00:01:04.180> generators<00:01:04.900> that

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
here are the side force generators that

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.510 
here are the side force generators that
I<00:01:05.830> alluded<00:01:06.280> to<00:01:06.310> a<00:01:06.820> second<00:01:07.420> ago<00:01:07.659> and<00:01:08.280> these<00:01:09.280> go

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
I alluded to a second ago and these go

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.910 
I alluded to a second ago and these go
on<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:09.820> end<00:01:09.969> of<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.180> wing<00:01:10.390> and<00:01:10.619> they<00:01:11.619> add<00:01:11.890> a

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
on the end of the wing and they add a

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.880 
on the end of the wing and they add a
little<00:01:12.430> bit<00:01:12.640> more<00:01:12.909> stability<00:01:13.240> in<00:01:13.899> 3d<00:01:14.469> flight

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
little bit more stability in 3d flight

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.810 
little bit more stability in 3d flight
you<00:01:15.700> can<00:01:15.909> have<00:01:16.119> a<00:01:16.149> little<00:01:16.329> more<00:01:16.540> dynamic<00:01:16.719> range

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
you can have a little more dynamic range

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.010 
you can have a little more dynamic range
with<00:01:18.820> what<00:01:19.030> you're<00:01:19.210> doing<00:01:19.329> with<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.750> plane

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
with what you're doing with the plane

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.029 
with what you're doing with the plane
with<00:01:20.799> the<00:01:20.920> assistance<00:01:21.430> of<00:01:21.610> these<00:01:22.649> alright<00:01:23.649> so

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
with the assistance of these alright so

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.929 
with the assistance of these alright so
here<00:01:24.549> is<00:01:24.579> a<00:01:24.700> look<00:01:24.909> at<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:25.149> plane<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:26.710> is<00:01:27.610> a<00:01:27.640> very

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
here is a look at the plane it is a very

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.289 
here is a look at the plane it is a very
striking<00:01:28.299> plane<00:01:29.460> one<00:01:30.460> thing<00:01:30.640> I<00:01:30.759> did<00:01:31.000> notice

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
striking plane one thing I did notice

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.789 
striking plane one thing I did notice
about<00:01:31.719> this<00:01:32.170> is<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:34.049> there<00:01:35.049> are<00:01:35.170> some<00:01:35.409> dents

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
about this is that there are some dents

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.990 
about this is that there are some dents
and<00:01:36.100> dings<00:01:36.130> in<00:01:36.609> it<00:01:36.759> already<00:01:37.570> out<00:01:37.840> of<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.079> box

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
and dings in it already out of the box

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.190 
and dings in it already out of the box
on<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.509> wing<00:01:40.719> there<00:01:40.990> and<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:43.600> wing<00:01:43.930> right

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
on the wing there and this wing right

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.149 
on the wing there and this wing right
there<00:01:44.439> too<00:01:45.179> I<00:01:46.179> also<00:01:46.570> noticed<00:01:47.259> on<00:01:47.469> the<00:01:47.920> bottom

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
there too I also noticed on the bottom

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:48.899 
there too I also noticed on the bottom
part<00:01:48.399> of<00:01:48.429> the<00:01:48.549> rudder

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
part of the rudder

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.740 
part of the rudder
I'm<00:01:49.780> sure<00:01:50.079> if<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:50.289> camera<00:01:50.469> shows<00:01:50.859> that<00:01:51.189> but

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
I'm sure if the camera shows that but

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.649 
I'm sure if the camera shows that but
the<00:01:52.750> tip<00:01:53.229> has<00:01:53.439> been<00:01:53.469> crinkled<00:01:54.460> like<00:01:55.240> they<00:01:55.420> just

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
the tip has been crinkled like they just

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.990 
the tip has been crinkled like they just
threw<00:01:55.990> it<00:01:56.020> in<00:01:56.109> the<00:01:56.229> box<00:01:56.500> way<00:01:57.039> too<00:01:57.100> quickly<00:01:57.609> like

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
threw it in the box way too quickly like

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.539 
threw it in the box way too quickly like
they<00:01:58.149> didn't<00:01:58.420> even<00:01:58.479> care<00:01:58.979> another<00:01:59.979> thing<00:02:00.340> that

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
they didn't even care another thing that

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.609 
they didn't even care another thing that
I<00:02:00.609> noticed<00:02:00.780> that's<00:02:01.780> not<00:02:02.079> really<00:02:02.350> plane

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
I noticed that's not really plane

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.609 
I noticed that's not really plane
specific<00:02:03.359> the<00:02:04.359> foam<00:02:04.689> that<00:02:04.719> they're<00:02:05.109> using<00:02:05.380> in

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
specific the foam that they're using in

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.460 
specific the foam that they're using in
these<00:02:05.740> boxes<00:02:06.310> these<00:02:06.549> days<00:02:07.289> stinks

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
these boxes these days stinks

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.330 
these boxes these days stinks
I<00:02:08.500> mean<00:02:09.429> it<00:02:09.610> reeks<00:02:10.000> like<00:02:10.590> chemically<00:02:11.590> gonna

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
I mean it reeks like chemically gonna

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.580 
I mean it reeks like chemically gonna
give<00:02:12.550> you<00:02:12.670> cancer<00:02:12.940> kind<00:02:13.330> of<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.510> smell

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
give you cancer kind of a smell

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.250 
give you cancer kind of a smell
I'm<00:02:14.680> not<00:02:14.890> sure<00:02:15.129> when<00:02:16.120> that<00:02:16.300> changed<00:02:16.840> I<00:02:16.930> think<00:02:16.959> I

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
I'm not sure when that changed I think I

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.680 
I'm not sure when that changed I think I
noticed<00:02:17.500> it<00:02:17.860> right<00:02:17.890> around<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.459> archer<00:02:18.879> when

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
noticed it right around the archer when

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.119 
noticed it right around the archer when
I<00:02:19.720> got<00:02:19.959> my<00:02:20.080> heart<00:02:20.230> sure<00:02:20.440> several<00:02:20.680> months<00:02:21.040> ago

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
I got my heart sure several months ago

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.640 
I got my heart sure several months ago
that<00:02:21.250> they've<00:02:21.580> started<00:02:22.290> making<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.379> change

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
that they've started making a change

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.690 
that they've started making a change
there<00:02:23.920> somehow<00:02:24.190> someway<00:02:26.099> it<00:02:27.099> should<00:02:27.400> go<00:02:27.580> away

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
there somehow someway it should go away

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.180 
there somehow someway it should go away
should<00:02:28.450> be<00:02:28.629> that<00:02:28.810> big<00:02:28.959> of<00:02:28.989> a<00:02:29.140> deal<00:02:29.290> long<00:02:29.830> term

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
should be that big of a deal long term

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.320 
should be that big of a deal long term
but<00:02:32.190> yeah<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.430> thought<00:02:33.790> I<00:02:33.819> would<00:02:34.060> share<00:02:34.269> that

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
but yeah I thought I would share that

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.470 
but yeah I thought I would share that
with<00:02:34.480> you<00:02:34.599> guys<00:02:34.870> that<00:02:35.140> that<00:02:35.349> fault<00:02:35.769> stinks<00:02:36.670> I'm

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
with you guys that that fault stinks I'm

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.240 
with you guys that that fault stinks I'm
doing<00:02:37.720> this<00:02:37.810> in<00:02:37.989> my<00:02:38.080> bedroom<00:02:38.319> and<00:02:38.709> as<00:02:38.890> soon<00:02:39.069> as

doing this in my bedroom and as soon as
I'm<00:02:39.400> done<00:02:39.430> doing<00:02:39.760> this<00:02:40.000> I'm<00:02:40.269> going<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.510> pull

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
I'm done doing this I'm going to pull

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.360 
I'm done doing this I'm going to pull
that<00:02:40.900> box<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.560> heck<00:02:41.739> out<00:02:41.950> of<00:02:42.010> here<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:44.590> now<00:02:44.830> I'm

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
that box the heck out of here so now I'm

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.300 
that box the heck out of here so now I'm
going<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.760> show<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.060> guys<00:02:48.720> battery<00:02:49.720> hatch<00:02:50.310> and

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
going to show you guys battery hatch and

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.979 
going to show you guys battery hatch and
nope<00:02:51.549> I<00:02:51.760> clearly<00:02:52.090> did<00:02:52.360> not<00:02:52.390> practice<00:02:52.959> that

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
nope I clearly did not practice that

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.620 
nope I clearly did not practice that
off-camera<00:02:53.459> so<00:02:54.459> as<00:02:54.610> you<00:02:54.760> can<00:02:54.910> see<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.239> magnets

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
off-camera so as you can see the magnets

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.490 
off-camera so as you can see the magnets
are<00:02:55.750> in<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.870> front<00:02:57.540> boom<00:02:58.540> very<00:02:59.110> strong

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
are in the front boom very strong

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.930 
are in the front boom very strong
magnets<00:02:59.920> it<00:03:00.099> actually<00:03:00.370> took<00:03:00.489> me<00:03:00.640> a<00:03:00.700> little<00:03:00.819> bit

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
magnets it actually took me a little bit

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.569 
magnets it actually took me a little bit
to<00:03:01.560> get<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.620> right<00:03:02.829> pressure<00:03:03.069> to<00:03:03.400> get<00:03:03.519> that

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
to get the right pressure to get that

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.569 
to get the right pressure to get that
off<00:03:03.910> there's<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:05.019> battery<00:03:05.230> bay<00:03:05.590> it's<00:03:06.459> like

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
off there's the battery bay it's like

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:07.860 
off there's the battery bay it's like
we've<00:03:06.760> got<00:03:06.879> a<00:03:06.910> little<00:03:07.150> bit<00:03:07.269> of<00:03:07.390> room<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.569> play

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
we've got a little bit of room to play

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.020 
we've got a little bit of room to play
with<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.349> center<00:03:08.829> of<00:03:08.980> gravity<00:03:09.400> actually

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
with the center of gravity actually

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.089 
with the center of gravity actually
pretty<00:03:10.420> pretty<00:03:11.200> nice<00:03:11.379> space<00:03:11.680> if<00:03:11.829> you<00:03:11.890> look

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
pretty pretty nice space if you look

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.970 
pretty pretty nice space if you look
back<00:03:12.250> in<00:03:12.489> there<00:03:12.640> now<00:03:13.480> with<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.750> 3d<00:03:14.440> bird<00:03:14.709> which

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
back in there now with the 3d bird which

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.910 
back in there now with the 3d bird which
is<00:03:15.160> what<00:03:15.340> this<00:03:15.519> has<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.910> potential<00:03:16.269> to<00:03:16.450> be<00:03:16.920> at

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
is what this has the potential to be at

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.129 
is what this has the potential to be at
least<00:03:18.129> at<00:03:18.370> a<00:03:18.400> lower<00:03:18.670> level<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:19.750> want<00:03:19.870> to<00:03:19.989> put

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
least at a lower level you want to put

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.259 
least at a lower level you want to put
the<00:03:20.260> CG<00:03:20.739> the<00:03:21.130> battery<00:03:21.489> back<00:03:21.700> a<00:03:21.730> little<00:03:22.150> bit

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
the CG the battery back a little bit

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.920 
the CG the battery back a little bit
farther<00:03:22.980> it's<00:03:23.980> a<00:03:24.040> little<00:03:24.250> bit<00:03:24.400> more<00:03:24.609> off

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
farther it's a little bit more off

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.449 
farther it's a little bit more off
kilter<00:03:25.930> so<00:03:26.319> you<00:03:26.440> can<00:03:26.560> do<00:03:26.680> more<00:03:26.859> tricks<00:03:27.160> things

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
kilter so you can do more tricks things

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.030 
kilter so you can do more tricks things
like<00:03:27.670> that<00:03:27.940> I<00:03:28.200> plan<00:03:29.200> to<00:03:29.380> fly<00:03:29.590> it<00:03:29.650> a<00:03:29.739> little<00:03:29.920> bit

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
like that I plan to fly it a little bit

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.120 
like that I plan to fly it a little bit
more<00:03:30.160> scale<00:03:30.519> that's<00:03:30.760> how<00:03:30.910> I<00:03:30.940> do<00:03:31.540> things

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
more scale that's how I do things

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.129 
more scale that's how I do things
but<00:03:33.130> I<00:03:33.190> do<00:03:33.250> like<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.700> idea<00:03:33.930> eventually<00:03:34.930> of

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
but I do like the idea eventually of

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.940 
but I do like the idea eventually of
being<00:03:35.739> able<00:03:35.829> to<00:03:36.130> try<00:03:37.000> and<00:03:37.269> do<00:03:37.630> some<00:03:38.079> 3d<00:03:38.590> tricks

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
being able to try and do some 3d tricks

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.309 
being able to try and do some 3d tricks
yes<00:03:39.250> extra<00:03:39.849> you<00:03:40.510> heard<00:03:40.720> that<00:03:40.900> correctly<00:03:41.109> and

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
yes extra you heard that correctly and

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.370 
yes extra you heard that correctly and
you<00:03:44.319> can<00:03:44.470> see<00:03:44.709> on<00:03:44.980> this<00:03:45.130> underside<00:03:46.079> it<00:03:47.079> helps

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
you can see on this underside it helps

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.949 
you can see on this underside it helps
with<00:03:47.500> orientation<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:49.090> top<00:03:49.329> and<00:03:49.540> bottom<00:03:49.840> are

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
with orientation the top and bottom are

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.009 
with orientation the top and bottom are
very<00:03:50.470> different<00:03:50.739> in<00:03:51.069> the<00:03:51.880> design<00:03:52.000> pattern<00:03:52.630> so

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
very different in the design pattern so

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.020 
very different in the design pattern so
that<00:03:53.230> will<00:03:54.040> help<00:03:54.220> especially<00:03:54.819> if<00:03:54.910> you're

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
that will help especially if you're

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.589 
that will help especially if you're
doing<00:03:55.120> 3d<00:03:55.720> but<00:03:56.109> really<00:03:57.299> depending<00:03:58.299> on<00:03:58.359> what's

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
doing 3d but really depending on what's

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.949 
doing 3d but really depending on what's
going<00:03:58.690> on<00:03:58.989> in<00:03:59.109> the<00:03:59.230> sky<00:03:59.500> behind<00:03:59.739> you<00:04:00.190> and

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
going on in the sky behind you and

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.559 
going on in the sky behind you and
things<00:04:01.959> like<00:04:02.200> that<00:04:02.880> it<00:04:03.880> can<00:04:04.060> make<00:04:04.239> a<00:04:04.299> big

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
things like that it can make a big

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.780 
things like that it can make a big
difference<00:04:04.810> between<00:04:05.440> a<00:04:05.470> good<00:04:05.919> day<00:04:06.130> flying<00:04:06.459> and

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
difference between a good day flying and

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.960 
difference between a good day flying and
a<00:04:07.060> really<00:04:07.450> bad<00:04:07.720> day<00:04:07.959> flying<00:04:08.290> a<00:04:08.760> couple<00:04:09.760> cool

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
a really bad day flying a couple cool

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.809 
a really bad day flying a couple cool
things<00:04:10.419> that<00:04:10.630> I<00:04:10.690> noticed<00:04:11.310> here<00:04:12.310> we've<00:04:12.519> got<00:04:12.669> the

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
things that I noticed here we've got the

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.629 
things that I noticed here we've got the
carbon<00:04:13.180> spar<00:04:13.510> going<00:04:13.840> across<00:04:14.169> which<00:04:14.530> is<00:04:14.639> it's

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
carbon spar going across which is it's

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:17.969 
carbon spar going across which is it's
more<00:04:16.180> and<00:04:16.299> more<00:04:16.450> standard<00:04:16.989> with<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.650> horizon

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
more and more standard with the horizon

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.460 
more and more standard with the horizon

hobby planes these days which is a very

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.580 
hobby planes these days which is a very
good<00:04:20.709> thing<00:04:20.979> also<00:04:24.150> because<00:04:25.150> this<00:04:25.360> is<00:04:25.659> a<00:04:25.990> 3d

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
good thing also because this is a 3d

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.530 
good thing also because this is a 3d
bird<00:04:26.800> or<00:04:26.979> potential<00:04:27.430> to<00:04:27.550> be<00:04:27.669> a<00:04:27.700> 3d<00:04:28.090> bird

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
bird or potential to be a 3d bird

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.480 
bird or potential to be a 3d bird
looks<00:04:29.050> like<00:04:29.260> they<00:04:29.440> reinforced<00:04:30.070> the<00:04:30.280> rudder

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
looks like they reinforced the rudder

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.720 
looks like they reinforced the rudder
quite<00:04:30.850> a<00:04:30.880> bit<00:04:31.150> this<00:04:31.330> is<00:04:31.540> a<00:04:31.570> nice<00:04:32.730> really

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
quite a bit this is a nice really

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.810 
quite a bit this is a nice really
well-made<00:04:34.120> piece<00:04:34.950> and<00:04:35.950> the<00:04:36.130> rudder<00:04:36.310> slips

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
well-made piece and the rudder slips

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.620 
well-made piece and the rudder slips
into<00:04:37.150> there<00:04:37.330> and<00:04:38.970> that's<00:04:39.970> definitely<00:04:40.240> going

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
into there and that's definitely going

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.350 
into there and that's definitely going
to<00:04:40.750> add<00:04:40.930> some<00:04:41.380> longevity<00:04:41.590> to<00:04:42.490> this<00:04:42.670> plane<00:04:45.360> one

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
to add some longevity to this plane one

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.960 
to add some longevity to this plane one
of<00:04:46.390> the<00:04:46.570> things<00:04:46.840> that<00:04:47.140> I<00:04:47.170> don't<00:04:47.260> like<00:04:47.970> about

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
of the things that I don't like about

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.960 
of the things that I don't like about
this<00:04:49.420> and<00:04:49.780> it<00:04:50.590> reminds<00:04:50.980> me<00:04:51.100> of<00:04:51.220> my<00:04:51.430> polecat

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
this and it reminds me of my polecat

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.660 
this and it reminds me of my polecat
these<00:04:52.810> wheel<00:04:53.050> pants<00:04:53.560> are<00:04:53.680> just<00:04:53.950> cheap<00:04:54.280> crap

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
these wheel pants are just cheap crap

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.190 
these wheel pants are just cheap crap
they're<00:04:54.940> probably<00:04:55.150> going<00:04:55.390> to<00:04:55.480> break<00:04:55.660> very

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
they're probably going to break very

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.920 
they're probably going to break very
very<00:04:56.470> quickly<00:04:56.800> I<00:04:57.130> notice<00:04:57.940> already<00:04:58.420> that<00:04:58.690> this

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
very quickly I notice already that this

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.760 
very quickly I notice already that this
is<00:04:59.760> super<00:05:00.760> sloppy<00:05:01.090> so<00:05:01.540> as<00:05:02.050> soon<00:05:02.170> as<00:05:02.320> I<00:05:02.410> take<00:05:02.620> off

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
is super sloppy so as soon as I take off

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.960 
is super sloppy so as soon as I take off
in<00:05:02.950> the<00:05:03.070> air<00:05:03.220> it's<00:05:03.490> probably<00:05:03.760> going<00:05:03.850> to<00:05:03.910> be

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
in the air it's probably going to be

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.630 
in the air it's probably going to be
pointed<00:05:04.360> down<00:05:04.390> I'll<00:05:04.960> land<00:05:05.260> with<00:05:06.130> it<00:05:06.250> like<00:05:06.430> this

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
pointed down I'll land with it like this

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.350 
pointed down I'll land with it like this
it'll<00:05:06.970> snap<00:05:07.360> off<00:05:08.520> and<00:05:09.520> so<00:05:09.820> on<00:05:09.970> this<00:05:10.150> one's

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
it'll snap off and so on this one's

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.930 
it'll snap off and so on this one's
pretty<00:05:10.690> good<00:05:10.750> but<00:05:11.200> you<00:05:11.500> know<00:05:11.620> what<00:05:11.940> you're

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
pretty good but you know what you're

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.270 
pretty good but you know what you're
only<00:05:13.090> as<00:05:13.240> strong<00:05:13.330> as<00:05:13.510> your<00:05:13.630> weakest<00:05:14.050> link<00:05:15.420> as

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
only as strong as your weakest link as

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.000 
only as strong as your weakest link as
you<00:05:18.280> can<00:05:18.460> see<00:05:19.200> manuals<00:05:20.200> on<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.620> back<00:05:20.770> of<00:05:20.950> the

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
you can see manuals on the back of the

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.820 
you can see manuals on the back of the
box<00:05:21.220> that<00:05:21.640> will<00:05:21.790> let<00:05:21.970> you<00:05:22.120> know<00:05:22.230> what<00:05:23.230> is<00:05:23.440> going
