used<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.030> method<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.750> didn't<00:01:37.049> quite

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
used to that method so it didn't quite

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.109 
used to that method so it didn't quite
work<00:01:37.259> out<00:01:37.619> for<00:01:37.860> me<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.070> just<00:01:38.159> kind<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.579> ended<00:01:38.970> up

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
work out for me it just kind of ended up

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.140 
work out for me it just kind of ended up
everywhere<00:01:40.020> but<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.650> method<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.130> used<00:01:41.520> Kourt

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
everywhere but the method I used Kourt

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.870 
everywhere but the method I used Kourt
worked<00:01:42.570> quite<00:01:43.049> well<00:01:43.250> so<00:01:44.250> as<00:01:44.310> far<00:01:44.549> as<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> one

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
worked quite well so as far as the one

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.569 
worked quite well so as far as the one
goes<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.420> has<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.960> flat<00:01:46.409> side<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:46.829> then<00:01:47.340> when

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
goes it has a flat side and then when

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.240 
goes it has a flat side and then when
you<00:01:47.729> twirl<00:01:48.149> them<00:01:48.479> one<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.290> has<00:01:49.470> longer

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
you twirl them one it has longer

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.580 
you twirl them one it has longer
bristles<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:51.119> each<00:01:51.390> corner<00:01:51.930> as<00:01:52.290> far<00:01:52.500> as

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
bristles on each corner as far as

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.069 
bristles on each corner as far as
application<00:01:53.369> goes<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:54.210> way<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.720> worked<00:01:54.930> out

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
application goes the way that worked out

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.649 
application goes the way that worked out
for<00:01:55.350> me<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.590> best<00:01:55.740> was<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.549> apply<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.329> mascara

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
for me the best was to apply the mascara

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.219 
for me the best was to apply the mascara
flat<00:01:58.409> first<00:01:58.829> against<00:01:59.310> my<00:01:59.700> eyelashes<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.750> then

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
flat first against my eyelashes and then

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.170 
flat first against my eyelashes and then
when<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.469> need<00:02:01.770> just<00:02:01.950> needed<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.640> separate<00:02:03.000> my

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
when I need just needed to separate my

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.969 
when I need just needed to separate my
lashes<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.780> basically<00:02:04.079> turn<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.560> on<00:02:04.649> its<00:02:04.860> side

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
lashes I basically turn it on its side

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.219 
lashes I basically turn it on its side
because<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.030> has<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.299> longer<00:02:06.659> bristles<00:02:06.899> just

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
because it has the longer bristles just

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.320 
because it has the longer bristles just
separate<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.039> lashes<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.640> they<00:02:08.910> worked<00:02:09.179> out

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
separate the lashes and they worked out

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
separate the lashes and they worked out
perfectly<00:02:10.050> well
