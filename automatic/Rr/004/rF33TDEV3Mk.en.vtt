00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.680
 many people ask what are the 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:11.429
 differences between 250 models 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.719
 and 350 watts here from 2 importers 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.020
 many different 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.050
 I would like to stress it 's here for 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.550
 example this 250 watts 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.820
 it has the panel with the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.489
 speedometer battery right 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.670
 the set here front and flashing headlights 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.239
 and those that are the same 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.450
 importer 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:44.219
 they do not have this headlight set 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.649
 then it is a bit simpler part but 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.160
 here only one charge indicator 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.829
 battery and a light gun 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.870
 both have the right roof racks 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.820
 the two models have agents 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:03.359
 also as a characteristic feature. 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.540
 This is a fist of light when you 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:13.159
 has the horn subject 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:13.159
 the blinkers end 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:24.439
 function in the light grip and this 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:28.520
 the drive down here 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:32.650
 and here the similar zebu 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:36.250
 We're both just showing that you have 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:41.440
 the light cannons differently are 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:44.680
 they all have a slot to be made 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:49.300
 the battery charge is this from here with a 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.310
 cap right where you dock 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.400
 loader 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.850
 that other model is the charger 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:02.680
 here in front of her 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:05.200
 another great advantage of these models is 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.649
 that you in case of need 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.010
 you can take this battery pack 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.950
 to load it into a 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.370
 Anything like that for that apartment. 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.600
 just turn the key 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.700
 contrary 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:27.959
 release the power cable and module 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.600
 battery it is highlighted 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:36.150
 so you can take the 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:40.660
 module to be loaded in another location 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:45.790
 after the load is just saw and fit it 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:48.880
 back on the bike and do the 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:53.100
 then you can do this 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:57.209
 take it to load another location 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:00.310
 the two models also has 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:04.170
 feature a system that we 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:07.150
 we can do a free translation as a 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.450
 aid of pedaling a system of 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:14.380
 pedal assistance and when you are which 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:18.660
 switched on starts pedaling 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.420
 from a certain speed it 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.440
 releases 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.330
 in the wheel set for you to win 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.020
 speed with it 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.739
 so you do not have to just use the engine 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:37.520
 the battery charge it goes but with 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.900
 simpler effort to do the 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.630
 your movement 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.680
 this is very useful for the economy of 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:49.790
 even 250 battery charge 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:53.269
 it also has its ease to you 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:58.400
 make pedaling 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:00.400
 it goes easier to see the 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.569
 movement 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:08.090
 then both models have these 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:12.850
 characteristics that are quite 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:16.450
 functionality for use allows you to 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:19.519
 uses classes and can walk 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:23.120
 quietly by ae 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:27.080
 so I hope that with that you could have 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:32.120
 a basis in the next video that we're going to 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:36.470
 do let's put them to be 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:39.190
 made a performance test of the two 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.190
 thanks
