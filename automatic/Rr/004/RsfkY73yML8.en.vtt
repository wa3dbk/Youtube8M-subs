00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 hi to all this the room in this 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.990
 video I'll explain where from 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.279
 come all these millions that I have and 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.140
 than other players in the same case 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.460
 that me too if I do you this 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.809
 video so simply because I see the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.920
 question come back regularly in the 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.519
 comments but also on the networks 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.259
 social 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.179
 I am often asked how you did 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.770
 to have 30 million then me who 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.449
 has been playing heaps 5 since its release in 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.400
 October 2013 it makes sense to me 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.449
 to have all this money and those who 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.470
 play at five throws since everything 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.090
 time know it then i will you 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.590
 explain a little history of gt5 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.779
 for you to understand that the elders 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.849
 who plays at 5 gta do not have to galore at 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.340
 to have a lot of money that's gone on 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.510
 starts in 2013 after the release of online at 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.399
 that time we could start again 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.260
 the broadcast by pressing the r2 key 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.700
 there was no need to return to 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.440
 session the show bring back a lot 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.670
 more than now she was more 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.010
 simple to make in a few hours 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.420
 you already had a million the first 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.739
 day we had already all bought one to 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.270
 to go I remember it and other the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.680
 titi because he preferred this one so 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.480
 it was super simple to do 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.440
 the money after a week of play there 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.510
 There were already people who had 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.949
 well over 10 million and 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.120
 one month later be rich it was 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.949
 downright become commonplace 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.390
 in addition to that we could also make 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.579
 looping races she was reporting 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.350
 a lot more rp and more money than 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.299
 now we often took the race 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.070
 emptying finding peace during evenings 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.689
 whole two or three weeks after the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.400
 out of the online we had already passed 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.840
 the level 120 we already had everything 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.460
 unlock we had bought too 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.130
 almost everything we needed 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.930
 and then after that there were the codes 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.520
 but almost all those who have 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.110
 facts were handed to their levels of 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.909
 base and have lost all their money 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.100
 I did not do it so I kept 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.600
 all my money still intact and finally 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.610
 the worst thing rhin Thursday the worst thing 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.439
 but in fact it's the best thing about me 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.509
 I took advantage of it a little bit more 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.189
 have taken advantage of the crewe challenges 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.979
 I had to do a few dozen 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.450
 million with crewe challenges 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.189
 maybe even the hundred but for 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.530
 give you some pretty easy examples 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.850
 France made himself 6 billion 500 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.920
 million with crewe challenges 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.890
 others have made the billion balloon 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.869
 44 had made him about 300 million 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.500
 et cetera et cetera are all done 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.360
 full of money 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.829
 me too a little but not masses no 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.750
 more otherwise I would have several hundred 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.130
 of millions at the moment so 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.350
 that's it for the main events that 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.000
 took place during the year on gt5 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.920
 online i know that for those who have 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.020
 landed on gta 5 not long ago or 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.270
 after all that happened that can 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.739
 look huge to have 30 million but 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.180
 for the elders will send you full 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.890
 to say that it's not much there 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.299
 used to have plenty of money if he 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.219
 there are some elders among you they will be able to 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.989
 to testify in the comments of 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.250
 our good old gta 5 old fashioned and 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.379
 if there are new ones they can also 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.670
 testified that rockstar trumps bridled and 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.109
 it's hard to make 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.370
 money nowadays there is 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:27.629
 had a lot of money and they had 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.889
 no need to worry anymore they had 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.109
 either billions or more 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:32.700
 hundreds of millions but they have been 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.139
 too greedy they wanted to make 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.579
 glitchs of the coup they found themselves at 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:37.200
 zero and that's a shame 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.269
 I did not want to be greedy 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.950
 for that I have never been banished I 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.329
 since I was rich enough I did not take 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.950
 the risk of making glitches at the moment 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.060
 where I saw mostly rockstar banish them 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.590
 people because they were doing it 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.359
 in any case all this to tell you that he 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.519
 is a huge difference between gta 5 is 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.169
 in its early days and gta 5 current one 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.430
 will not go back unfortunately 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.290
 it will be difficult to make 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.760
 money nowadays I hope this 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.409
 little history will allow you to better 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.730
 understand some things that's all 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.209
 for this video and I tell you to 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.840
 see you later 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.840
 ciao
