let me first show you how this one looks
you<00:00:29.500> can<00:00:29.620> get<00:00:29.740> an<00:00:29.830> idea<00:00:36.539> so<00:00:37.539> the<00:00:37.629> first<00:00:37.809> part<00:00:38.109> of

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
you can get an idea so the first part of

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.139 
you can get an idea so the first part of
the<00:00:38.260> style<00:00:38.499> is<00:00:38.679> it<00:00:38.829> is<00:00:38.980> a<00:00:39.010> deep<00:00:39.370> v<00:00:39.579> neck<00:00:39.609> which<00:00:39.999> I

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
the style is it is a deep v neck which I

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:41.639 
the style is it is a deep v neck which I
like<00:00:40.449> because<00:00:40.690> it<00:00:40.960> shows<00:00:41.170> a<00:00:41.199> little<00:00:41.379> bit<00:00:41.559> of

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
like because it shows a little bit of

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.680 
like because it shows a little bit of
skin<00:00:41.890> and<00:00:42.070> it<00:00:42.730> definitely<00:00:43.030> draws<00:00:43.510> the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
skin and it definitely draws the

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.479 
skin and it definitely draws the
attention<00:00:43.780> up<00:00:44.230> here<00:00:44.260> and<00:00:44.710> away<00:00:44.949> from<00:00:45.010> the

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
attention up here and away from the

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.299 
attention up here and away from the
bottom<00:00:46.210> part<00:00:46.449> of<00:00:46.629> it<00:00:46.780> now<00:00:47.260> the<00:00:47.649> typical<00:00:47.829> umph

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
bottom part of it now the typical umph

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.939 
bottom part of it now the typical umph
your<00:00:48.429> tub<00:00:48.699> top<00:00:49.149> or<00:00:49.420> babydoll<00:00:50.199> top<00:00:50.230> is<00:00:50.649> when<00:00:50.859> it

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
your tub top or babydoll top is when it

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:52.619 
your tub top or babydoll top is when it
cuts<00:00:51.159> right<00:00:51.249> below<00:00:51.670> the<00:00:51.819> bus<00:00:51.969> line<00:00:52.210> right<00:00:52.449> here

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
cuts right below the bus line right here

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.020 
cuts right below the bus line right here
and<00:00:52.839> see<00:00:52.960> that's<00:00:53.109> where<00:00:53.319> it<00:00:53.409> cuts<00:00:53.679> and<00:00:53.949> if<00:00:54.670> you

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
and see that's where it cuts and if you

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.149 
and see that's where it cuts and if you
notice<00:00:55.420> on<00:00:55.539> this<00:00:55.749> one<00:00:55.989> it<00:00:56.170> cinched<00:00:56.710> in<00:00:56.920> right

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
notice on this one it cinched in right

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:00.689 
notice on this one it cinched in right
here<00:00:57.489> and<00:00:57.670> that<00:00:58.420> is<00:00:58.749> so<00:00:59.260> important<00:01:00.069> you<00:01:00.399> need

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
here and that is so important you need

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.549 
here and that is so important you need
to<00:01:00.909> look<00:01:01.089> for<00:01:01.269> that<00:01:01.420> because<00:01:01.809> that<00:01:01.989> is<00:01:02.379> what

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
to look for that because that is what

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.649 
to look for that because that is what
will<00:01:02.710> make<00:01:02.769> it<00:01:03.010> slimmer<00:01:03.339> fitting<00:01:03.729> and<00:01:04.030> fall<00:01:04.629> a

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
will make it slimmer fitting and fall a

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.210 
will make it slimmer fitting and fall a
little<00:01:04.870> bit<00:01:05.080> closer<00:01:05.260> to<00:01:05.409> the<00:01:05.530> body<00:01:05.680> so<00:01:06.130> you

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
little bit closer to the body so you

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.429 
little bit closer to the body so you
still<00:01:06.280> have<00:01:06.580> this<00:01:06.729> looseness<00:01:07.060> but<00:01:07.720> yet<00:01:07.990> these

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
still have this looseness but yet these

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.530 
still have this looseness but yet these
pleading<00:01:09.130> this<00:01:09.340> pleading<00:01:09.610> in<00:01:09.880> here<00:01:10.090> will<00:01:10.509> make

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
pleading this pleading in here will make

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.030 
pleading this pleading in here will make
it<00:01:10.869> look<00:01:11.020> a<00:01:11.140> little<00:01:11.290> bit<00:01:11.500> closer<00:01:11.680> to<00:01:11.829> the<00:01:11.950> body

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
it look a little bit closer to the body

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.600 
it look a little bit closer to the body
and<00:01:12.219> not<00:01:12.490> so<00:01:12.790> much<00:01:12.850> like<00:01:13.420> a<00:01:13.649> full-on<00:01:14.649> maternity

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
and not so much like a full-on maternity

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.399 
and not so much like a full-on maternity
style<00:01:15.880> top<00:01:16.299> which<00:01:16.600> is<00:01:16.719> what<00:01:16.869> you<00:01:16.960> don't<00:01:17.170> want

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
style top which is what you don't want

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.410 
style top which is what you don't want
the<00:01:17.770> next<00:01:18.070> thing<00:01:18.219> is<00:01:18.280> there's<00:01:18.790> some<00:01:18.939> sparkle

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
the next thing is there's some sparkle

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.389 
the next thing is there's some sparkle
up<00:01:19.539> here<00:01:19.840> which<00:01:20.020> I<00:01:20.170> like<00:01:20.380> some<00:01:20.950> buttons<00:01:21.219> on<00:01:21.310> the

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
up here which I like some buttons on the

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.459 
up here which I like some buttons on the
side<00:01:21.549> but<00:01:22.360> the<00:01:22.509> sparkle<00:01:22.930> also<00:01:23.259> draws

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:23.469 
side but the sparkle also draws

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:25.109 
side but the sparkle also draws
attention<00:01:23.619> up<00:01:24.009> here<00:01:24.039> which<00:01:24.399> i<00:01:24.549> think<00:01:24.969> is

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
attention up here which i think is

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.730 
attention up here which i think is
really<00:01:25.270> important<00:01:25.869> you<00:01:26.140> don't<00:01:26.289> want<00:01:26.439> it<00:01:26.530> to<00:01:26.619> go

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
really important you don't want it to go

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.990 
really important you don't want it to go
too<00:01:26.799> much<00:01:27.159> you<00:01:27.340> don't<00:01:27.369> want<00:01:27.579> it<00:01:27.640> to<00:01:27.729> be<00:01:27.850> like

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
too much you don't want it to be like

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.490 
too much you don't want it to be like
half<00:01:28.270> and<00:01:28.450> half<00:01:28.479> but<00:01:29.020> this<00:01:29.140> one<00:01:29.289> is<00:01:29.439> just

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
half and half but this one is just

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.139 
half and half but this one is just
enough<00:01:29.860> for<00:01:30.009> they're<00:01:30.159> still<00:01:30.369> Brown<00:01:30.610> here<00:01:30.969> and

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
enough for they're still Brown here and

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.120 
enough for they're still Brown here and
a<00:01:31.390> little<00:01:31.539> bit<00:01:31.780> detail<00:01:32.140> over<00:01:32.380> here<00:01:32.560> so<00:01:32.740> it

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
a little bit detail over here so it

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.160 
a little bit detail over here so it
gives<00:01:33.340> it<00:01:33.460> a<00:01:33.549> nice<00:01:33.670> touch<00:01:33.939> the<00:01:34.570> next<00:01:34.960> thing<00:01:35.109> is

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
gives it a nice touch the next thing is
