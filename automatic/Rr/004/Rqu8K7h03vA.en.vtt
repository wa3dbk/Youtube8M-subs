00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.920
 I 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:21.819
 the cough is a must have been this percent chance showing with your 

00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:23.909
 Mexican girlfriend who in 2010 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:27.349
 with the option that grafica called remove funds 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.089
 I have five examples here where we are going to apply 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:32.550
 the concept 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.270
 in that first example we have a photo with a central object with two mountains p 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.610
 fairly defined 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.870
 good format 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.380
 and the option to remove funds 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.500
 and let's see how the process is chaste matiko I should just alert 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.380
 I get a moderately nice cut 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.400
 in this second case 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.020
 which are two objects 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.020
 therefore the option removed thoroughly 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.520
 do not believe it against the whole spectrum that we want we only need 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.250
 make a couple of adjustments 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.720
 in this case 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.720
 and we'll have it, it's not cuts 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.600
 in this third example 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.600
 the idea is to stay with a part butterfly a part 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.720
 what I notice that is here although 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.350
 we see that the bonds also with tournaments is that possible because you have to 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.560
 start acting and zas 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.560
 in my case 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.920
 when one reviews them, it reviews everywhere the acts of cuts 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.070
 is going to realize that the problem would be over the edges 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.430
 It's the only thing to keep in mind 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.470
 but normally the work is done by 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.180
 Not everything is rosy 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.830
 in this new example 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.830
 the option to remove funds will require me to have certain changes 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.580
 especially because I want to keep the part of 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.380
 the bottom part of the 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.120
 and the harpoon without the sky 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.120
 therefore bianchi maple my selection 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.489
 they ask as the one that automatically adjusts 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:17.919
 supposedly we want 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:19.979
 I would take a piece of here 

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:21.720
 and then complain about the sky 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.629
 therefore the first thing they do is 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.669
 take off 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:29.119
 It's open if I do not want it 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:32.759
 or simply say good if I made a mistake eliminated the brand 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.909
 really this candle that keep 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.369
 there is 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:45.609
 but the ones that I do not want to maintain is the sky so some customer that takes out 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:51.179
 we are that it would be touch-touch to do 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:54.859
 obviously I have to have a background that plays with that cut is that if I 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:56.150
 I put disbola k 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.649
 they will see 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:03:01.759
 all those votes simply massified visual what I'm doing in this 

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:03.369
 case 

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:05.470
 that is the most common case 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.950
 and let's say a patient a bit the most complex and that's when we have the wolves 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.809
 of the company with this type of formats 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:15.079
 I'm going to click here and I'll go 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.549
 to the option to remove fo 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:17.999
 and let's see 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:19.470
 cobo site 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.889
 expanded a bit 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:25.889
 the option does not achieve sect defines mind that what 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:27.449
 it stays 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:31.009
 there is no problem to be able to if I want to keep you also I would be 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.769
 and ready 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.289
 but 

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:38.579
 for this case where the 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.579
 the letters do not have a defined background 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:44.789
 the matter has become a bit more complicated 

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:46.559
 first obviously he said 

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:47.439
 spacious 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:49.189
 p the range 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:52.319
 then poe to mention the sum that still 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.759
 that does work if it is not deactivated 

00:03:55.759 --> 00:04:00.379
 and here I can make the additional adjustments for example I'll tell you 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:03.529
 that here is I want to keep 

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:06.529
 if they accuse you of hÃ¡jek in each letter 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:10.199
 and we are seeing how the option automatically 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:14.759
 ballini so much 

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:18.150
 we can even do two simple tricks the first 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.370
 if I did not want this part the dotcom in viloco that simply do not have it 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.110
 consider 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.110
 and eye on this this for this space in the eei 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.949
 you have to remove it so I can in the same section 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:34.710
 bobb harpo and sana arias 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.180
 who wants to keep 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.279
 That would be comedy 

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:39.360
 to accept 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.919
 and when we saw 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.919
 he is moderately made 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.340
 it is an interesting option 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.469
 let's never say that 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:54.889
 it's not photoshop but for most cases of 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.949
 call it civilian first aid graphics works very well 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.830
 He recommended them a lot and we are seeing each other 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:02.520
 in another Portuguese
