can just resign it's easy I don't like
it<00:05:19.139> as<00:05:19.290> well<00:05:19.320> but<00:05:19.770> it's<00:05:20.250> relatively<00:05:20.669> easy<00:05:20.850> to

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
it as well but it's relatively easy to

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.520 
it as well but it's relatively easy to
do<00:05:21.500> yeah<00:05:22.500> not<00:05:23.100> much<00:05:23.310> to<00:05:23.760> say<00:05:24.000> I<00:05:24.030> think<00:05:24.380> 94<00:05:25.380> is

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
do yeah not much to say I think 94 is

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.500 
do yeah not much to say I think 94 is
just<00:05:26.190> a<00:05:26.370> lemon<00:05:26.760> I<00:05:27.860> think<00:05:28.860> maybe<00:05:29.370> night<00:05:29.639> 92<00:05:30.330> was

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
just a lemon I think maybe night 92 was

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.970 
just a lemon I think maybe night 92 was
also<00:05:30.900> possible<00:05:31.410> at<00:05:31.560> okay<00:05:31.860> 95<00:05:32.750> and<00:05:33.800> yeah<00:05:34.800> he

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
also possible at okay 95 and yeah he

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.180 
also possible at okay 95 and yeah he
must<00:05:35.130> play<00:05:35.430> d<00:05:35.610> 5<00:05:35.850> has<00:05:36.090> simply<00:05:36.480> no<00:05:36.630> other<00:05:36.780> muth

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
must play d 5 has simply no other muth

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.680 
must play d 5 has simply no other muth
then<00:05:38.190> I<00:05:38.220> thought<00:05:38.610> or<00:05:38.850> care<00:05:39.060> will<00:05:39.270> probably

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
then I thought or care will probably

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.129 
then I thought or care will probably
take<00:05:39.960> and<00:05:40.639> this<00:05:41.639> situation<00:05:42.360> is<00:05:42.479> not<00:05:42.720> entirely

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
take and this situation is not entirely

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.590 
take and this situation is not entirely
clear<00:05:43.590> I<00:05:43.830> thought<00:05:44.190> that<00:05:44.340> if<00:05:44.580> or<00:05:44.820> is<00:05:44.970> probably

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 
clear I thought that if or is probably

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.180 
clear I thought that if or is probably
week<00:05:47.210> that's<00:05:48.210> true<00:05:48.540> the<00:05:48.930> term<00:05:49.229> he<00:05:49.770> can<00:05:49.950> play<00:05:50.100> a

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.510 
week that's true the term he can play a
five<00:05:50.580> it's<00:05:50.820> not<00:05:51.000> it's<00:05:51.240> not<00:05:51.330> totally<00:05:52.520> totally

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
five it's not it's not totally totally

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.719 
five it's not it's not totally totally
clear<00:05:53.820> cut<00:05:54.060> situation<00:05:55.130> it's<00:05:56.130> also<00:05:56.340> not<00:05:56.669> clear

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
clear cut situation it's also not clear

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:01.280 
clear cut situation it's also not clear
what<00:05:57.210> I<00:05:57.240> should<00:05:57.570> play<00:05:58.370> III<00:05:59.370> maybe<00:06:00.110> but<00:06:01.110> this
