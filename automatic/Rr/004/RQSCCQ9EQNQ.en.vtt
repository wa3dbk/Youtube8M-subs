00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 domestic animals of old races 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.230
 brought to Brazil for centuries have 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.599
 qualities that can be useful for 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.240
 improve the modern breeds of 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.620
 commercial yield of the importance of 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.920
 an embrapa resources program 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.910
 genetic resources to preserve 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.460
 horses and poultry of these breeds 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.699
 The low horse in Maranhão is a 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.699
 from them 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:37.739
 the name bajadero comes from downloaded bajada 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.030
 Maranhão region of origin of our 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.969
 horse to get there 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.100
 we leave the capital are Luis de Balsa in the 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.379
 company of the three uema teachers 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.570
 university of the state of maranhão 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.739
 presented a low horse to the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.739
 researchers at embrapa 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.930
 Twenty-one municipalities are part of the 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.360
 pine tree is one of them for almost 80 thousand 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.750
 inhabitants is considered a type of 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:11.170
 capital of the region, one of the poorest 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.110
 country the pine city is surrounded by 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.420
 plains are thus flooded 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.260
 good part of the year here in the 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.300
 Maranhão 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.130
 animals are raised loose if they 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.350
 feeds on native grass 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.420
 Some say that horse to breed 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.580
 practically alone in this environment 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.840
 in these flooded fields 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:34.270
 need to have lower blood second 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.310
 veterinarians valdo serra author of a 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.229
 dissertation on the horse 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.110
 to survive 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.070
 here these features will need to be 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.110
 adapt 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.790
 years and years of selection and selection 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.520
 natural selection of animals 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.310
 resistant to this ecosystem and those 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.750
 they did not resist they just show up 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.149
 so here today they do not have this breed 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.530
 adapted that a small animal is that 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.270
 natural selection itself has 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.580
 also so that he could with 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.290
 little grass a less nutritious pasture 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.880
 to survive 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.619
 another adaptation also very important 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.720
 that occurred was the hull because of the 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.459
 low dir on the hull very sturdy 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.650
 then it can be in the flooded behave in the 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:15.790
 lump in the dry season as it fits 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.100
 and the two conditions will the fat of 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.180
 horse breeders 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.519
 City 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.519
 the list is on account of the handlers 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:31.630
 handling happens only 45 times per 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.780
 year when animals of several owners are 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.239
 grouped into a collective agreement 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.180
 we accompany one of those days that usually 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.390
 to be very festive almost a meeting between 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.390
 friends 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:52.239
 animals are released an album is not 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:55.810
 Farofa handling is very Russian for pedestrians. 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:59.439
 for a mane trimmed does not cut the 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.139
 even everything and in the machete if the zé rodrigues 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:05.829
 and other caregivers believe that 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:08.439
 crisis weakens the animal and let those 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:12.040
 It is because there happened the dream is 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:15.299
 this child sucks the blood is there is 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.609
 improves but the animal falls short 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:22.750
 while they cut the horsehair others treat 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:25.030
 the tick with burnt oil and creolina 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.090
 here they believe that the underdog has 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.400
 a greater tolerance for the parasites races 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.709
 would be much more 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.879
 quickly in front of such 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:43.780
 tick infestation victory 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:45.400
 tick-full ear this was a 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.040
 candy for rafa 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:53.169
 I think it's going to work that way. 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:56.440
 infested look with dodo had a subject 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:58.840
 this low-level steering was being passed 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.840
 from father to son veterinary guidance 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.900
 this is a rare thing 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.810
 payment for the services of the treaters 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.819
 comes coconut- shaped at the end of each 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.340
 year the caretaker meets the owner 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.519
 animals to tell the others that 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:19.750
 were born every four others born 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:22.840
 three are with the owner and handler joseph 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.880
 for example takes care of 60 mares while 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:30.479
 others give a year or so a year 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:33.490
 animals the lord or any other friend 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.919
 money even nonexistent to turn 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:42.909
 to get money I do not ask 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:45.610
 Hi, have to work outside. 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:48.820
 this service to be able to have my point 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:54.000
 to be able to travel does fishing I fish and 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.000
 the farm work there but turning around 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.050
 eye now is not an easy life of course 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.720
 what a hand 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.729
 your boss is your boss 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:07.190
 that neither the owner of the animals can 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:09.750
 make money with the low price is 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.750
 How much was reading a mare in the low 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.470
 she goes to the basement today she talked about 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.190
 200 to 300 to 500 reais according to the 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.800
 animal 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:23.340
 for José Dias Creator and Veterinarian 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.560
 here 's region resistance in the word 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.710
 that defines this horse that the animal must 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.110
 more throw a bottle thrown soon 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.699
 stand it has no hull has not 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.710
 resistance can not withstand parasites like 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:37.199
 tick and development 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.539
 I have a lot of time and a lot of time. 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:42.479
 illness imposes on everyone and this one does not 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:44.400
 it's just that the monster were all those 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:46.530
 characteristics that have led to 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.650
 teachers of the UEME 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:53.759
 embrapa to present the download us 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:55.800
 We intend to start a census so that we can 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:58.169
 we can evaluate the effectiveness of the 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.389
 population here in the Maranhão 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:03.090
 the second point is the creation of a nucleus 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:05.520
 conservation on the campus of UEMA here 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.979
 even in the lower one that would have a squad 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.770
 and would also serve to guide 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:14.669
 the creators and handlers of the region 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.139
 on handling and reproduction techniques 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:18.210
 today we have a serious problem that 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:20.639
 involves group consanguinity 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.310
 precisely because there is no 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:26.490
 part of the servant this perception of how the 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:28.229
 accounting is the brother crossing 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.590
 with brother father with daughter like him 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:35.280
 depreciates this genetic material and does 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:38.219
 with which you have a life is limited in 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.500
 future with the advancement of biotechnology and 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:42.120
 with genetic sequencing will 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.580
 make it easier to 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.419
 transfer of genes from a race to 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.069
 other 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:50.069
 This is going to be a job I would say. 

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:52.110
 even commonplace and it is essential that we 

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:53.400
 we have this stored material that 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.919
 It's no use in a few years, people 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.719
 has this technology say what a pity it is 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:59.639
 we see a race that was so adapted 

00:06:57.719 --> 00:07:03.169
 which had such and such characteristics 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:03.169
 but she got lost there is no morning 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:41.680
 for the downhill horse was the last 

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.639
 animal included in the 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.639
 hence conservation
