00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070

year<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.490> road<00:01:51.729> or<00:01:52.000> even<00:01:52.210> at<00:01:52.300> home<00:01:52.500> we<00:01:53.500> always

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
year and road or even at home we always

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.950 
year and road or even at home we always
make<00:01:53.860> it<00:01:54.009> interesting<00:01:54.250> even<00:01:54.580> though<00:01:54.789> we<00:01:55.720> most

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
make it interesting even though we most

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.090 
make it interesting even though we most
of<00:01:56.050> our<00:01:56.140> controls<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.710> game<00:01:56.890> feel<00:01:57.159> but<00:01:59.069> had<00:02:00.069> a

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
of our controls the game feel but had a

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.800 
of our controls the game feel but had a
couple<00:02:00.340> times<00:02:00.520> to<00:02:00.789> kind<00:02:01.000> of<00:02:01.060> seal<00:02:01.300> it<00:02:01.509> and<00:02:01.630> then

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
couple times to kind of seal it and then

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.169 
couple times to kind of seal it and then
you<00:02:02.319> know<00:02:02.409> even<00:02:03.340> wish<00:02:03.670> them<00:02:03.789> call<00:02:03.970> have<00:02:04.149> a

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
you know even wish them call have a

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:05.730 
you know even wish them call have a
chance<00:02:04.420> to<00:02:04.600> even<00:02:04.780> tie<00:02:05.080> it<00:02:05.140> and<00:02:05.560> what

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
chance to even tie it and what

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.609 
chance to even tie it and what
half-court<00:02:06.159> heave<00:02:07.140> we<00:02:08.140> make<00:02:08.319> it<00:02:08.440> interesting

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
half-court heave we make it interesting

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.100 
half-court heave we make it interesting
but<00:02:08.950> a<00:02:09.250> devil<00:02:09.489> day<00:02:09.789> we<00:02:10.390> had<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.600> most<00:02:10.750> points

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
but a devil day we had the most points

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.850 
but a devil day we had the most points
at<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.230> end<00:02:11.350> I<00:02:11.680> guess<00:02:12.250> what<00:02:12.489> smiles
