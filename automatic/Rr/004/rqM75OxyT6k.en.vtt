00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:27.130
 these are the products we need for 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:30.580
 baking cake for the dough so to speak 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.080
 when stripping bulk we need 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.220
 about two glasses of flour 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.000
 half a glass of sugar a pack of butter or 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.290
 margarine 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.320
 200 grams or fillings you will need 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:48.730
 400 grams of cottage cheese 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:51.040
 4 eggs about a glass of sugar and you can 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.670
 put any dried fruit off or even 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.879
 fruits 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:01:01.030
 I traditionally put dried apricots and raisins and 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.800
 literally at the tip of the knife on how soda 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.330
 you can add your own 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.910
 curd mass 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.090
 oils help you first need 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.990
 very good freeze because we 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.030
 it will rub on a grater 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.490
 Burov I soaked pre-order 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.520
 she got a little softer I could with them 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.619
 wash off all unnecessary unnecessary and cut 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.720
 I also soaked in pieces 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.670
 and raisins to rinse well then 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.009
 much unnecessary macerate 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.140
 dried fruits because they are in process 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.390
 baking will absorb themselves moisture from 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.179
 cottage cheese 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.340
 dried apricots washed about Sashina lightly and 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:44.910
 cut enough large pieces 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:51.009
 on 4 6 parts also dried raisins 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:53.190
 prepare the grout volume but pour in a bowl 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.190
 flour 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:15.080
 sugar well knead to urban 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:20.860
 one sugar in flour then 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:26.360
 we get a large grater from the freezer 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:29.590
 our butter or margarine and rub on 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.040
 as you start from butter 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:37.400
 periodically mix it with flour 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.340
 because about the friction force and from the room 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.650
 temperature in this form it starts 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.220
 to thaw and then it will be more difficult 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:49.180
 mix in a uniform crumb with onions sh 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.180
 baby ready 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.950
 preparing the stuffing yolks you can 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.950
 to separate from proteins 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.530
 yolks put in cottage cheese or you can not 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.140
 bother and immediately mix the curd with 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.030
 eggs 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.959
 You can try to whip squirrels in the lush 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.220
 foam and then add convict mass 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:23.470
 until yolks add to your 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:23.470
 add bulk sugar and soda 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:41.840
 the rest of the sugar you add proteins 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:45.019
 let's score the wall of the fold cream well now 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:52.660
 Yolk mix with cottage cheese 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:52.660
 whipped whites and add dried fruits 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.870
 here is so gentle everything turned out 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.580
 add our dried fruits 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:20.169
 mix with mass and our stuffing 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.699
 I'm not ready to save much time 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:26.830
 begin to form 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:29.110
 our cake I take a split form because 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.199
 what with them then bake and pulls out on 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.400
 tripod shone view paper such 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:41.800
 way to make it easier 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:47.380
 and vypayu fasten them our grout spots 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:54.330
 dimensional distributing it along the bottom of the form also 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:54.330
 forming small bumpers from this mass 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:11.340
 ready now neatly put 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:11.340
 sprinkle pouring all the stuffing 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:23.630
 and leveled supply 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.350
 we fall asleep with his remnants 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.350
 grout 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:35.279
 press yourself do not need anything 

00:05:35.549 --> 00:05:42.659
 bottom and so the grout will press on top she 

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:47.249
 must be airy to cover 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:47.249
 air crisp our cake 

00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:58.269
 prepared oven 

00:05:53.549 --> 00:06:00.789
 first i put on the bottom of the oven 

00:05:58.269 --> 00:06:04.469
 over in the oven because at the bottom of us 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:08.289
 located on top of the grout wet 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:13.089
 soufflÃ© mixture and therefore need not to 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:15.069
 good hurt despite this moisture I 

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:21.399
 I rearrange the cake in the middle though 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:24.179
 you can see snuffed souffle is already 

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:30.179
 bliss place 

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:35.999
 up to brown I close the oven 

00:06:30.179 --> 00:06:39.429
 switch the heat over the top and 

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:43.179
 I'll even put somewhere around 250 to 

00:06:39.429 --> 00:06:44.469
 our baby flushed well our 

00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:49.800
