00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 Football 3D software has two modes 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.470
 different use the first one that 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.719
 is the simple simple mode where 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.400
 perform an exercise does not delay us more 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.019
 one minute 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.150
 is simply to load the 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.369
 playing fields by clicking on the 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.699
 view that interests us taking as 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.900
 reference the different distances of 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.880
 cameras that we have if normal close and 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.329
 distant 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.360
 in this way we locate the players of 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:35.790
 the way in the field that interests us 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.829
 then in the players tab we can 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.510
 select the color of the shirt 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.760
 the players and also the guidance 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.519
 in each of the gestures I'm going to 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.010
 place two red players here 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:48.600
 directly to a click on the player 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.420
 is loaded on the playing field with the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.750
 left mouse button I move it let's go 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.970
 to load an archer we will place 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.400
 here 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.400
 and we will load two players 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.320
 another shirt color 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.590
 thus 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.550
 a ball 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.130
 and we can perform 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.020
 different drawings by selecting colors 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.780
 and line types 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.250
 to 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.340
 perform the explanation of 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.200
 exercises there is an elements tab 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.050
 what can we load 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.240
 and drag in the same way 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.100
 in this way is the simple mode of use 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.900
 the view is selected, the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.300
 players the graphs are made and 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.000
 you can even enter text and load 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.370
 from the explanation tab 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.650
 any important data for the 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.750
 exercise has the option to save 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.480
 have the option to export it as a 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.090
 image the other way is to make a 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.970
 animation the animation is one more step 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.940
 advanced to give movement to each 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.430
 one of the players and 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.020
 to perform an animation directly 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.540
 we do it from the animation tab 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.890
 we load the color that interests us and 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.830
 this player is going to have different 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.600
 actions walking jogging running jump 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.630
 with different legs with both 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.730
 legs make passes head butts and 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.710
 actions also like abdominals 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.930
 flexibility stretching weights 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.730
 etcetera everything to take the field of 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.040
 game even in any of the 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.740
 land that we have here to make a 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.230
 animation the game is going to be in a 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.850
 been stopped initially then you 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.060
 we load the other action that can be a 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.900
 trot 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.950
 and we do it try here until the 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.860
 final position 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.930
 in a certain period that is the 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.640
 distance between the time in the 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.370
 who trots and who stands 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.739
 that way we see how from the line 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.000
 of time we can make the force 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.830
 trot 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.710
 This way you can go configuring 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.280
 any of the gestures if instead of 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.830
 jogging 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.450
 we want it to run better or will it change 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.220
 speeds instead of standing 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.220
 we want that in the end head 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.970
 let's do and this is the result 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.770
 are simple clicks if we want it to be 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.300
 slower instead of 1 to 13 the 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.830
 distance can be from 1 to 30 then 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.310
 so the player is going to do much more 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.560
 slow 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.690
 and that way they are synchronizing 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.610
 movements a screenshot to see 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.860
 What are the two modes of work of the 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.440
 software and ricky soccer 3d the first 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.410
 extremely simple with players 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.030
 static and the second already encouraging in 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.430
 three dimensions with different gestures 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.730
 technical and with a high resolution 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.730
 definition
