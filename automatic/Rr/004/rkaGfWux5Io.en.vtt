 characteristics and then we'll go 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.430
 a turn in a coup and so as said 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.600
 to this series there frankly I do them 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.600
 because really a lot of people 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.890
 ask me again and pascal and I 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.409
 think it's a pretty cool series 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.020
 and so that's it so it's this 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.170
 once it's a fashion r so we'll all 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.840
 immediately attacked the stuff 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:19.350
 so that's the level of the cap and then 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.450
 a headdress of complexion frost crazy so 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.759
 had not there been tried to look for 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.600
 an over acted but I have not found so 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.979
 here I show that I quickly did so 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.659
 but I took that but here I am 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.039
 quite convinced at the body level to 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.439
 body I still have the age of warrior 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:37.619
 the over vita because for this mode there 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:45.350
 it's going to be very important on the 12th so 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:47.939
 you after an anno game uncapped 1 pm 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.700

 frost crazy so there I have an over acts 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.119
 so they give 70 this and I you 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.070
 shows that I quickly made a level of 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.210
 montilliers I put a scirocco so 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.549
 140 da I put some tanguy boots 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.850
 frost blur no they are not super 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:13.980
 I have done but it so here it is 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:15.270
 I do with belt flip flops until 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.730
 so his stature for which I have 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.290
 opted that's not bad at all either I 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.819
 tell you what you will see that 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.069
 you may have noticed that 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.260
 I have there panel I show it to you after 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:29.549
 at the level of the rings I put a jump 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.790
 sovereign of the king singles here I am fast 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:39.060
 is quickly done well and we had fun 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:40.170
 but an amulet of groix so here it is 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.989
 as said I have the panel I you the 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.560
 watch panoplie here are thirty intel 30 to 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:50.099
 j-10 skiff pm and a pm so that's it's 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.420
 really great 7 pado that's level of 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.750
 Trophies of the dofus 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.709
 I put a surviving major acrobat 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.900
 major to turbulent for the pea a 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.030
 major balancing without hadji a 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.450
 equilibrium 8.50 to I have an ocher 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.400
 a pea so the level of vita I have 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.760
 three thousand so I stay in the 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.230
 standards 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.760
 I mean time that I spend in 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.989
 it's okay 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.959
 if I pass between all that it's clear 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.220
 that it weakens a little bit the vita 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.139
 we will say I showed you 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.980
 features now so six 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:25.829
 Levels 178 3010 health points sweet 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.579
 peace at 5pm practically 1600 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:31.470
 196 prospecting three 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.750
 doors and the second at the level of the 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.010
 wisdom of 151 so I have everything he 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.280
 must for melee look and 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:45.690
 see the wise is more than 251 so that's 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:47.280
 good after the call 260 3 but that's it 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.530
 it's the breakdown as much as it gives that 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.409
 so we do not care 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:55.199
 and there j 750 so I go up anyway to 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:58.979
 750 to agitate while watching I'm 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:04:00.180
 son vita I have a base of 642 vita and 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:02.970
 you can also see I have a base of 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.479
 102 is actually acting I'm dad 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.639
 rechaussant acted I only booster 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:10.829
 the agility of 102 like that I told myself 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.989
 I would like to have over 700 so 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.239
 I find myself with 750 who is 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.370
 really not bad at all and after that 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.169
 so as dj booth sense of the j 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.430
 then I saw everything else in utah 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.310
 four years ago what do we do 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.919
 optimize a maximum the vita and with 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.529
 this censorship frankly a gap was 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:31.380
 the thread lives like that there is 750 da j 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:32.680
 I think it's not bad at all 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.669
 here is for this mode there the doubs 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.229
 well that is very important for 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.780
 combine the three attacks I you 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:40.990
 will show it after in the details 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:45.669
 what do I have to show you tackle 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:49.780
 75 leakage 87.1 at the level of damage r 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:53.350
 I'm only 42 but now it 10:42 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.940
 not much but so I do I do 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.949
 a break simply that's it then 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.000
 after that so now I have you 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:03.400
 showed the stuff and the features 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.960
 so what am I going to do what I have 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.210
 makes a small break and I you 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:11.259
 found in a putsch so at all of 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:13.979
 then we are back in the fight 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:15.940
 so I took a putsch level 75 here 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.900
 so what I'm going to do is I 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.990
 will start by showing you a 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.960
 oboist so there I am not boost on 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:28.090
 will do the reflexes to start 352 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:30.520
 a claw of caen galls 396 then a 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:36.599
 bluff with a holiday that goes on 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:39.300
 I hope no geo will have offered a 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:42.610
 this is the gr 439 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:47.500
 so I'm going to boost myself so 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:48.840
 little roulette wheel perception of the 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.039
 fortune 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.610
 so backlash so much to do 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:58.060
 here and we left for a bluff 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:00.580
 this time boost that goes to 564 and 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.590
 it's a gr fortunately finally a 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.030
 roulette and so before I told you the 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.729
 12 places is really superb 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.409
 oh well it's perfect that's nickel 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:10.479
 four polls he on wheels this is 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:13.060
 perfect I show you the ji anyway 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:14.470
 hence when you go up in 1150 know kif 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.509
 so in fact before I told you 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.550
 why the 12 passes and super convenient 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:20.710
 for this game mode because we have the 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.270
 reflex and a gift without valve that kiffent 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.729
 in 4 loses or can be well combined 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:27.039
 look at I make you a reflex that 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:30.460
 goes to 638 a claw of sandals that 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:31.810
 will go to 685 and then I can 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.780
 to repeat a transplant of cancale by 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.009
 example that goes to 732 so here it is 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.900
 the 12 passes is really necessary 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:39.039
 after if we have a super we can do the 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.789
 same thing so I showed you 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:41.789
 castors 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:48.620
 400 force not interesting imagine that 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:50.220
 I hope I can see a reflex 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.910
 a second 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:55.680
 finally a claw of choirs and at the end 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.970
 I can replace a bluff but the 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.020
 problem with the beautiful bluff it's 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.390
 we never know that we are going 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.070
 to do so that's why the 12 father 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.860
 is still more practical like that one 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:07.020
 can really chain a chesnais with 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.280
 the main boom the main erp 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:15.000
 so here I bluff 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:16.410
 and then go die here you go 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.990
 here I presented you the mode 

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:22.200
 agility so we had 750 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:24.630
 to act it was not bad at all then tac 

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.010
 here I go a little zoom so here 

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:28.290
 I hope this little video of 

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.620
 presentation of my team of signs in 

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.410
 fashion 

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:33.030
 you will have liked it so it was the episode 

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:35.190
 number two in the small series of 

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.790
 presentations of my ecaflip with 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.100
 several modes 

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.780
 so I remind you in the previous 

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.620
 episode I had presented the flip cases in 

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.300
 water air mode 

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:45.000
 so if you have not seen it yet I 

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:47.610
 invite you to watch him go there 

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.690
 look rather it's a video and so 

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.730
 this is thank you by the way look at this 

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:53.510
