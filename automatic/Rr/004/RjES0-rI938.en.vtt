far<00:01:03.930> back<00:01:04.170> as<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.040> tail<00:01:05.489> material<00:01:06.110> one<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.200> my

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
far back as a tail material one of my

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.690 
far back as a tail material one of my
favorite<00:01:07.619> tail<00:01:07.830> materials<00:01:08.310> out<00:01:08.430> there<00:01:08.610> is

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
favorite tail materials out there is

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.570 
favorite tail materials out there is
 DeLeon<00:01:09.420> mostly<00:01:10.409> because<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:10.920> very

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
 DeLeon mostly because it's very

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.160 
 DeLeon mostly because it's very
very<00:01:11.820> durable<00:01:12.090> that's<00:01:12.450> probably<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.900> number

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
very durable that's probably the number

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.450 
very durable that's probably the number
one<00:01:13.350> reason<00:01:13.650> why<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.799> like<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.130> but<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.310> also

all the way I'm gonna taper it ever so
slightly<00:02:13.690> so<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.290> will<00:02:14.440> go<00:02:14.560> about<00:02:14.740> halfway<00:02:15.040> down

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
slightly so I will go about halfway down

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.530 
slightly so I will go about halfway down
build<00:02:16.390> my<00:02:16.540> thread<00:02:16.780> back<00:02:16.810> up<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.560> behind<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:17.890> lead

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
build my thread back up to behind a lead

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.870 
build my thread back up to behind a lead
about<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:19.720> third<00:02:20.110> of<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.350> way<00:02:20.470> down<00:02:20.730> build<00:02:21.730> my

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
about a third of the way down build my

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.940 
about a third of the way down build my
thread<00:02:22.180> back<00:02:22.360> up<00:02:22.660> just<00:02:23.200> tapering<00:02:23.620> this<00:02:23.770> fly

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
thread back up just tapering this fly

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.880 
thread back up just tapering this fly
ever<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:24.700> slightly

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
ever so slightly

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.080 
ever so slightly
okay<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.070> at<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.340> point<00:02:27.670> dopes<00:02:29.970> gonna<00:02:30.970> go

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
okay and at that point dopes gonna go

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.730 
okay and at that point dopes gonna go
ahead<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.300> put<00:02:31.420> a<00:02:31.450> half<00:02:31.690> hitch<00:02:31.900> secure<00:02:32.620> the

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
ahead and put a half hitch secure the

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.030 
ahead and put a half hitch secure the
light<00:02:32.920> that's<00:02:33.760> right<00:02:34.500> now<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.560> make<00:02:35.680> this<00:02:35.860> fly

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
light that's right now to make this fly

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.170 
light that's right now to make this fly
a<00:02:36.070> little<00:02:36.220> more<00:02:36.340> durable<00:02:36.430> I'm<00:02:36.820> gonna<00:02:37.000> take

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
a little more durable I'm gonna take

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.199 
a little more durable I'm gonna take
some<00:02:37.360> head<00:02:37.540> cement<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:39.220> just<00:02:39.430> put<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.730> little

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209

bead

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.300 

now<00:03:33.000> I'm<00:03:33.090> tying<00:03:33.299> this<00:03:33.420> on<00:03:33.599> a<00:03:33.629> jig<00:03:33.959> hook

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
now I'm tying this on a jig hook

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.130 
now I'm tying this on a jig hook
primarily<00:03:35.310> Jake<00:03:36.239> hooks<00:03:36.420> right<00:03:36.659> upside-down

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
primarily Jake hooks right upside-down

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.559 
primarily Jake hooks right upside-down
Amacker<00:03:37.769> keeps<00:03:38.549> that<00:03:38.700> point<00:03:39.000> off<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.150> bottom

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
Amacker keeps that point off the bottom

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.880 
Amacker keeps that point off the bottom
there's<00:03:39.959> any<00:03:40.170> more<00:03:40.290> woody<00:03:41.069> debris<00:03:41.250> or<00:03:41.879> other

obstinate<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.189> idea<00:03:44.459> behind<00:03:44.609> it<00:03:44.819> is<00:03:45.170> it<00:03:46.170> will

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
obstinate the idea behind it is it will

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.890 
obstinate the idea behind it is it will
reduce<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.799> amount<00:03:47.340> of<00:03:47.760> hang-ups<00:03:48.689> that<00:03:48.780> you

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
reduce the amount of hang-ups that you

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.559 
reduce the amount of hang-ups that you
have<00:03:49.019> on<00:03:49.139> the<00:03:49.230> stream<00:03:49.500> body<00:03:49.819> and<00:03:50.819> hopefully

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
have on the stream body and hopefully

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.740 
have on the stream body and hopefully
keep<00:03:51.959> more<00:03:52.139> flies<00:03:52.349> in<00:03:52.500> your<00:03:52.620> box<00:03:53.480> so<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.510> finish

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
keep more flies in your box so to finish

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.270 
keep more flies in your box so to finish
