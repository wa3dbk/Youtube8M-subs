00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.130 
it looks like when it comes out 810
minutes<00:02:07.159> here<00:02:08.090> they<00:02:08.269> are<00:02:08.450> they've<00:02:08.810> been<00:02:09.019> in

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
the oven for about nine minutes then it

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.059 
the oven for about nine minutes then it
says<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.420> pour<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:14.840> bag<00:02:15.170> of<00:02:15.380> chocolate<00:02:15.800> chips

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410
