00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:12.160
 Bolivian Vice President said on Tuesday (July 2), President Evo Morales was "kidnapped" after his plane flew from Russia forced to divert and landed in Austria. 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.760
 The plane was forced to divert in accusations that Edward Snowden was on board. 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:26.900
 Mr. Alvaro Garcia Linera accused France and Portugal of canceling Mr. Morales's aviation license, leading to a sudden stop in Vienna. 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:37.230
 "This completely violates the Vienna Convention, which says that the flights of world leaders cannot be hindered and have the right to exempt regulations. 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.630
 Some European governments have banned President Evo's plane from passing through their airspace. 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.300
 We want to tell all the people in the world that President Morales' plane was kidnapped by imperialism. " 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:06.860
 Bolivia's defense minister said the US State Department may be behind the decision not to allow Morales aircraft to land in Portugal or fly over France. 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:18.460
 There is no evidence that Snowden - who was wanted by Washington by espionage after revealing details about US phone and Internet surveillance - left Moscow airport. 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:28.560
 Bolivia is one of more than a dozen countries where Snowden sought refugees and Morales said he would consider granting asylum if requested. 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.760
 "We call on Latin American people, progressive governments to speak up. 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:45.200
 We ask Latin American people and governments to hold an emergency meeting to condemn this abuse. 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:55.830
 Latin America is being trampled, Bolivia is the smallest country in the region, but the country with the largest flight on the continent. " 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:11.100
 Snowden's choice seems to have shrunk since he arrived in Moscow from Hong Kong on June 23 and had no valid papers after his passport was revoked. 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:18.300
 US President Barack Obama has warned that any country that allows refugees will take the trouble. 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:28.400
 Five countries have refused to grant refugees to Snowden, seven have said they will consider the request if done on their territory, and eight said they have not made a decision yet.
