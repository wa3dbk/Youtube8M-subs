00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.560
 as the title of this art exhibition says 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.800
 the island of the day after me 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.810
 the intent is to create an image via imagination 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.699
 I look for melisa of the day after channel 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:21.269
 to always be imagined keyboards always the day after never be 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.269
 something finished I have a finished product 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:31.919
 % and this is what I think of the image of the regeneration of the idea 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:33.810
 picture 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.450
 that image 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.749
 - inserted 

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:37.950
 % 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.880
 it is not a product that we cannot simply consume that 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.180
 and in front of us 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.510
 we are italo via lazzaro worm away 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.850
 lema ram 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.140
 require 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.610
 xda essentially of our participation and imagination 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.300
 and therefore through a very specific evocative stimulus 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.070
 hegemony is rooted in our imagination 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.180
 and therefore 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.320
 this island of the image is already visible and has begun 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.189
 angelmule are 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.270
 every job presents 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.180
 this characteristic 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.300
 but every job is on the whole 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.490
 form this 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.830
 this kind of scenario 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.870
 that then earth in our imagination forms the island 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.220
 and not in the form of an imaginative peninsula 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.740
 but it also gives us some experience 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.130
 which constitutes us 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.500
 inter 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.800
 compared to things 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.470
 a kind of ritka, I'd say 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.350
 for example 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.760
 we have that of black marble with 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.950
 the coal forms pastes 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.480
 plant for milk geometry 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.790
 of my pugnochiuso that exerts a pressure on a sky naples goes into this 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.070
 I'm on coal 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.749
 is 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:13.709
 we see that it has five corners like the closed cumin, which is a little more 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.089
 abrupt bigger flash 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:19.509
 speedup.it the smurfs we see 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:21.759
 pass through 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:25.419
 villa toriton such from the form are filled with coal 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.160
 petrasso this pressure put us waiting for a creation that is a 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.630
 diamond in fact the work is called waiting for a diamond 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:37.109
 and it is like a metaphor of the 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:38.869
 of the becoming of an idea 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:42.599
 thought a church as a form eats pizza 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.649
 insert the image 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:46.919
 3 intrigues me 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:50.909
 create site link these points which are black holes 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:54.499
 and they had filled with black matter 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:58.949
 i ching the darkness gets even darker 

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:00.369
 echo 

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:02.099
 and then we have 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.529
 these series 7 st items 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:08.929
 rss with randomly serving spaces 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:12.359
 home for the space inside them 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.709
 reano another space 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.059
 an ancient space an invisible space 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:20.569
 and these seven elements are like 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.859
 rt - do a tactile action 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:29.079
 as if it touches absurdities brought to mind an invisible body 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:34.340
 photos are exposed speeches in various ways and this invisible door changes 

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:40.999
 therefore of form and the antitode to the whole milk waiting for a diamond a 

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:43.039
 this darkness more than darkness 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:45.419
 actually the polar star 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.189
 that that is 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:52.459
 impaled in the cross of the slots of the gallery floor 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:55.809
 and as always 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:04:00.349
 for this chair 8 one powdered it is channeled if long 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.389
 slot channel of the 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.100
 in the weather concrete floor 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.099
 let's do a job 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.480
 if specific 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.739
 after years 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.499
 Classical terms of the term is the weaver of sunsets in two others who 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:16.279
 yes count 

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:17.209
 I'm 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.510
 samantha also my geometric or even my right hand 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:22.559
 left hand 

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:25.270
 in the position in which then usually 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.460
 let's say let's stretch a thread 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.090
 in fact the child goes through this 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.530
 this red stone this red thread that 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:40.330
 nokia is the same color as stone 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.980
 stevie nicks weight 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.610
 at most trilly designs 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.309
 diy in length 

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:49.309
 and this I like peaches 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.129
 create this work 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:56.249
 a body not an installation a body in extension 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.180
 and this extension 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.630
 and as the last glow in the case of sunsets weavers 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.009
 the last glow of light on the horizon 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.110
 paella we have for a single purpose hours 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.110
 which presents itself and 2 concavities 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:15.550
 that through 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.089
 the indifferent positioning 

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:21.379
 relation alarms the origin of light 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:24.159
 post for varese various phases of the moon 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:29.800
 and at the same time there is almost a hint of a star design of a face that is 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.119
 it amazes looking at the various phases of the moon 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:35.850
 so too 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.860
 of my drawings 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.240
 unicredit and in the form of a triangle in this space then another space 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.770
 in the space 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.059
 and in these drawings 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:48.219
 as never seen 

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:52.969
 throw stars in the dark orion before using 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:57.690
 they are a different point of view on the same imagined of the sculptures 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:58.800
 just that 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.169
 with drawings 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.639
 that a strange thing happens that I book this imaginary 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:09.729
 tends towards an insurance element is a similar figure in the sculptures 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:12.050
 would become trivial 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.050
 It seems to me that these drawings are finely depicted 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.950
 to accept an enigmatic evocative sense 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.910
 in the sculptures the same without an enigmatic cover just reached of the photos 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.619
 through the 

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:27.929
 abstraction
