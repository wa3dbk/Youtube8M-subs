there were a couple screenshots that

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.939 
there were a couple screenshots that

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
went around and it looks pretty

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.500 
went around and it looks pretty
convincing<00:00:32.130> but<00:00:32.790> again<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.180> was<00:00:33.270> just<00:00:33.300> a

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
convincing but again it was just a

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.000 
convincing but again it was just a
screenshot<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.469> then<00:00:35.059> some<00:00:36.059> gameplay

screenshot and then some gameplay

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.709 
screenshot and then some gameplay
emerged<00:00:38.010> again<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.670> was<00:00:38.790> really<00:00:39.120> only<00:00:39.329> about

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
emerged again it was really only about

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.170 
emerged again it was really only about
two<00:00:40.379> seconds<00:00:41.040> or<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.340> it's<00:00:41.579> really<00:00:41.879> really

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
two seconds or so it's really really

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.479 
two seconds or so it's really really
short<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.600> just<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.899> walk<00:00:43.140> cycle<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.739> sir

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
short it's just a walk cycle of sir

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.369 
short it's just a walk cycle of sir
dating<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.850> four<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.149> ski<00:00:45.360> but<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:46.230> looked

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
dating a four to ski but it looked

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.840 
dating a four to ski but it looked
really<00:00:46.469> really<00:00:46.770> good<00:00:46.980> if<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> fake

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
really really good if this is a fake

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.760

they<00:00:48.120> went<00:00:48.329> through<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> lot<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.320> trouble<00:00:49.649> to

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
they went through a lot of trouble to

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.189 
they went through a lot of trouble to
make<00:00:49.860> us<00:00:50.010> look<00:00:50.190> legitimate<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.840> don't<00:00:52.079> know

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
make us look legitimate so I don't know

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.200 
make us look legitimate so I don't know
if<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.070> real<00:00:53.430> but<00:00:53.610> we<00:00:53.699> haven't<00:00:53.969> had<00:00:54.120> at
