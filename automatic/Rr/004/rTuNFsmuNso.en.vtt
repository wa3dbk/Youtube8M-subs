but I think a lot of people have sort of

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.049 
but I think a lot of people have sort of
felt<00:00:47.190> he's<00:00:47.340> sort<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.610> falling<00:00:47.910> off<00:00:48.000> the

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
because blocking and that sort of this

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.500 
because blocking and that sort of this
camera<00:03:01.190> move<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:01.519> you<00:03:01.700> know<00:03:01.819> there's<00:03:02.239> a<00:03:02.300> more

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
camera move and you know there's a more

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.540 
camera move and you know there's a more
a<00:03:02.750> more<00:03:02.930> cinematic<00:03:03.350> sense<00:03:03.769> to<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.340> way<00:03:04.430> they

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
a more cinematic sense to the way they

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.280
