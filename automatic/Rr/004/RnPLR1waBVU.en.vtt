00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:03.949
 2 light sources are used in this shoot 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.809
 our model is in this shoot because it's here and I'm showing them a visor now 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:09.409
 on 

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.529
 Actor can take a photo 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:17.300
 we have a clique source positioned to the right of the model so by the photographer 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.159
 seen 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:21.159
 and equipped with a troop OGS 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.839
 Epp is just as a tablet is coming 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:28.399
 Also with a so-called docks further hopes boxes with double taxation and both 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.399
 have the power 400 Ward seconds 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.640
 since this boxing point of view is very much in the morning but I watch it 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.570
 set pretty low power 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.360
 So from the top wants to come 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.080
 two common five stages 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.320
 from Precht two stages that equates to about 30 to 40 percent of 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.750
 overall performance 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.960
 the background is clear that 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.580
 the light comes out of the sample Rapps of Books will be very nice the 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.800
 Harrer erased from the rage 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.030
 and now I take some pictures and then I explain the Camara to them 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.030
 Attitude to it 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.400
 I will now 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.550
 Deaton after shooting scared politics and hands up a bit 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.310
 so 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.310
 just look up 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.670
 the slopes around 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.670
 Position appointed in October 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.080
 is the tenor but to mimic woman 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.400
 more Zuber 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.140
 Rheine different position 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.380

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.620
 wonderful 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.620
 always look up 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
 that makes one 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
 strong upswing 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.450
 his gift 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.660
 You can also do a shot 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.390
 we work w at other shoots with percent per format 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.759
 this number 100 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.589
 that is very good 

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:13.039
 little noise 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:16.129
 and manual settings 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:17.789
 Shutter speed 1 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:22.759

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:28.090
 2 light sources can not only be used by Kühn where to place 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:29.630

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.020
 the cover page is 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.240
 You can also 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.020
 right and long and model-kolleg mushroom heads referred to positioning boxes 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.989
 With that they reached a photo 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.450
 Virtually virtually no shadows can be seen that is saying good for that 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.710
