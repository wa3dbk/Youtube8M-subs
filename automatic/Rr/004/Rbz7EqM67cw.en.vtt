stainless steel door handle open that's
you<00:00:28.750> can<00:00:28.930> start<00:00:29.380> to<00:00:29.500> see<00:00:29.710> the<00:00:30.210> lodge<00:00:31.210> that

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:31.540 
you can start to see the lodge that

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.510 
you can start to see the lodge that
firebox<00:00:32.050> really<00:00:32.439> is<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:34.030> fact<00:00:35.220> it's<00:00:36.220> large

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
firebox really is in fact it's large

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.819 
firebox really is in fact it's large
enough<00:00:36.610> to<00:00:36.760> take<00:00:37.030> five<00:00:38.020> hundred<00:00:38.470> millimeter

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 
enough to take five hundred millimeter

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:45.960 
enough to take five hundred millimeter
length<00:00:44.130> you<00:00:45.130> can<00:00:45.250> probably<00:00:45.400> get<00:00:45.579> one<00:00:45.610> or<00:00:45.820> two

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
length you can probably get one or two

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.370 
length you can probably get one or two
pieces<00:00:46.180> in<00:00:46.510> there<00:00:46.660> once<00:00:46.840> you<00:00:46.930> get<00:00:47.079> that<00:00:47.200> fire

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
pieces in there once you get that fire

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.020 
pieces in there once you get that fire
going<00:00:47.410> because<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:48.280> height<00:00:48.520> of<00:00:48.730> the<00:00:48.820> stove

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
going because the height of the stove

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.310 
going because the height of the stove
you<00:00:49.180> can<00:00:49.239> actually<00:00:49.570> stand<00:00:49.840> molding

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
you can actually stand molding

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.050 
you can actually stand molding
vertically<00:00:51.160> rather<00:00:51.340> than<00:00:51.550> having<00:00:51.760> to<00:00:51.910> lie

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.060 
vertically rather than having to lie

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.610 
vertically rather than having to lie
them<00:00:52.300> down<00:00:52.480> so<00:00:53.079> you're<00:00:53.200> gonna<00:00:53.290> get<00:00:53.440> that

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
them down so you're gonna get that

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.940 
them down so you're gonna get that
really<00:00:54.250> big<00:00:54.550> roaring<00:00:54.970> flame<00:00:55.180> picture<00:00:55.920> as<00:00:56.920> a

really big roaring flame picture as a

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.830 
really big roaring flame picture as a
result<00:00:57.430> this<00:00:57.790> stove<00:00:58.120> is<00:00:58.270> actually<00:00:58.570> 10

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
result this stove is actually 10

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.930 
result this stove is actually 10
kilowatts<00:00:59.290> in<00:00:59.440> output<00:00:59.829> they<00:01:00.370> actually<00:01:00.730> tested

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
kilowatts in output they actually tested

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.360 
kilowatts in output they actually tested
this<00:01:01.120> stove<00:01:01.329> up<00:01:01.480> to<00:01:01.630> about<00:01:01.780> 24<00:01:02.260> kilowatts<00:01:02.710> but

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
this stove up to about 24 kilowatts but

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.130 
this stove up to about 24 kilowatts but
the<00:01:03.520> nominal<00:01:04.000> recommended<00:01:04.629> output<00:01:04.960> you're

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
the nominal recommended output you're

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:13.530 
the nominal recommended output you're
going<00:01:05.290> to<00:01:05.350> get<00:01:05.469> most<00:01:05.649> of<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:05.979> time<00:01:06.250> is<00:01:06.399> 10<00:01:12.510> okay

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
going to get most of the time is 10 okay

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.420 
going to get most of the time is 10 okay
now<00:01:13.659> I've<00:01:13.900> got<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.080> door<00:01:14.229> open<00:01:14.260> we<00:01:14.799> can<00:01:14.830> see<00:01:15.070> it

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
now I've got the door open we can see it

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.210 
now I've got the door open we can see it
at<00:01:15.520> the<00:01:15.580> top<00:01:15.820> here<00:01:16.090> we<00:01:16.360> have<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.990> air<00:01:17.200> control

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
at the top here we have the air control

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.539 
at the top here we have the air control
NORs<00:01:18.909> unusual<00:01:19.420> and<00:01:19.830> typical<00:01:20.830> of<00:01:21.010> units<00:01:21.430> of

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
NORs unusual and typical of units of

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.310 
NORs unusual and typical of units of
stones<00:01:21.790> is<00:01:22.090> that<00:01:22.330> the<00:01:22.420> air<00:01:22.570> wash<00:01:22.810> is<00:01:23.020> actually

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
stones is that the air wash is actually

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.740 
stones is that the air wash is actually
inside<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:23.920> door<00:01:24.250> so<00:01:24.880> when<00:01:25.030> I<00:01:25.060> close<00:01:25.360> the<00:01:25.390> door

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
inside the door so when I close the door

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.250 
inside the door so when I close the door
there<00:01:25.960> you<00:01:26.640> can't<00:01:27.640> actually<00:01:27.820> access<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:29.170> air

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
there you can't actually access the air

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.140 
there you can't actually access the air
control<00:01:29.680> now<00:01:30.400> this<00:01:30.549> is<00:01:30.670> something<00:01:30.970> that<00:01:31.000> you

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
control now this is something that you

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.670 
control now this is something that you
fix<00:01:31.330> our<00:01:31.479> thoughts<00:01:31.750> about<00:01:31.869> and<00:01:32.200> actually<00:01:32.320> is

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
fix our thoughts about and actually is

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.800 
fix our thoughts about and actually is
part<00:01:33.010> of<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.250> design<00:01:33.580> and<00:01:33.939> the<00:01:34.119> reason<00:01:34.479> for<00:01:34.510> it

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
part of the design and the reason for it

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.890 
part of the design and the reason for it
is<00:01:34.960> they<00:01:35.229> don't<00:01:35.380> want<00:01:35.880> leavers<00:01:36.880> or<00:01:37.240> dials<00:01:37.750> or

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
is they don't want leavers or dials or

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.719 
is they don't want leavers or dials or
controls<00:01:38.260> like<00:01:38.470> that's<00:01:38.710> sticking<00:01:39.549> up<00:01:39.640> from

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
controls like that's sticking up from

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.550 
controls like that's sticking up from
the<00:01:39.850> outside<00:01:40.150> and<00:01:40.540> spoiling<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:41.140> overall

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
the outside and spoiling the overall

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.310 
the outside and spoiling the overall
aesthetics<00:01:42.430> of<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:42.790> stone<00:01:43.030> so<00:01:43.570> it's<00:01:43.720> a<00:01:43.780> purely

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
aesthetics of the stone so it's a purely

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.130 
aesthetics of the stone so it's a purely
designing<00:01:44.979> orientated<00:01:45.729> feature<00:01:45.970> so<00:01:46.780> you<00:01:46.869> open

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
designing orientated feature so you open

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.010 
designing orientated feature so you open
the<00:01:47.200> door<00:01:47.380> and<00:01:48.070> you<00:01:48.820> can<00:01:49.030> control<00:01:49.540> your<00:01:49.810> air

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
the door and you can control your air

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.969 
the door and you can control your air
wash<00:01:50.229> from<00:01:51.130> there<00:01:52.259> now<00:01:53.259> the<00:01:53.350> primary<00:01:53.680> air

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
wash from there now the primary air

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.679 
wash from there now the primary air
control<00:01:54.340> isn't<00:01:54.549> that<00:01:54.820> spin<00:01:55.119> out<00:01:55.270> it's<00:01:55.420> likely

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
control isn't that spin out it's likely

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.570 
control isn't that spin out it's likely
to<00:01:55.720> down<00:01:55.960> here<00:01:56.170> is<00:01:56.320> this<00:01:56.470> really<00:01:56.830> nice<00:01:56.979> still

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
to down here is this really nice still

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.929 
to down here is this really nice still
this<00:01:58.590> with<00:01:59.590> different<00:01:59.770> holes<00:02:00.070> in<00:02:00.280> it<00:02:00.400> to<00:02:00.909> show

this with different holes in it to show
you<00:02:01.119> how<00:02:01.570> much<00:02:01.720> anything<00:02:02.049> letting<00:02:02.409> in<00:02:02.530> you
