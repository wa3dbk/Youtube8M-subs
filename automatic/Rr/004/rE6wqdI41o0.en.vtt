couple of ultra marathons the place just
really<00:01:20.749> grabbed<00:01:21.079> me<00:01:21.320> really<00:01:21.890> interested<00:01:22.340> me

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
really grabbed me really interested me

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.429 
really grabbed me really interested me
in<00:01:22.520> my<00:01:23.090> first<00:01:23.359> thoughts<00:01:23.600> where<00:01:23.869> I<00:01:23.899> had<00:01:24.079> have<00:01:24.409> to

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
in my first thoughts where I had have to

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.770 
in my first thoughts where I had have to
go<00:01:24.770> and<00:01:25.009> secondly<00:01:25.399> I<00:01:25.520> really<00:01:26.210> like<00:01:26.359> to<00:01:26.479> try<00:01:26.659> and

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
go and secondly I really like to try and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:34.069 
go and secondly I really like to try and
break<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.109> records

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.480 

so<00:01:35.079> this<00:01:35.200> is<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.439> rock<00:01:35.590> palace<00:01:36.009> to<00:01:36.100> be<00:01:36.189> my<00:01:36.310> home

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
so this is the rock palace to be my home

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.550 
so this is the rock palace to be my home
for<00:01:36.520> that<00:01:36.850> for<00:01:37.270> sixty<00:01:37.630> days<00:01:37.810> hopefully<00:01:38.110> on

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
for that for sixty days hopefully on

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.399 
for that for sixty days hopefully on
rock<00:01:38.829> or<00:01:39.039> having<00:01:39.490> looked<00:01:39.700> at<00:01:40.149> various<00:01:40.990> things

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
rock or having looked at various things

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.590 
rock or having looked at various things
I<00:01:41.619> actually<00:01:41.740> saw<00:01:42.250> a<00:01:42.579> water<00:01:42.939> Bowser<00:01:43.270> at<00:01:43.509> the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
I actually saw a water Bowser at the

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.779 
I actually saw a water Bowser at the
side<00:01:43.810> of<00:01:43.929> the<00:01:43.990> road<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:44.439> thought<00:01:45.399> that's<00:01:45.579> the

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
side of the road and thought that's the

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.749 
side of the road and thought that's the
ideal<00:01:46.659> vessel<00:01:47.110> for<00:01:47.560> me<00:01:47.679> this<00:01:47.979> is<00:01:48.130> my<00:01:48.280> access

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
ideal vessel for me this is my access

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.580 
ideal vessel for me this is my access

both<00:02:20.980> hatches<00:02:21.489> down<00:02:21.790> these<00:02:22.090> crossover<00:02:23.079> straps

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
both hatches down these crossover straps

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.020 
both hatches down these crossover straps
are<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.620> ones<00:02:23.799> I'll<00:02:23.980> be<00:02:24.069> using<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.549> lift<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:24.910> on

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
are the ones I'll be using to lift it on

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.180 
are the ones I'll be using to lift it on
and<00:02:25.209> off<00:02:25.299> the<00:02:25.510> boat<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:26.319> get<00:02:26.440> it<00:02:26.560> into<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.950> sea

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
and off the boat to get it into the sea

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.339 
and off the boat to get it into the sea
to<00:02:27.400> tow<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:27.760> rock<00:02:28.120> all<00:02:28.329> these<00:02:28.690> additional

to tow it to rock all these additional

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.470 
to tow it to rock all these additional
straps<00:02:29.650> at<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:29.920> front<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.640> part<00:02:31.269> of<00:02:31.360> the

straps at the front a part of the
winching<00:02:31.900> mechanism<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.739> so<00:02:33.400> they'll<00:02:33.519> be

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
winching mechanism and so they'll be

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.490 
winching mechanism and so they'll be
used<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:34.090> bring<00:02:34.299> the<00:02:34.450> pod<00:02:34.660> up<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.140> side<00:02:35.350> of

used to bring the pod up the side of
Rockall<00:02:35.739> I've<00:02:36.370> really<00:02:36.760> enjoyed<00:02:36.819> the<00:02:37.180> process

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
Rockall I've really enjoyed the process

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.710 
Rockall I've really enjoyed the process
of<00:02:38.459> constructing<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.670> pod<00:02:39.880> of<00:02:40.090> researching

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
of constructing the pod of researching

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.750 
of constructing the pod of researching
how<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:40.900> get<00:02:41.200> there<00:02:41.410> of<00:02:41.620> finding<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.609> best

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
how to get there of finding the best

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.640 
how to get there of finding the best
boat<00:02:43.090> just<00:02:43.600> just<00:02:43.840> getting<00:02:44.109> to<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.290> start<00:02:44.560> line

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.030 
boat just just getting to the start line
has<00:02:44.920> been<00:02:45.100> a<00:02:45.400> very<00:02:46.000> big<00:02:46.450> challenge<00:02:46.480> and<00:02:47.350> one<00:02:47.920> of

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
has been a very big challenge and one of

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.520 
has been a very big challenge and one of
really<00:02:48.639> enjoyed<00:02:48.970> just<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:49.720> logistics<00:02:50.260> of<00:02:50.410> it

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
really enjoyed just the logistics of it

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.590 
really enjoyed just the logistics of it
a<00:02:50.590> little<00:02:50.709> bit<00:02:50.859> of<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:50.980> handle<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:51.670> then<00:02:52.060> up<00:02:52.299> and

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
a little bit of a handle and then up and

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:03.449 
a little bit of a handle and then up and
in<00:02:54.540> that's<00:02:55.540> it<00:02:55.889> not<00:02:56.889> too<00:02:57.130> complicated<00:03:02.459> it's

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
in that's it not too complicated it's

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:04.920 
in that's it not too complicated it's
fairly<00:03:03.730> fairly<00:03:04.180> small<00:03:04.450> in<00:03:04.510> here<00:03:04.810> I<00:03:04.840> mean

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
fairly fairly small in here I mean

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.509 
fairly fairly small in here I mean
obviously<00:03:05.049> at<00:03:05.319> this<00:03:05.470> end<00:03:05.709> I<00:03:05.950> can't<00:03:06.220> sit<00:03:06.489> up

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
obviously at this end I can't sit up

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.640 
obviously at this end I can't sit up
straight<00:03:07.000> I<00:03:07.030> can<00:03:07.299> just<00:03:07.510> about<00:03:07.630> sit<00:03:08.049> up<00:03:08.230> hunched

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
straight I can just about sit up hunched

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.220 
straight I can just about sit up hunched
by<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.430> access<00:03:09.970> hatch<00:03:10.299> I<00:03:10.600> don't<00:03:11.049> normally

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
by the access hatch I don't normally

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.890 
by the access hatch I don't normally
suffer<00:03:11.889> from<00:03:12.069> claustrophobia<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:13.150> my<00:03:13.660> hope

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
suffer from claustrophobia and my hope

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.500 
suffer from claustrophobia and my hope
is<00:03:14.170> that<00:03:14.200> I'm<00:03:14.500> not<00:03:14.680> going<00:03:14.829> to<00:03:14.920> be<00:03:15.069> stuck<00:03:15.940> in<00:03:16.209> the

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
is that I'm not going to be stuck in the

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.960 
is that I'm not going to be stuck in the
pod<00:03:16.750> for<00:03:17.109> more<00:03:17.290> than<00:03:17.530> two<00:03:18.190> or<00:03:18.310> three<00:03:18.340> days<00:03:18.519> at<00:03:18.910> a

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
pod for more than two or three days at a

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.949 
pod for more than two or three days at a
time<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.709> if<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.950> weather's<00:03:21.220> at<00:03:21.430> all<00:03:21.959> clear

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
time and if the weather's at all clear

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.470 
time and if the weather's at all clear
then<00:03:23.350> I'm<00:03:23.560> going<00:03:23.799> to<00:03:23.859> be<00:03:23.980> out<00:03:24.130> of<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:24.400> pod<00:03:24.609> and

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
then I'm going to be out of the pod and

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.259 
then I'm going to be out of the pod and
on<00:03:25.599> the<00:03:25.750> rock<00:03:25.959> and<00:03:26.430> not<00:03:27.430> really<00:03:27.760> stretching<00:03:28.180> my

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
on the rock and not really stretching my

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.030 
on the rock and not really stretching my
legs<00:03:28.510> but<00:03:28.720> certainly<00:03:29.049> be<00:03:29.440> able<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.709> stretch

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
legs but certainly be able to stretch

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.910 
legs but certainly be able to stretch
the<00:03:30.250> body<00:03:30.400> out<00:03:30.639> a<00:03:30.670> bit<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.180> stand<00:03:31.989> up<00:03:32.230> and<00:03:32.440> move

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
the body out a bit and stand up and move

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.849 
the body out a bit and stand up and move
around<00:03:33.160> and<00:03:33.609> do<00:03:33.700> some<00:03:33.910> exercise<00:03:34.650> so<00:03:35.650> really

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
around and do some exercise so really

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.009 
around and do some exercise so really
the<00:03:36.099> pod<00:03:36.310> is<00:03:36.519> just<00:03:36.880> shelter<00:03:37.239> for<00:03:37.600> extreme

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
the pod is just shelter for extreme

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.000 
the pod is just shelter for extreme
weather<00:03:38.199> and<00:03:38.380> sleeping

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.950 

so<00:03:44.010> this<00:03:44.160> is<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.490> portable<00:03:44.970> petrol<00:03:45.390> winch<00:03:45.600> and

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
so this is the portable petrol winch and

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.590 
so this is the portable petrol winch and
which<00:03:46.260> I'll<00:03:46.440> be<00:03:46.530> using<00:03:46.710> to<00:03:47.040> bring<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:47.970> pod<00:03:48.240> and

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
which I'll be using to bring the pod and

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.830 
which I'll be using to bring the pod and
all<00:03:48.720> my<00:03:48.870> equipment<00:03:49.320> up<00:03:49.440> onto<00:03:49.860> rock<00:03:50.040> or<00:03:50.690> two<00:03:51.690> of

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
all my equipment up onto rock or two of

00:03:51.840 --> 00:04:06.360 
all my equipment up onto rock or two of
those<00:03:51.990> one<00:03:52.680> of<00:03:52.710> those<00:03:57.170> that's<00:03:58.170> it

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.069 

there's<00:04:07.370> two<00:04:07.610> things<00:04:07.849> in<00:04:08.030> this<00:04:08.420> Pelle<00:04:08.810> case

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
there's two things in this Pelle case

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.940 
there's two things in this Pelle case
actually<00:04:10.360> there<00:04:11.360> is<00:04:11.629> the<00:04:12.260> road<00:04:12.439> to<00:04:12.590> the<00:04:12.709> tail

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
actually there is the road to the tail

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.550 
actually there is the road to the tail
blade<00:04:13.280> from<00:04:13.670> my<00:04:13.790> wind<00:04:13.970> turbine<00:04:14.360> that<00:04:14.599> packs

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
blade from my wind turbine that packs

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.050 
blade from my wind turbine that packs
nicely<00:04:15.980> in<00:04:16.039> there<00:04:16.190> and<00:04:16.400> then<00:04:16.549> this<00:04:16.669> is<00:04:16.880> my

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
nicely in there and then this is my

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.849 
nicely in there and then this is my
began<00:04:17.600> satellite<00:04:18.169> unit<00:04:18.759> with<00:04:19.759> phone<00:04:20.680> so<00:04:21.680> that

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
began satellite unit with phone so that

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.430 
began satellite unit with phone so that
will<00:04:21.979> enable<00:04:22.340> me<00:04:22.520> to<00:04:22.639> keep<00:04:22.970> in<00:04:23.150> contact<00:04:23.750> with

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
will enable me to keep in contact with

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.050 
will enable me to keep in contact with
the<00:04:24.530> outside<00:04:24.650> world<00:04:25.130> and<00:04:25.430> this<00:04:25.669> is<00:04:25.850> where<00:04:26.030> all
