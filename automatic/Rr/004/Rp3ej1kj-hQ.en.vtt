00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
below I'm gonna have to go for a whole

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.870 
below I'm gonna have to go for a whole
because<00:01:37.409> they've<00:01:37.979> got<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.250> hardest<00:01:38.670> for<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
because they've got the hardest for the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.270 
because they've got the hardest for the
games<00:01:39.259> Sunderland's<00:01:40.259> or<00:01:40.470> Damon<00:01:40.829> Hammond<00:01:41.159> as

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
games Sunderland's or Damon Hammond as

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.240 
games Sunderland's or Damon Hammond as
well<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:41.729> they<00:01:41.909> could<00:01:42.180> prove<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:43.409> know<00:01:43.439> useful

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
well so they could prove you know useful

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.499 
well so they could prove you know useful
and<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.430> think<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.820> their<00:01:44.970> games<00:01:45.149> aren't<00:01:45.360> as

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
and I think that their games aren't as

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.969 
and I think that their games aren't as
