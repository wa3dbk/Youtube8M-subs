00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.830
 Good day to all, today we will 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.160
 cook chops and so what do you need this 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.160
 need to 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.850
 voluminous and will cook today two 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.399
 species of chicken breast and pork 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.640
 here beaten full-time meat so here he is 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.949
 shines for billing and see here so she 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.280
 The exact bit is called and this is the usual 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.260
 chicken breast you need to separate it from 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.570
 bones or buy ready-made separated 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.570
 chicken breast divide it into several 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.180
 parts to fight off are called this 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.700
 chops and winches from someone like somewhere 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.090
 used to call so look here 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.270
 chicken breast divided into three parts 1 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:21.259
 and 2 so much easier so easier and and repel when 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:24.000
 she will cut it from this side 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.440
 if there are bones necessarily them 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.940
 cut happens here you see here 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.289
 I got a bone 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:36.630
 because we will beat back to later 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:39.360
 ready bits as I was fine here 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.479
 so now you will need here 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.219
 such a hammer here such a hammer 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.930
 surface or is it iron 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:50.159
 metal or wood which you have 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.979
 eat meat proteins at home set on top 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.259
 a bag so that when we beat off all not 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.079
 flew all over the kitchen we beat to the thickness 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.789
 about 0 5 centimeters less than 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.439
 it is necessary that the meat is not very bright and 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:05.189
 otherwise it will not be felt. 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.530
 around one batter beat back and pork and 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.739
 chicken what do you have remember what 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.900
 chicken breasts they are more lean pork 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.000
 fatter but generally tiles they can 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.680
 to be lean per se but of course 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.720
 Between pork and chicken there is a big 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.670
 difference keep this in mind if you 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.770
 choose by precisely and pork meat 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.990
 look so as not to be 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.980
 a lot of fat on it because it will 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.800
 too fat 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.310
 we beat off the meat well we beat off all 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.980
 meat 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.340
 look at the thickness 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:38.030
 pork chops and that's such a thickness 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.670
 chicken is a little thicker it is a little thinner 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.030
 so that the wall they are not transparent 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:48.730
 you now need to add salt here and so we salt 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:53.810
 on the one hand we turn it all over and 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:57.590
 we salt on the other hand we salt now 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.040
 take the eggs so I took 2 eggs just 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.040
 fork 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.830
 slightly salted in the bathroom 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:10.390
 take a little pepper but you can 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.950
 take any spices but i take the pepper 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.200
 can any herb add all that to us 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.080
 like and and just pepper without adding 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:23.690
 Nothing more 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:25.280
 good so I could see terribly protein 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.530
 of ours but all is well alright 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.720
 mixed well mixed 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:34.280
 Now we take flour, too, need to salt 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:38.270
 also slightly because we all see 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:43.250
 salt and meat and eggs and flour 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:46.030
 so here is someone you like you can even 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.920
 flour add a little pepper 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.820
 that the top looked little Berge 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:56.350
 but this is optional I add now 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.970
 so we do and the kidneys 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.570
 heat the pan add there 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.000
 butter 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.910
 it should warm up well not well 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.510
 be cold then look like me 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:12.560
 I will do take heels take a twig 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:15.770
 dip it in the egg on one side here 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.070
 so that's good and on the other hand not 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.670
 spare eggs because the more he 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.550
 get wet and so 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:28.270
 homogeneous batter will Svetku 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:31.030
 shifts to flour and well good 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.720
 we fall asleep to you so that there is no 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:37.000
 gaps 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:41.920
 on the one hand on the other hand like this 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.020
 and lay it out like this 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.240
 we lay out on the hot pan on 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.170
 hot on hot oil so she 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.660
 fizzled 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:52.960
 you can do double straight what is it 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.940
 then look like this 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.150
 spread on a pan and you can still 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.850
 lower the egg and then again in the flour 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.190
 and then you get a double batter so 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.340
 can also be done but I will do in 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.000
 one layer and so dip or daughters and 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.330
 will be 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.150
 and spread like this way we fry 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:16.570
 Here is such a fry it should be 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:20.710
 on top is such a beautiful am different 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:22.990
 Colors here are the tiles or chops from 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.820
 we turned out look here is pork 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.310
 these two and these three 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.200
 it's from chicken breast it even on 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.940
 Photos can be seen to see this one 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.310
 he is a little bit fatter even by them 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.800
 that he is in such a little bit in a papyrka 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.620
 These are the chicken on the sides. They are more 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.370
 smooth because it's chicken eyes 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:45.030
 they turn out very tender and tasty and 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:48.370
 You can serve them to any side dish. 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.500
 try it tasty simply and quickly and 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.810
 you need something always love everything and everyone 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.940
 like remember that if you fry 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.880
 pork I regretted it a little longer than 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.650
 chicken because chicken is literally 2 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.420
 minutes on each side and it is ready 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.910
 pork chops a little bit longer 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.410
 roasted it roasted I 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.940
 we think you will like it again
