connector<00:00:19.300> which<00:00:19.449> was<00:00:19.630> previously<00:00:19.900> leaked<00:00:20.590> we

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
connector which was previously leaked we

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.589 
connector which was previously leaked we
saw<00:00:21.039> it<00:00:21.099> on<00:00:21.250> the<00:00:21.279> actual<00:00:21.580> iphone<00:00:22.090> hardware

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:22.599 
saw it on the actual iphone hardware

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:24.929 
saw it on the actual iphone hardware
which<00:00:23.410> we<00:00:23.830> saw<00:00:24.009> the<00:00:24.070> dock<00:00:24.460> and<00:00:24.490> now<00:00:24.759> we're

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
which we saw the dock and now we're

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.060 
which we saw the dock and now we're
finally<00:00:25.269> getting<00:00:26.019> a<00:00:26.080> glimpse<00:00:26.289> of<00:00:26.529> the<00:00:26.800> cable

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
finally getting a glimpse of the cable

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.070 
finally getting a glimpse of the cable
and<00:00:27.429> how<00:00:27.880> that<00:00:28.119> actually<00:00:28.300> looks<00:00:28.689> like<00:00:28.839> so<00:00:29.019> you

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
and how that actually looks like so you

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.140 
and how that actually looks like so you
can<00:00:29.259> see<00:00:29.439> on<00:00:29.619> one<00:00:30.160> end<00:00:30.339> obviously<00:00:30.580> there's<00:00:31.089> the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
can see on one end obviously there's the

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.840 
can see on one end obviously there's the
USB<00:00:31.599> I'm<00:00:31.750> on<00:00:32.080> the<00:00:32.560> other<00:00:32.740> end<00:00:32.950> there's<00:00:33.190> a<00:00:33.280> 9<00:00:33.520> pin

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
USB I'm on the other end there's a 9 pin

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.630 
USB I'm on the other end there's a 9 pin
connector<00:00:34.330> with<00:00:34.900> sort<00:00:35.500> of<00:00:35.559> a<00:00:35.680> metal<00:00:36.100> conductor

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
connector with sort of a metal conductor

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.920 
connector with sort of a metal conductor
going<00:00:36.940> around<00:00:37.180> it<00:00:37.360> I<00:00:37.420> believe<00:00:37.660> it's<00:00:37.840> a

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
going around it I believe it's a

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.380 
going around it I believe it's a
two-sided<00:00:38.620> 9<00:00:38.800> pin<00:00:39.100> connector<00:00:39.879> so<00:00:40.059> double

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
two-sided 9 pin connector so double

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.330 
two-sided 9 pin connector so double
sided<00:00:40.600> not<00:00:41.199> too<00:00:41.350> sure<00:00:41.559> about<00:00:41.590> that<00:00:41.860> but<00:00:42.039> that's

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
sided not too sure about that but that's

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.430 
sided not too sure about that but that's
how<00:00:42.520> I<00:00:42.550> believe<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:43.090> leak<00:00:43.300> was<00:00:43.350> for<00:00:44.350> the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
how I believe the leak was for the

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.590 
how I believe the leak was for the
iphone<00:00:44.800> hardware<00:00:45.039> so<00:00:45.730> definitely<00:00:45.879> this<00:00:46.149> cable

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
iphone hardware so definitely this cable

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.090 
iphone hardware so definitely this cable
must<00:00:46.750> support<00:00:47.140> it<00:00:47.289> if<00:00:47.440> this<00:00:47.680> is<00:00:47.859> true<00:00:48.070> of

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
must support it if this is true of

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.529 
must support it if this is true of
course<00:00:48.399> today's<00:00:48.820> august<00:00:49.149> twenty-third

for the fact that you're gonna have to

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.570 
for the fact that you're gonna have to
purchase<00:01:12.790> new<00:01:13.000> accessories<00:01:13.840> because<00:01:14.680> pretty

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
purchase new accessories because pretty

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.210 
purchase new accessories because pretty
much<00:01:15.670> your<00:01:15.970> old<00:01:16.150> accessories<00:01:16.630> are<00:01:16.750> now

much your old accessories are now

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.469 
much your old accessories are now
incompatible<00:01:18.220> unless<00:01:18.460> you<00:01:18.610> get<00:01:19.000> some<00:01:19.210> sort<00:01:19.420> of

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
incompatible unless you get some sort of

incompatible unless you get some sort of
adapter<00:01:19.990> which<00:01:20.470> I<00:01:20.619> suspect<00:01:20.890> Apple's<00:01:21.490> probably

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
adapter which I suspect Apple's probably

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.580 
adapter which I suspect Apple's probably
also<00:01:22.000> going<00:01:22.210> to<00:01:22.270> release<00:01:22.600> but<00:01:23.200> anyways<00:01:23.439> that's
