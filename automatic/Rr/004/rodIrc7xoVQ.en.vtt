00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.500
 I am a mother of two children, I have two children and 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 unfortunately the two were born prematurely, 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.500
 one in the 26th week of the pregnancy and the other in the 29th. 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 As for the eldest, it was evident that we would meet with some affliction, 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 He suffered from meningitis and consequently more complications could be expected. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.500
 The minor, from his birth, was very sharp, 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.500
 at least until the first year of life 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.500
 it seemed that everything was going to be fine, however 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.500
 then he was diagnosed with infantile cerebral palsy, 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.000
 what affects the legs, making him limp. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.500
 My children go to Kociánka (special school). 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 The oldest began at three years 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.500
 and I'm very glad to have found it, because 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.500
 for a long time, we did not know that our son was disabled 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 and that the problem was not bad education, but that our son is really mentally retarded 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.000
 and needs the attention of specialists, 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.500
 which we found there. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 In the Kociánka special kindergarten the magnetic therapy devices of the RENAISSANCE series applied to it, 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.000
 it's where I've seen it for the first time; 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.500
 My son Ondra reacted very well, 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.500
 while the rest of treatments, such as rehabilitations, worse. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 He is hyperactive, he suffers from ADHD, 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.000
 and with these devices it reacts very well; 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.500
 from the beginning it lasted up to 10 quiet minutes, 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 what in our case is an achievement. 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.500
 So we rented it for 3 months 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 and we discovered that the device really helps, 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.500
 the child is calmer, concentrates better 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 and as it was growing, at the beginning we applied the device to the whole body 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:56.500
 and then we focus on the head to decrease hyperactivity. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 We also use it for more treatments, 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.000
 Ondra is hydrocephalic and the main symptoms are 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.500
 a high attention and inquisitive deficit 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.500
 and predisposition to nocturnal enuresis - urinary incontinence. 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.000
 We have achieved it at 6 years old so 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.500
 since then he is able to go to the bathroom only at night 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 and we are not worried about this problem anymore. 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:46.500
 This curiously coincides with the season when we used the RENAISSANCE device. 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.500
 After about 2 months of application stopped urinating. 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.500
 My other son Robert was born in week 29 of pregnancy, 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 weighed only a pound and a half, 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.500
 he also suffers from childhood cerebral palsy and 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:17.000
 It has affected the lower extremities, the right is worse. 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.500
 They are injecting botulinum toxin, but 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.500
 before this treatment we have already started with the application of magnetic therapy 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 and I must say that we have noticed an improvement that 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.500
 is related to its development. 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 Before I dragged my right leg, then it began to copy the walk 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:56.000
 and now practically, in the morning or at night, when he is tired 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.500
 it shows that the child is limping, but 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.500
 throughout the day it is not evident that he suffers from any physical disability. 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:15.500
 So I am very grateful and I also attribute it to the use of RENAISSANCE magnetic therapy.
