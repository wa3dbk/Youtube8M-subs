00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.219
 my name is alexey is my car 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.010
 VAZ 2111 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:14.679
 after replacing the head gasket 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.169
 cylinders over the winter I ran into 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.750
 problem that increased pressure in 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:22.359
 cooling system 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.939
 led me to look at me 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:28.090
 it got tired and I came to the conclusion that it was necessary 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.849
 change the radiator since the car is 7 years old 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:36.510
 daring art never changed it stands 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:36.510
 for sunrise I decided to buy the same 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.670
 firms art-p Dimitrovgrad plant 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.789
 standard part not on standard 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.100
 because this item served by faith and 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:54.629
 true so much time I think it is 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.039
 too, so for you except recommend 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.570
 so we drove to the force with which I 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.579
 I work and now I will tell you how 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.180
 correctly change the sargent on this 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.649
 by car 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.199
 First of all, unscrew the terminal with 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:11.200
 battery further unscrew the air 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:13.030
 filter set in front of the line and if y 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.830
 you car is hot it just needs 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.960
 disable without gloves so as not to burn yourself 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.610
 and bye 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.050
 the ambassador will drain we turn off 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:26.590
 the rest of the bails 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.049
 but the antifreeze is still not flowing 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.899
 because the system is sealed now we 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.970
 unscrew the cap on the expansion 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.429
 cistern 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.500
 Stalin, no, but the boiler rolled 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:41.020
 merges unscrew the nozzles 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.509
 chilling arrest and as 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:50.489
 we will unscrew them the ambassador will 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:52.869
 hiding more and more further 

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:55.780
 ratchet from the head for 10 unscrew 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.660
 radiator and fan mounting nuts 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.280
 front frame of the car forget about 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.319
 Gadget which is with us 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.500
 do not forget about son chip food 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.500
 fan 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.530
 Now we divert bribes from the frame and 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.720
 unscrew the band clamp to thin 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.360
 hose that goes to the expansion 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:21.730
 tank this one to whom the tag will change to 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:24.280
 normal so that we do not break anything 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.959
 probably twist the fan for this need 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:31.690
 take off the top pair to make it easier 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:33.790
 the fan is washed off from the radiator we all 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.260
 unscrewed the radiator from all mounts but 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.820
 faced problems that lower 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.640
 the mount is very tight 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.670
 so take the pliers and bottom 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.130
 fastenings turn out and yourself but when 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.959
 This need a little fan to file 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.959
 I will be there nothing prevented 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.070
 mount and fan is folded down now 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:01.890
 very easy to get well here it is 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.890
 time to pull out our faulty radians 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.700
 useful to his arsenal 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.209
 to have such a magnet to 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.850
 get your hands dirty and get out of such 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.430
 difficult places like antifreeze and other things gaga 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.459
 the parts we need are random 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.090
 there got such a garage 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.890
 fishing need to dismantle all the nozzles 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.260
 spare parts that we need 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.050
 don't forget to take off the rubber at the point they 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.580
 we still need 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:34.170
 in the course of their work very often in the park 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.210
 so that the details are fake chinese 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.070
 now thank god your parents 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.800
 that's what they thought remained to supply 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.960
 their products with labels to 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.670
 it is believed that genuine products are necessary 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.710
 just erase the code and go to 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.080
 us 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:54.610
 here it is the code that we found necessary 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.510
 send his sms to 2420 to 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.750
 see that radiator 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.560
 genuine here we sent sms and 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.270
 got an answer 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.520
 what did you buy genuine goods 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.090
 production group thank someone 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.590
 for your choice 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.840
 all now i'm sure that the radiator 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.040
 authentic you can put cool 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.540
 a box of cardboard 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:21.010
 tough enough you can not be afraid 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:23.140
 hurt everything before guys 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.830
 insert the name you need to prepare set 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:30.510
 rubber bushings and lower mounting 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.510
 fasten the bottom of the solo nipple 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:39.020
 all now we mount our radiator but 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.570
 neatly so that where it does not fall by these 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:45.170
 branch pipes 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.760
 preferably installation places so 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.950
 the radiator is in our place now in 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.780
 reverse past collecting now 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.820
 we put the cooling fan 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.160
 lower mount which we have in tight 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:05:01.150
 entered with a little effort 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:05.540
 there it is all in place here in place 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:08.630
 I stretch all the bolts without fanaticism to 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.670
 do not break the thread while there is access not 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:16.460
 forget to connect the fan so that later 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:20.980
 can not all put big now 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.980
 cooling pipe 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:28.040
 connect under the arms to the thermostat 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:30.980
 and we drag them too 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:35.080
 neatly so that then you to me for 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.080
 meat and did not go to the place 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:45.170
 all now we mount the air filter 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:48.800
 place a little trick when pouring over 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:50.960
 40 need to unscrew the throttle pipe 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.430
 dampers so that air does not form 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.770
 cork cooling system 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.230
 Well now the fun part is 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.340
 the final part of the work topping up 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.340
 coolant 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.530
 it is important that you add fluid to the people and 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.470
 the minute that you have already curled mix 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.340
 Some of them can not be when pouring 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.630
 coolant must be turned 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.610
 attention that you need to fill all 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.860
 maximum label because now 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.560
 when we swing a little if we 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.050
 the system is complete here from here ass leak 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.880
 air in the cooling system be not 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.580
 must be hot though the cover is also necessary 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:27.610
 tighten tightly to the system 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:30.530
 cooling pressure was put Kremlin 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:33.110
 so we replaced the radiator safely 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.480
 see nothing complicated about it now 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.630
 need to start the car and get that no 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.630
 leaks 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.830
 the whole machine has warmed up the thermostat on 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:47.690
 came across our bottom pipe 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:49.940
 hot radiator too hot neat 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.250
 no antifreeze 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.229
 again went a little bit later on 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.360
 cold you have to drink a little bit 

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:58.550
 maximum now need to drive on the street and 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.449
 visually make sure we have no sketches 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:04.480
 see, we all have traces 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:05.440
 there is no coolant 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.540
 pruners 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:11.860
 the cooling system is working properly 

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.860
 why did we get scared 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.710
 you yourself know something home repair 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:19.110
 auto industry occupation creative but if 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:21.449
 do everything thoughtfully and slowly 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:25.070
 everything will turn out just fine 

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:25.070
 I wish you success will take
