so<00:00:04.730> vouches<00:00:05.240> is<00:00:05.420> kind<00:00:05.810> of<00:00:05.870> an<00:00:05.960> old<00:00:06.170> idea<00:00:06.259> I

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:06.500 
so vouches is kind of an old idea I

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.750 
so vouches is kind of an old idea I
think<00:00:06.680> it's<00:00:06.920> an<00:00:07.009> idea<00:00:07.279> that<00:00:07.460> Milton<00:00:07.729> Friedman

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:07.760 
think it's an idea that Milton Friedman

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.940 
think it's an idea that Milton Friedman
introduced<00:00:08.570> and<00:00:08.809> really<00:00:09.080> advocated<00:00:09.650> for<00:00:09.679> and

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
introduced and really advocated for and

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.119 
introduced and really advocated for and
was<00:00:10.130> a<00:00:10.160> real<00:00:11.320> you<00:00:12.320> know<00:00:12.410> really<00:00:12.679> fought<00:00:12.919> for<00:00:12.950> I

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:13.129 
was a real you know really fought for I

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:14.140 
was a real you know really fought for I
think<00:00:13.190> there's<00:00:13.459> a<00:00:13.519> whole<00:00:13.639> fee<00:00:13.849> has<00:00:13.940> a<00:00:13.999> whole

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
think there's a whole fee has a whole

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.909 
think there's a whole fee has a whole
foundation<00:00:14.719> set<00:00:14.959> up<00:00:15.110> you<00:00:15.650> know<00:00:15.769> it's

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:15.919 
foundation set up you know it's

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:17.320 
foundation set up you know it's
encouraged<00:00:16.369> to<00:00:16.520> use<00:00:16.640> of<00:00:16.820> vouchers

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
encouraged to use of vouchers

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.580 
encouraged to use of vouchers
I<00:00:17.710> don't<00:00:18.710> think<00:00:18.980> vouchers<00:00:19.970> are<00:00:20.929> the<00:00:21.140> solution

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
I don't think vouchers are the solution

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.470 
I don't think vouchers are the solution
and<00:00:21.740> I<00:00:21.769> think<00:00:21.949> the<00:00:22.039> problem<00:00:22.429> is<00:00:22.609> that<00:00:22.789> what

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
and I think the problem is that what

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.450 
and I think the problem is that what
vouchers<00:00:24.140> do<00:00:24.380> to<00:00:24.859> the<00:00:25.009> extent<00:00:25.340> that's

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
vouchers do to the extent that's

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.759 
vouchers do to the extent that's
successful<00:00:25.970> it<00:00:26.480> saved<00:00:27.230> the<00:00:27.470> public

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
successful it saved the public

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.159 
successful it saved the public
educational<00:00:28.279> system<00:00:28.480> they<00:00:29.480> actually<00:00:29.839> saved

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
educational system they actually saved

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.409 
educational system they actually saved
the<00:00:30.380> existing<00:00:30.830> system<00:00:31.189> they<00:00:31.310> actually<00:00:31.419> create

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
the existing system they actually create

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.150 
the existing system they actually create
this<00:00:32.630> false<00:00:32.990> sense<00:00:33.230> of<00:00:33.410> competition<00:00:33.860> and

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
this false sense of competition and

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.639 
this false sense of competition and
innovation<00:00:34.310> within<00:00:35.060> the<00:00:35.690> school<00:00:36.050> districts

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
innovation within the school districts

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.040 
innovation within the school districts
and<00:00:36.850> but<00:00:37.850> but<00:00:38.300> the<00:00:38.450> government<00:00:38.719> is<00:00:38.780> still

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
and but but the government is still

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.299 
and but but the government is still
involved<00:00:39.469> in<00:00:39.559> education<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.070> government

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
involved in education the government

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.740 
involved in education the government
still<00:00:40.520> runs<00:00:40.850> these<00:00:41.090> schools<00:00:41.539> essentially<00:00:42.469> and

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
still runs these schools essentially and

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.479 
still runs these schools essentially and
the<00:00:44.750> government<00:00:45.050> can<00:00:45.140> take<00:00:46.039> you<00:00:46.370> know

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
the government can take you know

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.189 
the government can take you know
converse<00:00:47.000> they<00:00:47.390> can<00:00:47.600> change<00:00:47.870> they<00:00:48.079> ultimately

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
converse they can change they ultimately

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:51.130 
converse they can change they ultimately
have<00:00:48.649> control<00:00:49.039> so<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:49.399> vouchers<00:00:50.140> the

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
have control so the vouchers the

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.849 
have control so the vouchers the
vouchers<00:00:51.620> I<00:00:51.770> think<00:00:52.100> a<00:00:52.660> tight<00:00:53.660> an<00:00:54.050> attempt<00:00:54.620> to

00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:54.859 
vouchers I think a tight an attempt to

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:58.180 
vouchers I think a tight an attempt to
take<00:00:55.039> a<00:00:55.070> step<00:00:55.550> in<00:00:55.820> the<00:00:56.480> right<00:00:56.719> direction<00:00:57.160> but<00:00:58.160> I

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
take a step in the right direction but I

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.299 
take a step in the right direction but I
think<00:00:58.489> what<00:00:58.640> they<00:00:58.730> actually<00:00:58.940> do<00:00:59.629> is<00:01:00.100> move<00:01:01.100> us

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
think what they actually do is move us

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:02.950 
think what they actually do is move us
away<00:01:01.489> from<00:01:01.969> the<00:01:02.059> direction<00:01:02.179> one<00:01:02.510> of<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:02.690> main

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
away from the direction one of the main

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.049 
away from the direction one of the main
ways<00:01:03.170> they<00:01:03.469> do<00:01:03.530> this<00:01:03.829> is<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.550> government<00:01:04.940> now

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
ways they do this is the government now

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.730 
ways they do this is the government now
has<00:01:05.090> to<00:01:05.510> approve<00:01:05.720> who<00:01:05.930> gets<00:01:06.110> vouchers<00:01:06.500> and<00:01:06.650> who

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
has to approve who gets vouchers and who

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.920 
has to approve who gets vouchers and who
don't<00:01:06.950> who<00:01:07.190> doesn't<00:01:07.549> so<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.330> school<00:01:08.630> still

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
don't who doesn't so the school still

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.749 
don't who doesn't so the school still
have<00:01:09.080> to<00:01:09.259> fit<00:01:09.530> into<00:01:09.710> some<00:01:10.040> box<00:01:10.400> that<00:01:10.670> the

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
have to fit into some box that the

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.710 
have to fit into some box that the
government<00:01:11.119> gets<00:01:11.210> to<00:01:11.509> define<00:01:12.080> and<00:01:13.570> what<00:01:14.570> that

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
government gets to define and what that

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.539 
government gets to define and what that
means<00:01:15.049> is<00:01:15.439> that<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:15.860> government<00:01:15.890> now<00:01:16.310> gets

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
means is that the government now gets

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.609 
means is that the government now gets
through<00:01:16.729> regulate<00:01:17.119> private<00:01:17.390> schools<00:01:17.840> because

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
through regulate private schools because

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:19.960 
through regulate private schools because
the<00:01:18.920> government<00:01:19.189> gets<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:19.460> site<00:01:19.729> which

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
the government gets the site which

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.370 
the government gets the site which
private<00:01:20.360> schools<00:01:20.570> get<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:20.900> vouchers<00:01:21.229> and

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
private schools get the vouchers and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.569 
private schools get the vouchers and
which<00:01:21.500> private<00:01:21.710> schools<00:01:22.040> don't<00:01:22.220> get<00:01:22.460> the

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 
which private schools don't get the

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:24.730 
which private schools don't get the
vouchers<00:01:22.909> think<00:01:23.450> about<00:01:23.630> universities<00:01:24.259> we

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
vouchers think about universities we

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.080 
vouchers think about universities we
used<00:01:24.920> to<00:01:25.040> have<00:01:25.130> private<00:01:25.490> universities<00:01:25.970> in

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
used to have private universities in

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.850 
used to have private universities in
this<00:01:26.180> country<00:01:26.240> but<00:01:27.079> since<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:27.500> government

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
this country but since the government

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.910 
this country but since the government
got<00:01:28.009> involved<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:28.909> they<00:01:29.030> could<00:01:29.210> make<00:01:29.920> any

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
got involved and they could make any

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.920 
got involved and they could make any
kind<00:01:31.130> of<00:01:31.220> decisions<00:01:31.790> about<00:01:31.909> who<00:01:32.180> to<00:01:32.210> admit<00:01:32.630> who

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
kind of decisions about who to admit who

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.690 
kind of decisions about who to admit who
not<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.320> admit<00:01:33.530> and<00:01:33.649> what<00:01:33.770> criteria<00:01:33.950> would<00:01:34.490> be

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
not to admit and what criteria would be

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.399 
not to admit and what criteria would be
in<00:01:34.850> who<00:01:35.360> to<00:01:35.390> give<00:01:35.570> scholarships<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:36.229> and<00:01:36.350> who

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
in who to give scholarships to and who

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.280 
in who to give scholarships to and who
not<00:01:36.560> to<00:01:36.619> give<00:01:36.799> scholarships<00:01:37.009> to<00:01:37.340> and<00:01:37.610> so<00:01:37.759> on

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
not to give scholarships to and so on

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.010 
not to give scholarships to and so on
now<00:01:39.290> the<00:01:39.350> government<00:01:39.920> is<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.130> biggest<00:01:40.220> funder

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
now the government is the biggest funder

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.620 
now the government is the biggest funder
financier<00:01:42.110> of<00:01:42.290> student<00:01:42.860> loans<00:01:43.149> so<00:01:44.149> if<00:01:44.420> you're

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
financier of student loans so if you're

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.499 
financier of student loans so if you're
a<00:01:44.659> university<00:01:45.259> and<00:01:45.350> you<00:01:45.409> want<00:01:45.710> to<00:01:45.829> get

a university and you want to get
students<00:01:47.509> who<00:01:47.570> are<00:01:47.780> receiving<00:01:48.110> student<00:01:48.710> loans

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
students who are receiving student loans

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.399 
students who are receiving student loans
you<00:01:49.219> now<00:01:50.060> have<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.420> play<00:01:50.600> by<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.840> government's
