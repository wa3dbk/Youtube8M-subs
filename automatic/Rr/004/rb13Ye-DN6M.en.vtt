00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.549
 hello today I bring you a recipe that we have 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.049
 Ireland made much of a cake 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:13.429
 preparing the time of the first the 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:18.290
 lining 3 scream 3 gray silver eggs 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:19.580
 Irish irish sugar and has 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:24.200
 big 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:27.130
 in Irish dark chocolate and milk 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.130
 whole irish 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.790
 and four eggs 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.260
 first we will beat the eggs with energy 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.440
 we're fine and then we add the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.210
 cream or cream cream 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.510
 Irish is of excellent quality 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.699
 as if going to go to earth 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.039
 then we add the two glasses of 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.170
 sugar to me has given me the type of 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.299
 case that is we know more or less than a 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.670
 glass of that makes the same pot of 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:05.729
 cream that we had and I've loved 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.640
 add a few droplets of essence 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.670
 vanilla 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.050
 then after the flour to which already 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.050
 we have put the yeast 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:24.520
 and we add in this case three glasses of 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.960
 flour and let's beat 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.960
 while we put it 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.460
 then we mix well 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.080
 we will heat in the microwave a little 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.810
 of milk like this one that 's fine 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.320
 hot and on it as we put 100 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.390
 grams of dark chocolate we see that it 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.000
 dissolves with the heat that has 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.580
 remained in the container and the milk and 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.710
 when it's already a little thick and 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.070
 already liquid, we are going to add a 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.220
 piece of the dough that has remained to us 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.500
 stir when mixing everything then this 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.310
 part will mix it with chocolate and we 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.170
 will serve to add that you like so much 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.720
 at home that is chocolate to a 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.759
 cake but really only part 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.200
 white is great too but it's 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.130
 true that the chocolate gives a 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.840
 We are going to decorate it very rich 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.459
 making that mixture and we put it into 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.840
 oven about an hour east 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.090
 oven was not mine and then I did not 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.450
 knew well but it takes more or less a 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.640
 hour, look there when I play 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.560
 softly you see because it is not yet 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.610
 finish has to come out the clean needle 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.610
 and this is the result
