00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.919
 Speak there class wagner birth here 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.639
 Once again we are here to talk about the 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:15.210
 Very serious subject is alright 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:19.320
 starting from scratch, it is obvious that each 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:23.960
 a subject of guitar already the galera me 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:27.390
 asking here is that I do because I 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.609
 I'm beginner, I'm starting from scratch. 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.800
 I thought it would be a cool video to 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:37.380
 people comment 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:41.809
 It is this crowd I'm by myself I 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.809
 I'll try to explain this way. 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.690
 taking my course is like me 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.480
 I made it to get where I arrived. 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.940
 Actually, I got nowhere. 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.750
 but I'm trying until today and it was the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.510
 I think that for you to play a 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.239
 legal instrument to start from scratch so 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.650
 start from scratch with your tour I think 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.409
 that you have to inspire someone 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:15.689
 has a nice reference and feel here 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:18.119
 you live here your favorite artist 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.439
 in my case my first contact with 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:26.729
 The music I had was with the guitar on the 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:33.390
 middle of my father is and here at home 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:36.210
 there was a lot of country music that I 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.329
 I listen today but it was from there 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:44.490
 that I started in you live an environment 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:51.360
 you automatically have to listen 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:53.159
 and listen and silvino this in this stage of 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.230
 sertaneja music that time was not 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.990
 right 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.510
 The sesi that we speak is right even if in 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.140
 truth is not crap cetane 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:06.140
 I enchanté our galera there was a 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.500
 organism worked well 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.040
 worked and it's coming back I have 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.590
 Contact because it was with guitar and I 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:21.400
 I started there I already liked music 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:24.920
 since childhood I sang sang is not 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.470
 I used to drums with cans and stuff 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.870
 When I got the guitar, it already has a certain 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.720
 beaten notion 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.930
 It looks amazing but it's I did not know which one 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.730
 is the logic more notion of hitting at risk 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:44.990
 since it was impressive but I already 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:47.750
 then I have over the years I saw in 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.060
 television was playing with pop rock the 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.560
 her style and I identified with the 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.710
 who did not like the first time the 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:58.220
 listening already felt what is a 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:01.640
 business was not even going to go through 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.180
 a few years I started listening to the style 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.280
 of my first rock album was a 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.890
 urban privilege what country 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.360
 so I was impressed that is 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.790
 I liked it, I would like to see it from here. 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.850
 open a legal playing card stood 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.650
 seeing the photos of the galley there right? 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.580
 has even one in comic strip history 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.070
 colleague there he and I really liked the 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:32.150
 given it was only I am still today that 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:34.130
 soldiers today and I thought the 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.610
 character is just always trying 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.730
 I played it up 15 but I liked it 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.330
 understood 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.549
 that is inspired by truth and the bottom 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:50.080
 an artist you have to mirror him 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:53.310
 and I feel like playing right and 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.310
 personal thing 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.269
 Well, I'm coming back here, something else that I 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.549
 I see it's a lot in the crowd and 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.170
 mainly mainly in 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.620
 beginners that is the case that we are 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.329
 commenting is wanting to be some right name 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.640
 it's totally wrong 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:12.099
 a lot of people play bad because of 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.879
 him because he wants to start at the 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.860
 advanced 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.500
 this is totally logical it's the same thing 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.440
 What are you doing at school and studying? 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.139
 math and want to see where vision 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.810
 if I learn a lesson the subtraction I 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.220
 It's the same thing so the guys do not have 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.550
 patience 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.590
 This is what I give even because of how 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.020
 this even listening to something very 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.389
 star is not that he finds himself 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.550
 I already started listening to yngwie 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.330
 malmsteen I already started listening was a 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.000
 sock 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.340
 These things I dealt with bad cars and 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.500
 I started to listen I think 15 years 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.990
 behind and has a 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.900
 Do the math, I started to play and 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.190
 nine and ten years I am today euphoric and 25 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.010
 years in June 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.349
 it's such bad service that it's been 15 years 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.940
 back kaka is like I told you I 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:04.270
 I started listening to music, certainly. 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:07.180
 want I was here at home and all I 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.810
 information is welcome in this world of 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:13.740
 music if you really want 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:18.099
 develop into a certain instrument and 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:21.010
 come back to what I see of difficulty she 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:24.220
 is this is wanting to start soon in the reestréia 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:27.610
 at the right level so do not do it now 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:33.760
 starts everything starts at a low level 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:35.889
 Okay, I did the following, I started. 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.420
 I learned from those resistance and if it is 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:40.540
 Little time, I do not have it all. 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:43.180
 the internet was not right but I want to say 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:46.030
 the information was very difficult right me 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:49.780
 I'm not that old, but it's health 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.940
 ten years ago it 's not like that, so I 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.890
 I learned from those little comic books 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.530
 It was in my mouth straight to see if I had 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:59.950
 arrived at the novelty I always bought myself 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.990

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:05.140
 legion that is all the songs in the 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:08.200
 sequence all encrypted and I was 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:09.550
 I learned the court through that magazine and with 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.250
 the friend help I have here 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.880

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:18.550
 was around hammer in that 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:21.430

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.560
 with a cipher right and I was all 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.380
 day hammering over here right 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.420
 playing the songs one by one and I 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:33.190
 I memorized every line that renato 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:35.680
 spoke said that not only does not it 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:38.710
