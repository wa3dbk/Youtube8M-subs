CRV<00:02:18.830> and<00:02:19.070> then<00:02:19.730> what<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.180> also<00:02:20.390> has<00:02:20.810> is<00:02:21.080> this

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
CRV and then what it also has is this

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.010 
CRV and then what it also has is this
magic<00:02:21.890> seat<00:02:22.220> so<00:02:22.730> you<00:02:22.760> can<00:02:23.030> actually<00:02:23.240> make<00:02:23.990> it

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
magic seat so you can actually make it

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.590 
magic seat so you can actually make it
into<00:02:24.410> several<00:02:24.800> configurations<00:02:25.640> depending<00:02:26.480> on

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
into several configurations depending on

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.530 
into several configurations depending on
the<00:02:27.050> cargo<00:02:27.380> that<00:02:27.410> you're<00:02:27.680> carrying<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:29.360> can

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
the cargo that you're carrying you can

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.830 
the cargo that you're carrying you can
vindicates<00:02:29.990> well<00:02:30.230> it's<00:02:31.190> a<00:02:31.490> little<00:02:32.000> sporty<00:02:32.510> for

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
vindicates well it's a little sporty for

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.010 
vindicates well it's a little sporty for
a<00:02:32.870> little<00:02:33.440> guy<00:02:33.530> like<00:02:33.650> this<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:35.090> control

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
a little guy like this the control

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.810 
a little guy like this the control
layout<00:02:36.110> is<00:02:36.350> very<00:02:36.590> simple<00:02:37.040> it<00:02:37.130> so<00:02:37.310> it's<00:02:37.550> similar

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
layout is very simple it so it's similar

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.330 
layout is very simple it so it's similar
to<00:02:38.210> what<00:02:38.570> you<00:02:38.660> would<00:02:38.750> see<00:02:38.810> with<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.560> fit<00:02:39.770> and

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
to what you would see with the fit and

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.610 
to what you would see with the fit and
the<00:02:40.790> overall<00:02:41.060> interior<00:02:41.750> comfort<00:02:42.170> is<00:02:42.290> actually

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
the overall interior comfort is actually

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.110 
the overall interior comfort is actually
pretty<00:02:42.800> damn<00:02:43.100> good<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.580> seats<00:02:43.820> are<00:02:43.970> a<00:02:44.000> little

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
pretty damn good the seats are a little

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.570 
pretty damn good the seats are a little
bit<00:02:44.300> on<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.450> small<00:02:44.690> side<00:02:44.720> like<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.170> fit<00:02:45.350> but

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
bit on the small side like the fit but

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.220 
bit on the small side like the fit but
unlike<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.730> fit<00:02:46.970> I<00:02:47.210> get<00:02:47.570> better<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:47.810> just<00:02:47.900> spent

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
unlike the fit I get better I just spent

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.440 
unlike the fit I get better I just spent
with<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:48.410> steering<00:02:48.650> though<00:02:48.860> I<00:02:49.160> get<00:02:49.820> more

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
with the steering though I get more

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.260 
with the steering though I get more
adjustment<00:02:50.900> with<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.230> seat<00:02:51.410> itself<00:02:51.830> and<00:02:52.270> grab

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
adjustment with the seat itself and grab

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.790 
adjustment with the seat itself and grab
that<00:02:53.450> there's<00:02:53.570> not<00:02:53.690> gobs<00:02:53.960> of<00:02:54.200> headroom<00:02:54.380> if<00:02:54.680> I

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
that there's not gobs of headroom if I

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.380 
that there's not gobs of headroom if I
was<00:02:54.920> roaming<00:02:55.100> with<00:02:55.400> four<00:02:55.760> inches<00:02:55.970> of<00:02:56.120> hair<00:02:56.300> on

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
was roaming with four inches of hair on

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.000 
was roaming with four inches of hair on
the<00:02:56.480> top<00:02:56.540> of<00:02:56.750> my<00:02:56.840> head<00:02:57.050> I'd<00:02:57.380> probably<00:02:57.590> rub

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
the top of my head I'd probably rub

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.400 
the top of my head I'd probably rub
against<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.580> sunroof<00:02:58.940> area<00:02:59.240> here<00:02:59.510> but<00:02:59.720> for

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
against the sunroof area here but for

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.990 
against the sunroof area here but for
the<00:03:00.470> most<00:03:00.620> part<00:03:00.770> it's<00:03:01.459> actually<00:03:01.820> very

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
the most part it's actually very

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.050 
the most part it's actually very
comfortable

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.430 

little<00:03:10.060> tiny<00:03:10.300> bit<00:03:10.510> of<00:03:10.540> a<00:03:10.690> blind<00:03:10.960> spot<00:03:11.080> when<00:03:11.260> you

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
little tiny bit of a blind spot when you

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.900 
little tiny bit of a blind spot when you
peer<00:03:11.650> over<00:03:11.680> your<00:03:12.100> shoulder<00:03:12.460> because<00:03:12.550> of<00:03:12.820> the

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
peer over your shoulder because of the

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.850 
peer over your shoulder because of the
way<00:03:13.060> it<00:03:13.300> fills<00:03:13.720> up<00:03:13.870> in<00:03:14.020> the<00:03:14.080> pinches<00:03:14.440> just<00:03:14.770> like

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
way it fills up in the pinches just like

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.640 
way it fills up in the pinches just like
the<00:03:14.950> CRB<00:03:15.430> but<00:03:16.330> you<00:03:16.630> know<00:03:16.750> what<00:03:16.930> I<00:03:17.140> got<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.530> tell

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
the CRB but you know what I got to tell

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.220 
the CRB but you know what I got to tell
you<00:03:17.770> this<00:03:18.220> thing<00:03:18.280> I<00:03:18.550> take<00:03:18.760> over<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.060> CRV<00:03:19.540> in<00:03:20.140> a

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
you this thing I take over the CRV in a

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.150 
you this thing I take over the CRV in a
heartbeat<00:03:20.530> so<00:03:21.310> you<00:03:21.370> can<00:03:21.610> put<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:21.970> seats<00:03:22.210> down

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
heartbeat so you can put the seats down

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.560 
heartbeat so you can put the seats down
and<00:03:24.160> you<00:03:24.280> can<00:03:24.430> also<00:03:24.580> put<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:24.970> seats<00:03:25.210> up<00:03:26.220> and

the<00:03:28.570> other<00:03:28.690> side<00:03:28.960> does<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:29.380> exact<00:03:30.010> same<00:03:30.040> thing

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
the other side does the exact same thing

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.910 
the other side does the exact same thing
so<00:03:30.790> you<00:03:30.850> can<00:03:31.120> use<00:03:31.660> it<00:03:31.690> however<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:32.380> like<00:03:32.590> for

split

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.500 

then<00:03:59.050> you<00:03:59.290> use<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.590> turn<00:03:59.950> signal<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:00.760> you're

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
what's next to you and the reason why

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.170

they<00:04:14.080> only<00:04:14.320> do<00:04:14.560> it<00:04:14.590> when<00:04:15.010> with<00:04:15.640> the<00:04:15.790> right<00:04:16.000> Nair

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
they only do it when with the right Nair

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.940 
they only do it when with the right Nair
and<00:04:16.209> not<00:04:16.420> the<00:04:16.510> left<00:04:16.720> is<00:04:17.200> because<00:04:17.650> your<00:04:17.769> head<00:04:17.920> is

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
and not the left is because your head is

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.380 
and not the left is because your head is
already<00:04:18.280> turning<00:04:18.489> right<00:04:18.760> so<00:04:19.180> when<00:04:19.269> you're

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
already turning right so when you're

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.819 
already turning right so when you're
turning<00:04:19.690> right<00:04:19.840> and<00:04:20.290> you<00:04:20.350> hit<00:04:20.500> your<00:04:20.530> turn

turning right and you hit your turn

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.500 
turning right and you hit your turn
signal<00:04:21.250> you're<00:04:21.669> gonna<00:04:21.790> see<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.060> screen<00:04:22.330> and

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
signal you're gonna see the screen and

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.700 
signal you're gonna see the screen and
you're<00:04:22.660> gonna<00:04:22.750> see<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.050> mirror<00:04:23.290> over<00:04:23.470> there

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
kind of mellow things out now I don't

I'm<00:05:19.330> just<00:05:19.540> saying<00:05:19.750> that<00:05:19.870> it's<00:05:20.020> much<00:05:20.140> more

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
I'm just saying that it's much more

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.230 
I'm just saying that it's much more
mature<00:05:20.530> than<00:05:20.800> you<00:05:20.920> might<00:05:21.070> think<00:05:21.240> especially

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
mature than you might think especially

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.780 
mature than you might think especially
when<00:05:22.540> you<00:05:22.630> come<00:05:22.840> out<00:05:23.020> of<00:05:23.080> the<00:05:23.440> manual<00:05:24.400> and<00:05:24.730> they

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
when you come out of the manual and they

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:31.050 
when you come out of the manual and they
walk<00:05:25.030> into<00:05:25.620> the<00:05:26.620> CVT<00:05:28.170> so<00:05:29.170> it's<00:05:29.860> it's<00:05:30.760> a<00:05:30.880> good

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
walk into the CVT so it's it's a good

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.300 
walk into the CVT so it's it's a good
setup
