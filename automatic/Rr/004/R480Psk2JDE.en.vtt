00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.740
 but we are waiting for two or three 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.140
 cut the fabric 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.600
 as the humorist and the rest of the 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.210
 rest of my life 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.010
 the humorist never rests because 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.250
 there are times you are not working but 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.580
 what happens to you around you think 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.530
 to enhance some situation 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.700
 as you live cranes above all 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.740
 those who thank God we have 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.680
 laburo every day and we have to 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.410
 do things or generate ideas all 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.870
 days like for the guys in the program 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.430
 on the radio in one in the morning we're 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.260
 always generating situation then 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.690
 you have to read the newspaper to do the 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.490
 spoof the information when you see in 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.970
 the subway you are seeing what happens the sky 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.970
 never 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.130
 to follow or to stay paying attention 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.830
 to things and to generate a character 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.080
 new on the street we finally look at the 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.900
 mines what happens 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.760
 there are a lot of pages to symbols 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.500
 people tell you 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.500
 we have thought that they no longer ask 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:20.590
 it's going to be a free system 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.740
 I do not remember it coming back from the fan that 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.259
 happens does not work if what works happens 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.280
 who misses you as if he misses me if 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.280
 every time you garments and 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:54.660
 of the bank and the whole world against the 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.660
 wall and if they are wallpaper see 4 days 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.900
 of the house 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.320
 and until in a moment he got tired of 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.740
 look was not the towel as well as he could 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.210
 went to see who it was then grabbed by 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.389
 the door knob looked to see who 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:37.949
 was and for another time I looked at a listing 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.949

00:05:54.949 --> 00:06:01.220
 type in the hospital 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.740
 very worried aside for the other good 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.050
 the doctor says 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:08.400
