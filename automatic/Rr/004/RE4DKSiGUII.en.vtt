00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
hydrochloride absorbs a lot better I can

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.280

see<00:02:26.730> why<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:26.970> would<00:02:27.209> absorb<00:02:27.330> it<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.750> came<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.140> see

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
see why it would absorb it I came to see

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.259 
see why it would absorb it I came to see
it<00:02:28.350> in<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.530> water<00:02:28.709> and<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.580> barely<00:02:29.820> shook<00:02:30.120> him

thing so we just lost our money thought
it<00:04:18.239> was<00:04:18.330> dissolved<00:04:18.600> quicker<00:04:19.019> and<00:04:19.470> you<00:04:20.280> know

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
it was dissolved quicker and you know

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.099 
it was dissolved quicker and you know
what<00:04:20.580> the<00:04:20.669> price<00:04:20.910> tag<00:04:21.150> on<00:04:21.299> that<00:04:21.359> concrete<00:04:21.660> is

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
what the price tag on that concrete is

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.170 
what the price tag on that concrete is
like<00:04:22.350> three<00:04:22.620> times<00:04:22.650> well<00:04:23.550> I<00:04:23.580> would<00:04:23.790> say<00:04:23.910> four
