hi<00:00:10.510> I'm<00:00:10.570> Lewis<00:00:10.990> TARDIS<00:00:11.349> the<00:00:11.530> co-founder<00:00:12.219> and

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:12.340 
hi I'm Lewis TARDIS the co-founder and

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.150 
hi I'm Lewis TARDIS the co-founder and
co-ceo<00:00:12.700> beacon<00:00:13.360> and<00:00:13.599> I'm<00:00:14.349> here<00:00:14.620> to<00:00:14.799> tell<00:00:15.040> you

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
co-ceo beacon and I'm here to tell you

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.359 
co-ceo beacon and I'm here to tell you
about<00:00:15.250> the<00:00:15.490> beacon<00:00:15.849> craft<00:00:16.119> brewer<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:18.070> this<00:00:18.250> is

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:18.369 
about the beacon craft brewer so this is

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.220 
about the beacon craft brewer so this is
the<00:00:18.460> only<00:00:18.640> technology<00:00:19.119> in<00:00:19.480> the<00:00:19.599> world<00:00:19.779> that

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
the only technology in the world that

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.950 
the only technology in the world that
uses<00:00:20.470> negative<00:00:21.099> pressure<00:00:21.480> has<00:00:22.480> an<00:00:22.630> extraction

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
uses negative pressure has an extraction

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.200 
uses negative pressure has an extraction
variable<00:00:23.470> rather<00:00:24.460> than<00:00:24.579> focusing<00:00:24.910> the<00:00:25.000> time

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
variable rather than focusing the time

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.970 
variable rather than focusing the time
temperature<00:00:25.689> in<00:00:25.779> turbulent<00:00:26.230> so<00:00:26.349> we<00:00:26.439> focus<00:00:26.800> on

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
temperature in turbulent so we focus on

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.979 
temperature in turbulent so we focus on
is<00:00:27.250> creating<00:00:28.180> a<00:00:28.480> negative<00:00:28.869> pressure

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:28.989 
is creating a negative pressure

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:32.729 
is creating a negative pressure

that<00:00:42.880> the<00:00:43.090> end<00:00:43.270> I<00:00:43.540> was<00:00:44.500> working<00:00:44.800> right<00:00:44.890> now<00:00:45.100> is

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
that the end I was working right now is

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.819 
that the end I was working right now is
he's<00:00:47.860> been<00:00:48.010> dosed<00:00:48.220> and<00:00:49.140> correct<00:00:50.140> refugees

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
he's been dosed and correct refugees

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:52.800 
he's been dosed and correct refugees
being<00:00:51.040> put<00:00:51.250> on<00:00:51.460> the<00:00:51.610> user<00:00:52.000> interface<00:00:52.360> you<00:00:52.720> were

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:52.810 
being put on the user interface you were

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.930 
being put on the user interface you were
surprised<00:00:53.110> when<00:00:53.380> he<00:00:53.440> said<00:00:53.650> he's<00:00:54.489> filling<00:00:54.790> up

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
surprised when he said he's filling up

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.090 
surprised when he said he's filling up
the<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:55.720> chamber<00:00:56.079> under<00:00:56.380> a<00:00:56.470> water<00:00:56.739> and<00:00:56.950> it's

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
the the chamber under a water and it's

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.560 
the the chamber under a water and it's
now<00:00:57.220> the<00:00:57.280> first<00:00:57.670> vacuum<00:00:57.880> has<00:00:58.120> occurred<00:00:58.390> is

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
now the first vacuum has occurred is

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.690 
now the first vacuum has occurred is
degassing<00:00:59.050> vacuum<00:00:59.800> there's<00:01:00.100> a<00:01:00.190> lot<00:01:00.430> of<00:01:00.520> gas

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
degassing vacuum there's a lot of gas

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.450 
degassing vacuum there's a lot of gas
here<00:01:00.970> because<00:01:01.329> it'll<00:01:01.540> drive<00:01:01.810> material<00:01:02.460> it

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
here because it'll drive material it

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.760 
here because it'll drive material it
feels<00:01:04.299> like<00:01:04.540> that<00:01:04.689> I'm<00:01:04.780> very<00:01:05.019> dense<00:01:05.320> ginger

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
feels like that I'm very dense ginger

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.710 
feels like that I'm very dense ginger
that's<00:01:05.920> in<00:01:06.070> there<00:01:06.280> now<00:01:06.850> it's<00:01:07.000> steeping<00:01:07.360> but

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
that's in there now it's steeping but

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.320 
that's in there now it's steeping but
you<00:01:07.900> know

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
you know

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.390 
you know
it's<00:01:09.510> going<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.710> second<00:01:11.040> vacuum<00:01:11.310> is

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
it's going to the second vacuum is

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.340 
it's going to the second vacuum is
occurring<00:01:11.700> right<00:01:11.730> now<00:01:11.820> initial<00:01:12.510> degassing<00:01:12.810> is

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
occurring right now initial degassing is

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.910 
occurring right now initial degassing is
uh<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:15.380> occurring<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.800> as<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.310> releases<00:01:17.640> their

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
uh is occurring and as it releases their

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.580 
uh is occurring and as it releases their
appellee<00:01:19.920> infuses<00:01:20.520> into<00:01:20.930> into<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.140> teaser

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
appellee infuses into into the teaser

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.310 
appellee infuses into into the teaser
that's<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.190> therefore<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:24.420> process<00:01:24.720> is

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
that's in therefore this process is

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.640 
that's in therefore this process is
going<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.190> take<00:01:26.280> roughly<00:01:26.460> about<00:01:26.790> 90<00:01:27.240> seconds

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
going to take roughly about 90 seconds

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.900 
going to take roughly about 90 seconds
maybe<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.770> little<00:01:28.920> less<00:01:29.130> actually<00:01:29.640> little<00:01:29.820> bit

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
maybe a little less actually little bit

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.340 
maybe a little less actually little bit
a<00:01:29.940> little<00:01:30.060> more<00:01:30.330> what<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.690> see<00:01:30.840> now<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.050> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
a little more what you see now is the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.940 
a little more what you see now is the
wire<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.860> having<00:01:32.490> more<00:01:32.730> water<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.860> so<00:01:34.860> this

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
wire is having more water to it so this

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.310 
wire is having more water to it so this
T<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:36.120> get<00:01:36.300> this<00:01:36.450> Blair's<00:01:36.840> teeth<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.080> get<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
T to get this Blair's teeth to get the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.100 
T to get this Blair's teeth to get the
Apple<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.100> get<00:01:38.370> the<00:01:38.550> the<00:01:39.480> fruit<00:01:39.720> noise<00:01:39.900> for
