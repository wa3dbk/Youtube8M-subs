00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.620
 hello catalytic and be welcome to a 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:05.660
 new video to the brain and trick of the 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.370
 1.11 as a hostage with naturalization 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.559
 fire we need money to buy 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.299
 our new cars are worth I think that 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.309
 it's a pretty simple trick 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.690
 too easy for you and good what 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.119
 we'll have to do in the typical 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.830
 triangle and accelerate ok and I'm that 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.630
 cause the shot is too easy or 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.949
 that with deco without trick is easy I already 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.439
 I have caught the trick call the 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.699
 First, it's good and well, 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.980
 we would have to do is take us out 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.750
 car and we will place it 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.939
 to see we have to place the ones that you can 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.250
 go on the street valdÃ©s but there was in the 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.350
 red sidewalk then on the red line as the 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.000
 border and it's okay because if we put it 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.040
 beyond then when we knew with 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.690
 our bicycle disappears is worth it 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.790
 that we are going to place here I hope that 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.830
 you understand, I'm always saying 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.870
 many are worth, they are worth good, they have 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.839
 to have three bicycle bicycles 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.730
 all the bicycles that to do the 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:54.110
 trick then there are logical and six already 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.879
 Turkish times buy after two 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.470
 bikes ok because that trick the good 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.809
 is that he goes too much 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.780
 followed ballet we are not going to take the 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.309
 figures and good let's go out with it ok 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.550
 and good but good this is that no 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.899
 we need a car bought is served 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.960
 in any version in this one was 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:13.759
 doing with the one of the 1.8 this car of 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.890
 version 1.8 you give it works with 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.810
 any type of car that thanks you 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.869
 they will give less, sometimes it will be more 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.369
 it varies a lot yes and relatively if 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.630
 you do with a newly purchased car 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.770
 bought then win much greater than the 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.990
 contest and then explain a little bit 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.340
 meanwhile we got to look okay 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.560
 which looks after we sell 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.760
 our car will ask you, I hope 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.260
 so that the bicycle 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.230
 the cyclist what we do is save 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:43.610
 our money backwards as they are 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:46.640
 many are worth 3 thousand 800 dollars worth 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.130
 It's good and what we save that 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.420
 let's call the mechanic who is 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.780
 we do not have to wait for ourselves 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.640
 absolutely nothing ok or is it just 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.990
 we go through our life there was no good 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.450
 wait, I'll explain a little 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.950
 when we get to our garage the 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.330
 bicycle will be left out there ok no 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.150
 let's go to simple stones is for nothing 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.230
 and cycled is no longer useful now 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.570
 what we have to do is enter 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.190
 walking ok let's go before him walking 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.600
 let's do the bicycle and we're going to 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.550
 walk in and I saw how it is there 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.900
 another arrived and we want to see do the 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.400
 trick we can do it again followed 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.840
 show no touching masters triangle 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.790
 radio again I do this the process 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.070
 we leave the capo there we enter through another 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.170
 bicycle ok that Ivan and as I said 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.230
 this varies a lot and well I think that 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.970
 is the trick that still works the version 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.530
 1.11 and freedom is very good and for 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.570

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.610
 challenge in this video we go for the challenge 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.860
