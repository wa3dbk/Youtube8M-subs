00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.430
 Hello everyone, 

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:06.180
 And thank you so much for all the questions you posted on my blog. 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.910
 I'll put the camera farther away. 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.710
 to show people what I'm talking about, because 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.140
 is much easier than just writing. 

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.850
 I'm here today, and let's make a summary 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.550
 about all this. 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.800
 First, I would like to talk about the main points, 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.530
 because as I was researching how we can get rid of cellulite, 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.380
 I have discovered that there are some very important main points 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.090
 and the first of these points is that there are 90 more muscles below the waist 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.310
 and to work all of them in a way that helps to develop muscle, 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.860
 leveling the fat and softening the surface of the skin, 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.820
 We need to do it in a very special way with bodyweight exercises. 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.640
 and when Billie came to me, she could not do a squat 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.990
 with knees bent that way 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.370
 and we had to work with a mirror for a few months 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.680
 until she was able to do a normal squat 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.810
 without messing with the knees, and then we did a lot of body workouts 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.790
 and recently discovered in an interview 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.850
 that this is the secret to getting rid of cellulite. 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.630
 So even if you've never exercised before and are not so fit, 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.630
 you will be able to do so with the program you will hear in this interview. 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.740
 So how does it work? 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.220
 There are actually 3 things that are very important, no matter what kind of exercise you are doing 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.400
 In other words, it is more important than the same. 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.650
 First I would like to talk about how the exercises are performed. 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.690
 Shape is very important because we need to activate 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.600
 all muscles in the right way 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.820
 And this only happens when you have a good way to practice, 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.350
 that gives you a range of motion, a full range of motion. 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.000
 For example, if you are doing a bicep curl, 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.110
 you have to achieve a range of motion that way 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.680
 and not those little moves you sometimes see people doing in the gym. 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.950
 This range of motion is really important for you to make sure you are reaching your muscles in the right way, 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.610
 because your body positioning is correct. 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.640
 The second thing is the speed you do the exercise, 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.480
 because if you do too fast, 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.120
 you will use the urge of your body to help you. 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.900
 So it's kind of a cheat. 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.010
 Then again instead of doing something fast and rocking your body, 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.340
 Let's do it slowly and I'll demonstrate this by doing it on the rug. 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.270
 The third thing is the sequence of exercises, and it is of the utmost importance. 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.690
 No matter how you get the results you make with your customers 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.830
 and with your own body because a large part of the results you get is due to the sequence of exercises, 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.560
 because when you go from one to another, something very interesting happens. 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.940
 In the first exercise you do, your muscles start to get tired. 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.050
 When you go to the next, 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.850
 muscles will respond in a different way because they are tired 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.560
 and different muscles or different parts of the muscle fiber will take the front 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.110
 and start doing the work. 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.360
 You are actually forcing the body 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.890
 to work in ways he is not accustomed or perhaps not even comfortable. 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.620
 Then this first part about the sequence of exercises 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.880
 and also which exercises to follow will complement each other. 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.750
 As for example, we exercise the thighs and glutes 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.840
 and then exercise the sides of the leg. They are complementing themselves, and in this way, 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.100
 when the program is designed in the correct way, 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.080
 you will see the synergistic result, such as a "snowball" 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.300
 because everything has been designed in a very specific way to produce the results we seek. 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.830
 So let's go to the carpet and I'll show you 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.060
 the first exercise, 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.970
 the things I want to show you here are speed and form. 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.010
 we'll do the range of motion and we'll do it slowly. 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.680
 Even if you are super strong and you do this exercise, 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.500
 what we're going to do is use the muscles in the most intense way you can by flexing them 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.090
 and stretching them so you can get maximum benefit. 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.250
 Can you see the range of motion? 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.290
 Shrink, then raise 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.870
 and flex. 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.340
 Inspire, 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.240
 make the move up 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.530
 and upload. 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.150
 I'll repeat that, 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.020
 20 times for each leg. 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.510
 Reaching the loin 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.970
 and the back of a great way. 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.240
 We are mainly working the back of the thigh and glutes. 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.370
 Now let's change 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.440
 to a different position 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.060
 and now we will work the calf 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.790
 and we will also continue to work the ischitibial with this position descending 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.430
 and then we climbed up again. 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.280
 See the slow way I'm working? 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.830
 Inspiring 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.360
 and exhaling, that's right. 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.460
 This is an isometric exercise. 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.810
 makes the muscles hard 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.830
 and I can feel the pressure on the back of my leg here and here. 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.140
 I'll show you now on the other side. 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.000
 Heel up, 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.760
 putting the heel up and ensuring 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.890
 that you will keep it that way in every repetition. 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.360
 Oh, what a good feeling. 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.000
 Twenty reps like that, okay? 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.050
 If you take turns with someone, 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.310
 you can put a weight on your ankle and do this 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.960
 or you can even use a Swiss ball, 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.490
 much more difficult, 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.890
 or you can do some exercises in that position while someone might help you 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.660
 and lift your leg 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.680
 Like this. 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.710
 OK 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.150
 That's right. 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.550
 Amazing. 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.020
 And this next exercise, 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.880
 you can do it with a bank, 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.260
 all my friends love this exercise, 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.970
 you can use the seat and then you will lift your whole leg off the floor, 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.610
 which will make this exercise work even harder with your muscles 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.840
 because there is more weight being pressed being pressed on the hamstrings and glutes. 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.120
 Okay, so let's recap. 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.680
 The way you exercise is important, the sequence of the exercise 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.470
 and the speed you make it. 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.740
 and before we finish, 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.300
 I wanted to say that if you already exercise with heavy loads, 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.070
 already exercises 3 or 4 times a week, 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:46.720
 or have well developed muscles so maybe this program is not for you. 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.890
 But if you still have cellulite, 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.940
 and you liked what you saw today, 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:56.330
 and you would like to know how you can join my program, you can do it at home, 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.840
 and really recommend you give it a try, 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.020
 because I know it really works. 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.620
 Thank you for all your questions. 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.560
 Love you so much. 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.020
 Keep following me, keep following my blog, 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.450
 continue to show your love because people you know can benefit 

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.490
 of what I'm doing, and I'll see you soon.
