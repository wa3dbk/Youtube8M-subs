 and this is the problem 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.519
 Action ratio 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.110
 28 you can not miss the day 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:23.520

 in conference with a lot of the campus 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.149
 green hills 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:02.900
 very fatherly facundo 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:29.070
 It's not a gym without your ticket 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.670
 but I give it to you supergrass you have to 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.670
 pay nothing 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.610
 that is to say my friends 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.660
 and you too 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.660
 once 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.260
 but good 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.890
 apparently people and 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.810
 University students valley 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.000
 of mexico are not aware and do not 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.350
 know what will happen on the day like this 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.760
 that we are going to interview someone for 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.760
 know what it tastes 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.480
 Hey, you know what's going to happen today 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.040
 essentially for what I know describe the 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.520
 that someone is given but only because we 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.520
 we find 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.980
 they have told us that we have to pass 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.590
 your coordinator not all of life 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.450
 Doubts 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:34.810
 I do not have to clap 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.940
 but that is not activity that you can 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.440
 be aware of them we by 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.130
 example we are public relations and 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.130
 let's give a workshop 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.840
 you know that we are 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.920
 I design 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.260
 22 videos how to monitor in this 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.260
 companion to the student 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.800
 I lost the job 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.769
 only from our teacher 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:15.390
 to make a plastic composition 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.190
 for a kitchen plastic and 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.570
 later it is given a coated 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.400
 the rest 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.590
 transparent to be able to place 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.250
 nations happy to spray deployed 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:29.350
 arrive with all logic 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:32.400
 and many of our bodies 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.400
 in that 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.080
 and published carry out 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.120
 where people 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.030
 you know more than anything for example 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.090
 in murcia 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:47.330
 more than anything 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:51.190
 it's annoying because it's squeezing 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.190
 quite and when cutting 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:57.340
 there's no stopping to introduce ourselves to 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.440
 do we have information 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.190
 consequently the same should 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.320
 do what 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.320
 like the arms the legs all 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.639
 this is only the caresses and minds 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.680
 and I mentioned earlier that more 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.169
 late 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:22.509
 answer 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:24.719
 we're just going to be in front of the 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:24.719
 theater 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.100
 two 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:35.169
 and suddenly you came to me 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:42.850
 canceled the weak heart 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:49.560
 never leave my side 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:56.750
 stay though looking night and day 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:56.750
 I'm going to summarize this feeling 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.280
 videos 

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:44.220
 without giving anything more of tranquility you 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:47.000
 I can not wait to cry in the 

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.000
 happiness
