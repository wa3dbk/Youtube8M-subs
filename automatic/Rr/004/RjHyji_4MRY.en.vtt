okay check this out I built a hackintosh
I<00:00:09.160> guess<00:00:10.090> what<00:00:10.270> three<00:00:10.510> weeks<00:00:10.660> ago<00:00:10.920> build<00:00:11.920> a

machine<00:02:41.190> my<00:02:41.940> first<00:02:42.270> machine<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:43.020> a<00:02:43.050> dual<00:02:43.350> core

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
machine my first machine is a dual core

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.560 
machine my first machine is a dual core
celeron<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.820> I<00:02:44.880> want<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.180> show<00:02:45.330> you<00:02:45.390> the

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
celeron and I want to show you the

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.930 
celeron and I want to show you the
difference<00:02:45.990> between<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:47.160> know<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.520> one<00:02:47.760> and

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
difference between you know this one and

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.960 
difference between you know this one and
that<00:02:47.970> one<00:02:48.570> as<00:02:48.840> far<00:02:49.050> as<00:02:49.170> boot<00:02:49.770> time<00:02:50.040> just<00:02:50.910> to

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
that one as far as boot time just to

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.550 
that one as far as boot time just to
give<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.240> an<00:02:51.300> idea<00:02:51.390> how<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.960> would<00:02:52.050> be<00:02:52.170> if

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560
