cool<00:01:06.360> enough<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.990> idea<00:01:07.350> behind<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
cool enough the idea behind the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.850 
cool enough the idea behind the
technology<00:01:08.010> here<00:01:08.580> really<00:01:09.180> see<00:01:09.470> so<00:01:10.470> much<00:01:10.619> more

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
technology here really see so much more

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.770 
technology here really see so much more
people<00:01:11.250> taking<00:01:11.729> their<00:01:11.760> smartphones<00:01:12.420> and

came from I'm range are we talking about

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.990 
came from I'm range are we talking about
or<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.840> credibility<00:01:20.439> yeah<00:01:21.009> absolutely<00:01:21.549> you

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
have 32 feet of range okay so the head

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.230 
have 32 feet of range okay so the head
is<00:01:25.630> actually<00:01:26.079> held<00:01:26.350> in<00:01:26.530> by<00:01:26.770> two<00:01:26.829> magnets<00:01:27.460> so

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
is actually held in by two magnets so

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.880 
is actually held in by two magnets so
you<00:01:28.299> can<00:01:28.509> see<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:28.689> head<00:01:28.840> snap<00:01:29.079> at<00:01:29.259> a<00:01:29.320> place<00:01:29.560> and

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
you can see the head snap at a place and

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.550 
you can see the head snap at a place and
it<00:01:29.979> does<00:01:30.159> holding<00:01:30.490> they're<00:01:30.640> quite<00:01:30.909> nice<00:01:31.560> but

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
it does holding they're quite nice but

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.800 
it does holding they're quite nice but
think<00:01:32.770> about<00:01:32.860> in<00:01:33.070> terms<00:01:33.100> of<00:01:33.429> ranged<00:01:33.939> is<00:01:34.179> we

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
think about in terms of ranged is we

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.510 
think about in terms of ranged is we
don't<00:01:35.049> need<00:01:35.200> an<00:01:35.319> end<00:01:35.439> your<00:01:35.649> music<00:01:35.979> experience

this<00:01:47.470> kind<00:01:47.770> of<00:01:47.830> technology<00:01:48.159> must<00:01:48.670> be

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
this kind of technology must be

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.089 
this kind of technology must be
difficult<00:01:49.060> to<00:01:49.479> install<00:01:49.630> Travis<00:01:50.560> right

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:51.099 
difficult to install Travis right

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:53.639 
difficult to install Travis right
