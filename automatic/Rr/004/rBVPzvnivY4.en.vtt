this<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.000> where<00:00:39.120> he<00:00:39.180> had<00:00:39.300> trouble<00:00:39.600> right<00:00:39.719> there

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
this is where he had trouble right there

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.369 
this is where he had trouble right there
but<00:00:40.620> he<00:00:40.680> got<00:00:40.829> by<00:00:41.300> his<00:00:42.300> exercise<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.899> perfect<00:00:43.260> at

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
but he got by his exercise is perfect at

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.229 
but he got by his exercise is perfect at
this<00:00:43.469> point<00:00:43.680> this<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.040> an<00:00:44.280> incredibly<00:00:44.910> long

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
this point this is an incredibly long

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.840 
this point this is an incredibly long
routine<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.899> all<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.230> parts<00:00:46.559> are<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.739> value<00:00:49.850> ok

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
routine and all the parts are a value ok

flares to the end and a handstand that's

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.680 
flares to the end and a handstand that's
your<00:00:54.449> guy

the Soviet Union
wieder<00:01:00.410> performance<00:01:01.160> coming<00:01:01.520> in<00:01:01.640> but<00:01:01.790> the

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
wieder performance coming in but the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.250 
wieder performance coming in but the
nine-eight<00:01:02.600> oh<00:01:02.710> now<00:01:03.710> what's<00:01:03.980> the<00:01:04.190> extension

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
nine-eight oh now what's the extension

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.690 
nine-eight oh now what's the extension
the<00:01:06.260> most<00:01:06.470> important<00:01:06.950> thing<00:01:07.070> to<00:01:07.190> notice<00:01:07.400> here

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
the most important thing to notice here

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:16.800 
the most important thing to notice here
is<00:01:07.730> how<00:01:08.330> high<00:01:08.630> his<00:01:08.900> hips<00:01:09.229> are<00:01:09.500> above<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:10.010> horse

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.300 

definitely<00:01:17.810> one<00:01:17.960> of<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.170> best<00:01:18.590> routines<00:01:19.070> done

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
definitely one of the best routines done

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.430 
definitely one of the best routines done
in<00:01:19.430> the<00:01:19.520> world<00:01:19.670> if<00:01:20.479> not<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:20.990> best

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
in the world if not the best

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.350 
in the world if not the best
and<00:01:21.830> notice<00:01:22.100> how<00:01:22.220> long<00:01:22.460> his<00:01:22.610> arms<00:01:22.640> are<00:01:23.060> he<00:01:23.210> has

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
and notice how long his arms are he has

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.050 
and notice how long his arms are he has
tremendous<00:01:24.220> elevation<00:01:25.220> over<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:25.640> pommels

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
tremendous elevation over the pommels

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.310 
tremendous elevation over the pommels
and<00:01:26.180> that<00:01:26.270> helps<00:01:26.540> a<00:01:26.630> great<00:01:26.720> deal

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
and that helps a great deal

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.070 
and that helps a great deal
so<00:01:27.800> we<00:01:27.920> await<00:01:28.160> the<00:01:28.190> score<00:01:28.580> a<00:01:28.790> 9<00:01:29.060> Dino<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:29.960> that

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
so we await the score a 9 Dino and that

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.600 
so we await the score a 9 Dino and that
really<00:01:30.350> bolts<00:01:30.740> him<00:01:30.890> out<00:01:31.010> in<00:01:31.160> front<00:01:31.400> that's

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
really bolts him out in front that's

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.249 
really bolts him out in front that's
gonna<00:01:31.759> be<00:01:31.940> hard<00:01:32.180> to<00:01:32.330> beat<00:01:32.479> he<00:01:32.630> came<00:01:32.869> in<00:01:33.080> with

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
gonna be hard to beat he came in with

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.020 
gonna be hard to beat he came in with
the<00:01:33.380> highest<00:01:33.590> going<00:01:33.979> to<00:01:34.100> competition<00:01:34.729> of<00:01:34.820> nine

the highest going to competition of nine

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.170 
the highest going to competition of nine
nine<00:01:35.360> so<00:01:35.960> he's<00:01:36.200> now<00:01:36.440> out<00:01:36.830> in<00:01:37.070> front<00:01:37.340> with<00:01:37.550> a<00:01:37.580> 19

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
nine so he's now out in front with a 19

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.120 
nine so he's now out in front with a 19
point<00:01:38.479> a<00:01:38.780> though<00:01:39.020> you're<00:01:39.590> looking<00:01:39.860> at<00:01:40.009> him

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
point a though you're looking at him

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.650 
point a though you're looking at him
right<00:01:40.310> now<00:01:40.340> but<00:01:40.759> Linton<00:01:40.970> Mogilny

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
right now but Linton Mogilny

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.990 
right now but Linton Mogilny
he's<00:01:42.170> from<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.500> Soviet<00:01:42.920> Union<00:01:43.280> so<00:01:43.580> the<00:01:43.820> old

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
he's from the Soviet Union so the old

he's from the Soviet Union so the old
man<00:01:44.210> go<00:01:44.360> watch<00:01:44.570> it<00:01:44.600> right<00:01:44.780> now<00:01:45.170> is<00:01:45.440> marry<00:01:45.830> and

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
man go watch it right now is marry and

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.060 
man go watch it right now is marry and
visa<00:01:46.430> he<00:01:47.360> has<00:01:47.479> a<00:01:47.630> nine<00:01:47.840> point<00:01:48.200> seven<00:01:48.410> five<00:01:48.800> he's

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
visa he has a nine point seven five he's

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.450 
visa he has a nine point seven five he's
from<00:01:49.340> Romania

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.300 

okay<00:01:55.460> now<00:01:55.580> reason<00:01:56.200> is<00:01:57.200> doing<00:01:57.530> longitudinal

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
okay now reason is doing longitudinal

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.830 
okay now reason is doing longitudinal
travels<00:01:58.789> but<00:01:58.970> notice<00:01:59.330> the<00:01:59.479> difference

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
travels but notice the difference

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.600 
travels but notice the difference
there's<00:02:00.050> not<00:02:00.619> quite<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.039> same<00:02:01.190> extension

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
there's not quite the same extension

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.690 
there's not quite the same extension
that<00:02:01.820> you'll<00:02:01.940> see<00:02:02.119> in<00:02:02.270> Mogilny<00:02:03.400> he<00:02:04.400> really

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
that you'll see in Mogilny he really

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.850 
that you'll see in Mogilny he really
uses<00:02:04.970> pure<00:02:05.360> strength<00:02:05.900> rather<00:02:06.140> than<00:02:06.409> technique

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
uses pure strength rather than technique
