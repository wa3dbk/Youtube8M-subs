00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.180
 to edit pictures in our workflow 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.429
 is the interaction of two 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.910
 to have software tools 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.099
 once there is adobe photoshop that 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.080
 is actually the 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.859
 bildbearbeitungs-software par excellence 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.690
 just as important, perhaps even 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.029
 has become much more important nowadays 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.980
 However, a small additional program too 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.680
 adobe photoshop namely adobe photoshop 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.300
 lightroom based on this title you can 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.810
 one already recognize where he himself 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.030
 So these products placed photoshop 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.620
 is the actual image editing 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.629
 tool during adobe photoshop lightroom 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.120
 in the end, that's the way to go 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.730
 product is photoshop lightroom i can 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.100
 open it for a short time is for me 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.739
 a tool to large amounts of data to 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.550
 handle to sort data images 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.579
 to sift 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.170
 also to develop pictures there as well 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.960
 the building development takes place in me 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.420
 management instead of the real one 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.920
 retouching the takes place in photoshop 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.189
 And now you have a little something 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.840
 explain the raw converter of the 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.990
 Developer so here if I'm up here 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.360
 go on evolve and right out me 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.520
 this column even then I angucke 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.130
 Here are the same settings 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.380
 like in photoshop that means if I am now 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.240
 load a raw file in Photoshop directly 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.549
 or in lightroom and then after 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.650
 Exporting photoshop is actually 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.390
 jacket like pants because both attack 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.110
 the same engine on the same raw 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.729
 converter back now why then 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.229
 the whole with lightroom in advance 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.020
 edit and that's a thing of 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.240
 efficiency again lightroom and that 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.009
 In any case, my opinion is very much 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.770
 more efficient in the handling of 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.049
 Big data photoshop can believe 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.649
 I also only 400 pictures on maximum 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.909
 import once and is relative 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.549
 slow and sluggish when it comes to it 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.610
 to process large amounts of data 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.700
 in lightroom, however, I can do things 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.920
 Hide things different 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.969
 rate and then not anymore 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.640
 show 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.020
 i get much better with big ones 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.489
 datasets from the photo shoot too 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.330
 a small result which reduces 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.410
 shall be 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.020
 than to make the whole thing in photoshop 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.490
 good, now that we know that 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.230
 lightroom is the same in the 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.880
 Development like photoshop is so 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.160
 only one more thing of the way of working 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.720
 and the handling and there it is 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.970
 personal matter of taste whether one with 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.180
 line or divert work 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.650
 We want to do it with you and that's one 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.720
 very important point for my opinion 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.960
 After that you can save a lot of time 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.600
 if you are properly ans ans 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.030
 werk goes the biggest work is with us 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.560
 also in lightroom , by the way , if I am 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.210
 Now take a picture and I'll watch the 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.730
 complete workflow on then 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.370
 probably over 50% of the workflow in 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.080
 to find lines and the smaller one 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.260
 part of that then really finds in the 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.700
 photoshop work instead 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.830
 You can basically define ours 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.010
 separating it by saying okay 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.010
 Lightroom works with the image 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.110
 Pixelate what's there and photoshop 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.040
 edited image in pixels that just 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.740
 are not there 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.630
 that is when I move pixel 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.790
 alter retouch clown and such 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.830
 I want to go on and on 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.990
 in photoshop because there is work in 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.790
 Photoshop significantly more efficient line 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.320
 can indeed already first corrections 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.670
 make move with any and 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.350
 any clones and copiers 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.450
 stamp but eventually you hear the 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.550
 speed up there at the moment 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.870
 So where I only brightnesses and color 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.240
 so on and so on would like to move 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.640
 I use lightroom for the picture 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.050
 develop and then when I pixel 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.700
 move if I really want the 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:42.910
 retouching work 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.910
 then I go directly to photoshop
