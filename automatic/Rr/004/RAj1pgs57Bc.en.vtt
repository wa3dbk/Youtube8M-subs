00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.300
 half transistors 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.990
 interesting because unlike ordinary 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.969
 transistors designed to work 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.680
 to address lifting work at the heart of it 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.060
 books shock nizatsiya opponent 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.630
 crossings when it's cold at the border 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.300
 breakdown mode takes lapina 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.940
 figuratively 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.960
 and so leads to a sharp increase 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.359
 flow 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.509
 between 20 and nickname transistors 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.870

 resistance man 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.910
 resistance and but transition method is so bad 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.180
 with increasing voltage on 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.879
 hardware collector 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.879
 rarely will flow mainly through 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.670
 three semesters 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.760
 at a certain voltage to flow 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.760
 collector will stay 0 transition but contrary to 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.120
 half figurative debt increase 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.210
 increases and voltage drops but 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.220
 and out of 35 gas 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.600
 as a result 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.970
 internet transition is starting to open 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.070
 and most of the flow of colleagues goes into 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.570
 Cyc Minister 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.700
 and this in turn leads to a decrease 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.390
 his resistance 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.020
 limiting tons to the level allowed 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.810
 for this transistor 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.470
 can avoid thermal work 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.210
 while maintaining further work 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.600

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.700
 The track of them is as follows 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.590
