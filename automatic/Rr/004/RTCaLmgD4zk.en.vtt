 I do not know if what you left for me will be enough for me to close the day. I do not hurt anymore, and what I wanted to say is suddenly gone 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:20.417
 And if I've gotten used to putting my head on a bed not a bed and words I did not hear then what was left for me to run and shout to run and shout 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:48.417
 The wind and the rain washed the street of filth and a million of noises and once I thought that if I tried I would still be able to wash people 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:23.417
 And you do not care where you came from and where you are now and the song you're wearing seems to whisper to you to run and shout to run and shout 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:48.417
 Take me, I'll do you a good thing. Sit in beside me. You know that nothing matters as long as you're here while you're here 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:52.417
 Run and shout Run and shout Run and scream Run and shout Run and shout Run and shout 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.417
