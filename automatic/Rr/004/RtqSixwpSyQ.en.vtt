 hello everyone with you hancock and in this 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:10.650
 video I want to show you what happens to 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:12.929
 people when they play 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.940
 competitive mode vx goal like 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.980
 it is known you cannot leave it while you 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.810
 are playing 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.180
 until 30 rounds can not go out 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.440
 because the team is west or weekly and 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.420
 for 30 days 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.750
 and that's what was with me when I was driving with 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.750
 gifts 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.599

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.450

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.729

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.130
