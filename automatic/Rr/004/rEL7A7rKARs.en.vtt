00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
is probably going to give me a lot of

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.900 
is probably going to give me a lot of
flak<00:01:53.119> but<00:01:53.709> it<00:01:54.709> seemed<00:01:54.920> like<00:01:55.039> a<00:01:55.069> tiny<00:01:55.459> wee<00:01:55.729> knife

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
and it's oh yeah I tighten it a lot

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.949 
and it's oh yeah I tighten it a lot
because<00:02:00.590> I<00:02:01.399> need<00:02:01.970> to<00:02:02.090> break<00:02:02.270> it<00:02:02.420> in<00:02:02.539> but<00:02:02.840> I

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.540 
to EDC this for a couple weeks I'm
obviously<00:04:49.170> not<00:04:49.350> giving<00:04:49.650> a<00:04:49.710> final<00:04:49.890> verdict<00:04:50.400> now

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
obviously not giving a final verdict now

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.990 
obviously not giving a final verdict now
because<00:04:50.790> I<00:04:50.850> just<00:04:51.120> got<00:04:51.300> it<00:04:51.390> today<00:04:51.510> and<00:04:51.870> I<00:04:53.000> want

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
because I just got it today and I want

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.390 
because I just got it today and I want
to<00:04:54.030> actually<00:04:54.150> use<00:04:54.390> it<00:04:54.420> right<00:04:54.870> now<00:04:55.050> oh<00:04:55.290> yeah<00:04:56.130> and

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
to actually use it right now oh yeah and

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.460 
to actually use it right now oh yeah and
since<00:04:56.580> I<00:04:56.670> tighten<00:04:57.060> it<00:04:57.150> this<00:04:57.990> has<00:04:58.170> the<00:04:58.200> absolute

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
since I tighten it this has the absolute

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.010 
since I tighten it this has the absolute
strongest<00:04:58.950> detent<00:04:59.520> on<00:04:59.610> any<00:04:59.730> knife<00:04:59.970> Iona<00:05:00.420> well

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
strongest detent on any knife Iona well

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.810 
strongest detent on any knife Iona well
the<00:05:01.110> strongest<00:05:01.410> retention<00:05:01.920> there's<00:05:02.550> no<00:05:02.700> way

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
the strongest retention there's no way

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.550 
the strongest retention there's no way
you<00:05:02.910> can<00:05:03.030> flick<00:05:03.570> this<00:05:03.720> out<00:05:03.930> there<00:05:04.260> literally

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
you can flick this out there literally

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.470 
you can flick this out there literally
is<00:05:04.680> no<00:05:04.950> way<00:05:05.100> I'm<00:05:05.310> there's<00:05:06.150> just<00:05:06.330> not<00:05:06.420> enough

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
is no way I'm there's just not enough

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.410 
is no way I'm there's just not enough
mass<00:05:06.960> to<00:05:07.140> do<00:05:07.350> so<00:05:07.910> obviously<00:05:08.910> this<00:05:09.090> does<00:05:09.270> make

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
mass to do so obviously this does make

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.230 
mass to do so obviously this does make
it<00:05:09.570> a<00:05:09.630> little<00:05:09.660> bit<00:05:10.200> harder<00:05:10.500> to<00:05:10.530> open<00:05:10.920> then<00:05:11.310> some

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
it a little bit harder to open then some

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.810 
it a little bit harder to open then some
other<00:05:12.300> nice<00:05:12.570> but<00:05:12.960> it<00:05:13.830> still<00:05:14.460> got<00:05:14.700> that

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
other nice but it still got that

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.880 
other nice but it still got that
smoothness<00:05:15.270> to<00:05:15.570> it<00:05:15.900> because<00:05:16.410> it<00:05:16.560> brought

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
smoothness to it because it brought

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.490 
smoothness to it because it brought
enough<00:05:17.160> washers<00:05:17.490> are<00:05:17.790> very<00:05:17.970> good<00:05:18.350> not<00:05:19.350> as

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
enough washers are very good not as

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.110 
enough washers are very good not as
smooth<00:05:19.770> as<00:05:19.920> not<00:05:20.250> nearly<00:05:20.460> as<00:05:20.580> smooth<00:05:20.850> as<00:05:20.970> it

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
smooth as not nearly as smooth as it

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.960 
smooth as not nearly as smooth as it
I'll<00:05:21.750> see<00:05:22.080> so<00:05:22.800> this<00:05:22.920> isn't<00:05:23.190> working<00:05:23.310> in<00:05:23.610> not

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
I'll see so this isn't working in not

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.270 
I'll see so this isn't working in not
just<00:05:24.000> the<00:05:24.510> shunt<00:05:24.810> but<00:05:25.020> still<00:05:25.770> quite<00:05:25.920> smooth

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
just the shunt but still quite smooth

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.360 
just the shunt but still quite smooth
and<00:05:26.490> the<00:05:26.540> lock-up<00:05:27.540> is<00:05:29.150> rock<00:05:30.150> solid<00:05:30.690> now<00:05:31.370> rock

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
and the lock-up is rock solid now rock

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.970 
and the lock-up is rock solid now rock
solid<00:05:34.100> so<00:05:35.630> just<00:05:36.630> in<00:05:36.780> another<00:05:37.050> size<00:05:37.320> comparison

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
solid so just in another size comparison

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.630 
solid so just in another size comparison
a<00:05:38.160> couple<00:05:38.580> more<00:05:40.220> kind<00:05:41.220> of<00:05:41.280> want<00:05:41.400> to<00:05:41.430> do<00:05:41.550> this

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
a couple more kind of want to do this

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:56.310 
a couple more kind of want to do this
for<00:05:41.820> fun<00:05:42.120> more<00:05:42.390> than<00:05:42.510> anything<00:05:45.440> big<00:05:46.440> pioneer

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
Vic pioneer very similar in size but

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:13.500 
Vic pioneer very similar in size but
Urkel<00:06:06.860> military<00:06:07.450> just<00:06:08.450> for<00:06:09.520> for<00:06:10.520> jokes

you<00:06:54.650> my<00:06:54.770> last<00:06:54.920> rider<00:06:55.250> was<00:06:55.520> not<00:06:56.360> great<00:06:56.630> it's

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:57.170 
you my last rider was not great it's

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.870 
you my last rider was not great it's
definitely<00:06:57.350> still<00:06:57.830> a<00:06:57.890> thicker<00:06:58.190> edge<00:06:58.430> near<00:06:58.730> the

00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:58.880 
definitely still a thicker edge near the

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.650 
definitely still a thicker edge near the
tip<00:06:59.120> and<00:06:59.480> reasonably<00:07:00.260> thicker<00:07:00.530> than<00:07:00.710> normal

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:01.660 
tip and reasonably thicker than normal

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.170 
tip and reasonably thicker than normal
but<00:07:02.660> it's<00:07:02.810> still<00:07:02.960> a<00:07:03.020> good<00:07:03.170> edge<00:07:03.380> it<00:07:03.650> is<00:07:04.430> sharp

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:05.180 
but it's still a good edge it is sharp

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.530 
but it's still a good edge it is sharp
fast<00:07:05.510> for<00:07:05.690> sure<00:07:05.840> so<00:07:06.260> I'm<00:07:06.440> happy<00:07:06.740> with<00:07:06.830> that<00:07:07.540> so

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:08.540 
fast for sure so I'm happy with that so

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.090 
fast for sure so I'm happy with that so
far<00:07:08.750> I<00:07:08.960> think<00:07:09.050> fit<00:07:09.500> and<00:07:09.620> finish<00:07:09.740> this<00:07:09.950> is

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:10.100 
far I think fit and finish this is

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.770 
far I think fit and finish this is
definitely<00:07:10.370> a<00:07:10.430> step<00:07:10.610> up<00:07:10.730> above<00:07:10.970> my<00:07:11.150> SN<00:07:11.420> g<00:07:11.600> and

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:11.780 
definitely a step up above my SN g and

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.650 
definitely a step up above my SN g and
I'm<00:07:12.040> happy<00:07:13.040> with<00:07:13.130> it<00:07:13.190> right<00:07:13.400> now<00:07:13.460> I<00:07:13.790> like<00:07:14.630> to
