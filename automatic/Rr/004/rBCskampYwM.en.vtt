00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the shortest one this one shouldn't take

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.000 
the shortest one this one shouldn't take
too<00:00:58.949> long<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.850> that's<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.809> little<00:01:01.109> nice<00:01:01.260> tackle

last<00:02:09.630> like<00:02:09.929> segments<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:10.769> level<00:02:11.009> it's<00:02:11.400> I

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
last like segments of this level it's I

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.130 
last like segments of this level it's I
don't<00:02:13.440> know<00:02:13.769> if<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.070> would<00:02:14.130> consider<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.900> very

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
don't know if I would consider the very

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.530 
don't know if I would consider the very
last<00:02:16.380> fights<00:02:16.769> as<00:02:17.160> like<00:02:17.790> one<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.150> hardest

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
last fights as like one of the hardest

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.949 
last fights as like one of the hardest
parts<00:02:18.900> in<00:02:19.080> this<00:02:19.170> game<00:02:19.550> probably<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.760> because<00:02:21.239> in

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
parts in this game probably I because in

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.110 
parts in this game probably I because in
the<00:02:22.230> later<00:02:22.440> levels<00:02:22.709> it's<00:02:23.100> definitely<00:02:23.760> harder

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
the later levels it's definitely harder

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.040 
the later levels it's definitely harder
than<00:02:24.680> but<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.800> still<00:02:26.160> quite<00:02:26.760> intense

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
than but it still quite intense

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.650 
than but it still quite intense
I<00:02:29.140> always<00:02:29.920> want<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.250> try<00:02:30.460> to<00:02:30.520> kill<00:02:31.210> that<00:02:31.360> pain

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660

i<00:02:45.660> had<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.590> do<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:46.950> by<00:02:47.069> myself<00:02:47.280> that's<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:47.880> little

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
i had to do it by myself that's a little

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.740 
i had to do it by myself that's a little
secret<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:49.580> there's<00:02:50.580> another<00:02:50.880> door<00:02:51.239> I<00:02:51.450> think

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
secret and there's another door I think

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.110 
secret and there's another door I think
I<00:02:51.870> pressed<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.440> yeah<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:52.920> think<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:53.940> have<00:02:54.060> to

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
I pressed it yeah I think you have to

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.920 
I pressed it yeah I think you have to
open<00:02:54.510> both<00:02:55.019> of<00:02:55.260> them<00:02:55.410> for<00:02:56.450> secrets<00:02:57.450> because<00:02:57.720> I

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
open both of them for secrets because I

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.420 
open both of them for secrets because I
think<00:02:58.110> they're<00:02:58.290> tagged<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.980> way<00:02:59.190> I<00:02:59.220> don't

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430

so trying to kill these cattle demons
girls<00:04:06.720> tackle<00:04:07.560> demons<00:04:07.860> are<00:04:07.980> no<00:04:08.100> fun<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.460> fight

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670

girls tackle demons are no fun to fight
well<00:04:09.570> in<00:04:09.750> this<00:04:10.190> certain<00:04:11.190> second<00:04:12.090> manner<00:04:12.330> i

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
well in this certain second manner i

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.190 
well in this certain second manner i
definitely<00:04:13.260> don't<00:04:13.470> want<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.650> keep<00:04:13.830> them<00:04:14.010> alive

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.170

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
I think I to shot of him the double

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.600 
I think I to shot of him the double
barrel<00:04:22.450> can<00:04:22.600> actually<00:04:23.050> kill<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:23.860> cackle

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
barrel can actually kill the cackle

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.580 
barrel can actually kill the cackle
demon<00:04:24.910> two<00:04:25.300> shots<00:04:25.660> I<00:04:26.050> think<00:04:26.650> all<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:27.300> all<00:04:28.300> the

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
demon two shots I think all the all the

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.440 
demon two shots I think all the all the
shocking<00:04:29.590> shots<00:04:29.830> have<00:04:30.070> to<00:04:30.250> hit<00:04:30.580> him<00:04:30.610> sometimes

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
shocking shots have to hit him sometimes

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.060

painter one that tool he won't spawn at

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.070 
painter one that tool he won't spawn at
times<00:05:11.950> I<00:05:12.190> really<00:05:12.460> don't<00:05:12.670> know<00:05:12.760> why<00:05:12.970> and<00:05:13.300> since

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
times I really don't know why and since

percent<00:05:16.180> kills<00:05:17.040> but<00:05:18.040> I<00:05:18.070> think<00:05:18.310> he's<00:05:18.460> yeah<00:05:18.760> he

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
percent kills but I think he's yeah he

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.450 
percent kills but I think he's yeah he
spawned<00:05:19.210> on<00:05:19.330> this<00:05:19.510> one<00:05:20.850> yeah<00:05:21.850> there<00:05:22.060> he<00:05:22.180> is

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
spawned on this one yeah there he is

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.590 
spawned on this one yeah there he is
so<00:05:24.389> on<00:05:24.569> that<00:05:24.600> low<00:05:24.960> health<00:05:25.319> I<00:05:25.560> decided<00:05:26.039> to<00:05:26.370> play

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
so on that low health I decided to play

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.499 
so on that low health I decided to play
play<00:05:27.600> it<00:05:27.720> more<00:05:27.840> defensively<00:05:28.639> yeah<00:05:29.639> those<00:05:30.000> make

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:30.509 
play it more defensively yeah those make

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:32.930 
play it more defensively yeah those make
it<00:05:30.660> as<00:05:30.810> fireballs<00:05:31.380> they<00:05:31.770> really<00:05:32.310> hurt<00:05:32.520> when

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
it as fireballs they really hurt when

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.580 
it as fireballs they really hurt when
you<00:05:33.270> have<00:05:33.750> no<00:05:33.930> shields<00:05:35.870> thank<00:05:36.870> God<00:05:37.110> I<00:05:37.139> saved

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
you have no shields thank God I saved

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:43.850 
you have no shields thank God I saved
right<00:05:37.770> there<00:05:38.009> I<00:05:39.500> do<00:05:40.500> everything

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.839 

I<00:05:43.919> don't<00:05:44.580> really<00:05:44.699> think<00:05:46.069> having<00:05:47.069> a<00:05:47.340> saving

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:47.849 
I don't really think having a saving

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:50.330 
I don't really think having a saving
mode<00:05:48.090> option<00:05:49.020> makes<00:05:49.199> this<00:05:49.439> game<00:05:49.650> easier<00:05:50.099> it

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
mode option makes this game easier it

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.869 
mode option makes this game easier it
does<00:05:50.550> make<00:05:50.789> it<00:05:50.909> more<00:05:50.939> forgiving<00:05:52.550> you're<00:05:53.550> still

00:05:53.869 --> 00:05:53.879 
does make it more forgiving you're still

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:55.459 
does make it more forgiving you're still
getting<00:05:54.030> some<00:05:54.330> sort<00:05:54.629> of<00:05:54.689> a<00:05:54.780> challenge<00:05:55.289> at

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:55.469 
getting some sort of a challenge at

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:59.689 
getting some sort of a challenge at
least<00:05:56.000> well<00:05:57.000> that's<00:05:57.840> how<00:05:58.020> I<00:05:58.050> feel<00:05:58.430> some<00:05:59.430> people

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 
least well that's how I feel some people

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:01.490 
least well that's how I feel some people
might<00:05:59.879> think<00:05:59.939> that<00:06:00.300> makes<00:06:00.689> the<00:06:00.840> game<00:06:00.990> too<00:06:01.259> easy

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
might think that makes the game too easy

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.589 
might think that makes the game too easy
I<00:06:04.009> I<00:06:05.009> still<00:06:05.610> you<00:06:05.699> know<00:06:05.729> get<00:06:06.000> some<00:06:06.210> sort<00:06:06.449> of<00:06:06.509> a
