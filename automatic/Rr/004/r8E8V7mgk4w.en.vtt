green ax is basically all summer and

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.300 
green ax is basically all summer and
then<00:01:10.080> they<00:01:10.200> definitely<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.950> grow<00:01:11.130> them<00:01:11.220> in

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
then they definitely can grow them in

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.140 
then they definitely can grow them in
the<00:01:11.400> fall<00:01:11.610> again

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
the fall again

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.859

and he said you could replant it right
down<00:01:38.820> there<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.750> pull<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.049> out<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.259> ground

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
down there you pull it out of the ground

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.980 
down there you pull it out of the ground
stick<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.740> right<00:01:40.890> back<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.340> but<00:01:42.329> I've<00:01:42.659> done<00:01:42.930> a

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
stick it right back in but I've done a

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.389 
stick it right back in but I've done a
little<00:01:43.079> research<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.920> found<00:01:43.950> out<00:01:44.310> what

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
little research and I found out what

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.010 
little research and I found out what
really<00:01:44.579> works<00:01:44.880> good<00:01:45.090> as<00:01:45.180> if<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.420> bring<00:01:45.869> them

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
really works good as if you bring them

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.780 
really works good as if you bring them
in<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.140> house<00:01:46.290> wash<00:01:46.619> them<00:01:46.770> up<00:01:46.920> cut<00:01:47.490> off<00:01:47.610> the

in the house wash them up cut off the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.999 
in the house wash them up cut off the
BAA<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.119> throw<00:01:48.689> them<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.960> cup<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.290> water

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
BAA and throw them in a cup of water

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.340 
BAA and throw them in a cup of water
let<00:01:50.790> them<00:01:50.909> rehydrate<00:01:51.630> those<00:01:51.869> roots<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.320> little

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
let them rehydrate those roots a little

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.080 
let them rehydrate those roots a little
bit<00:01:52.680> though<00:01:52.890> even<00:01:53.100> start<00:01:53.490> growing<00:01:53.939> right

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
bit though even start growing right

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.109 
bit though even start growing right
there<00:01:54.560> so<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.310> then<00:01:56.549> take<00:01:56.790> them<00:01:57.000> and

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
there so and so then take them and

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.660 
there so and so then take them and
replant<00:01:57.570> them<00:01:57.689> now<00:01:58.560> you've<00:01:58.799> got<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> steady
