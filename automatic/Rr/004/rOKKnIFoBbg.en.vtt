 hello friends i want to thank 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:16.230
 those who answered my question 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.939
 whether the website of tailors is blocked dot com 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.369
 where they live the thing is that 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.730
 several times people complained and words 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.679
 were such that here the provider megaphone 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.890
 blocking website tailors com and I'm here 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.500
 it is strange but whatever does not fit 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.750
 in no such sound framework 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.830
 so I asked you to look and 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:45.510
 this is a message that the guys reported 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:49.800
 she was not really from the provider 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:53.430
 megaphone or any other message this 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.720
 went from our side the fact is that here 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:01.860
 there is a service that keeps records 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:03.390
 spammer ip and if we allow a person 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.229
 hiding your ip 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.060
 for ip internet provider in the same 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.310
 zone geographically here for this 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.259
 specific and their provider can 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.240
 being alone is enough 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:20.979
 let's say malicious 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.580
 robbers then on all ah pi al pro 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.960
 marked as malicious and all those behind 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.289
 this ip 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.990
 they fall into a bad list 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:35.590
 when trying to get to sites 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.619
 who use this list here 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.100
 so we saw what we have there 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:45.939
 the site is done and indeed it is like 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:49.509
 would use this list of the most so 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:51.549
 general admin considerations but given 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.759
 almost half of the people there 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.369
 which responded to them the site was not 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.380
 affordable I thought it was too bad 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:04.140
 will and 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.819
 yesterday we canceled not the service itself we 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.479
 abolished the use of this service on 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:13.630
 on our side, that's why I think that 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.000
 all who could not get to the ports website 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.170
 who should now be easy on him 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.480
 so this is new 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.750
 that's so everything's all right us nobody 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.470
 doesn't block like that all the way 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.470
 is happy
