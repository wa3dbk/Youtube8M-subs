00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
this game but not bad either probably

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.189 
this game but not bad either probably
around<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.670> same<00:01:02.760> overall<00:01:03.359> as<00:01:03.539> me<00:01:03.719> maybe<00:01:03.899> like

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
around the same overall as me maybe like

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.830 
around the same overall as me maybe like
an<00:01:04.320> 87<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.100> 88<00:01:05.400> something<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.360> would

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
an 87 and 88 something like that would

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.539 
an 87 and 88 something like that would
be<00:01:06.960> my<00:01:07.170> guess<00:01:07.200> based<00:01:07.890> off<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.310> players

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
be my guess based off of the players

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.370 
be my guess based off of the players
that<00:01:08.670> he<00:01:08.880> has<00:01:09.060> but<00:01:09.750> he's<00:01:09.900> doing<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.170> great<00:01:10.260> job

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
that he has but he's doing a great job

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.200 
that he has but he's doing a great job
on<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.830> first<00:01:11.070> drive<00:01:11.310> moving<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.820> ball<00:01:11.970> down

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
on this first drive moving the ball down

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.690 
on this first drive moving the ball down
the<00:01:12.360> field<00:01:12.510> short<00:01:13.500> efficient<00:01:14.070> passes<00:01:14.520> like

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
the field short efficient passes like

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.609 
the field short efficient passes like
this<00:01:14.939> are<00:01:15.150> really<00:01:15.360> really<00:01:15.720> difficult<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.409> stop

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
this are really really difficult to stop

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.320 
this are really really difficult to stop
in<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:16.979> game<00:01:17.159> if<00:01:17.340> somebody<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.090> really

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
in this game if somebody is really

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.640 
in this game if somebody is really
committed<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.750> throwing<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.170> ball<00:01:19.320> short

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
committed to throwing the ball short

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.130 
committed to throwing the ball short
it's<00:01:19.890> very<00:01:20.280> difficult<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.850> stop<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.390> unless

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
it's very difficult to stop it unless

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.109 
it's very difficult to stop it unless
you<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.650> commit<00:01:23.009> on<00:01:23.189> stopping<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:23.939> then

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
you just commit on stopping it and then

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.820 
you just commit on stopping it and then
you're<00:01:24.299> really<00:01:24.479> vulnerable<00:01:24.930> over<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.530> over

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.670 
you're really vulnerable over the over
the<00:01:25.860> top<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.400> course<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.689> know<00:01:28.470> I'm

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
the top of course so you know I'm

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.710 
the top of course so you know I'm
letting<00:01:29.310> him<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> short<00:01:29.939> passes<00:01:30.390> early

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
letting him have the short passes early

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.569 
letting him have the short passes early
because<00:01:30.900> typically<00:01:31.439> people<00:01:31.770> will<00:01:32.070> eventually

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
because typically people will eventually

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.130 
because typically people will eventually
give<00:01:32.759> up<00:01:32.790> on<00:01:33.090> those<00:01:33.180> short<00:01:33.509> passes<00:01:33.960> and

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
give up on those short passes and

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.530 
give up on those short passes and
they'll<00:01:34.500> try<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.040> go<00:01:35.159> deep<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:36.030> guy<00:01:36.240> wasn't

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
they'll try and go deep this guy wasn't

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.450 
they'll try and go deep this guy wasn't
really<00:01:36.869> trying<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.229> go<00:01:37.320> deep<00:01:37.560> though<00:01:37.590> he<00:01:38.100> just

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
really trying to go deep though he just

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.490 
really trying to go deep though he just
have<00:01:38.670> thrown<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.180> short<00:01:39.479> running<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.259> ball

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
have thrown it short running the ball

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.950 
have thrown it short running the ball
making<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.579> very<00:01:41.759> very<00:01:42.000> difficult<00:01:42.119> for<00:01:42.689> me<00:01:42.810> to

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
making it very very difficult for me to

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.139 
making it very very difficult for me to
do<00:01:43.170> anything<00:01:43.290> on<00:01:43.770> defense<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.460> make<00:01:44.640> him<00:01:44.820> make

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
do anything on defense to make him make

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.660 
do anything on defense to make him make
a<00:01:45.210> mistake<00:01:45.600> or<00:01:45.810> anything<00:01:46.170> like<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.460> and<00:01:47.460> I'm

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
going to user his defensive line quite a

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.089 
going to user his defensive line quite a
bit<00:02:21.930> in<00:02:21.959> this<00:02:22.110> one<00:02:22.349> and<00:02:22.530> that's<00:02:22.800> very

bit in this one and that's very

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.250 
bit in this one and that's very
difficult<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.760> stop<00:02:24.120> when<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:24.690> try<00:02:24.989> and<00:02:25.110> run

well<00:03:13.380> I<00:03:13.410> guess<00:03:13.709> I<00:03:13.860> shouldn't<00:03:14.069> say<00:03:14.190> I<00:03:14.220> had<00:03:14.400> a

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
well I guess I shouldn't say I had a

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.520 
well I guess I shouldn't say I had a
drive<00:03:14.760> i<00:03:14.940> basically<00:03:15.480> had<00:03:15.690> one<00:03:15.930> play<00:03:16.230> that<00:03:16.260> went

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
drive i basically had one play that went

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.670 
drive i basically had one play that went
for<00:03:16.709> a<00:03:16.739> touchdown<00:03:17.030> but<00:03:18.030> yeah<00:03:18.660> so<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.200> solar

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
for a touchdown but yeah so the solar

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.530 
for a touchdown but yeah so the solar
still<00:03:20.010> tied<00:03:20.250> up<00:03:20.400> here<00:03:20.640> as<00:03:20.760> Calvin<00:03:21.150> Johnson

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
still tied up here as Calvin Johnson

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.840 
still tied up here as Calvin Johnson
leads<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.989> wood<00:03:22.170> there<00:03:22.500> on<00:03:22.709> my<00:03:22.890> opponent<00:03:23.190> but

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
leads the wood there on my opponent but

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.270 
leads the wood there on my opponent but
again<00:03:24.239> we<00:03:24.510> drop<00:03:24.900> an<00:03:25.079> interception<00:03:25.590> man<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.190> I

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
again we drop an interception man and I

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.520 
again we drop an interception man and I
thought<00:03:26.640> for<00:03:27.030> sure<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.600> when<00:03:28.049> I<00:03:28.079> make<00:03:28.290> some

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
thought for sure that when I make some

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.840 
thought for sure that when I make some
of<00:03:28.590> these<00:03:28.680> upgrades<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:29.340> my<00:03:29.459> team<00:03:29.700> would

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
of these upgrades that my team would

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.789 
of these upgrades that my team would
start<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.180> get<00:03:30.299> more<00:03:30.450> interceptions<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.260> it's

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
start to get more interceptions and it's

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.160 
start to get more interceptions and it's
just<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.220> doesn't<00:03:32.489> seem<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:32.940> happen<00:03:33.269> like<00:03:33.750> it

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
just it doesn't seem to happen like it

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.500 
just it doesn't seem to happen like it
just<00:03:34.829> they<00:03:35.010> throw<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.459> ball<00:03:35.609> directly<00:03:36.090> at<00:03:36.329> my

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
just they throw the ball directly at my

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.569 
just they throw the ball directly at my
guys<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:36.959> they<00:03:37.109> just<00:03:37.350> don't<00:03:37.650> catch<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.370> I

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
guys and they just don't catch it and I

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:39.890 
guys and they just don't catch it and I
know<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.790> lot<00:03:38.880> of<00:03:39.030> you<00:03:39.209> are<00:03:39.299> saying<00:03:39.510> you<00:03:39.600> have<00:03:39.870> to

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
know a lot of you are saying you have to

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.140 
know a lot of you are saying you have to
use<00:03:40.230> or<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:40.500> have<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.859> user<00:03:41.069> it<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.850> should

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
use or you have to user it you should

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.440 
use or you have to user it you should
not<00:03:42.359> have<00:03:42.420> to<00:03:42.810> user<00:03:43.319> a<00:03:43.680> player<00:03:44.160> who<00:03:44.609> is<00:03:44.639> open

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
not have to user a player who is open

the<00:03:45.720> ball<00:03:45.930> being<00:03:46.170> thrown<00:03:46.230> to<00:03:46.859> him<00:03:46.889> basically<00:03:47.639> I

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
the ball being thrown to him basically I

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.789 
the ball being thrown to him basically I
mean<00:03:48.389> that<00:03:48.540> is<00:03:48.690> just<00:03:48.720> crazy<00:03:49.200> I<00:03:49.440> don't

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
mean that is just crazy I don't

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.229 
mean that is just crazy I don't
understand<00:03:50.310> how<00:03:50.370> this<00:03:50.519> game<00:03:50.670> could<00:03:50.850> possibly

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
understand how this game could possibly

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.660 
understand how this game could possibly
justify<00:03:51.450> that<00:03:52.019> but<00:03:52.709> you<00:03:53.010> know<00:03:53.130> it<00:03:53.310> is<00:03:53.459> what<00:03:53.489> it

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
justify that but you know it is what it

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.520 
justify that but you know it is what it
is<00:03:53.760> i<00:03:54.000> guess<00:03:54.060> at<00:03:54.329> this<00:03:54.420> point<00:03:54.540> i<00:03:54.780> need<00:03:55.139> to<00:03:55.230> start

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
is i guess at this point i need to start

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.379 
is i guess at this point i need to start
trying<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:56.069> use<00:03:56.340> her<00:03:56.519> more<00:03:56.850> when<00:03:56.880> they<00:03:57.150> throw

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
trying to use her more when they throw

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.509 
trying to use her more when they throw
the<00:03:57.540> ball<00:03:57.720> at<00:03:57.930> my<00:03:58.109> defense<00:03:58.530> even<00:03:58.739> i<00:03:59.040> just

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
the ball at my defense even i just

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:00.559 
the ball at my defense even i just
always<00:03:59.700> feel<00:03:59.940> like<00:04:00.000> i'm<00:04:00.239> gonna<00:04:00.359> make<00:04:00.510> a

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
always feel like i'm gonna make a

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.229 
always feel like i'm gonna make a
mistake<00:04:01.019> if<00:04:01.230> I<00:04:01.350> try<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.680> do<00:04:01.799> that<00:04:01.829> and<00:04:02.239> it

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
mistake if I try and do that and it

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.240 
mistake if I try and do that and it
costs<00:04:04.019> me<00:04:04.170> like<00:04:04.380> on<00:04:04.530> that<00:04:04.680> play<00:04:04.889> there<00:04:05.220> I

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
costs me like on that play there I

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.009 
costs me like on that play there I
probably<00:04:05.730> could<00:04:06.150> have<00:04:06.180> stepped<00:04:06.510> in<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:06.810> tried

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
probably could have stepped in and tried

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.569 
probably could have stepped in and tried
to<00:04:07.049> intercept<00:04:07.470> it<00:04:07.650> but<00:04:07.799> I<00:04:07.859> thought<00:04:08.100> my<00:04:08.250> guy<00:04:08.400> was

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
to intercept it but I thought my guy was

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.220 
to intercept it but I thought my guy was
there<00:04:08.819> and<00:04:09.060> it<00:04:09.329> ends<00:04:09.600> up<00:04:09.720> that<00:04:09.750> my<00:04:09.989> opponent

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
there and it ends up that my opponent

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.840 
there and it ends up that my opponent
gets<00:04:10.440> a<00:04:10.620> field<00:04:10.859> goal<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.190> end<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.519> first<00:04:11.670> half

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
gets a field goal to end the first half

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.390 
gets a field goal to end the first half
and<00:04:12.209> he<00:04:12.989> is<00:04:13.139> playing<00:04:13.350> this<00:04:13.620> read<00:04:13.859> option<00:04:14.040> now

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
and he is playing this read option now

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.849 
and he is playing this read option now
pretty<00:04:14.760> tough<00:04:15.030> as<00:04:15.299> you<00:04:15.630> can<00:04:15.930> see<00:04:16.139> he<00:04:16.350> is<00:04:16.380> pretty

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
pretty tough as you can see he is pretty

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.890 
pretty tough as you can see he is pretty
much<00:04:16.979> user<00:04:17.340> in<00:04:17.609> a<00:04:17.729> defensive<00:04:18.269> lineman<00:04:18.510> or<00:04:18.840> a

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
much user in a defensive lineman or a

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.930 
much user in a defensive lineman or a
player<00:04:19.200> who's<00:04:19.470> blitzing<00:04:20.039> every<00:04:20.430> single<00:04:20.760> play

player who's blitzing every single play
and<00:04:21.180> he's<00:04:21.269> pretty<00:04:21.450> much<00:04:21.630> just<00:04:21.750> like<00:04:21.930> sprinting

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
and he's pretty much just like sprinting

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.990 
and he's pretty much just like sprinting

basically<00:05:36.229> into<00:05:36.620> triple<00:05:36.950> coverage<00:05:36.979> both<00:05:37.580> of

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
basically into triple coverage both of

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.969 
basically into triple coverage both of
my<00:05:37.940> Safety's<00:05:38.390> were<00:05:38.570> there<00:05:38.750> and<00:05:38.930> I<00:05:39.200> was<00:05:39.380> using<00:05:39.650> a

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
my Safety's were there and I was using a

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:41.920 
my Safety's were there and I was using a
guy<00:05:40.160> that<00:05:40.370> was<00:05:40.490> really<00:05:40.729> close<00:05:41.000> there<00:05:41.390> so<00:05:41.900> I

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
guy that was really close there so I

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.450 
guy that was really close there so I
don't<00:05:42.290> understand<00:05:42.740> why<00:05:42.860> these<00:05:42.919> people<00:05:43.040> make

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
don't understand why these people make

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.790 
don't understand why these people make
these<00:05:43.640> passes<00:05:44.150> but<00:05:44.360> I<00:05:44.630> guess<00:05:45.169> I'm<00:05:45.350> not<00:05:45.380> immune

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
these passes but I guess I'm not immune

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.560 
these passes but I guess I'm not immune
to<00:05:45.830> him<00:05:46.070> either<00:05:46.220> I<00:05:46.340> throw<00:05:46.640> picks<00:05:46.850> from<00:05:47.180> time<00:05:47.419> to

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
seems like people just do it over and

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.560 
seems like people just do it over and
over<00:06:06.110> again<00:06:06.380> and<00:06:06.560> I<00:06:06.979> don't<00:06:07.340> know<00:06:07.460> why<00:06:07.700> it's<00:06:08.300> so

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
over again and I don't know why it's so

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.080 
over again and I don't know why it's so

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
effective but they really really changed

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.450
