 about the most interesting news from the world 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.990
 design and architecture 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.939
 look student architect Tyler short 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.949
 developed mechanical blinds 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.900
 who change their position in 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.210
 depending on the position of the sun in 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.130
 during the day as in vertical 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.559
 blinds that are hung in the rooms 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.489
 shading system will hang front 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.710
 us on the street 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.510

 depending on the position of the sun on 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.100
 horizon also she will be able 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:46.679
 serve your top to create 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.350
 horizontal shadow from high after 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:51.690
 lunch sun this project was 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.089
 designed to offer mechanical 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.570
 problem solving which in urban 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.670
 the environment often cannot be solved by static 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:03.649
 architectural components looks like 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.649
 really very fast punk 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.670
 Germans from the creative studio florale 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.450
 Apparently it became quite boring and they decided 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.130
 turn 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.380
 Of a wide helped in this various 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.939
 objects ranging from lunar craters and 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.979
 ending with female breasts 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.380
 to form various objects on 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.570
 4d technology was used on the screen 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.369
 cinema each letter calls separately 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.270
 the emotion turned out pretty bright and 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.670
 unusually 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.670
 Well oh, those Germans 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.670
 artists amaze us again 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.010
 alien but surely 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.440
 gorgeous janet installations 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.660
 stepfather and arinka damn creative director 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.840
 google third plan is designed and 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.880
 interactive exposure in the sky seven hundred 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.700
 forty five feet of airspace 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.850
 between buildings shimmer and shine 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.950
 bright colors illuminating the urban landscape 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.530
 Still next to the installation of embedded 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.730
 dynamic digital adapters which 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.980
 allow visitors 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.290
 participate creating a sculpture with 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.720
 using their smartphones, guests can 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.060
 draw bright rays of light small 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.430
 line drawn on the smartphone screen 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.980
 can stretch almost a hundred feet 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.170
 the sky and the ability to manage the sculpture 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.740
 attracts a huge amount of it 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.200
 of tourists 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:27.110
 installation costs to open 30 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:29.330
 anniversary of ted conference and continue 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.550
 until March 22 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.390
 then the creators want to take her to 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.420
 other cities 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:40.630
 yes rafi she doesn't give italian 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.290
 designer eugenia marburg created 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.090
 high-tech micro plant 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.220
 using a wide range of shoes 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.260
 which customers can design themselves 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.570
 and modify online 3d 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.340
 printer prints shoe frame and other 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.230
 elements of a series of connecting 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.810
 holes to be easier then 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.780
 all connect me just wondering what 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.670
 this thought occurred to me so 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.150
 there is dohrena money i don't know where to go 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:11.060
 can be put in the necessary technology is not 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:12.470
 i have put in 3d shoe printer designer 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.480
 explained that all this may be 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.980
 an example of how young developers 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.230
 can use digital technology 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.230
 to create your own products 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.599
 Shukhov Tower in Moscow has long been considered 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.300
 Russian counterpart and filmai towers and 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.970
 a group of architects recently turned to 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.480
 Vladimir Putin to save 160 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:38.299
 meter towers built in 1922 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.790
 django incline and photographer richard couples 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.500
 which are considered expert matters 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.750
 Soviet architecture in an open letter 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.879
 claims that the tower is 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.040
 unique contribution of Russian engineering 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:52.099
 genius and a significant part of the heritage 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.709
 Moscow world value Shukhov tower 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.239
 confirm the exposure and layouts on 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.329
 prestigious architectural exhibitions 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.310
 Europe of the last years if our release is not 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.920
 late then you yourself can sign 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.319
 such a petition going to the site change.org 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:11.690
 to stop the dismantling of the masterpiece 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:13.730
 Vladimir Shukhov to the rear of seoul parks 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.650
 kinetic interactive appeared 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.970
 the sculpture is easier said appeared 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.940
 which pool you can manage 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.590
 hand every move 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.510
 determined by the established 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.400
 kinect device that responds to 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.289
 change of body position in space 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.120
 data obtained by the engine and 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:31.190
 coupling arm help 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.229
 determine the tilt angle while with water and 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.570
 the amount of water online 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.729
 installation author tried to convey the idea 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.130
 that we find it very difficult to control our 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:43.090
 strength and often we do not even guess 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.090
 what are we capable of 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.020
