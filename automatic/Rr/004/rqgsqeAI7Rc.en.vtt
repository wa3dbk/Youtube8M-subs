young children are produced in ways that
are<00:00:32.070> very<00:00:32.219> simple<00:00:32.669> both<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.420> language<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.079> in

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
look and what we wanted to do was to do

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.549 
look and what we wanted to do was to do
something<00:00:45.890> that<00:00:46.890> was<00:00:47.040> much<00:00:47.280> more<00:00:47.610> complex

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
something that was much more complex

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.670 
something that was much more complex
where<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:50.160> story<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:51.059> not<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:51.750> much<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
where the story is not so much in the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.530 
where the story is not so much in the
words<00:00:52.890> as<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.730> pictures<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:56.149> we<00:00:57.149> were

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
words as in the pictures and we were

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.229 
words as in the pictures and we were
trying<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.840> create<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.739> book<00:00:59.250> which<00:00:59.520> would<00:00:59.760> be<00:00:59.969> a

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
trying to create a book which would be a

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.249 
trying to create a book which would be a
real<00:01:00.719> favorite<00:01:01.320> for<00:01:01.800> very<00:01:02.700> young<00:01:02.790> children

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:03.259 
real favorite for very young children

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:08.719 
real favorite for very young children
but<00:01:04.259> also<00:01:04.469> something<00:01:05.600> because<00:01:06.600> as<00:01:06.869> parents<00:01:07.859> we

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
but also something because as parents we

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.830 
but also something because as parents we
both<00:01:08.969> were<00:01:09.509> very<00:01:09.539> fed<00:01:10.079> up<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:11.450> having<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.689> read

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
both were very fed up of having to read

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.120 
both were very fed up of having to read
books<00:01:13.109> over<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.530> over<00:01:13.679> and<00:01:13.799> again<00:01:14.009> which

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
books over and over and again which

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.800 
books over and over and again which
didn't<00:01:14.459> really<00:01:14.639> have<00:01:14.850> much<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.329> there<00:01:15.569> for<00:01:15.779> us

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
didn't really have much in there for us

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.840 
didn't really have much in there for us
so<00:01:16.350> we<00:01:16.529> were<00:01:16.649> trying<00:01:16.859> to<00:01:17.039> create<00:01:17.520> something

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
so we were trying to create something

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.739 
so we were trying to create something
that<00:01:18.299> would<00:01:19.170> entertain<00:01:19.889> a<00:01:20.069> child<00:01:20.749> entertain

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:21.749 
that would entertain a child entertain

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:23.239 
that would entertain a child entertain
the<00:01:21.869> parent<00:01:22.289> as<00:01:22.439> well<00:01:22.469> so<00:01:22.829> that<00:01:22.979> they<00:01:23.100> would

00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:23.249 
the parent as well so that they would

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:25.999 
the parent as well so that they would
want<00:01:23.399> to<00:01:23.579> read<00:01:23.789> it<00:01:23.999> and<00:01:24.869> also<00:01:25.020> there's<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.859> lot

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
want to read it and also there's a lot

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.080 
want to read it and also there's a lot
of<00:01:26.159> space<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:26.999> book<00:01:27.209> for<00:01:29.090> conversation

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
of space in the book for conversation

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.589 
of space in the book for conversation
between<00:01:31.130> child's<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.399> parents<00:01:32.969> to<00:01:33.209> talk

00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:33.599 
between child's and the parents to talk

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:35.239 
between child's and the parents to talk
about<00:01:33.779> what's<00:01:34.109> going<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.499> in<00:01:34.679> the<00:01:34.770> pictures

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:35.249 
about what's going on in the pictures

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:38.230 
about what's going on in the pictures
what's<00:01:35.999> happening<00:01:36.599> what<00:01:36.779> might<00:01:37.049> be<00:01:37.259> happening

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
what's happening what might be happening

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.399 
what's happening what might be happening
about<00:01:39.240> characters<00:01:39.929> that<00:01:40.139> are<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
about characters that are in the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.859 
about characters that are in the
pictures<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:42.319> we<00:01:43.319> were<00:01:43.829> very<00:01:44.009> much<00:01:44.569> trying<00:01:45.569> to

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
pictures so we were very much trying to

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.459 
pictures so we were very much trying to
make<00:01:46.349> something<00:01:47.479> that<00:01:48.479> would<00:01:48.659> last<00:01:49.109> a<00:01:49.319> long

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
make something that would last a long

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:52.370 
make something that would last a long
time<00:01:50.240> with<00:01:51.240> very<00:01:51.479> few<00:01:51.749> words<00:01:51.929> so<00:01:52.109> you<00:01:52.139> can

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
time with very few words so you can

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.769 
time with very few words so you can
either<00:01:52.499> read<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.919> very<00:01:53.130> very<00:01:53.369> quickly<00:01:53.669> or<00:01:54.659> you

00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:54.779 
either read it very very quickly or you

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:56.870 
either read it very very quickly or you
can<00:01:54.959> read<00:01:55.109> it<00:01:55.229> very<00:01:55.380> slowly<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.429> pictures

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
can read it very slowly and the pictures

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.229 
can read it very slowly and the pictures
are<00:01:57.090> quite<00:01:57.810> complex<00:01:58.399> but<00:01:59.399> then<00:01:59.669> I<00:01:59.909> think<00:02:00.090> it's

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:00.239 
are quite complex but then I think it's

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:02.889 
are quite complex but then I think it's
a<00:02:00.359> mistake<00:02:00.749> that<00:02:00.779> we<00:02:01.109> all<00:02:01.259> make<00:02:01.499> that<00:02:01.529> children

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
a mistake that we all make that children

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.210 
a mistake that we all make that children
don't<00:02:03.899> have<00:02:04.229> very<00:02:04.639> simple<00:02:07.039> imaginations<00:02:08.039> they

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
don't have very simple imaginations they

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.670 
don't have very simple imaginations they
have<00:02:08.430> absolutely<00:02:09.180> massive<00:02:09.420> imaginations<00:02:10.320> and

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
have absolutely massive imaginations and

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.880 
have absolutely massive imaginations and
go<00:02:11.550> off<00:02:11.610> on<00:02:11.940> incredible

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
go off on incredible

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.300 
go off on incredible
flights<00:02:13.069> of<00:02:13.310> fancy<00:02:13.520> and<00:02:14.480> are<00:02:14.600> quite<00:02:15.310> complex

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
flights of fancy and are quite complex

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.809 
flights of fancy and are quite complex
in<00:02:16.760> their<00:02:17.060> imaginings<00:02:17.810> really<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:19.700> know

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
in their imaginings really and you know

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.309 
in their imaginings really and you know
it's<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.030> only<00:02:20.180> age<00:02:20.450> where<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:20.959> actually

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
it's the only age where you actually

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.840 
it's the only age where you actually
have<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.680> luxury<00:02:22.069> to<00:02:22.340> really<00:02:22.670> indulge

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
have the luxury to really indulge
