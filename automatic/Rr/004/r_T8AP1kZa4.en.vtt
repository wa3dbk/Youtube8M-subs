00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.130
 v 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:12.320
 hello to all lost boys 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.249
 on the bus and also with a little delay 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:20.050
 the trailer analysis of the new ok that will be on February 12 superstar 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.810
 finally put lizzani spy 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.500
 let's start immediately to see the trailer to communicate 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.039
 love 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.109
 here is day and I'm already here too 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:37.380
 because he is using olive tree 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.910
 why 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.470
 probably given that the license is denied to ahli mental insanity 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.420
 calavera dealing with ghosts 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.270
 since it is luino 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.040
 to me 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.219
 noxae will u be these two viscose news too I never used it 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.290
 I forget what it's called the l 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.210
 sandwich see guys 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.150
 then 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.150
 eu and i as wand it 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.530
 as it is the prerogative of the character in itself has always had that at night is 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.920
 the ghost arrived the ghost of a friend of her sister what it was 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.500
 open gainer avola 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.700
 I'm sure s mt-5 is 8 beta we are not where misfits 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.000
 siguen of 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.079
 we have a 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:23.510
 sort of bonus 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.520
 for health 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.570
 that is, we do not get scared easily because we are not afraid of dog dogs 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.230
 - and enzo 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.700
 other people . ok 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.820
 so I didn't understand why alice mail habbo text is fabulous especially 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.200
 then this is the interesting thing 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.640
 anna ok how must see u sleep is wearing a hat 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.000
 or just a bush 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.930
 in your head as never before 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.930
 what makes me think is that it serves as a disguise for hiding 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.190
 so probably the monsters and the details are probably gods 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.350
 hooola. own ghosts 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.700
 that if they don't see us they can't attack us 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.700
 so if not we hide ourselves. in a bush 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:14.589
 in this way 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:17.989
 probably the ghosts pass let us alone 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.989
 then let's go ahead have added a new character that makes me laugh 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.200
 a lot is called saya &amp; b salento an ex 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:29.570
 the member usl of those written 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.759
 writing vs and here written of salento 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:37.229
 was his things are can not not talk has problems staying alive 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:40.869
 to stay alive 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:44.719
 wind iphone inter probably the most difficult character to use 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:51.249
 I have no ras 30db of heart me2 of stomach I will not know this skillfully 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:54.109
 a very very difficult character to use 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.519
 but what do you think I certainly don't use it will be for the release 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.649
 echo another thing 

00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:01.959
 as you can see why 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.049
 here 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.669
 despite being from 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:07.849
 of wine when we apply something makes the bikes 

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:10.679
 which monster 

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:12.519
 here then 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.239
 precious will remain silent make me hear noises at home at night 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.200
 probably the night will be a thing 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.369
 crazy much more profilia 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:26.909
 of the other boring nights that I always said of death that palate nothing happens 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.909
 well now think again 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:35.499
 note this hand 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.719
 I don't know the monster of the night 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:41.719
 hands are the pranks too 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:45.069
 then 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.069
 took something pick up dark swords 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.999
 dark on word 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:52.309
 then 

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:55.309
 roby me will be new weapons finally 

00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:58.599
 because it probably scratches you 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.939
 we will need to fight the ghosts 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.619
 that other co what this is 

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:08.619
 it is something that is gathered 

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:11.029
 or let's go 

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:12.809
 I don't know it seems 

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:14.469
 watching 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:18.539
 unipa ecco vedi d'ax bordighera sword fantasy mail cool 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:23.009
 also this looks like a ceas play tetris an armor I made of the same 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:24.970
 first room material collects 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.900
 go parma 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.879
 bet armor probably 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:32.219

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:35.219

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.889

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.370

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:45.419
 ghosts 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.430
 probably this way you buy power to control the ghosts that 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.490
 it would be so beautiful 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.030
 the moments when you get the nyt armor lalla d'ax wordlo only one 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.390
