00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.040
 Hi guys all good 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.689
 so I came to record a little bit today 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.239
 different from what you've seen here in the 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:25.050
 channel I came to give some tips only to 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:26.130
 Who wants to start recording? 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.520
 videos right 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.690
 here is a channel on youtube and I 'm not 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.660
 The expert in this matter on the subject I have 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.150
 about eight months or so in this world 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.440
 from youtube and I came to tell you a little about 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.260
 my differences to whoever is 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.670
 starting is to have some tips because 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.670
 as well as many other bloggers already 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.220
 are as well as their experience they 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.130
 They also did not have and I myself did 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.590
 thing I at first I had experience 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.570
 None so I had to go after 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.030
 run behind video I think this is 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.589
 important and I came to record today 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.299
 talk some tips to you 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.780
 Good folks, I 'm not going to talk. 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.329
 in detail 12 prey to vote the title 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.369
 there are ten tips to start recording 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.770
 video I'm going to talk and tell some 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.710
 of my experiences as well and then 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.999
 come on 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.329
 I think the first thing that has to 

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:26.310
 do before turning the camera on is to think 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:28.170
 well if that's what you like because 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.030
 It's no use turning on the camera. 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.850
 shy and unable to express herself 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.509
 right and do something just for 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.429
 modinha or because he wants to make money is 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:41.069
 main point is this before you start 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:44.399
 to record the video you have to realize 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:46.560
 and understand that everyone starts at the 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.719
 beginning the obvious mind right? 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.689
 none of the walnut trees that are today 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:53.340
 super famous cells did not start not 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.590
 They had an overnight it 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.240
 It takes time for a teacher to know the 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.149
 company knows itself 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.859
 so it's a thing that takes time is not 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.249
 something on a channel today, tomorrow it's going 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:04.480
 evening 

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:06.580
 Do you know what he said? 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.980
 to know is not so it works you have 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.260
 to put this in your head to a 

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:14.980
 parentheses now is that I started a 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.310
 channel 12 years ago I think I like it 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.160
 two videos I think and I stayed 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.190
 desperate I think I do more 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.310
 two years ago about four years ago and I 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.490
 caracas and the two visit kind you know no 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.620
 gave no display of a writing 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.300
 because it's because I was ashamed of 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.300
 show to my friends for mine 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.250
 relatives and his seal showed him 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.080
 I was just on YouTube as I was a 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.530
 then it was not in the 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.380
 recommendations not tava had no right not 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.150
 there was none I ended up giving up 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.420
 because I thought this happened from 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.070
 day to night but then people who neither 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.650
 I said this is a thing that takes time 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.570
 have to take several steps as soon as 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.930
 what to start has to focus has to 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.580
 dedicate for beauty but not for 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.020
 starts making a channel thinking about 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.570
 work is money that will win 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.100
 product for review 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.380
 people who knew part of several 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.709
 groups on facebook and a lot of people that 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.140
 start and only to win 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.480
 companies and to make a review two 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.050
 daughters because only if the ugliest thing 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.730
 here in the world and something else you have to 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.010
 do something because you do not like it 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.360
 waiting for something in return I record the 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.220
 videos here because I feel good myself 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.440
 I like this and all this part of 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.450
 communication, I identify myself a lot then 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.520
 can see in the first videos of the channel 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.800
 I 've never been ashamed to know how to speak or 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.450
 had not I think it has a lot of 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.010
 people watching me and or so record 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.010
 I feel good doing this, there are those who have 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.110
 shame I give a very tip 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.030
 interesting healthy people and I always put 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.130
 my camera does not have that look 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.350
 that I had seen to be able to look and 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.870
 inspired the camera so I stayed 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.510
 looking for true mirror many times or 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.130
 to the camera and everything has to talk 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.010
 Do not think about the air, my God, 80 people. 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.560
 represents according to the camera the type 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.330
 if you need only none 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.150
 It is to know the camera side look 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.920
 down and to the sides know and this goes 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.989
 Give you more courage so I could look 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.989
 forward and really from the camera and 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.310
 I was able to focus and talk and know another. 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.320
 Also, I see a lot of people 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.389
 speaking not only on this October issue 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.100
 but in other things it is also shame 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.020
 of friends shame because people 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.380
 who know you from other people in the 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.930
 good city talk know go river or whatever 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.790
 what we know is interested is much 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.530
 bullshit I thought as I already said that 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.120
 I was too ashamed to disclose 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.250
 disclosed did not leave the minimum of 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.440
 people and in my parents did not know 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.600
 nobody in my family knew only me 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.250
 I even caught it see the video only 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.260
 so it became known that no one stays 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.910
 knowing and know the second time that I 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.370
 I decided to record a video I thought 'not me 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.720
 I'm going to record, I'm going to invest, it 's something. 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.160
 that I like to do 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.350
 Do you know I want to share with 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.300
 You all the things that I know, I guess. 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.340
 that this is cool for those who like it is a 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.280
 Fantastic thing, people, I sure want. 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.380
 To form this work I 'm going to have to 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.630
 have a lot of dedication for this I will have 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.300
 I try hard for this but it's 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.340
 This is what I want and it's no use, it's not 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.610
 give up because they do not display the 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:18.990
 people do not give up because I started type 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.520
 or 0 is very few people at the beginning of 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.620
 series because people do not know each other 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.810
 even more the owner does not share with the 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:29.220
 People then the method of dissemination 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:32.940
 so for people to know is 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:35.729
 to publicize in groups is to judge in their 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.860
 facebook same twitter all your 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.900
 social networks and friends will do with 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.639
 creativity will pass their friends 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.430
 and so it goes on so the channel goes 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:46.470
 growing up but remember that it is not the day 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.539
 To night people this takes time to 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.669
 start growing 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:53.520
 My channel is now with a thousand and 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:55.860
 nearly 1300 subscribers and this took time 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.419
 People are not 100 from day to night so 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.370
 just when the channel 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.229
 Growing up and something for you. 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.080
 they will not give up on you 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:06.720
 really like tap is also to do 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.580
 record video or blog alike makes thinking 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.320
 which is something that you like that is a 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.969
 thing that I like to do, I'll do 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.099
 Prague 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:14.809
 the other person is obvious that we are going 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:17.449
 want content that serves some purpose 

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:18.979
 way or someone else but I will not 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:21.229
 do something I do not like to do 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:24.049
 Just because it's fashionable, I guess. 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:25.519
 the main thing is you do it yourself 

00:06:24.049 --> 00:06:28.759
 does not think about others 

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:30.499
 and another thing is also a lot of people 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:31.459
 who wanted channel by inspiration of 

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:34.369
 other people 

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:36.199
 Obviously, I've watched a lot of people. 

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:38.989
 to watch mostly animals 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:41.149
 star since forever since the rate 

00:06:38.989 --> 00:06:43.009
 It is also clear that we thought I would go. 

00:06:41.149 --> 00:06:45.529
 record sells because they are people 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:47.209
 Great, I really admire her work . 

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:49.309
 if I really like the work then they 

00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:51.709
 I breathe in it but spying is a 

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:54.019
 thing to copy all the videos they 

00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:56.329
 they do is totally something else then the 

00:06:54.019 --> 00:06:59.149
 first thing is whether you do because 

00:06:56.329 --> 00:07:02.149
 Do you like it, do not change your way, will not it? 

00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:04.249
 Hi, people, why? 

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:07.729
 the way you're going to see it goes 

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:10.339
 give a super huge result and you will 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:12.139
 recommend you say that you are sure 

00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:13.999
 then it is that we expect much 

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:15.649
 You liked this video I was there. 

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:17.449
 time wanting to do your paper waiting 

00:07:15.649 --> 00:07:19.249
 because I was sure a lot of people come 

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:21.199
 down here comment everything just 

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:22.699
 time have no experience but 

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:25.729
 I wanted to tell my experience that 

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:27.379
 I had until today to this day and the 

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:29.479
 that I spent what I think about who 

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:31.279
 is beginning to record videos and then 

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:32.839
 That's it, I really hope that you guys 

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:34.369
 have enjoyed the video if you 

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:37.159

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:41.449
 has video every week and will soon have 

00:07:39.649 --> 00:07:43.249
 some news still does not register 

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:45.049
 on the channel comment here too 

00:07:43.249 --> 00:07:49.209
