10<00:01:51.509> Bank<00:01:51.689> is<00:01:51.840> easier<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.670> basically<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:54.420> can

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
10 Bank is easier and basically you can

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.399 
10 Bank is easier and basically you can
slide<00:01:55.110> these<00:01:55.259> little<00:01:55.500> circles<00:01:55.950> up<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:57.409> create

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
slide these little circles up and create

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.770 
slide these little circles up and create
your<00:01:58.680> equalizer<00:01:59.280> now<00:02:00.149> if<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.450> don't<00:02:00.570> know<00:02:00.689> how

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
your equalizer now if you don't know how

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.959 
your equalizer now if you don't know how
you<00:02:00.869> Colossus<00:02:01.290> work<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:02.729> left<00:02:02.969> side<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:04.969> bass

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
you Colossus work the left side is bass

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.819 
you Colossus work the left side is bass
frequencies<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.930> get<00:02:07.079> into<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.380> midst<00:02:07.710> and

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
frequencies you get into the midst and

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.550 
frequencies you get into the midst and
about<00:02:08.009> right<00:02:08.340> here<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.819> then

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
about right here and then

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.750 
about right here and then
from<00:02:09.920> about<00:02:10.160> 4,000<00:02:10.789> 16,000<00:02:11.450> is<00:02:12.250> high<00:02:13.250> treble

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
from about 4,000 16,000 is high treble

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.850 
from about 4,000 16,000 is high treble
frequencies<00:02:13.910> so<00:02:14.900> this<00:02:15.140> would<00:02:15.260> be<00:02:15.350> like<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.560> bass

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
frequencies so this would be like a bass

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.700 
frequencies so this would be like a bass
heavy<00:02:16.730> equalizer<00:02:17.270> right<00:02:17.390> here<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:17.990> so<00:02:18.410> that's

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
heavy equalizer right here and so that's

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.470 
heavy equalizer right here and so that's
going<00:02:19.040> to<00:02:19.130> have<00:02:19.250> out<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.460> bass<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:20.240> can

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
going to have out the bass you can

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.090 
going to have out the bass you can
listen<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.930> music<00:02:21.020> while<00:02:21.410> you<00:02:21.560> screw<00:02:22.070> with

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
listen to music while you screw with

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.590 
listen to music while you screw with
these<00:02:22.310> settings<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:22.880> you<00:02:22.940> can<00:02:23.150> get<00:02:23.390> a

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
these settings and so you can get a

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.630 
these settings and so you can get a
sound<00:02:24.140> that<00:02:24.320> you<00:02:24.380> like<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:24.860> once<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:25.520> have<00:02:25.610> a

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
sound that you like and once you have a

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.680 
sound that you like and once you have a
sound<00:02:25.790> that<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.030> like<00:02:26.209> you<00:02:26.360> want<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.570> hit

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
sound that you like you want to hit

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.930 
sound that you like you want to hit
command<00:02:26.870> s<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.440> state<00:02:27.680> it<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:28.310> can<00:02:28.459> name<00:02:28.640> it<00:02:28.670> I

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
command s to state it you can name it I

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.790 
command s to state it you can name it I
name<00:02:29.120> my<00:02:29.390> default<00:02:29.750> one<00:02:29.930> system<00:02:30.230> you<00:02:30.350> Cuba<00:02:30.709> were

name my default one system you Cuba were

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.330 
name my default one system you Cuba were
just<00:02:30.950> gonna<00:02:31.100> name<00:02:31.220> this<00:02:31.340> one<00:02:31.520> example<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:33.340> I

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
just gonna name this one example and I

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.620 
just gonna name this one example and I

once that's ready we'll just show you an

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.320 
once that's ready we'll just show you an
example<00:02:42.310> we<00:02:43.310> can<00:02:43.459> see<00:02:43.580> audio<00:02:43.880> is<00:02:44.030> running

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
example we can see audio is running

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.160 
example we can see audio is running
through<00:02:44.870> here<00:02:46.720> through<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.780> input<00:02:48.050> and

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
through here through the input and

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.900 
through here through the input and
output<00:02:48.230> right<00:02:48.590> there<00:02:48.739> and<00:02:50.500> so<00:02:51.500> one<00:02:52.459> final

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
output right there and so one final

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.540 
output right there and so one final
thing<00:02:53.450> or<00:02:53.900> two<00:02:54.440> final<00:02:54.739> things<00:02:54.920> actually<00:02:55.160> you

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
thing or two final things actually you

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.880 
thing or two final things actually you
can<00:02:55.700> hit<00:02:55.880> au<00:02:56.150> lab<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:56.750> preferences<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.830> can

can hit au lab and preferences you can

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.280 
can hit au lab and preferences you can
go<00:02:58.100> to<00:02:58.160> documents<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:59.030> so<00:02:59.630> each<00:02:59.930> time<00:03:00.170> you
