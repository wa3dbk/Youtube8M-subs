I mean of course like in the previous

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.960 
I mean of course like in the previous
GTA's<00:01:04.589> when<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.890> beat<00:01:05.100> up<00:01:05.250> someone<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.700> dare

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
GTA's when you beat up someone you dare

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.670 
GTA's when you beat up someone you dare
cash<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.420> course<00:01:06.450> comes<00:01:06.930> visible<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.590> then

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
cash of course comes visible and then

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.500 
cash of course comes visible and then
you<00:01:07.770> just<00:01:07.920> like<00:01:08.100> run<00:01:08.340> over<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:08.970> basically

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
you just like run over it and basically

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.690 
you just like run over it and basically
collect<00:01:10.170> their<00:01:10.380> money<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:10.890> maybe<00:01:11.430> when<00:01:11.610> you

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
collect their money so maybe when you

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.280 
collect their money so maybe when you
kill<00:01:11.880> someone<00:01:12.150> they<00:01:12.330> drop<00:01:12.570> their<00:01:12.720> credit<00:01:13.080> card
