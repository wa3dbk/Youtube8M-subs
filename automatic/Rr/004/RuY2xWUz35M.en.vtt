the DP chip fitted we just went for a

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.730 
the DP chip fitted we just went for a
simple<00:02:18.880> test<00:02:19.090> drive<00:02:19.420> we<00:02:19.900> had<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.410> laptop

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
simple test drive we had the laptop

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.280 
simple test drive we had the laptop
connected<00:02:21.400> up<00:02:21.520> via<00:02:21.850> a<00:02:21.970> USB<00:02:22.210> cable<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:23.140> the

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
chip actually in series so we could do

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.280 
chip actually in series so we could do
live<00:02:27.400> adjustments<00:02:28.210> while<00:02:28.420> we<00:02:28.570> were<00:02:28.630> driving

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
this really is also in the end about

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.580 
this really is also in the end about
their<00:02:34.240> performance<00:02:34.840> but<00:02:35.080> when<00:02:35.200> you<00:02:35.320> get<00:02:35.440> more

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
their performance but when you get more

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.620 
their performance but when you get more
performance<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:36.280> get<00:02:36.460> the<00:02:36.580> cutting<00:02:36.790> edge<00:02:37.060> you

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
performance and get the cutting edge you

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.690 
performance and get the cutting edge you
have<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.990> be<00:02:38.110> very<00:02:38.320> very<00:02:38.470> careful<00:02:38.800> so<00:02:39.550> we

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
have to be very very careful so we

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.360 
have to be very very careful so we

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
we're looking at doing is actually

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.960 
we're looking at doing is actually
getting<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.440> injector<00:03:03.010> needle<00:03:03.700> lift<00:03:03.880> a

getting the injector needle lift a

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.400 
getting the injector needle lift a
little<00:03:04.090> bit<00:03:04.209> higher<00:03:04.480> to<00:03:04.510> get<00:03:04.900> into<00:03:05.080> some<00:03:05.230> more

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
little bit higher to get into some more

volume on the rail side of the system

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.940 
volume on the rail side of the system
we're<00:03:07.840> altering<00:03:08.200> which<00:03:08.560> we'll<00:03:08.709> be<00:03:08.739> including

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
we're altering which we'll be including

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.740 
we're altering which we'll be including
the<00:03:09.340> rail<00:03:09.520> pressure<00:03:09.850> and<00:03:10.120> monitoring<00:03:10.630> that

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
the rail pressure and monitoring that

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.660 
the rail pressure and monitoring that
pressure<00:03:11.050> so<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:11.950> rail<00:03:12.100> pressure<00:03:12.400> in<00:03:12.580> this

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
pressure so the rail pressure in this

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.160 
pressure so the rail pressure in this
vehicle<00:03:12.970> from<00:03:13.390> factory<00:03:13.780> will<00:03:13.870> be<00:03:13.989> going
