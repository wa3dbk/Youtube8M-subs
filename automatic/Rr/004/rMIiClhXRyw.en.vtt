00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.360 

I've<00:00:00.690> never<00:00:01.140> really<00:00:01.560> been<00:00:01.709> interested<00:00:02.040> in

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
I've never really been interested in

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.050 
I've never really been interested in
money

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
money

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.840 
money
and<00:00:03.600> the<00:00:04.140> mechanics<00:00:04.589> of<00:00:04.770> it<00:00:04.920> so<00:00:05.400> it<00:00:05.609> took<00:00:05.790> me

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
and the mechanics of it so it took me

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.670 
and the mechanics of it so it took me
quite<00:00:06.000> a<00:00:06.210> while<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.450> sort<00:00:07.080> of<00:00:07.109> get<00:00:07.319> it<00:00:07.440> I<00:00:07.560> always

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
quite a while to sort of get it I always

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.799 
quite a while to sort of get it I always
thought<00:00:08.210> economics<00:00:09.210> was<00:00:09.330> really<00:00:09.540> complicated

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
thought economics was really complicated

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.180 
thought economics was really complicated
and<00:00:10.380> boring<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:11.690> always<00:00:12.690> cared<00:00:13.110> about<00:00:13.230> nature

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
and boring I always cared about nature

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.359 
and boring I always cared about nature
and<00:00:15.139> environmental<00:00:16.139> issues<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:16.949> couldn't

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
and environmental issues and I couldn't

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.660 
and environmental issues and I couldn't
really<00:00:17.850> understand<00:00:18.529> why<00:00:19.529> we<00:00:19.890> treated<00:00:20.340> you

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
really understand why we treated you

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.099 
really understand why we treated you
know<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.880> plants<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.449> animals<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.020> nature

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
know the plants and animals and nature

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.220 
know the plants and animals and nature
this<00:00:22.410> way<00:00:22.619> because<00:00:23.039> it's<00:00:23.910> very<00:00:24.390> obvious<00:00:24.960> that

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
this way because it's very obvious that

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.120 
this way because it's very obvious that
we<00:00:25.380> need<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:26.070> environment<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:28.019> thought<00:00:28.920> we

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
we need the environment and I thought we

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.220 
we need the environment and I thought we
should<00:00:29.189> really<00:00:30.000> care<00:00:30.330> more<00:00:30.570> about<00:00:30.689> taking

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
should really care more about taking

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.319 
should really care more about taking
care<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.969> keeping<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.090> clean<00:00:33.329> I

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
care of it and keeping it clean I

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.209 
care of it and keeping it clean I
understood<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.600> we<00:00:37.050> wanted<00:00:37.380> some<00:00:37.530> progress

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
understood that we wanted some progress

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.310 
understood that we wanted some progress
and<00:00:38.730> but<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.450> couldn't<00:00:39.750> understand<00:00:40.110> why<00:00:40.260> this

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
and but I couldn't understand why this

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.330 
and but I couldn't understand why this
clash<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.570> happening<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:43.379> saw<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.160> there

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
clash is happening and I saw that there

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.160 
clash is happening and I saw that there
are<00:00:44.460> certain<00:00:44.940> forces<00:00:45.300> sort<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.780> working

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
are certain forces sort of working

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.160 
are certain forces sort of working
behind<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.680> scenes<00:00:46.950> but<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.850> couldn't<00:00:48.570> wrap<00:00:48.960> my

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
behind the scenes but I couldn't wrap my

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.729 
behind the scenes but I couldn't wrap my
brain<00:00:49.200> around<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:50.539> and<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:52.199> couple<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.530> years

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
brain around it and a couple of years

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.619 
brain around it and a couple of years
ago<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.039> friend<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.550> mine<00:00:53.610> mentioned<00:00:54.090> positive

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
ago a friend of mine mentioned positive

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.619 
ago a friend of mine mentioned positive
money<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.020> me<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:56.039> then<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.640> started<00:00:57.449> watching

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
money to me so then I started watching

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.250 
money to me so then I started watching
videos<00:00:58.469> online<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.809> sort<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.870> slowly

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
videos online and sort of slowly

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.609 
videos online and sort of slowly
connecting<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> dots<00:01:03.110> the<00:01:04.110> crucial<00:01:04.589> moment

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
connecting the dots the crucial moment

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.149 
connecting the dots the crucial moment
for<00:01:05.159> me<00:01:05.339> was<00:01:05.939> seeing<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.080> talk<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.650> Michael

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
for me was seeing the talk that Michael

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.190 
for me was seeing the talk that Michael
Rowbotham<00:01:08.990> gave<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.320> Canada<00:01:11.159> Tacoma<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.200> 1999

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
Rowbotham gave in Canada Tacoma in 1999

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.270 
Rowbotham gave in Canada Tacoma in 1999
and<00:01:13.700> it<00:01:14.700> just<00:01:15.650> everything<00:01:16.650> sort<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.920> fell<00:01:17.130> into

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
and it just everything sort of fell into

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.320 
and it just everything sort of fell into
place<00:01:18.290> he<00:01:19.290> connected<00:01:19.860> everything<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.790> cared

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
place he connected everything I cared

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.710 
place he connected everything I cared
about<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:23.250> way<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.790> we<00:01:24.000> create<00:01:24.390> money

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
about to the way that we create money

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.280 
about to the way that we create money
and<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.830> was<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.460> clear<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.119> from<00:01:28.080> then

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
and it was just so clear and from then

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.310 
and it was just so clear and from then
on<00:01:28.670> for<00:01:29.670> me<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.090> just<00:01:30.299> became<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:31.110> most

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
on for me it just became the most

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.160 
on for me it just became the most
important<00:01:31.799> thing<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.100> could<00:01:32.340> trace<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.869> many

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
important thing I could trace so many

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.499 
important thing I could trace so many
different<00:01:34.740> issues<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.400> came<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:36.450> contact

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
different issues that I came in contact

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.170 
different issues that I came in contact
with<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.380> my<00:01:37.530> everyday<00:01:37.799> life<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:39.000> sort<00:01:39.150> of

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
with in my everyday life to sort of

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.980 
with in my everyday life to sort of
trace<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.600> back<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:40.049> money<00:01:40.700> so<00:01:41.700> then<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.299> decided

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
trace it back to money so then I decided

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.649 
trace it back to money so then I decided
I<00:01:43.530> had<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.860> do<00:01:43.979> something<00:01:44.340> about<00:01:44.399> it

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.219 

so<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.689> started<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.320> movement<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:49.890> Croatia

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
so I started this movement in Croatia

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.410 
so I started this movement in Croatia
and<00:01:52.610> it's<00:01:53.610> very<00:01:54.060> very<00:01:54.329> slowly<00:01:54.600> growing<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:56.420> saw

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
and it's very very slowly growing I saw

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.370 
and it's very very slowly growing I saw
I<00:01:57.990> see<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.070> whole<00:01:59.250> situation<00:01:59.939> as<00:02:00.180> if<00:02:00.479> the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
I see this whole situation as if the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.480 
I see this whole situation as if the
world<00:02:01.619> was<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:02.490> big<00:02:02.759> Tupperware<00:02:03.299> box<00:02:03.509> and

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
world was this big Tupperware box and

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.709 
world was this big Tupperware box and
someone<00:02:05.490> sort<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.850> placed<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.450> stone

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
someone sort of placed a stone

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.229 
someone sort of placed a stone
underneath<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.710> on<00:02:07.829> one<00:02:08.039> side<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.970> sort<00:02:09.179> of

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
underneath it on one side and it sort of

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.550 
underneath it on one side and it sort of
tipped<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.629> balance<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:10.110> little<00:02:10.229> bit

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
tipped the balance a little bit

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.010 
tipped the balance a little bit
and<00:02:11.180> everything<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.360> we<00:02:12.450> have<00:02:12.690> sort<00:02:12.989> of

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
and everything that we have sort of

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.470 
and everything that we have sort of
trickles<00:02:13.470> down<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.860> one<00:02:14.040> side<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.790> creates

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
trickles down to one side and creates

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.990 
trickles down to one side and creates
this<00:02:15.720> inequality<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.650> we're<00:02:17.550> being<00:02:17.700> very

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
this inequality and we're being very

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.809 
this inequality and we're being very
clever<00:02:18.630> about<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.590> creative<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.700> we're

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
clever about it and creative and we're

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.420 
clever about it and creative and we're
investing<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.720> lot<00:02:21.989> of<00:02:22.080> energy<00:02:22.470> into<00:02:22.770> fixing

investing a lot of energy into fixing

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.830 
investing a lot of energy into fixing
single<00:02:24.390> issues<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.680> fighting<00:02:26.370> for<00:02:26.700> this<00:02:27.599> or

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
single issues and fighting for this or

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.110 
single issues and fighting for this or
that<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:28.260> trying<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.830> make<00:02:29.160> things<00:02:29.880> more

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
that and trying to make things more

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.740 
that and trying to make things more
equal<00:02:30.510> time<00:02:30.720> trying<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.140> redistribute<00:02:32.510> but<00:02:33.510> I

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
equal time trying to redistribute but I

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.860 
equal time trying to redistribute but I
feel<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:34.500> there's<00:02:34.739> this<00:02:34.920> one<00:02:35.250> thing<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:36.030> we

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
feel that there's this one thing that we

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.070 
feel that there's this one thing that we
could<00:02:37.080> do<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.860> would<00:02:38.209> very<00:02:39.209> simply<00:02:39.810> put

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
could do that would very simply put

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.500 
could do that would very simply put
things<00:02:40.920> back<00:02:41.130> if<00:02:41.400> we<00:02:41.519> could<00:02:41.700> remove<00:02:42.239> that

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
things back if we could remove that

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.170 
things back if we could remove that
little<00:02:42.720> rock<00:02:43.019> and<00:02:43.519> create<00:02:44.519> a<00:02:44.580> flat<00:02:44.880> surface

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
little rock and create a flat surface

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.259 
little rock and create a flat surface
again<00:02:45.690> then<00:02:46.380> I<00:02:46.410> feel<00:02:46.769> that<00:02:47.100> so<00:02:47.610> many<00:02:47.880> different

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
again then I feel that so many different

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.390 
again then I feel that so many different
things<00:02:48.480> would<00:02:48.660> just<00:02:48.870> passively<00:02:49.400> resolve

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
things would just passively resolve

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.570 
things would just passively resolve
themselves<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:51.299> I<00:02:52.260> think<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:53.040> little<00:02:53.280> stone

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
themselves and I think that little stone

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.800 
themselves and I think that little stone
is<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:55.010> money<00:02:56.010> system<00:02:56.280> today<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.540> think

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
is the money system today and I think

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.090 
is the money system today and I think
that<00:02:58.049> together<00:02:58.650> we<00:02:59.099> can<00:02:59.310> change<00:02:59.880> it
