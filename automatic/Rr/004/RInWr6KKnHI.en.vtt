form<00:00:26.990> like<00:00:27.320> in<00:00:27.980> and<00:00:28.189> done<00:00:28.340> with

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.010 

we'll<00:00:32.489> watch<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:32.940> first<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.750> can<00:00:33.900> watch

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
we'll watch this first and you can watch

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:42.930 
we'll watch this first and you can watch
what's<00:00:34.230> going<00:00:34.440> on

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.680 

and<00:00:43.510> then<00:00:43.630> I<00:00:43.660> just<00:00:43.870> stops<00:00:44.250> reading<00:00:45.480> like

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
and then I just stops reading like

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.530 
and then I just stops reading like
like<00:00:48.690> there's<00:00:48.899> not<00:00:49.020> even<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.290> disk<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.620> there

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
like there's not even a disk in there

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.840 
like there's not even a disk in there

and that's a new disc so and I know it's

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.189 
and that's a new disc so and I know it's
not<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.390> discs<00:00:54.750> because<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:56.010> know<00:00:57.199> I've

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.460 

and<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.460> won't<00:01:14.850> watch<00:01:15.080> now<00:01:16.080> if<00:01:16.230> you<00:01:16.350> can

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
and this is won't watch now if you can

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:31.190 
and this is won't watch now if you can
see<00:01:16.620> it<00:01:16.680> spinning<00:01:17.130> but

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.780 

and<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.220> stops

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.040 

yes<00:01:35.450> that's<00:01:35.960> it's<00:01:36.710> done<00:01:36.980> but<00:01:37.940> I<00:01:38.240> found<00:01:38.870> a<00:01:39.020> way

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
yes that's it's done but I found a way

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.470 
yes that's it's done but I found a way
to<00:01:39.170> get<00:01:40.070> it<00:01:40.160> working<00:01:40.310> I<00:01:40.580> see<00:01:40.640> just<00:01:40.940> like<00:01:41.150> pound

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
to get it working I see just like pound

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.570 
to get it working I see just like pound
on<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.720> top<00:01:41.930> a<00:01:41.960> lot<00:01:42.260> and<00:01:43.130> they<00:01:43.220> would<00:01:43.340> go<00:01:43.460> after

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
on the top a lot and they would go after

00:01:43.580 --> 00:02:00.940 
on the top a lot and they would go after
a<00:01:43.760> while

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.160 

all<00:02:01.490> I've<00:02:01.670> got<00:02:01.880> to<00:02:01.909> do<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:02.060> get<00:02:02.180> it<00:02:02.299> working<00:02:02.479> is

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
all I've got to do to get it working is

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.540 
all I've got to do to get it working is
get<00:02:03.469> it<00:02:03.560> going<00:02:03.799> a<00:02:03.860> little<00:02:03.950> bit<00:02:04.189> for<00:02:04.610> first<00:02:04.820> time

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:25.640 

takes<00:02:10.550> a<00:02:10.670> few<00:02:10.789> tries

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.209 

and<00:02:26.650> there<00:02:26.829> you<00:02:26.889> go

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:27.219 
and there you go

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:30.780 
and there you go
I<00:02:27.389> either<00:02:28.389> just<00:02:28.719> tap<00:02:29.439> on<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:29.859> a<00:02:30.099> lot<00:02:30.459> or

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
I either just tap on it a lot or

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:40.000 
I either just tap on it a lot or
continue<00:02:31.269> submitting<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:31.810> when<00:02:31.930> it<00:02:32.049> stops

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:55.920 

yeah<00:02:40.550> that's<00:02:41.000> going

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.510 

and<00:02:56.470> there<00:02:56.620> you<00:02:56.680> go

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
and there you go

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.860 
and there you go
you<00:02:59.030> can<00:02:59.210> see<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.510> laser<00:02:59.660> kinda<00:03:00.260> right<00:03:01.010> there

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:27.850 
you can see the laser kinda right there

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.410 

and<00:03:28.860> then<00:03:29.130> yeah<00:03:29.460> and<00:03:29.760> then<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:30.000> continues

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
and then yeah and then it continues

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.470 
and then yeah and then it continues
reading<00:03:30.840> throughout<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.440> whole<00:03:32.060> as<00:03:33.060> long<00:03:33.330> as

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
reading throughout the whole as long as

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.600 
reading throughout the whole as long as
I<00:03:33.570> play<00:03:33.630> it<00:03:33.840> it'll<00:03:34.080> just<00:03:34.260> keep<00:03:34.440> reading<00:03:34.680> but

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
I play it it'll just keep reading but

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.550 
I play it it'll just keep reading but
it's<00:03:35.820> starting<00:03:36.330> off<00:03:36.570> is<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.930> problem<00:03:37.290> I'm

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
it's starting off is a problem I'm

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.350 
it's starting off is a problem I'm
thinking<00:03:37.890> this<00:03:37.950> in<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.160> motor<00:03:38.370> because

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
thinking this in the motor because

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.000 
thinking this in the motor because
usually<00:03:39.810> when<00:03:40.110> it<00:03:40.170> stops<00:03:40.490> it'll<00:03:42.560> it'll<00:03:43.560> spin

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
usually when it stops it'll it'll spin

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.590 
usually when it stops it'll it'll spin
and<00:03:44.280> when<00:03:44.370> it<00:03:44.459> stops<00:03:44.730> it<00:03:44.910> on<00:03:45.060> its<00:03:45.180> own<00:03:45.330> it'll

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
and when it stops it on its own it'll

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.410 
and when it stops it on its own it'll
stop<00:03:45.900> suddenly<00:03:46.430> but<00:03:47.430> when<00:03:47.670> it<00:03:47.790> stops<00:03:48.150> slows

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
stop suddenly but when it stops slows

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.720 
stop suddenly but when it stops slows
down<00:03:48.660> it<00:03:48.900> doesn't<00:03:49.170> read<00:03:49.380> it'll<00:03:50.010> gradually

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
down it doesn't read it'll gradually

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.550 
down it doesn't read it'll gradually
slow<00:03:51.420> down<00:03:52.700> so<00:03:53.700> I'm<00:03:53.850> thinking<00:03:54.300> it's<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.350> motor

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
slow down so I'm thinking it's the motor

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.170 
slow down so I'm thinking it's the motor
and<00:03:55.890> I<00:03:55.950> just<00:03:56.130> need<00:03:56.250> a<00:03:56.280> new<00:03:56.400> motor<00:03:56.580> but<00:03:56.910> I'm<00:03:57.060> not

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
and I just need a new motor but I'm not

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.490 
and I just need a new motor but I'm not
sure<00:03:57.470> if<00:03:58.470> you<00:03:58.590> guys<00:03:58.709> have<00:03:59.070> any<00:04:00.290> questions<00:04:01.290> or
