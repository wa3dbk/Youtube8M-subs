Let me show you how to make flying jack-o'-lanterns.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.889
You know, it's a lot of fun to carve jack-o'lanterns.

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.930
It's one of my favorite holidays, Halloween.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.070
And, of course, the jack-o'lantern, well,
it's the symbol of Halloween.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.450
But why have a jack-o'lantern just sitting
around when you can them flying around?

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.830
Let me show you how to suspend a jack-o'lantern
where you can hang it from a trellis, a tree,

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.750
or your porch like a lantern, as in jack-o'lantern.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.640
What you wanna do is carve your jack-o'lantern
in the way you would like, make it as spooky

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.180
or as friendly as you like.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.769
Open up the lid, and what I wanna do is pierce
through here two holes where I can run a dowel.

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.420
You can use a dowel like this, this would
be the largest you'd wanna use or something

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.420
even smaller.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.789
Just something strong enough to suspend it.

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.879
Or you can use some sticks if you want it
look really old fashioned and natural.

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.440
And what I'm gonna do is pierce this stick
through the flesh of the pumpkin at about

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.170
here and here.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.729
This stick will serve as the handle from which
I can hang the jack-o'lantern.

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.460
So, one of the best things to do is just use
a cordless drill.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.560
I'm gonna come down from the top of the pumpkin
down to here about 2 inches, then I'm gonna

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.770
drill in like this.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.390
Over here the same way.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.490
Then it's just a matter of taking your stick
or your dowel and pushing it in and matching

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.820
up on this side over here like that.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.600
Okay, now, it's a matter of just making sure
that our top still fits -- it's does, everything's

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.930
in good order.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.880
And now we attach the wire to the top to suspend
it.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.530
And what I'm gonna use here is just some steel
galvanized wire.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.780
You can use any kind of wire you like.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.729
You could even use string or jute.

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.130
But I'm gonna wrap a piece of wire here on
this side like that.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.859
Of course, the thinner the wire the better
because you want these to look like they're

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:00.840
flying around above your head.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.539
So I'm thinking about like that looks good.

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:10.020
So I'll mark that, giving a little length
here, cut it off, wrap the wire around here

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.080
like this, make sure it's secure.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.270
There we go.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.920
Put on the top.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.590
And, as you can see, that'll hang nicely from
a variety of places.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.000
One thing to think about is that these things
will rotate around.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.210
I've often carved the backside of them too.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.670
Because when you pop in the flame or some
way to illuminate it, in this case, I'm using

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.700
these little LED lights that fire up, they
don't create any heat, you can drop two or

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.490
three of those in here, and it'll give you
all the illumination you want.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.600
And without having heat in here, your jack-o'lantern
will last a lot longer.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.050
Anyway, it's a fun idea.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.350
Give it a try, you'll be glad you did.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.660

Alright, let's do another one.
