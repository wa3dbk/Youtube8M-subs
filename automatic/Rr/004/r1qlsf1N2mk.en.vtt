00:00:04.539 --> 00:00:04.549 
this cleaning material I found useful

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:06.590 
this cleaning material I found useful
last<00:00:05.549> year<00:00:05.790> when<00:00:05.940> I<00:00:05.970> was<00:00:06.060> cleaning<00:00:06.270> my<00:00:06.540> kitchen

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
last year when I was cleaning my kitchen

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.709 
last year when I was cleaning my kitchen
counter<00:00:09.530> and<00:00:10.610> so<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:11.910> was<00:00:12.120> going<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.330> try<00:00:12.540> it<00:00:12.599> on

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
counter and so I was going to try it on

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.310 
counter and so I was going to try it on
the<00:00:12.929> kitchen<00:00:13.110> floor<00:00:13.639> now<00:00:16.490> here<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.699> a

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
the kitchen floor now here is a

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.480 
the kitchen floor now here is a
dishwashing<00:00:19.320> liquid<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:20.039> supposed<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.580> be

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
dishwashing liquid it's supposed to be

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.150 
dishwashing liquid it's supposed to be
cleaning<00:00:23.490> grease<00:00:23.910> pretty<00:00:24.630> well<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.439> used

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
cleaning grease pretty well so I used

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.919 
cleaning grease pretty well so I used
that<00:00:26.369> first<00:00:26.699> for<00:00:27.060> cleaning<00:00:27.390> this<00:00:27.539> floor

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
that first for cleaning this floor

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.860 
that first for cleaning this floor
here's<00:00:30.929> our<00:00:31.080> just<00:00:31.260> an<00:00:31.349> average<00:00:32.719> amount<00:00:33.719> of

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
here's our just an average amount of

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.260 
here's our just an average amount of
dirt<00:00:34.170> where<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:35.030> generally<00:00:36.030> walk<00:00:36.270> and

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
dirt where I generally walk and

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.760 
dirt where I generally walk and
yesterday<00:00:39.270> over<00:00:39.809> here<00:00:40.079> there<00:00:40.290> used<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.559> be<00:00:40.620> a

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
yesterday over here there used to be a

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.190 
yesterday over here there used to be a
table<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.940> part<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.570> fourth<00:00:42.899> last

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
table so this part of the fourth last

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.420 
table so this part of the fourth last
dirty<00:00:45.289> but<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.530> about<00:00:46.710> average<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.370> I

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
dirty but this is about average and I

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.930 
dirty but this is about average and I
was<00:00:47.579> cleaning<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.300> floor<00:00:48.539> yesterday<00:00:49.110> and

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
was cleaning the floor yesterday and

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.080 
was cleaning the floor yesterday and
what<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:50.969> did<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.390> use<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.629> blue<00:00:53.090> dishwashing

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
what I did is use that blue dishwashing

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.400 
what I did is use that blue dishwashing
liquid<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.910> I<00:00:56.910> get<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> results<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.170> like

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
liquid and I get the results so like

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.400 
liquid and I get the results so like
this<00:00:58.820> it's<00:00:59.820> certainly<00:01:00.180> cleaner<00:01:00.930> than<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.199> was

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
this it's certainly cleaner than it was

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.860 
this it's certainly cleaner than it was
before<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.920> washed<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.550> but<00:01:02.699> it's<00:01:03.539> certainly

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
before I washed it but it's certainly

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.850 
before I washed it but it's certainly
not<00:01:03.960> white<00:01:04.350> either<00:01:05.000> and<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.720> use<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.140> oxy<00:01:07.590> clean

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
not white either and I use the oxy clean

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.649 
not white either and I use the oxy clean
I<00:01:08.250> put<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.909> dances<00:01:09.890> push<00:01:10.890> down<00:01:11.130> for<00:01:11.659> anywhere

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
I put it dances push down for anywhere

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.300 
I put it dances push down for anywhere
from<00:01:12.810> an<00:01:12.960> hour<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.260> overnight<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.040> put<00:01:14.220> it

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
from an hour to overnight and I put it

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.429 
from an hour to overnight and I put it
down<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.790> little<00:01:15.119> less<00:01:15.390> than<00:01:15.540> an<00:01:15.689> hour<00:01:15.840> ago<00:01:16.080> on

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
down a little less than an hour ago on

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.710 
down a little less than an hour ago on
this<00:01:17.310> section<00:01:17.759> here<00:01:18.979> this<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.210> what<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.360> tiles

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
this section here this is what the tiles

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.090 
this section here this is what the tiles
look<00:01:21.840> like<00:01:22.110> after<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.590> clean<00:01:23.100> them<00:01:23.280> with<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
look like after I clean them with the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.969 
look like after I clean them with the
the<00:01:26.100> blue<00:01:26.640> dishwashing<00:01:27.180> breathe<00:01:27.979> cleaner

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
the blue dishwashing breathe cleaner

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.630 
the blue dishwashing breathe cleaner
liquid<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.439> it<00:01:31.439> got<00:01:31.650> them<00:01:31.890> certainly<00:01:32.220> cleaner

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
liquid and it got them certainly cleaner

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.219 
liquid and it got them certainly cleaner
but<00:01:33.619> it<00:01:34.619> still<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.070> stained<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:35.970> then<00:01:36.229> here's

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
but it still is stained so then here's

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.660 
but it still is stained so then here's
where<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:38.689> wiped<00:01:39.689> off<00:01:40.100> this<00:01:41.100> was<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.490> was

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
where I just wiped off this was this was

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.069 
where I just wiped off this was this was
the<00:01:41.790> same<00:01:42.030> when<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.360> just<00:01:42.540> wipe<00:01:42.659> these<00:01:42.840> two

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
the same when I just wipe these two

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.980 
the same when I just wipe these two
tiles<00:01:44.240> after<00:01:45.240> 45<00:01:45.930> minutes<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.860> oxy<00:01:47.399> clean

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
tiles after 45 minutes of the oxy clean

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.660 
tiles after 45 minutes of the oxy clean
so<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.020> can<00:01:49.380> get<00:01:49.740> an<00:01:49.829> idea<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.869> does

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
so you can get an idea that it does

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.830 
so you can get an idea that it does
manage<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.729> get<00:01:53.970> through<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.950> now<00:01:56.540> you<00:01:57.540> see<00:01:57.750> if

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
manage to get through and now you see if

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.040 
manage to get through and now you see if
I<00:01:57.960> can<00:01:58.170> just

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
I can just

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:14.290 
I can just
so<00:02:00.050> we<00:02:00.140> get<00:02:00.380> myself<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.950> little<00:02:01.130> bit<00:02:01.310> here<00:02:13.300> you
