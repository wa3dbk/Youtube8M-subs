00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.780
 Good, I'll talk a little bit now to 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:22.960
 about genetic engineering on 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.270
 collage on transgenic first in 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.640
 which consists of genetic engineering 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.040
 dna manipulation dna manipulation 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.869
 that we call recombinant DNA is 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.270
 the DNA you are introducing into 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.980
 another segment the jec is introducing 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.079
 in other segments of dna that are 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.850
 placing within another individual who 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.460
 You're cutting that you're calling. 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.559
 this dna that you are manipulating that the 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.680
 people call it recombinant dna 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.840
 in this case here the first cloning 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.000
 I wanted to draw attention to the fact that 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.700
 natural cloning is what cloning 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.070
 mitosis case natural you have a 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.930
 natural courage when you form a 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.400
 monozygotic twins you have one 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.110
 kind of cloning 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.809
 because in fact there was a fertilization 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.600
 in the boston division - you have to 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.970
 separation of the two individuals are two 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.310
 genetically equal individuals because 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.560
 came from the same fertilization and that 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.520
 embryonic development 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.890
 they separate 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.990
 the difference is that you will have by 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.520
 example in monozygotic twins 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.289
 fingerprint fingerprint 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.979
 different is formed in the environment 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:26.170
 uterine 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.789
 in the case of the elderly for example 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.630
 reproductive unicellular beings 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:33.100
 asexual is in a kind of cloning 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.899
 only a cloning is natural to us 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.119
 cloning is natural because in the 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.920
 truth is done by a natural process 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.729
 the development of division of 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.069
 individual 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.380
 in this case here the courage that people 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:46.659
 is accustomed to talking to you in the gft 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.509
 laboratory may have the objective of 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.909
 to form a fabric it may have the objective 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.850
 to form an individual now has the 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.889
 controversy there that once again put a 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.079
 I wound up in the case a human species 

00:01:56.889 --> 00:02:00.729
 an individual of the human species after 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:01.869
 I'll talk a little about the problem that 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.999
 is involved in that 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.009
 now cloning I can form a 

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:07.450
 tissue has another cell I can not 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.280
 forming a fabric I can form a 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.400
 individual for example today already 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.470
 produces human skin then tomorrow the future 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.959
 next you will get a burn a 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.209
 burn of 2nd and 3rd degree can only do 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.680
 a skin transplant is actually a 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.880
 human skin that will have an index of 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.880
 lower rejection 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.340
 In this case the cloning of what I 'm going to have 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.050
 in fact what will differentiate 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.209
 if I'm going to form a fabric I'll form 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.280
 A new guy first I'm gonna get 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.440
 this cell that was formed and I will 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.360
 put a lab petri dish 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.220
 probably in the oven or cloth 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.019
 I'm going to get this guy who was trained 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.400
 this cell is developing 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.260
 deploy within a belly of 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.900
 rent I have the formation of a 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.970
 not to mention that in the process of 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.849
 differentiation in the 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.269
 development of cells here I have 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:58.450
 factors that will express active people 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:01.569
 Inactive jesus, for example, there is a 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.430
 theory that one of the reasons for 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.560
 cell differentiation is a mechanism 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.060
 inducer of neighboring cells 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.549
 then what cells that are around 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.680
 I'm farming that cell. 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.989
 release substances that will induce 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.299
 activation of certain people so that 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.840
 fabric cell forum is more 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.579
 or less so just pick up a cell 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.470
 undifferentiated and put a fabric a 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.870
 blade has been one by one culture 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.329
 of epithelial tissue this cell will become 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.030
 differentiate into epithelial tissue and 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:33.280
 take for example this cell put 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.859
 one in the bone cell culture medium 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.260
 This my undifferentiated cell will 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:40.900
 differentiate into bone cells beauty 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.810
 here in the case of cloning in the process in 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.209
 that I'm going to get the core of 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.880
 a cell so I want to make the 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.709
 cloning of a given individual 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.359
 Whatever the dolly sheep we go 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.190
 catch the classic example of dolly sheep 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.680
 I take a cell can be a cell 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.959
 of mammary gland a deployed cell 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:04.359
 It has to be a somatic cell reminds 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:06.700
 which sum of the Greek means body then 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:09.099
 the somatic cell is any cell in the 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.040
 body that is not the gamete so it is 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.769
 blog that the blog cell her 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.919
 represents two chromosomes of each type 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:20.919
 in our species are 46 chromosomes 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.349
 I'll get this blog core to 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:26.139
 I'll take a vote anyway 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:28.090
 I'll take the core of your vote. 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.630
 I just want to use the cytoplasm 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:34.030
 your face and will get this 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.530
 blog core and I'll put it inside 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.990
 his face 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:41.110
 I'll take this is the face that was a voice. 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.510
 nucleated notes that it is not obvious is a 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.550
 your secondary coast I'll take this 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.690
 blog core and I'll put it inside 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.210
 your face 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.130
 I'll take the vote now and I'll 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.920
 put it for example a belly of 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.840
 rent in the uterus that validation occurs 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.480
 development in the case of mammalian 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.030
 placenta and I will stimulate this cell 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.290
 divide with a shock for example the 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.320
 electric discharge 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:08.140
 this cell begins to divide repairs 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.750
 that the oocyte that yellow 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.210
 You have the belly for rent and the nucleus. 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.390
 here is blank the cells that will be 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.220
 formed will be loading 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.110
 genetic trait of whoever inherited the 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.660
 core of who offered core 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.950
 in the case of this first cell here 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.650
 Calm down then, what do they do? 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:30.160
 ask in proof is for example got the 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:34.120
 core of a floyd cell of a frog 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:37.900
 there is a secondary grandparent of a 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:40.810
 rabbit and picked up is implanted in the other 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.870
 Any animal that is going to be born 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.500
 there will be a frog that is the nucleus of 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.360
 prod 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.890
 so who is donating the core will be 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.950
 responsible for the transmission of 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:54.820
 hereditary beauty characteristics 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:57.040
 in the case of the transgenic I have is 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.560
 term is already saying transgenic I 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.910
 to move urgently from one species to another 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.470
 species 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.800
 so look what I put here I have 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:08.500
 a species to that species I caught it 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.240
 a fragment of DNA 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.720
 I'll use it for an enzyme 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:16.570
 restriction or even nuclease that enzyme 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.420
 of restriction I cut dna fragment 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:22.510
 I want to get this piece of 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:27.450
 dna and I'm going to put another species 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:33.910
 here I am going to use an enzyme called dna 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:42.550
 ligase and here this asterisk is a 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:45.250
 restriction enzyme or even nuclease 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:47.560
 then the restriction enzyme I cut 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:50.170
 Dna fragment that I want the way 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.430
 I 'm going to take it and transfer this genius to 

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.770
 other species 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:57.770
 so whenever I have an individual 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:07:00.259
 in their genetic material there is a 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.160
 piece of dna one gene from another 

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:03.620
 species 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.690
 We call it a transgenic individual. 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.220
 now in the next module i will explain 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.620
 for you as we do this with 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.780
 insulin and other examples that people 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.960
 have a transgenic individual in our 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.960
 daily
