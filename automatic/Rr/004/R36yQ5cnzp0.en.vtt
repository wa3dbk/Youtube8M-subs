00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
everything the same i use my optimum

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.620 
everything the same i use my optimum
care<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.170> i<00:00:16.410> took<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:17.039> same<00:00:17.250> steps<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:18.060> all

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
care and i took the same steps and all

that good stuff so i was 12 weeks post
this<00:00:22.529> time<00:00:22.949> i<00:00:23.460> normally<00:00:23.939> wait<00:00:24.090> longer<00:00:24.330> than

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
this time i normally wait longer than

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.279 
this time i normally wait longer than
that<00:00:24.720> but<00:00:25.310> i<00:00:26.310> had<00:00:26.640> graduation<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.810> want<00:00:28.140> my

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
that but i had graduation so I want my

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.200 
that but i had graduation so I want my
hair<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.680> look<00:00:28.830> good<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.510> um<00:00:30.619> I<00:00:31.619> went<00:00:32.210> straight

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
hair to look good so um I went straight

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.780 
hair to look good so um I went straight
then<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.350> would<00:00:34.860> like<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.579> go<00:00:35.969> um<00:00:37.610> someone<00:00:38.610> else

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
then I would like to go um someone else

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.810 
then I would like to go um someone else
did<00:00:39.000> my<00:00:39.090> hair<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.360> time<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:39.899> did<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.820> it

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
did my hair this time and I did it so it

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.790 
did my hair this time and I did it so it
is<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> little<00:00:42.570> straighter<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.020> do<00:00:43.170> like<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.770> but

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
is a little straighter I do like it but

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.850 
is a little straighter I do like it but
i<00:00:44.040> am<00:00:44.820> sure<00:00:44.879> than<00:00:45.660> i<00:00:45.809> would<00:00:45.989> normally<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.680> i

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
i am sure than i would normally like i

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.020 
i am sure than i would normally like i
like<00:00:47.340> almost<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.210> text<00:00:48.660> like<00:00:48.780> sort<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.289> look<00:00:49.500> but

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
like almost a text like sort of look but

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.340 
like almost a text like sort of look but
whatever<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.480> here<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:53.690> it<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.840> very<00:00:54.989> smooth

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
whatever so here it is it is very smooth

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:08.570 
whatever so here it is it is very smooth
and<00:00:59.690> let's<00:01:00.690> get<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:04.580> let's<00:01:05.580> see<00:01:07.580> old

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
and let's get to it so let's see old

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.770 
and let's get to it so let's see old
thing<00:01:08.850> i<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.240> noticed<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:11.240> even<00:01:12.240> though<00:01:12.390> I

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
thing i have noticed is even though I

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.749 
thing i have noticed is even though I
dust<00:01:13.560> my<00:01:13.890> hair<00:01:14.189> very<00:01:14.600> often<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.810> still<00:01:16.759> really

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
dust my hair very often I still really

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.140 
dust my hair very often I still really
really<00:01:18.090> really<00:01:18.360> trim<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.320> after<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.430> video<00:01:20.759> I

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
really really trim so after this video I

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.590 
really really trim so after this video I
will<00:01:21.240> probably<00:01:22.340> be<00:01:23.340> doing<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.729> trimming<00:01:24.119> video

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
will probably be doing a trimming video

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.149 
will probably be doing a trimming video
if<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.990> guys<00:01:25.200> are<00:01:25.380> interested<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.890> seeing

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
if you guys are interested in seeing

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:40.360 
if you guys are interested in seeing
that<00:01:26.250> but<00:01:28.520> this<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.880> from<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.299> side

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:53.250 

the<00:01:41.030> other<00:01:43.690> show<00:01:44.690> you<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:44.930> back<00:01:45.250> one<00:01:46.250> second

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.430 

so<00:01:54.260> this<00:01:54.530> is<00:01:54.680> it<00:01:54.920> from<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.280> back<00:01:55.540> I<00:01:56.540> bet<00:01:57.410> you

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
so this is it from the back I bet you

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.070 
so this is it from the back I bet you
could<00:01:57.830> see<00:01:58.130> a<00:01:58.160> lot<00:01:58.430> better<00:01:58.760> that<00:01:59.240> I<00:01:59.510> really<00:01:59.930> do

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
could see a lot better that I really do

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.440 
could see a lot better that I really do
need<00:02:00.230> to<00:02:00.320> turn<00:02:00.620> himself<00:02:01.060> I'm<00:02:02.060> going<00:02:02.210> to<00:02:02.300> go

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
need to turn himself I'm going to go

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.190 
need to turn himself I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:02.480> and<00:02:02.840> do<00:02:03.170> that<00:02:03.200> after<00:02:04.190> this<00:02:05.110> there<00:02:06.110> you

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
ahead and do that after this there you

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.180 
ahead and do that after this there you
go<00:02:06.460> just<00:02:07.460> wanted<00:02:07.760> you<00:02:07.790> guys<00:02:08.000> to<00:02:08.210> see<00:02:08.240> the

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
go just wanted you guys to see the

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.560 
go just wanted you guys to see the
results<00:02:10.190> before<00:02:10.340> I<00:02:10.550> actually<00:02:10.820> trimmed<00:02:11.600> it<00:02:11.840> so

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
results before I actually trimmed it so

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:20.590 
results before I actually trimmed it so
this<00:02:14.570> is<00:02:14.600> it<00:02:14.960> I<00:02:15.140> am<00:02:15.410> noticing<00:02:16.870> like<00:02:19.450> okay<00:02:20.450> the

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
this is it I am noticing like okay the

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.330 
this is it I am noticing like okay the
one<00:02:20.720> thing<00:02:20.960> I<00:02:21.050> could<00:02:21.230> do<00:02:21.380> different<00:02:21.800> is<00:02:21.980> my

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
one thing I could do different is my

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.320 
one thing I could do different is my
mid-step<00:02:23.270> protein<00:02:23.870> um<00:02:24.740> I<00:02:25.840> didn't<00:02:26.840> use<00:02:27.170> a

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
mid-step protein um I didn't use a

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.810 
mid-step protein um I didn't use a
reconstructor<00:02:29.330> like<00:02:29.570> I<00:02:29.690> usually<00:02:29.870> do<00:02:30.350> I<00:02:30.680> did<00:02:31.610> am

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
reconstructor like I usually do I did am

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:38.230 
reconstructor like I usually do I did am
I<00:02:35.230> use<00:02:36.230> this<00:02:36.830> instead<00:02:37.310> as<00:02:37.490> my<00:02:37.670> reconstruct

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
I use this instead as my reconstruct

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.740 
I use this instead as my reconstruct
their<00:02:38.420> I<00:02:38.630> don't<00:02:39.620> think<00:02:39.680> my<00:02:39.980> hair<00:02:40.340> I<00:02:40.640> mean<00:02:41.630> my

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
their I don't think my hair I mean my

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.420 
their I don't think my hair I mean my
hair<00:02:41.870> really<00:02:42.020> does<00:02:42.170> like<00:02:42.680> this<00:02:42.950> stuff<00:02:43.190> but<00:02:43.340> I

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
hair really does like this stuff but I

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.780 
hair really does like this stuff but I
don't<00:02:43.610> think<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:43.910> likes<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.360> as<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:45.790> mid-step

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
don't think it likes it as a mid-step

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.820 
don't think it likes it as a mid-step
protein<00:02:47.300> during<00:02:47.630> my<00:02:47.840> relaxed<00:02:48.350> across<00:02:48.650> this

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
protein during my relaxed across this

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.080 
protein during my relaxed across this
because<00:02:49.220> i<00:02:49.340> am<00:02:49.550> seeing<00:02:50.380> a<00:02:51.380> lot<00:02:52.370> of<00:02:52.850> and

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
because i am seeing a lot of and

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.580 
because i am seeing a lot of and
broken<00:02:53.480> hairs<00:02:53.690> that<00:02:53.870> could<00:02:54.080> be<00:02:54.200> because<00:02:54.440> i

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
broken hairs that could be because i

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.160 
broken hairs that could be because i
need<00:02:54.860> to<00:02:54.920> trim<00:02:55.220> I<00:02:55.459> don't<00:02:55.700> know<00:02:55.820> but<00:02:56.209> Alice<00:02:57.050> I

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
need to trim I don't know but Alice I
