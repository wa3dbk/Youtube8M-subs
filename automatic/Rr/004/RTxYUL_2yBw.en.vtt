00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.889 

I<00:00:48.950> think<00:00:49.520> pretty<00:00:49.640> much<00:00:49.760> similar<00:00:50.120> to<00:00:50.300> to

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.710 
I think pretty much similar to to
yesterday<00:00:51.320> I<00:00:51.530> think<00:00:51.890> that<00:00:52.149> all<00:00:53.149> four<00:00:53.510> look

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720

yesterday I think that all four look
good<00:00:53.930> I<00:00:54.579> think<00:00:55.579> DJ<00:00:55.940> Morgan<00:00:56.180> looks<00:00:56.480> improved

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
good I think DJ Morgan looks improved

good I think DJ Morgan looks improved
now<00:00:57.079> the<00:00:57.140> DJ<00:00:57.500> Morgan

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.599 

it<00:01:00.600> was<00:01:00.690> really<00:01:00.870> handled<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.010> really<00:01:02.129> well<00:01:02.280> I

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
it was really handled it really well I

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.640 
it was really handled it really well I
think<00:01:03.089> I<00:01:03.269> thought<00:01:03.480> it's<00:01:04.140> kind<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.350> easy<00:01:04.500> on

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
think I thought it's kind of easy on

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.350 
think I thought it's kind of easy on
Curtis<00:01:05.009> and<00:01:05.159> he's<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.670> another<00:01:05.909> guy<00:01:06.090> there

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
Curtis and he's have another guy there

rusher so
I<00:01:11.030> think<00:01:11.330> DJ<00:01:11.690> I'm<00:01:12.080> sure<00:01:12.380> hears<00:01:12.680> from<00:01:12.800> a<00:01:12.920> lot<00:01:13.040> of

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
I think DJ I'm sure hears from a lot of

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.560 
I think DJ I'm sure hears from a lot of
people<00:01:13.430> that<00:01:13.550> he<00:01:13.670> thought<00:01:13.910> man<00:01:14.180> out<00:01:14.360> which<00:01:14.540> is

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
people that he thought man out which is

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.240 
people that he thought man out which is
not<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:14.930> case<00:01:14.960> and<00:01:15.380> so<00:01:15.650> it's<00:01:15.860> good<00:01:15.980> to<00:01:16.010> see<00:01:16.160> the

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
not the case and so it's good to see the

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.460 
not the case and so it's good to see the
way<00:01:16.370> he's<00:01:16.490> responded<00:01:17.000> and

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
way he's responded and

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.140

body<00:01:49.920> was<00:01:50.160> that<00:01:50.280> something<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.850> wanted

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
body was that something that you wanted

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.970 
body was that something that you wanted
to<00:01:51.810> do<00:01:51.960> or<00:01:52.110> did<00:01:52.230> he<00:01:52.320> take<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.560> upon<00:01:52.950> yourself

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
to do or did he take that upon yourself

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.970 
to do or did he take that upon yourself
I<00:01:53.580> think<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.690> that<00:01:54.720> once<00:01:55.410> again<00:01:55.590> happens<00:01:55.950> a

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
I think that that once again happens a

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.410 
I think that that once again happens a
lot<00:01:56.070> with<00:01:56.220> secondary<00:01:56.580> players<00:01:56.790> Andre<00:01:57.210> Walker

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
lot with secondary players Andre Walker

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.800 
lot with secondary players Andre Walker
another<00:01:58.380> example<00:01:58.740> 100<00:01:59.190> or<00:01:59.640> another<00:02:00.510> example

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
another example 100 or another example

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.320 
another example 100 or another example
so<00:02:01.650> it's<00:02:02.400> really<00:02:02.670> good<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.850> see<00:02:02.970> because<00:02:03.180> it

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
so it's really good to see because it

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.870 
so it's really good to see because it
helps<00:02:03.600> them<00:02:03.720> and<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.710> can<00:02:04.860> see<00:02:05.040> how<00:02:05.070> strong<00:02:05.490> is

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
helps them and you can see how strong is

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.760 
helps them and you can see how strong is
it<00:02:06.120> looks<00:02:06.960> completely<00:02:07.350> different

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
it looks completely different

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.650 
it looks completely different
bodywise

another<00:03:56.310> example<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.970> same<00:03:57.120> thing

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
another example the same thing

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.990 
another example the same thing
second-year<00:03:57.840> guy<00:03:58.159> really<00:03:59.159> has<00:03:59.459> developed

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
second-year guy really has developed

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.809 
second-year guy really has developed
looks<00:04:00.480> looks<00:04:01.290> of<00:04:01.439> a<00:04:01.560> lot<00:04:01.829> better<00:04:02.310> than<00:04:02.549> he<00:04:02.610> did

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
looks looks of a lot better than he did

looks looks of a lot better than he did
in<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.480> spring<00:04:03.780> so<00:04:03.810> I<00:04:04.200> think<00:04:04.590> a<00:04:04.650> lot<00:04:04.680> of<00:04:04.829> the

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
in the spring so I think a lot of the

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.229 
in the spring so I think a lot of the
excitement<00:04:05.340> isn't<00:04:05.610> necessarily<00:04:06.090> to

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
excitement isn't necessarily to

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.030 
excitement isn't necessarily to
frontline<00:04:06.510> guys<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:07.110> we<00:04:07.200> all<00:04:07.319> know<00:04:07.500> about<00:04:07.650> I

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
frontline guys that we all know about I

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.680 
frontline guys that we all know about I
think<00:04:08.489> there's<00:04:08.670> a<00:04:08.730> lot<00:04:08.909> of<00:04:08.940> excitement<00:04:09.329> about

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
think there's a lot of excitement about

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.080 
think there's a lot of excitement about

we've had he's faster he's actually

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.930 
we've had he's faster he's actually
better<00:04:24.300> than<00:04:24.479> most<00:04:24.690> of<00:04:24.900> our<00:04:24.960> tailbacks<00:04:25.410> so<00:04:26.100> at

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
better than most of our tailbacks so at

a<00:04:45.910> lot<00:04:46.150> of<00:04:46.180> concern<00:04:46.600> there's<00:04:47.320> two<00:04:47.500> defensive

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980

high level right now and the rest of it

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.170 
high level right now and the rest of it
just<00:04:55.630> flashes<00:04:56.220> there's<00:04:57.220> not<00:04:57.310> much<00:04:57.460> experience

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180

it's going to be wide open that's going
to<00:05:00.860> be<00:05:00.919> a<00:05:00.949> very<00:05:01.160> important<00:05:01.729> story<00:05:02.539> over<00:05:02.750> the

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
to be a very important story over the

to be a very important story over the
next<00:05:03.020> couple<00:05:03.139> weeks<00:05:03.380> is<00:05:04.370> it<00:05:04.520> easier<00:05:04.910> to<00:05:05.060> learn

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
next couple weeks is it easier to learn

next couple weeks is it easier to learn

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
right and left defensive end so it would

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.260 
right and left defensive end so it would
probably<00:05:16.100> be<00:05:16.280> a<00:05:16.310> little<00:05:16.430> easier<00:05:16.580> to<00:05:16.820> play<00:05:17.030> in

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
probably be a little easier to play in

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.779 
probably be a little easier to play in
