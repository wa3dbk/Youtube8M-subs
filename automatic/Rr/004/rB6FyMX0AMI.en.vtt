00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
streaks start all over again let's talk

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.240 
streaks start all over again let's talk
about<00:00:43.629> the<00:00:43.870> class<00:00:44.110> that<00:00:44.350> I'm<00:00:44.440> running<00:00:44.650> it's

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
about the class that I'm running it's

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.420 
about the class that I'm running it's
the<00:00:45.610> honey<00:00:45.940> badger<00:00:46.650> and<00:00:47.650> as<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:48.010> integrated

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
the honey badger and as the integrated

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.950 
the honey badger and as the integrated
silencer<00:00:49.059> on<00:00:49.089> it<00:00:49.269> so<00:00:49.480> basically<00:00:49.750> you<00:00:49.900> don't

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
silencer on it so basically you don't

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.630 
silencer on it so basically you don't
have<00:00:50.170> to<00:00:50.260> put<00:00:50.440> a<00:00:50.470> silencer<00:00:50.710> on<00:00:51.010> it<00:00:51.190> at<00:00:51.519> that

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
have to put a silencer on it at that

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.420 
have to put a silencer on it at that
point<00:00:51.910> you<00:00:52.030> can<00:00:52.180> spend<00:00:52.480> it<00:00:52.629> on<00:00:52.890> secondary<00:00:53.890> or

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
point you can spend it on secondary or

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.899 
point you can spend it on secondary or

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.850 
that I run on it is ready up your
weapons<00:01:00.789> ready<00:01:01.059> faster<00:01:01.539> after<00:01:01.660> sprinting<00:01:01.860> I'm

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
weapons ready faster after sprinting I'm

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.969 
weapons ready faster after sprinting I'm
using<00:01:03.160> amplify<00:01:03.940> see<00:01:04.809> it<00:01:04.960> louder<00:01:05.289> enemy

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
using amplify see it louder enemy

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:13.170 
using amplify see it louder enemy
footsteps<00:01:10.710> also<00:01:11.710> stalker<00:01:12.190> so<00:01:12.940> you<00:01:13.030> move

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
footsteps also stalker so you move

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.820 
footsteps also stalker so you move
faster<00:01:13.660> while<00:01:13.810> aiming<00:01:14.020> down<00:01:14.259> sights<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
faster while aiming down sights the

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.609 
faster while aiming down sights the
kicker<00:01:18.070> on<00:01:18.160> this<00:01:18.429> one<00:01:18.640> for<00:01:18.820> me<00:01:18.970> is<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.210> Deadeye

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
kicker on this one for me is the Deadeye

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.139 
kicker on this one for me is the Deadeye
consecutive<00:01:20.619> kills<00:01:20.860> increase<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.520> chance<00:01:21.789> to

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
consecutive kills increase the chance to

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.990 
consecutive kills increase the chance to
deal<00:01:22.330> more<00:01:22.570> damage<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.830> basically<00:01:24.220> whenever

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
deal more damage so basically whenever

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.150 
deal more damage so basically whenever
you<00:01:25.330> get<00:01:25.479> kills<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:26.410> more<00:01:26.560> kills<00:01:26.800> you<00:01:26.950> get

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
you get kills the more kills you get

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.790 
you get kills the more kills you get
there<00:01:28.060> is<00:01:28.149> a<00:01:28.179> higher<00:01:28.450> chance<00:01:28.720> to<00:01:29.050> the<00:01:29.500> bullet

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
there is a higher chance to the bullet

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.320 
there is a higher chance to the bullet
damage<00:01:29.950> given<00:01:30.340> higher<00:01:30.490> so<00:01:30.729> if<00:01:30.850> you<00:01:30.940> see<00:01:31.119> the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
damage given higher so if you see the

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.800 
damage given higher so if you see the
red<00:01:32.020> hit<00:01:32.289> marker<00:01:32.709> on<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.399> enemy's<00:01:33.789> best<00:01:34.479> when

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
red hit marker on the enemy's best when

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.650 
red hit marker on the enemy's best when
dead<00:01:35.560> eyes<00:01:35.740> kicking<00:01:36.220> in<00:01:36.369> and<00:01:36.640> dealing<00:01:37.479> more

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
dead eyes kicking in and dealing more

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.690 
dead eyes kicking in and dealing more
damage<00:01:37.720> so<00:01:38.410> what<00:01:38.560> I<00:01:38.590> wanted<00:01:38.830> to<00:01:38.920> talk<00:01:39.039> about<00:01:39.099> is
