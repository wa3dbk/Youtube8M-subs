00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.790
 hi to all and axel hostesses mobile.fr 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.670
 I am at mwc 2015 on the stand of sony 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.269
 and I have in the hand the exclude ya had 4 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.189
 I then had 4 q it is the successor of the 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.949
 e3 but the frame is a device whose 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:22.500
 we already heard about it in fact there 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.029
 this is simply his variant 4g I 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.210
 were going through the specs quickly so 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:31.500
 we have a screen 4.7 inches qhd small that a 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.570
 hd ip s 5 megapixel rear 2 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.880
 megapixels in the front it will be available 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.710
 in white and black so here we have the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:44.040
 white version as you can 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:48.899
 notice and compatible lt had 135 g 18 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.780
 mm thick a mtk 67,32 1.5 giguere 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.610
 quad core 1 gig of ram one gigabyte naiman 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.860
 achieved with micro sd up to 32 gigas 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.820
 and a battery of 2300 thousand in peer 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.930
 with a stamina mode we will make a 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.270
 little tour of design is a small 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.090
 earlier entry-level device 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.430
 aude between guin probably with the 4g 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.900
 but the 4g is really the one in all 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.689
 case on this version of the terminal 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:17.250
 the element that makes him stand out 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:20.759
 so right here you see it not very 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:26.159
 well, but we have the front camera 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.780
 the led just next logo sony down we 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.240
 nothing but buttons 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.799
 built-in interface on / off button 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.840
 lock unlock keys from 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.950
 volume 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.720
 micro usb jack nothing down device 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.759
 photo with nfc compatible led flash 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.590
 apparently and then when you take it 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.850
 in hand necessarily it's nice enough 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.740
 the only thing is that the borders are 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.009
 still strong 1 it's not deaths 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.689
 no small border but the design 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.570
 is interesting sent there you have 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.549
 this white hull maths that exceeds 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.659
 on the sides why not tell me 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.969
 by the way in the comments what 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.770
 you think then 4g good is good 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.090
 after I can test it there 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.950
 turns again as you can see 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.850
 for those who may have seen from my 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.140
 soul videos at 4.4 since under the bed 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.270
 people it does not really look like that anymore 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.220
 it's pretty close 1 but it changes 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.030
 a little I do not know if it will go under the 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.140
 hip hop for the shot 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.400
 good so we'll go quickly in 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.590
 the interface is an interface that 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.930
 know well 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.770
 that's if you have for example look 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.480
 some of my tests experia here 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.090
 the keyboard then there you can the 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:37.390
 to handle a hand without much problem 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.390
 a priori this menu the album 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.709
 multitouch multitasking multitasking forgiveness 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.640
 and of course the small caps so I say 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.849
 of course but it's not necessarily 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.099
 obvious on a small screen like that 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:03:03.750
 to have them see the small caps the good 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:05.880
 the ups up can capture relatively 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.769
 quickly a picture with different 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.230
 modes here in automatic mode a mode 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.489
 manual that provides carefree access 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.459
 more particularly based on 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:18.120
 different scenes that kind of things 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.769
 here it is yeah it is it is reactive but 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.410
 we still feel that he is trailing 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.560
 a little bit because it's a device 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.569
 range of gard we will say lower 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.640
 compared to what we saw from 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.680
 sony in my previous videos 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.150
 especially 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.190
 Here I think it will be about 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.630
 the whole calendar looks like bein 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.670
 yes yesterday samba sarr that's the one we 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.890
 know one here it's a device 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.510
 interesting especially by in my opinion his 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.030
 price I have not there I'm sorry 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.829
 look I'm sure it was published 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.150
 but I have not the same price if I 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.030
 out the securities I think the rested 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:55.380
 and so it's them four but with this 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.389
 version version 4g and so that's not it 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.590
 badly it is also called the 4g because 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:01.470
 that it's the successor it's a 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.959
 experience them 4g I think they do 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.130
 a youngster had 4 ejeie ​​a priori a 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.200
 miss on me who's cheating on me 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.630
 in any case, this is a device rather 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.480
 entry-level design simple small 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.280
 screen and 4g that's what it is 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.269
 Hold on this terminal here if you 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.109
 have questions do not hesitate 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.109
 sure and then I tell you see you soon
