00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.720
 right temperature bastards 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.560
 a serious problem that this motorcycle has 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.560
 which is to get to 120 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.400
 well, it was evident that the highway was 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.730
 motorbike was going to be very clear now it starts 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.730
 the fun 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.170
 no no no 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.979
 Well, nothing has arrived until here 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.990
 is that they are like a barbarity like 150 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.360
 and so because it's there from the sun and 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.040
 because so tomorrow I do all the 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.690
 pull pyrenees but you are here 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:13.420
 I should know if tomorrow, well, no, 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:19.240
 we have nothing that has so many 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:21.540
 hosts do not understand much other part 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.540
 thing 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.200
 well that's 9 in the morning and I'm in 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.569
 cadaqués and I'm going to asturias but not 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.340
 he came in and I'm going to 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.430
 through the pirineo by 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:52.220
 transpyrenean if you can and we will see 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.220
 like the cold 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.310
 let's move on 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.200
 Now let's get straight into the 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:16.620
 Pyrenees I will put olot as first 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:18.299
 stop and 58 kilometers then two or three 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.890
 degrees and a half this starts to put 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:24.900
 a little three and that ting and so he checked 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.720
 some pine gloves for under the 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.140
 fat gloves because the worst will be 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.140
 hands 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.280
 It is a great invention that is called 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.320
 hans werner this warms my hands 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.320
 a little while 7 hours 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.680
 for the feet the hands and the body 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.390
 has a tormentón letters but torments 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.370
 of snow and it's just where I'm going 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.780
 that the foresight of these people who are 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:01.069
 The most important thing is that the skin does not 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.959
 I will get to study when 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.519
 then when I could come to 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.909
 I could not test the motorbike in Cádiz 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:11.500

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.500
 Y 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.039
 road of curves we are going to raise the 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:22.009
 It's a shame because every time 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:25.879
 It's cold and you have to be careful 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.879
 besides the bike is not mine 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.650
 grade and a half 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:37.049
 and it starts to snow it 's getting ugly like that 

00:04:34.329 --> 00:04:37.049
 that slowly 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.550
