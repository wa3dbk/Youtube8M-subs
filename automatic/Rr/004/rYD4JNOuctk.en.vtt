 "Tank" was four years old. we are not going to stop. 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.199
 Four years ago, the game was 16,000 users, 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:17.066
 and now plays more than a million people at a time. 

00:00:19.422 --> 00:00:21.580
 The «World of Tanks» game has users in every continent, 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.340
 and the players are more than 220 countries worldwide. 

00:00:28.044 --> 00:00:32.088
 From the beginning, we did a game for us to be the very fun to play.

 The game has more than forty cards. 

00:01:10.044 --> 00:01:15.020
 A lot of time and effort we spent on the reflection of physical damage - 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.780
 the so-called engine «Havok». 

00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:23.111
 We will add a lot of interest in the game process.

 There will be a physical movement of the tank overturns. 

00:01:29.377 --> 00:01:32.755

 Project «World of Tanks» - 4 years 

00:02:20.577 --> 00:02:25.540
 If you have created a game, no one thought that it would eSports. 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.355
 But the number of tournament players and number of tournaments themselves have increased, 

00:02:30.355 --> 00:02:32.444
 and we realized without eSports - anywhere. 

00:02:33.955 --> 00:02:37.599
 The first tank was eSports tournament "Ural Steel" Tournament - 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.020
 it was a really serious international tournament 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.199
 which brought together a lot of teams who represented 32 countries. 

00:02:45.955 --> 00:02:49.377
 Communication with the players - one of the most important parts of our work. 

00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:53.022
 Over the past year we have spent more than a hundred meetings with the players. 

00:02:53.022 --> 00:02:55.340
 We have launched their own league «Wargaming». 

00:02:55.555 --> 00:02:58.780
 The other day was the grand finale in Warsaw. 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.510
 We are trying to get to the final forty thousand teams 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.177
 which is more than two hundred thousand players worldwide. 

00:03:08.177 --> 00:03:10.900
 But reached the finals only the best, 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.370
 and they are followed by more than two million people around the world, 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.911
 as well as tens of thousands directly in Warsaw.

00:03:42.844 --> 00:03:44.980
 In addition to meetings with the players in real life, 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.844
 we spend a lot of activities on the servers. 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.444

00:03:52.444 --> 00:03:54.444
