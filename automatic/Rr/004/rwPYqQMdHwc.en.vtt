00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.070
 as we have already said in other of our 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.830
 videos the new seat lion brand new car 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.829
 of the year in Spain 2014 is homeland pride 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.320
 to one side a cochazo without a doubt the best 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:15.839
 lion of all times for the first 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.240
 since the appearance in 1999 of the 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.040
 first generation joins the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.830
 lion range the interesting body 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.860
 familiar called st that with 4 meters 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.260
 54 in length is 27 centimeters more 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.060
 long that his brother of 5 doors this 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.890
 moment of length does not affect the space 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.579
 of the passenger compartment with respect to the 5 doors 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.930
 but yes to the trunk space goes from 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:41.700
 380 liters to 587 and that's a lot 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.800
 so you can get an idea of everything 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.970
 an audi a6 abbot of almost 5 meters 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.950
 long has 22 liters less amazing 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.870
 the trunk of this lion that said 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.090
 in passing is not the largest of its 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.739
 rivals only in volkswagen golf 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.620
 variant and especially the honda civic 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.829
 tourer with stratospheric 624 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.780
 liters are above 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.790
 but the trunk does not only live on liters of 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.100
 ability but also ease of 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.080
 loading and management of space and leonine 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.720
 you get very good note in these 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.640
 aspects for example the curtain covers 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.200
 luggage is collected by just pressing the 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.600
 roasts down and extends 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.250
 comfortably by these guides and if we have 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.890
 to remove it to load over 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.630
 she is very grateful that we have a 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.140
 concrete place to store it in this 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.140
 false bottom 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.900
 ah 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.880
 and if we need more space with these 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.740
 handles we can easily fold the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.950
 backs in this way 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.409
 we will have a capacity of 1,470 liters 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.030
 the seat lion 7 is one more option 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.740
 recommended for long trips in 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.869
 family thanks to your fantastic 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.000
 Charging capacity to your good atmosphere 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.439
 interior a little tarnished by the use of 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.329
 some plastics something hard in the area 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.250
 lowering the dashboard one direction 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:02.020
 electric touch nice and some 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.060
 suspensions that look for comfort but 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.420
 that do not leave out the sports DNA of 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.420
 the brand 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.300
 the tdi 150 horsepower engine that we are 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.310
 Trying today can be a good icing 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.500
 that cake and more if it is associated with 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.540
 6- speed automatic shift dsg that 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.490
 gives us an extra comfort pity that 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.040
 the throttle response is a bit 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.960
 slow no doubt this intermediate option of 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.440
 the diesel range is the most balanced if 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.260
 We will travel normally loaded 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.270
 accelerates from 0 to 100 in 86 seconds and 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.820
 reaches 215 kilometers per hour of 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.280
 tip speed in addition in that test only 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.500
 weighs 45 kilos more than lion 5 doors 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.810
 this makes the consumption barely 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.210
 resents increasing a simple tenth of 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.570
 liter standing at 4.5 liters at 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.570
 winds 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.020
 If we can not buy from a relative 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.300
 big to use this compact option what 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.800
 solves with a lot of ballots worth 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.780
 that is not the cheapest of its rivals 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.290
 but is that the overall quality also 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.290
 it has its price
