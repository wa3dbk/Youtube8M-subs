going<00:02:09.259> to<00:02:09.349> take<00:02:09.500> that<00:02:09.649> out<00:02:09.759> we're<00:02:10.759> going<00:02:10.849> to

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:10.909 
going to take that out we're going to

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:12.280 
going to take that out we're going to
turn<00:02:11.150> this<00:02:11.299> thing<00:02:11.360> over<00:02:11.629> put<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:11.959> battery

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
turn this thing over put the battery

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.690 
turn this thing over put the battery
back<00:02:12.470> in<00:02:12.970> turn<00:02:13.970> this<00:02:14.090> over<00:02:15.099> and<00:02:16.099> put<00:02:16.129> this<00:02:16.430> up

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
back in turn this over and put this up

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.110 
back in turn this over and put this up
and<00:02:16.879> see<00:02:17.060> if<00:02:17.150> something<00:02:17.450> else<00:02:17.569> happens<00:02:18.640> so<00:02:19.640> so

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
and see if something else happens so so

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.500 
and see if something else happens so so
basically<00:02:20.269> what<00:02:20.689> I<00:02:20.719> did<00:02:20.810> is<00:02:21.019> I<00:02:21.439> as<00:02:22.239> I<00:02:25.480> clear<00:02:26.480> out

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
basically what I did is I as I clear out

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.009 
basically what I did is I as I clear out
the<00:02:26.779> BIOS<00:02:27.969> okay<00:02:28.969> and<00:02:29.209> what<00:02:29.329> bothers<00:02:29.689> me<00:02:29.840> right

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
the BIOS okay and what bothers me right

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.690 
the BIOS okay and what bothers me right
now<00:02:32.620> let's<00:02:33.620> see<00:02:33.739> if<00:02:33.829> I<00:02:33.889> can<00:02:34.010> get<00:02:34.129> it<00:02:34.219> in<00:02:34.340> there<00:02:34.519> I

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
now let's see if I can get it in there I

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.080 
now let's see if I can get it in there I
still<00:02:35.209> have<00:02:35.359> the<00:02:35.480> blinking<00:02:36.730> blue<00:02:37.730> blinking

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:44.059 
computer actually has a lot of good

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:46.479 
computer actually has a lot of good
stuff<00:03:44.299> so<00:03:45.019> I<00:03:45.049> just<00:03:45.650> want<00:03:45.829> to<00:03:45.889> point<00:03:46.040> out<00:03:46.159> where

stuff so I just want to point out where

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.580 
stuff so I just want to point out where
the<00:03:46.699> BIOS<00:03:46.999> can<00:03:47.689> be<00:03:47.809> reset<00:03:48.169> and<00:03:48.349> that's<00:03:48.469> by

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
the BIOS can be reset and that's by

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.409 
the BIOS can be reset and that's by
pulling<00:03:48.919> out<00:03:49.010> that<00:03:49.189> memory<00:03:49.430> chip<00:03:49.669> and<00:03:49.879> these

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:50.419 
pulling out that memory chip and these

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:54.189 
pulling out that memory chip and these
things<00:03:50.719> are<00:03:50.870> as<00:03:51.230> low<00:03:51.379> as<00:03:51.409> $2<00:03:52.249> at<00:03:52.430> a<00:03:52.849> a<00:03:53.389> store<00:03:53.989> or

things are as low as $2 at a a store or
maybe<00:03:54.379> the<00:03:54.590> most<00:03:54.829> is<00:03:54.980> five<00:03:55.189> dollars<00:03:55.400> okay<00:03:56.299> for

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
maybe the most is five dollars okay for

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.789 
maybe the most is five dollars okay for
