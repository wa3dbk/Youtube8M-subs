00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.430 
quality is decent I suppose and I just
will<00:00:58.739> not<00:00:58.829> jest<00:00:59.219> but<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.820> had<00:01:00.570> surgery<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.379> few

will not jest but I had surgery a few
weeks<00:01:02.250> beforehand<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:04.159> move<00:01:05.159> movements<00:01:06.000> are

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
weeks beforehand so move movements are

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.929 
weeks beforehand so move movements are
kind<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.330> hard<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.570> do<00:01:09.710> right<00:01:10.710> now<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:11.250> box<00:01:11.549> is

let's<00:06:20.090> just<00:06:20.180> try<00:06:20.449> and<00:06:20.509> get<00:06:20.690> out<00:06:20.930> the<00:06:21.169> best<00:06:21.349> way

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
let's just try and get out the best way

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.409 
let's just try and get out the best way
I<00:06:21.560> can<00:06:21.729> because<00:06:22.729> I<00:06:22.819> can't<00:06:23.060> really<00:06:23.180> lift

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419 
I can because I can't really lift

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:25.020 
I can because I can't really lift
anything<00:06:23.690> heavy<00:06:24.020> when<00:06:24.500> I<00:06:24.530> was<00:06:24.680> recording

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
anything heavy when I was recording

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.689 
anything heavy when I was recording
because<00:06:26.030> it<00:06:26.750> could<00:06:27.020> have<00:06:27.199> strained<00:06:27.830> the<00:06:28.490> wound

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:28.699 
because it could have strained the wound

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:31.709 
because it could have strained the wound
I<00:06:28.880> had<00:06:29.090> is<00:06:29.360> an<00:06:30.080> open<00:06:30.469> wound<00:06:30.680> it<00:06:30.919> wasn't<00:06:30.949> sewn

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:31.719 
I had is an open wound it wasn't sewn

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:34.540 
I had is an open wound it wasn't sewn

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:44.690 
there or though a LX I believe it is

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.839 
there or though a LX I believe it is
because<00:06:45.349> it's<00:06:45.740> just<00:06:46.099> a<00:06:46.370> cool<00:06:46.550> looking

because it's just a cool looking
different<00:06:47.029> case<00:06:47.419> but<00:06:47.979> default<00:06:48.979> it<00:06:49.099> was<00:06:49.190> like

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.310 
different case but default it was like

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.510 
different case but default it was like
$2,000<00:06:50.300> it<00:06:51.169> was<00:06:51.409> better<00:06:51.740> than<00:06:51.979> what<00:06:52.159> I<00:06:52.190> got<00:06:52.490> I

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 
$2,000 it was better than what I got I

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.340 
$2,000 it was better than what I got I
believe<00:06:53.860> and<00:06:54.860> it's
