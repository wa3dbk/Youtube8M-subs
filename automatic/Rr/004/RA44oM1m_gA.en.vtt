00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 Play is a voluntary activity. 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.109
 and conscious a form of activity 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.880
 where the characteristic is 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.670
 the imagination and the various meanings 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.370
 of life in order to favor an occasion 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.170
 education for children is through 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.420
 of the joke that the child represents 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.180
 the external discourse and internalize 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.619
 building your own thinking 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.930
 developing their potential 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.539
 thinking that way said x christian 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.000
 led fini and ellen lousada created the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.460
 to play here in lucas do rio verde 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.079
 here is a collective play space 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.110
 in fact she has a routine 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.989
 differentiated from the routine of a school 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.719
 a day care center and a caregiver center here 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.680
 the child comes to play to exercise 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.320
 your play activities are not going well 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.270
 different from what happens in schools 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.309
 In this sense, the toy library 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.320
 a great responsibility because it is a 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.410
 space where the child begins to experience 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.210
 situations of their daily lives creating and 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.570
 developing his own personality 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.990
 ethical values â€‹â€‹and attitudes towards 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.680
 other children play like everyone else 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.450
 know is an exercise of personality to 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.220
 child is joking that the child 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.500
 is building that she is going 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.259
 representing adult life models 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.049
 with whom she lives with whom she 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.729
 It looks like it 's just a joke. 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.520
 also that we can start 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.640
 observe the child's personality 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.990
 the great joys that the child has 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.210
 during play 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.009
 a good example of this is the angel who 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.720
 only 2 years shows that it is 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.610
 following the vain steps of the morning 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.950
 juliana france since its space 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.439
 Favorite is the dressing room where she can wear 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.750
 and to abuse the imagination and still be 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.750
 more beautiful with the children's makeup 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.539
 the mother of the owl is all good, right? 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.850
 mainly stays happy and quiet in 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.159
 know the seriousness and commitment of 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.649
 all professionals the toy library and 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.629
 ends up going back in time and taking advantage of 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.370
 the moments with your little ones 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.730
 parents need that kids 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.160
 They like it very much and what's cool is that they do not 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.830
 It's age, I came here and I realize how 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.810
 mother as a child and toy 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.819
 friend of my childhood of my time 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.739
 stimulates my children and I see that 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.200
 they get calmer because in this 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.049
 holiday time is complicated, right? 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.700
 Baba, it's really hard for you to talk because 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.920
 I've had terrible experiences with 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.410
 bad judy haim from my kids 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.480
 already the Lucy brothers lucas pandolf 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.730
 and attend the united space and 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.549
 much more fun than if you were 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:49.140
 at home and the best with only one rule 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:52.650
 can not get hurt do not have to charge 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:57.090
 who can attack balls but then who 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.489
 either side of these tests is pretty cool 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.100
 have a pula time squid pula has had 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.630
 puzzle board toy mother 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.670
 it's a very good toy library 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.880
 another point well worked by aunts 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.859
 she in crisis is musicality a form 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.260
 of expressing the feeling 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:17.489
 they come here they end they want 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:21.840
 singing is the battery is our battery you 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:24.150
 So come on and want to play drums and I think 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.519
 that the field now had the cam and starts to 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.769
 of the spider lady climbing the wall from here 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.380
 there was little there was a house that 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.180
 nothing and sing everything changed and everything goes 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.780
 singing now you sing I had the 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.989
 and this part of the musicality she 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:43.940
 enchants because the music speaks nÃ© to the music 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:46.919
 Speech and you're there, the child is quiet. 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:51.110
 go play he came in shy right? 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:53.270
 I do not want to just look at it 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.610
 movement begins there. 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.670
 sing and play the drums begin to take a 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.800
 look at the crisis those look from afar 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.580
 and talk like this, go and my love will sing 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.900
 along catiele talking with strollers 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.640
 soon he will be coming 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.100
 touching is constant when selling 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.850
 singing we ever sing that other 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:16.459
 it so goes then the part of the song is 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.079
 passion and now the horizons of playing 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.150
 will grow even more 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.520
 from February the experiences 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.010
 growth difficulty expectations 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.690
 experienced by children as well as by their 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.210
 families for part of the program 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.190
 infant time to play another one 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.350
 earth tv production 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.400
 everything is going to be very new was our 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.370
 expectancy 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.080
 our expectation is first fun 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.310
 place with the kids 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:45.919
 to offer mothers conditions to be 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.500
 interacting with snow to a program of 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:51.169
 always the same 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.150
 Let's talk about television today. 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.250
 people will watch something different and 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.740
 I will be able to watch with my son and 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.950
 I think in this role there is no terrestrial tv 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.800
 in the table growing a lot in the question 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.560
 of the program interactions for all 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.030
 public that the children's 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.220
 fact he will also have his 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.470
 teach me to play 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.180
 This objective of this toy library 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.880
 is showing that anyone can be 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.979
 happy and enjoy the world of imagination 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.979
 Finally, to play, there is no age. 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.820
 ae 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.820
 ah
