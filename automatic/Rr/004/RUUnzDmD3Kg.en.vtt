call<00:02:39.650> it<00:02:39.880> here<00:02:40.880> are<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.210> custom<00:02:42.110> plug<00:02:42.380> wires<00:02:42.650> I

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
call it here are the custom plug wires I

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.850 
call it here are the custom plug wires I
actually<00:02:43.040> made<00:02:43.970> these<00:02:44.180> are<00:02:45.170> you<00:02:45.500> know<00:02:45.620> cut

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
what else to say I've just spraying some

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.710 
what else to say I've just spraying some
PB<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.700> boers<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.060> turning<00:03:05.420> it<00:03:05.510> over<00:03:05.600> to

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
PB and the boers and turning it over to

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.930 
PB and the boers and turning it over to
make<00:03:05.900> sure<00:03:06.050> everything<00:03:06.350> was<00:03:06.440> fine<00:03:06.850> pulled<00:03:07.850> the

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
pressure gauge that's going to mount on

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.270

there<00:03:14.540> i<00:03:14.690> flipped<00:03:15.230> on<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:15.410> manifolds<00:03:15.920> the

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
there i flipped on the manifolds the

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.990 
there i flipped on the manifolds the
turbo<00:03:16.640> will<00:03:16.790> sit<00:03:16.940> like<00:03:17.090> right<00:03:17.440> here-ish<00:03:18.440> oh

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000

yeah<00:03:20.000> that<00:03:20.510> upside<00:03:20.810> down<00:03:20.930> manifold<00:03:21.380> beauty

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
yeah that upside down manifold beauty

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:29.220 
yeah that upside down manifold beauty
anyway<00:03:22.850> time<00:03:23.360> to<00:03:23.480> move<00:03:23.570> on<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:24.260> the<00:03:25.070> chassis
