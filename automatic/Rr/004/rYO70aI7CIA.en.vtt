00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
off and you also have your volume

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.210 
off and you also have your volume
control<00:02:18.019> some<00:02:19.019> more<00:02:19.140> things<00:02:19.380> on<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.680> back<00:02:19.860> you

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
control some more things on the back you

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.490 
control some more things on the back you
have<00:02:20.280> here<00:02:20.730> mo<00:02:21.209> I<00:02:21.450> know<00:02:21.660> out<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.830> also<00:02:23.580> your<00:02:24.500> DC

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
have here mo I know out and also your DC

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.360 
have here mo I know out and also your DC
6<00:02:26.190> volt<00:02:26.580> out<00:02:27.060> or<00:02:27.989> in<00:02:28.549> in<00:02:29.549> and<00:02:30.739> I<00:02:31.739> think<00:02:32.160> that

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
6 volt out or in in and I think that

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.900 
6 volt out or in in and I think that
completes<00:02:32.730> our<00:02:33.890> review<00:02:34.890> on<00:02:35.190> this<00:02:35.430> for<00:02:35.730> this

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
completes our review on this for this

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.319 
completes our review on this for this
video<00:02:36.299> and<00:02:38.630> I<00:02:40.579> guess<00:02:41.579> that's<00:02:41.790> it

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
video and I guess that's it

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.229 
video and I guess that's it
and<00:02:42.420> we'll<00:02:42.690> see<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.260> you'll<00:02:44.069> see<00:02:44.340> me<00:02:44.579> in<00:02:44.819> the

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
and we'll see you you'll see me in the

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.260 
and we'll see you you'll see me in the
next<00:02:45.870> videos
