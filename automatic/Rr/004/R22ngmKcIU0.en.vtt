just right on the front you think that
you

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
you

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.760 
you
that<00:02:13.620> it's<00:02:13.770> too<00:02:14.100> too<00:02:14.670> obvious<00:02:15.240> but<00:02:15.570> it's<00:02:16.320> not

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
that it's too too obvious but it's not

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.790 
that it's too too obvious but it's not
because<00:02:17.130> people<00:02:18.140> when<00:02:19.140> they<00:02:19.260> come<00:02:19.500> into<00:02:19.650> the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
because people when they come into the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.200 
because people when they come into the
world<00:02:19.950> they're<00:02:20.250> just<00:02:20.460> looking<00:02:20.610> for<00:02:20.970> random

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
world they're just looking for random

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.410 
world they're just looking for random
things<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.840> thing<00:02:22.080> is<00:02:22.260> like<00:02:22.940> how<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:23.970> set

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
things and the thing is like how I set

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.570 
things and the thing is like how I set
it<00:02:24.570> up<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.930> everything<00:02:25.020> how<00:02:25.650> there's<00:02:26.520> a

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
it up and everything how there's a

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.830 
it up and everything how there's a
little<00:02:26.760> button<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:28.670> pretty<00:02:29.670> much<00:02:29.730> they<00:02:30.180> hit

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
little button and pretty much they hit

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.270 
little button and pretty much they hit
the<00:02:30.960> button<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.410> they<00:02:31.500> go<00:02:31.680> in<00:02:31.860> there<00:02:32.070> like<00:02:32.190> oh

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
the button and they go in there like oh

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.370 
the button and they go in there like oh

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
they're like well here's a switch so and

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.150 
they're like well here's a switch so and
they<00:02:38.580> really<00:02:38.940> they're<00:02:39.840> like<00:02:40.020> okay<00:02:40.320> well<00:02:40.560> of

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
course it's might might be a trap but

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.760 
course it's might might be a trap but
you<00:02:43.800> never<00:02:44.010> know<00:02:44.250> because<00:02:45.080> you<00:02:46.080> never<00:02:46.200> know<00:02:46.380> so

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
you never know because you never know so

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.590 
you never know because you never know so

we we we are low run on maps in this
world<00:03:02.730> so<00:03:03.090> or<00:03:03.380> run<00:03:04.380> low<00:03:04.650> on<00:03:04.680> maps<00:03:05.130> in<00:03:05.340> this

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
world so or run low on maps in this

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.140 
world so or run low on maps in this
world<00:03:05.730> so<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:07.170> diamond<00:03:07.560> check<00:03:07.770> is<00:03:07.980> is<00:03:08.940> the

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
world so the diamond check is is the

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.380 
world so the diamond check is is the
place<00:03:09.860> the<00:03:10.860> place<00:03:10.890> yeah<00:03:11.490> well<00:03:11.820> you're<00:03:12.240> not
