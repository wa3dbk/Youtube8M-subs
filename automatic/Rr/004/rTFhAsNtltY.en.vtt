 Snowy the hot desert raid

 presents all the conditions that 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.229
 allow to test vehicles and 

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:59.870
 in particular euro 4 technologies and

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.570
 this human and technical adventure 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.119
 is for the French manufacturer 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.920
 a great opportunity to promote 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.329
 his products and meet a lot 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.890
 of customers from different countries crossed 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.899
 it is a relationship operation 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.969
 public but also motivational 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.130
 internal since the vehicles are 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:30.740
 driven by 65 employees renault trucks 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.840
 from 14 different nationalities 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:38.209
 relaying during the four months of 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:41.720
 the odyssey the selection of drivers was 

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:42.709
 done in a very democratic way 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.649
 especially what I liked is 

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:46.280
 that there was nevertheless a call to 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.450
 staff 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.979
 we had about 250 response and 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.509
 we did at first a 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.539
 draw to retain a 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:02:00.739
 hundred is sure it's driverless so 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:02.420
 we finally chose 65 that 

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:06.409
 were actually selected in 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.150
 function on the one hand of their skills 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.610
 in 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.370
 in mechanics of their skills and 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.930
 their ease in driving but we 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.030
 do not have a professional driver 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.130
 we have people who have their license 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.930
 heavyweight but who do not drive 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.550
 necessarily all year round and which have 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.460
 very well suited to wishes tok'ra 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.770
 whether it's tanks I have never 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.210
 Sherpa 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.670
 the first day we made costs 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.560
 will have to allow me to 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.069
 the laughing stock 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.749
 who is a vehicle them 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.480
 I did say the weight and the 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:37.210
 template of a truck 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.120
 to pick up 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.530
 to these funds after the first 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.980
 day it was after we did a little 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.849
 of track that was the sphere of 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.240
 best three quarters of an hour for me 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.730
 raise 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.780
 things are going well 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.780
 well he passes the obstacles well 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.240
 enough enough 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.360
 it's funny jumped to other 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.460
 I'm not too brutal 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.569
 anti slip gently it is not beautiful the 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.319
 sport 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.319
 in his something remarkable 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.660
 we're here to do tests too 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.840
 to validate a number of things 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.880
 so obviously that the land 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.470
 are not easy but it allows us to 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.020
 check it 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.940
 the good solutions it is less good 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.340
 Sherpas are more prototypes 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.080
 direct for now we do not have too much 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.880
 worries about circus units it's something 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.420
 thing that's happening is happening relatively 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.950
 well 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.900
 there will be a number of things to 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.510
 improve like everything 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.129
 of course but the main thing is to 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.180
 acquire a certain amount of data 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.569
 then to make sure that 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.140
 it would be 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.140
 at the cyber base 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.110
 it was also a bit of a chance to 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.820
 to test telemedicine because we 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.100
 takes care of the telemedicine tests in this 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.890
 moment for different apps that 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.120
 in the mountains joel g in africa for 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.740
 dispensaries and except that this 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.700
 suitcase it's a prototype we're going 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.860
 test and try to use and 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:46.850
 with this suitcase we can do full 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:49.040
 review that smoke can not read 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.330
 finally can not translate is 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.650
 diagnosed but against the 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.690
 send live with a specialist 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.670
 which will be conducted in France and which 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:02.080
 would allow the eradication ine that 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:02.080
 Masked diagnosis with small sensor 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.020
 needs a little more the vehicle this 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:13.110
 autumn with five people it's not 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.810
 bad little electrical problem that avoids 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.810
 that they have that starts so we're going 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:28.680
 we have to look at that it will take 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:30.449
 a little bit of time but I'm used to that 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.340
 it is a relay that comes to collect 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:34.259
 clichy water the droids to launch to 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.530
 side receives the 17 flights by a security 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:39.389
 from the side of the to complete up to 24 the 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.530
 mass is done by the christmas contactor 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.050
 in peace let it start again now 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.469
 do a cure so at my recent test that 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.680
 heated 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:48.449
 the coil is hot the son is 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.370
 disconnects in someone who infuriates 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:52.469
 course game and we wait for that 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.419
 cool down and what happened at the 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:55.430
 the township station to do a little 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.719
 intervention 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:02.460
 people immediately proposes 

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:04.830
 for for to help and even those who do not 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.509
 do not know about mechanical wear 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.440
 a tool where I get up and ema 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:09.810
 outdoors 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.240
 well I'm in charge of the case that is 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:16.130
 that she's driving workshop with all the 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.130
 logistics to find the parts yes 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.680
 but here is a demand 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:22.880
 so we are going to attend 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.480
 it is true that we are not bored in this 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.630
 meaning where we start very early in the morning 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.040
 and we end relatively 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.090
 of art in the day because we said 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.210
 is a bit of bad luck to 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.740
 maintenance to ensure 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.090
 on board, however, as we are 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:40.110
 perfectly autonomous since we have 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:41.699
 a calendar is the europe on 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.759
 is pretty stupid but finally everything happens 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:43.759
 well
