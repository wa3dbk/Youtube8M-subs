00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:16.299

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:23.070
 It is Suzuki Hustler first time special specification 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:27.510
 Is not it from the first time special? 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.960
 Something is different this time, it has become the first time special specification 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.960
 Sure 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.039

 It number of special color has become the first specification this 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:45.150
 Well will be transparent feeling of the last year of 2014 after j at home means that I'm talking about me too late 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.320

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:08.260
 It is the first time special color in the catalog here 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:14.250
 Maybe it's a mistake 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.250
 I already had this kind of thing before , so it's good together 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.510
 It is an action that is different or meaning 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.619
 Even if it is a car 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.619
 Nice color This color is nice 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.100

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.840
 There is an action 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.840

 The back door turns cold 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.670
 I really like this personally I wonder if the back is cool 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:05.870
 It is to say that I bought and broke the first special specification of the monthly seller's cellar 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.870
