00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
like this zoom too much let me turn it

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:14.030 
like this zoom too much let me turn it
off<00:03:10.489> okay<00:03:11.489> so<00:03:12.090> it<00:03:12.209> says<00:03:12.389> it<00:03:12.719> cannot<00:03:13.319> find<00:03:13.769> this

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
off okay so it says it cannot find this

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.869 
off okay so it says it cannot find this
either<00:03:15.199> so<00:03:16.199> the<00:03:16.560> next<00:03:16.590> step<00:03:17.269> to<00:03:18.269> try<00:03:18.569> is<00:03:19.879> delete

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
either so the next step to try is delete

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:28.490 
either so the next step to try is delete
the<00:03:21.030> short<00:03:21.299> file<00:03:21.629> name<00:03:26.359> then<00:03:27.359> it<00:03:27.479> asks<00:03:27.840> are<00:03:28.109> you

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
the short file name then it asks are you

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.369 
the short file name then it asks are you
sure<00:03:29.180> so<00:03:30.180> it<00:03:30.329> seems<00:03:30.509> like<00:03:30.780> it<00:03:30.930> knows<00:03:31.139> it's

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
sure so it seems like it knows it's

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.219 
sure so it seems like it knows it's
there<00:03:31.590> it's<00:03:31.859> asking<00:03:32.340> if<00:03:32.489> I'm<00:03:32.639> sure<00:03:32.900> so<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:33.930> say

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:34.229 
there it's asking if I'm sure so I say

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:36.170 
there it's asking if I'm sure so I say
yep<00:03:34.439> and<00:03:34.680> then<00:03:35.159> I<00:03:35.310> don't<00:03:35.519> get<00:03:35.729> any<00:03:35.909> error

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
yep and then I don't get any error

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.939

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
looks like it's lab5 one part a so

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.810 
looks like it's lab5 one part a so
that's<00:05:02.870> the<00:05:03.110> directory<00:05:03.890> and<00:05:04.100> then<00:05:04.160> if<00:05:04.550> we

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
that's the directory and then if we

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:18.460 
that's the directory and then if we
switch<00:05:05.750> to<00:05:05.780> the<00:05:06.170> dose<00:05:09.610> area<00:05:16.060> you<00:05:17.060> can<00:05:17.240> see<00:05:17.470> it's

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
switch to the dose area you can see it's

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.290 
switch to the dose area you can see it's
the<00:05:18.650> same<00:05:18.680> or<00:05:19.160> similar<00:05:19.340> i'll<00:05:19.700> change<00:05:19.940> it<00:05:20.090> so

200<00:05:57.490> pretty<00:05:58.490> strange<00:05:58.760> huh<00:06:02.919> try<00:06:03.919> it<00:06:04.010> again

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.940 

there's<00:06:10.580> the<00:06:10.760> directory<00:06:11.530> now<00:06:12.530> let's<00:06:12.740> try<00:06:12.890> to

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:43.820 
capitalized for the both ales so this is

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.840 
capitalized for the both ales so this is

capitalized know if it has a buffer long

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.950 
capitalized know if it has a buffer long
enough<00:06:52.220> to<00:06:52.370> get<00:06:52.610> to<00:06:52.760> the<00:06:52.880> delete<00:06:53.420> part<00:06:53.720> and

enough to get to the delete part and

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.310 
enough to get to the delete part and
then<00:06:54.530> I<00:06:54.830> can<00:06:55.010> try<00:06:55.160> to<00:06:55.190> delete<00:06:55.550> it<00:06:55.730> again<00:06:56.320> are
