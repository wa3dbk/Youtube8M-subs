00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:15.460
 How are we gamers doing the 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.410
 Army trophy three men 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.040
 The first part is to get the 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.040
 three characters 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.040
 we have franklin in his room in 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.510
 the floor below and I'll put to trevor 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.220
 that I have brought from the point where 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.140
 I was 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.030
 in the upper part of the house to 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.760
 avoid that they are worth 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.620
 we leave you in the kitchen and now 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.480
 we selected michael which is the last 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.739
 that we lack the had a michael for the 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.750
 final because it is the one that is usually the most 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.750
 near the franklin house 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.800
 Michael, we are going to take you to the 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.800
 let's select it on the map 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.570
 here I would be 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.769
 just take it to there step 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.769
 this part so that it is not boring 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.920
 once we have arrived at the house of 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.119
 franklin let's check that the others 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.119
 two characters have not moved 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.440
 we have trevor in the perfect kitchen 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.570
 already franklin on the floor below 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.920
 I'm going to select a clover because then 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.830
 we can not choose between the three 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.020
 characters and he wants to use his helicopter 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.720
 and if we go with another character to the hangar 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.580
 of trevor there will be no helicopter 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.260
 you can also have bought a hangar 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.940
 and helicopters on our own can you 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.070
 choosing the character you want is 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.690
 I'm going to do it by approaching the 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.910
 prison we simply make it 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.130
 find the characters the first we 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.730
 will say that if we want to take something we give 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.000
 to the right button 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.930
 saying yes and now we go out 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.850
 we can go out the main door 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.980
 because we are not the owner of the house like that 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.420
 that we went through this and when we met 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:10.030
 with maikel and simply joins the 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.220
 two other characters now in a little while 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.880
 you will see that without problems the 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.880
 three in 8 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.790
 in this 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.370
 perfect once we have our 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.019
 characters what I've done to 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.260
 quickly get the stars of 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.480
 search 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.200
 is to take a helicopter so I go to 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.200
 clover hangar 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.430
 step this part is simply to take them 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.430
 there 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.150
 comes to the helicopter all this I put it 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.459
 accelerated to give you an idea 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.269
 I just take the helicopter 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.269
 we assemble the 3 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.819
 although the trophy says spend three minutes 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.799
 with three search stars can 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.299
 being four is now worth it in jail 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.260
 will give after a little while four 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.120
 stars 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.549
 what we have to do now is 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.500
 hold three minutes whenever the 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.840
 formal stars let's approach a 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.569
 little bit to some police car or some 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.769
 helicopter because now we do 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.769
 Interested in being persecuted 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.140
 what I do is hold on 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.140
 maximum possible time in the helicopter 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.420
 always in motion, it's worth 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.420
 because they are going to shoot us 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:40.590
 important to have the three characters 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.970
 it's like protector with life jacket 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.960
 because if someone is injured they can 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.270
 rare things happen 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.990
 then in the end put an example of a 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.990
 failure that I had 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.349
 OK 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.060
 when we see that the helicopter already 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.599
 it starts to smoke a lot that we run 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.599
 risk 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:06.190
 let's leave the helicopter 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.870
 we get quickly with a car 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.060
 we hope so for our two 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.450
 comrades when the three are already 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.450
 keep running 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.930
 they are four stars so do not have 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:20.930
 modesty in and fast because they are going to 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:24.100
 constantly chase are you 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.100
 following helicopters cars 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.210
 the barricades 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.880
 and hold out until the trophy pops 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:47.869
 Here you see, it has already jumped 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.860
 and now I'm going to give you an example of 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.480
 a kind of mistake that I had because 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.130
 I had the other two characters without 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.729
 lifejacket 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:03.120
 franklin has been injured 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:06.479
 and what happened next was that 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.270
 michael has been scared and as soon as he stops 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.939
 a little car got out no 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:15.020
 I could avoid it then also dies but 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:16.970
 even if he had not died he was already leaving 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.110
 therefore with two characters there 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.110
 we would have got him
