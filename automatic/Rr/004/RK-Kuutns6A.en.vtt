too<00:01:25.470> as<00:01:25.740> far<00:01:25.950> as<00:01:26.780> how<00:01:27.780> they<00:01:27.930> look<00:01:28.140> when<00:01:28.259> they're

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
too as far as how they look when they're

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
finished up not too bad let's take a

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.590 
finished up not too bad let's take a
look<00:01:32.909> at<00:01:33.000> these<00:01:33.150> parts<00:01:33.540> here<00:01:34.130> first<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.250> all

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
look at these parts here first of all

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.320 
look at these parts here first of all
we'll<00:01:36.600> look<00:01:36.720> at<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:38.210> Romulan<00:01:39.210> bird-of-prey

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
we'll look at the Romulan bird-of-prey

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.260 
we'll look at the Romulan bird-of-prey
now<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.860> looks<00:01:41.070> pretty<00:01:41.430> familiar<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:42.119> looks

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
now it looks pretty familiar it looks

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.780 
now it looks pretty familiar it looks
just<00:01:42.330> like<00:01:42.510> the<00:01:42.750> larger<00:01:43.380> scale<00:01:43.740> kit<00:01:44.070> from<00:01:44.310> amt

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
just like the larger scale kit from amt

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.300 
just like the larger scale kit from amt
not<00:01:45.479> accurate<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.260> actual<00:01:46.619> model<00:01:47.040> itself

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
not accurate to the actual model itself

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.490 
not accurate to the actual model itself
that<00:01:47.520> was<00:01:47.610> used<00:01:47.820> on<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.150> show<00:01:48.360> but<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:49.110> good

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
that was used on the show but a good

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.469 
that was used on the show but a good
representation<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.580> you<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.180> see<00:01:51.330> it's

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
representation of it you can see it's

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.880 
representation of it you can see it's
got<00:01:51.630> kind<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:52.020> different<00:01:52.170> shape<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:52.710> got

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
got kind of a different shape it's got

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.100 
got kind of a different shape it's got
the<00:01:53.150> warp<00:01:54.150> nacelles<00:01:54.510> that<00:01:54.689> are<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> little<00:01:54.930> bit

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
the warp nacelles that are a little bit

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.750 
the warp nacelles that are a little bit
different<00:01:55.470> than<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.770> pylons<00:01:56.430> here<00:01:56.610> were

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
different than the pylons here were

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.640 
different than the pylons here were
shaped<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.750> little<00:01:58.170> different<00:01:58.470> on<00:01:58.500> the
