00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.970

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.460

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.140

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.820
 to look lovely is an edition 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.189
 limited and because well I know that some 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.080
 of you you have it seems to me that 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.230
 deserved a review this palette so 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.610

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.949

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.129

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:42.920
 palette is this is the summer eye palette 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.510
 of the two face and good is an edition 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.369
 limited as I tell you from the summer that 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.879
 according to what the girls of sephora told me 

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:52.280
 it's only going to be this summer if it sounds 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.049
 well I do not know if it will stay for more 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.720
 forward the thing is that well I wanted 

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:59.210
 this palette but what I always say 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.610
 I already have too much of these things 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.460
 always my sister the the girl died and 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.439
 As it was, it was a sale. 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.259
 was around 25% for makeup 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.600
 good in the valid palette 34 and there was a 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.880
 25% discount so he stayed 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.090
 super good price 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.530
 well once the box is like you see 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.590
 It's cute, it does not even pull the card 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.259
 because I think it's beautiful this is the 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.570
 palette from behind is how you see it 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.280
 like the bottom of a pool or the 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.869
 beach of those who are lucky that 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.500
 have these kinds of beaches that are 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:35.140
 see the piecitos between the water is a 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.060
 pretty little palette vouchers is not 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.740
 very big the palette and it's done 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.270
 when I hit him so much murga my 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.890
 sister that I liked the palette of 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.399
 such but when he saw it he told me but if 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.259

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.619
 I'm going to bring it closer so that 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:53.590
 you can see that the shooter has 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.149
 It opens like this once the pallet is 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.630
 open we have by the top 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.549

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.500
 cards 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.929
 These three cards are three looks 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.569
 different things you can do with them 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.579
 I wear the look this done well more or 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.079
 less is not the same as it is this 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:14.019

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.040
 to go out one night or whatever is good 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.210
 that on the one hand and the palette is this me 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.650
 at first I thought that this was 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.010
 illuminators but good you can 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.750
 use as you want each look 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.000
 of the palette that is reflected in the 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.020

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.820
 to make them suárez for you to see 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.150
 alright so good the first line is 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:51.120
 a rose with satin does not have 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.460
 flashes is a satin pink then a 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.240
 rose higher and finally a tone 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:59.070
 Toasted brown does not have the 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.410
 shimmer that has the one below but hey 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.820
 It's a medium brown and I'm going to do it in 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.030
 the other hands so you can see how 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.040
 It looks good because the first tone I take it 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.790
 He fingers and taught them how is see 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:16.070
 is a satin-colored rosette the second tone is 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.070
 a matte rose is the tone plumeria 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.569
 and the third tone is the cocoa beach tone 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:26.219
 what is this tone here 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.219
 and placed in the hand 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.060
 because they are such that it is so in order 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.030
 just as they are here then there the 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.310
 you are seeing are really the truth tones 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.600
 pretty very summery and good this 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.060
 makeup in concrete is going to be a 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.530
 pretty natural makeup the next 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.080
 As you can see, it's me and the other 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.110
 it's more at night so I think it 's 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.630
 beautiful this palette 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.640
 and well there you have the first the first 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.130
 row the second row which are the tones 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.670
 that I carry today I show you the first 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:04.700
 tone is the tone pitch &amp; putt that put 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.130
 class and havalina says that the tones are worth 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.740
 they put the make-up that I teach you 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.540
 is the first one is called and i 'what good 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.610
 it's a second diary makeup puts 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.740
 which is the classic and the second and the 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.370
 third the fashion those are the 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:21.739
 makeups that laying beige 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.840
 classic and fashion and refers to all the 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.470
 line is worth the first pitch is the pitch 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.010
 food that is this tone is what I carry 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.950
 in the lacrimal and in the arch of the eyebrow 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:36.050
 the second tone is the coral back that is 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.000
 the one that I carry on the mobile eyelid that is 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.160
 this tone is a coral tone with a lot 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.160
 of golden sparkles 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:47.660
 and the third tone is chocolate sanz 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.090
 what is this tone 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.510
 or this is the same in the hand that they give 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.510
 that way 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:01.230
 well the tone of medium that is the tone 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.360
 coral did not take much quantity but good 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.760
 The more quantity you put, the more 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.440
 up is going to see the tone and how you 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.110
 I say I have put a shadow under 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.810
 orange and is one which cream for 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.060
 give it more intensity but let's go 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.500
 palette I wanted it mainly because 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:22.380
 the shadow coral color and shadow 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:25.560
 of the next look that is not a 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:28.110
 shadow similar to that of war nyala ni to 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.760
 the mac key but now you will see that it is 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.540
 a pretty pretty special shadow 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.490
 well the next row carries this tone 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.070
 hence it is a more vanished tone 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:42.120
 this is more coral the azulito that you 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:44.190
 it said and a matte brown that is kind like 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.650
 the express shadow of mac so that you 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:50.289
 make an idea well this is the first 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.539
 tone is the zombie tone 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:55.200
 what is similar to the previous one but now 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:57.390
 I say it 's a more vanilla tone 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.009
 the mermaid shadow that is the shadow most 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:03.849
 pretty from the palette 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:05.770
 what is this shadow is a blue with a 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:10.289
 little dot of brown you will see it blurred 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.289
 how is it and you took it coconut 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.740
 what is a brown then as I said a 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:19.580
 brown a coffee with milk 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:21.229
 and put in your hand are left like this you see 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.070
 that is beautiful the blue shadow that you 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:27.340
 he said is very very pretty 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:29.590
 I do not know I think this shadow is beautiful and 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:32.740
 the last one also seems to me good at 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:36.250
 include a little bit of brown shadow 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:39.790
 it's not all if measurable or it gives the 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.620
 palette plus more varied tones so 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:44.230
 nothing this ice the palette as you see in 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.940
 some lovely shadows my sister to 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:49.390
 contrary that I said is that the palette 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:51.790
 no, it's not worth it, let's see what 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:54.010
 I have many pallets she told me 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:56.320
 it was not worth the price that it marked since 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:07:00.220
 she for 36 euros 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:02.110
 I think 36 or 34 934 with 70 I think I said 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:05.620
 that it was not worth it because then because 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:07.390
 these tones and these tones here are 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.040
 some shades in beige and brown what 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.960
 good have many pallets of the 

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.090
 that I have and said no but to me 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:16.930
 like I already tell you by the coral tone and by 

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:19.750
 the blue tone is that is an expression are 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:22.300
 venues among blue gray one point of brown 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.770
 and I wanted it so good and the good 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.139
 two shadows 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.669
 how are you seeing then to have the 

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:30.129
 golden flashes make them very 

00:07:27.669 --> 00:07:32.409
 special 

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:34.509
 and well, nothing has been the palette 

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:37.239
 I wanted to show you the background so you can see 

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:40.269
 as pigmented and how beautiful is the 

00:07:37.239 --> 00:07:42.879
 I see beautiful to give as in this 

00:07:40.269 --> 00:07:44.679
 case has happened to me and nothing like it 

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:47.139
 has promised I'll make you a look with 

00:07:44.679 --> 00:07:49.179
 each of the rows the first one is this 

00:07:47.139 --> 00:07:51.519
 as I said before and nothing 

00:07:49.179 --> 00:07:53.499
 then I will upload that video are 

00:07:51.519 --> 00:07:55.719
 those next in the other but good 

00:07:53.499 --> 00:07:57.309
 that is already recorded so I do not expect anything 

00:07:55.719 --> 00:08:00.580
 that you liked the video that always 

00:07:57.309 --> 00:08:03.659
 I say a very strong kiss to all and we 

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.659
 we see in the next chao
