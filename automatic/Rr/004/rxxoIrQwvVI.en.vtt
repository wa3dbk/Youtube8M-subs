00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.680
 we will speak in this video of 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.180
 dispersion and refraction of the 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.590
 light 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:16.190
 so to start the dispersion that is 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.750
 what is it then dispersion of the 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.970
 white light to start if you 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.230
 take a white light source a 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.660
 beam of white light and that you 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.509
 the send on a prism so a prism 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.240
 you saw it is a glass object and 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.740
 well you will see at the exit of the prism 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.380
 who had a decomposition actually you 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.329
 see a beam that has spread out 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.730
 input beam was spread out according to 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.110
 all the colors of the rainbow 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.610
 so you have a separation based 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.580
 colors according to the lengths 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.470
 of wave and this decomposition there it is 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.170
 that the phenomenon of dispersion on 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.640
 scatters the light so the figure that 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.590
 gets to the exit the this 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.630
 decomposition 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.760
 this is called the spectrum of the 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.980
 white light since we sent the 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.690
 white light on it now 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.980
 what happens if instead 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.129
 to send white light 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.490
 we see a monochromatic light 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:09.530
 so for example a laser so you redo 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.509
 the same experience sending a laser 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.729
 red on the prism and what are you 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.170
 want to watch at the battered exit goes 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.060
 actually observe only one beam 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.789
 this time there is no decomposition 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.810
 of beams and elsewhere it's like 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.060
 we know it's a light 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.159
 monochromatic it is because there is 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.719
 no decomposition we know that 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.140
 it is a so-called monochromatic light 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:32.749
 mono means chromatic 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.229
 colors a color so since there are 

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:38.299
 that a color can not be broken down 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.979
 here I have not written them but if you 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.490
 repeat the same word here you can say 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.719
 polychromatic there are several colors 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.420
 so speaking of color it takes 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:49.369
 we talk about wavelength 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.329
 since each color is attached to 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.100
 a wavelength 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.740
 so that's what we see here sweat 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.530
 on this diagram the wavelengths of the 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.039
 visible light it goes from 400 to 800 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.229
 nanometers at 400 you have an edge this is the 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.630
 purple is at 8 100 nanometers 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.069
 you have the end of red the red he 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.330
 start before it starts you see a 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.490
 not appreciated 100 nanometers 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.930
 and then between mata all the others 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.959
 colors blue green yellow red ok 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.799
 so that's light scattering 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.530
 now we will go to the second 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:23.530
 part the refraction of light that's 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.480
 different then already the definition of the 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.549
 refraction of light this is the 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.639
 change of direction that will undergo a 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:33.370
 ray of light when he passes from one 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:34.989
 middle another middle so that's 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.150
 when it crosses the surface of 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.680
 separation between one medium and another 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:44.139
 transparent medium each of these backgrounds 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.870
 have characterized it in optics by its 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:48.040
 refractive index small m 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.560
 so how does one calculate small n is this 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.269
 that you can calculate and yes in 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.780
 exercises we can we can do it 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.480
 calculate 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.540
 so you have to know this equation 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.519
 small n index of refraction is equal to 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.349
 the speed of speed to speed 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.900
 forgiveness of light in the void 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.780
 / the speed of light in this 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.549
 middle in there well yeah because actually the 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.370
 light is not going at the same speed in 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.900
 the vacuum or for example in the water so 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.650
 if I give you these two speeds in 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.329
 meter per second 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.129
 you take your calculator you make the 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.449
 division and you will find the value of 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:24.069
 small hates the refractive index 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:26.229
 of this environment and you need to know 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.720
 least these three values ​​ie 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:31.659
 the refractive index of the air is 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.599
 a Monday of refraction of water that 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:35.829
 about 1.33 and the index poured 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.389
 about 1.5 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.069
 so it's important that you know them 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:42.970
 this possibly shame and will call back 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:45.209
 not in the exercises and now we 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.959
 arrives on the most important part 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.680
 concerning the refraction of light 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:53.439
 it's the law of snell cards 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.810
 so we said that refraction was 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:57.250
 a change of direction 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.009
 when you go from one medium to another 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.799
 so look at this diagram this diagram 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:03.370
 precisely up there above the line 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.739
 horizontal 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.639
 this part up there is the middle 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:11.979
 1 is the first middle down you have 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:15.699
 the second middle and so what do we do 

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:16.659
 it is that we send a ray of light that 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:18.430
 comes from above 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:19.750
 so they go through the first middle and 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.519
 you see he's going through the second 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.690
 middle and what did we say we said 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.409
 when he changed his environment he was going 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.419
 change direction 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:26.440
 well that's what we see the beam 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.990
 there he changed direction 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.530
 when entering the second medium he 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.090
 there is a law that binds all of this 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.520
 to find hideous when you have nothing and that's 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.540
 so we're going to come here so we need it 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.250
 must specify a very important thing 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.800
 how does one characterize the angle 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.920
 with which the beam enter the 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.510
 middle well, we decided to take 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.730
 as a reference the normal so you see 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.050
 the dotted line that I traced you there 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.940
 will have to do in the exercises 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.230
 so first of all you trace the 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.690
 separation of the two environments and 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.630
 secondly you dotted traces a 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.700
 perpendicular to the surface of 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.380
 separation in match you know we 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.690
 uses indifferently perpendicular 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.120
 or normal it's the same thing 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.250
 what's called the normal right to 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.980
 this line is perpendicular 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.330
 so I'm dotted and well 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.700
 what is called the angle of incidence 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.040
 that is to say the angle with which the 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:24.220
 ray arrives it's the angle between the 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.580
 radius and normal attention it's not 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:31.390
 between the radius and the horizontal 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:33.130
 the same for the refracted ray it is 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.590
 refractory with a certain angle s to 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.620
 this angle is measured here again as 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:41.770
 being the angle between the normal and the 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.600
 radius itself and it's called i 2 so 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.250
 the angle with which they arrive these 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.560
 links the angle with which it emerges these 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.070
 hideous it comes in the middle of a 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.430
 ten weeks 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:55.000
 1 it shows up there is refracted in the 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:58.419
 middle of a 10 n 2 then two things to 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.220
 first know little to the rays 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:05.800
 incidents and refracted and normal 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.800
 it's all in the same plane 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.330
 that of the table in this case 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.470
 firstly second little b and that 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.820
 it is the most important 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.850
 it's the equation you'll use 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:19.630
 this equation is indicates that 1 1 this is 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:24.640
 to say Monday this x the sine of the angle ya 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:27.190
 one is equal to n 2 x the sine of the angle 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.960
 hideous so that it is absolutely necessary that 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.820
 you know her and then you 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.830
 know how to use it means what 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.550
 know how to use it means that in 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.090
 an exercise 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.590
 we can give you the index one 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.200
 can give you n 2 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:44.560
 we can give you 6 1 and you should 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.240
 that you find id is very careful about 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.660
 one thing is that in your calculator 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.750
 when you are going to type sine of there is a fake 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.670
 the angle is radiant radiant 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.560
 not in degrees so if you want 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.240
 use it in degrees and calculators 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.880
 who have the degree function it has to 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.010
 active tulle but by default the angle here 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:07.380
 on your calculator should be used in 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:07.380
 radiant especially do not go wrong
