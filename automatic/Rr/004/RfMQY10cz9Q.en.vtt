too<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.850> i<00:00:47.940> think<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.420> like<00:00:48.480> though<00:00:48.719> it's

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
too and i think it's like though it's

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.979 
too and i think it's like though it's
like<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> valve<00:00:50.010> from<00:00:50.370> mono<00:00:51.030> or<00:00:51.210> 42<00:00:51.449> but<00:00:51.780> this

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
like a valve from mono or 42 but this

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.630 
like a valve from mono or 42 but this
kind<00:00:52.230> i<00:00:52.289> think<00:00:52.320> issues<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.949> kind<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.579> looks

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
kind i think issues it kind of looks

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.720 
kind i think issues it kind of looks
like<00:00:53.789> shoes<00:00:54.090> two<00:00:54.300> rounds<00:00:54.750> per<00:00:55.350> shot<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.920> don't

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
like shoes two rounds per shot I don't

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.189 
like shoes two rounds per shot I don't
