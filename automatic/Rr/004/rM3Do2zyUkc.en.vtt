okay<00:00:01.439> here's<00:00:01.709> another<00:00:01.949> piece<00:00:02.250> of<00:00:02.310> mystery

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
okay here's another piece of mystery

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.749 
okay here's another piece of mystery
tissue<00:00:03.710> it<00:00:04.710> doesn't<00:00:05.069> look<00:00:05.220> like<00:00:05.250> much<00:00:05.730> of

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
tissue it doesn't look like much of

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.860 
tissue it doesn't look like much of
anything<00:00:06.120> from<00:00:06.899> here<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:08.010> label<00:00:08.639> is<00:00:08.870> lung

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
anything from here the label is lung

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.770 
anything from here the label is lung
organizing<00:00:10.860> pneumonia<00:00:11.490> but<00:00:11.790> from<00:00:12.269> looking<00:00:12.570> at

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
organizing pneumonia but from looking at

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.589 
organizing pneumonia but from looking at
it<00:00:13.259> from<00:00:13.769> this<00:00:13.980> power<00:00:14.250> we<00:00:14.700> don't<00:00:14.730> know<00:00:15.240> what<00:00:15.450> it

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
it from this power we don't know what it

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.470 
it from this power we don't know what it
really<00:00:15.809> could<00:00:16.139> be<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.560> think<00:00:17.400> however<00:00:17.760> if<00:00:18.270> you

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
really could be I think however if you

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.260 
really could be I think however if you
zoom<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.439> little<00:00:19.650> closer<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.520> could<00:00:21.029> now

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
zoom in a little closer you could now

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.080 
zoom in a little closer you could now
just<00:00:21.689> about<00:00:21.930> recognize<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.890> fact<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.340> there

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
just about recognize the fact that there

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.990 
just about recognize the fact that there
indeed<00:00:24.570> are<00:00:25.019> alveolar<00:00:25.890> structures<00:00:26.640> here

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
indeed are alveolar structures here

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.200 
indeed are alveolar structures here

you<00:00:45.780> would<00:00:45.930> see<00:00:46.230> perhaps<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:47.190> an<00:00:47.489> acute

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
you would see perhaps in an acute

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.770 
you would see perhaps in an acute
pneumonia<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:50.030> they<00:00:51.030> appear<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.420> have

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
pneumonia and they appear to have

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.069 
pneumonia and they appear to have
basically<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.800> mononuclear<00:00:53.539> structure<00:00:54.539> with<00:00:55.050> a

up<00:01:05.189> these<00:01:05.580> alveoli<00:01:06.390> are<00:01:06.659> indeed<00:01:07.560> macrophages

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
up these alveoli are indeed macrophages

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.820 
up these alveoli are indeed macrophages
and<00:01:08.820> some<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.689> them<00:01:09.840> have<00:01:10.049> taken<00:01:10.470> up<00:01:10.619> a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
and some of them have taken up a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.460 
and some of them have taken up a
hemosiderin<00:01:11.430> pigment<00:01:12.150> which<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.900> why<00:01:13.080> they

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
hemosiderin pigment which is why they

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.770 
hemosiderin pigment which is why they
appear<00:01:13.920> nice<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:16.640> granular<00:01:17.640> with<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.909> golden

appear nice and granular with a golden

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.060 
appear nice and granular with a golden
pigment<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.790> an<00:01:21.030> organizing<00:01:22.070> pneumonia

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
pigment this is an organizing pneumonia

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.060 
pigment this is an organizing pneumonia
and<00:01:23.400> whereas<00:01:24.330> an<00:01:24.540> acute<00:01:24.960> pneumonia<00:01:25.140> pneumonia

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
and whereas an acute pneumonia pneumonia

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.149 
and whereas an acute pneumonia pneumonia
you<00:01:26.640> would<00:01:26.790> see<00:01:27.000> neutrophils<00:01:28.040> filling<00:01:29.040> up

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
you would see neutrophils filling up

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.210 
you would see neutrophils filling up
most<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.640> these<00:01:29.759> lvl<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:31.350> organizing

most of these lvl a in organizing
pneumonia<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.030> chief<00:01:33.299> cell<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:34.729> inflammation

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
pneumonia the chief cell of inflammation

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.179 
pneumonia the chief cell of inflammation
is<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:37.430> macrophage<00:01:39.110> often<00:01:40.110> called<00:01:40.380> histiocytes

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
is a macrophage often called histiocytes

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.420 
is a macrophage often called histiocytes
by<00:01:41.549> pathologists<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:43.130> they<00:01:44.130> basically<00:01:44.430> are

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
by pathologists and they basically are

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.640 
by pathologists and they basically are
organizing

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
organizing

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.570 
organizing
the<00:01:49.340> tissue<00:01:49.610> so<00:01:50.180> it<00:01:50.360> could<00:01:50.540> be<00:01:50.690> once<00:01:50.960> again

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
the tissue so it could be once again

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.500 
the tissue so it could be once again
regenerated<00:01:52.580> that's<00:01:52.820> why<00:01:53.000> this<00:01:53.060> is<00:01:53.450> called

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
regenerated that's why this is called

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.230 
regenerated that's why this is called
the<00:01:53.780> organizing<00:01:54.590> phase<00:01:55.010> of<00:01:55.340> inflammation

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
the organizing phase of inflammation

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.150 
the organizing phase of inflammation
it's<00:01:56.540> also<00:01:56.780> called<00:01:57.140> a<00:01:58.390> granulation<00:01:59.390> in<00:01:59.630> a<00:01:59.870> way

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
it's also called a granulation in a way

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.580 
it's also called a granulation in a way
so<00:02:01.270> what<00:02:02.270> else<00:02:02.450> do<00:02:02.630> we<00:02:02.720> want<00:02:02.990> to<00:02:03.110> say<00:02:03.290> here

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
so what else do we want to say here

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.840 
so what else do we want to say here
actually<00:02:03.860> we<00:02:04.130> don't<00:02:04.190> want<00:02:04.400> to<00:02:04.460> say<00:02:04.610> anything

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
actually we don't want to say anything

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.150 
actually we don't want to say anything
more<00:02:05.180> just<00:02:05.840> effect<00:02:06.230> that<00:02:06.440> you<00:02:06.530> could<00:02:06.740> realize

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
more just effect that you could realize

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.540 
more just effect that you could realize
in<00:02:07.490> organizing<00:02:08.560> pneumonia<00:02:09.560> or<00:02:09.770> organizing

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
in organizing pneumonia or organizing

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.250 
in organizing pneumonia or organizing
pneumonitis<00:02:11.210> if<00:02:11.570> you'd<00:02:11.750> rather<00:02:11.930> use<00:02:12.230> that

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
pneumonitis if you'd rather use that

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.250 
pneumonitis if you'd rather use that
term<00:02:12.770> you<00:02:13.730> see<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.510> architecture<00:02:15.230> of

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
term you see that the architecture of

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.130 
term you see that the architecture of
the<00:02:15.440> lung<00:02:15.680> is<00:02:15.860> preserved<00:02:16.430> but<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.480> alveoli

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
the lung is preserved but the alveoli

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.420 
the lung is preserved but the alveoli
are<00:02:18.380> filled<00:02:18.710> chiefly<00:02:19.340> with<00:02:19.420> macrophages
