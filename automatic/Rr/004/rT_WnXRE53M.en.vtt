00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.239
 for each of the three masks that I give you 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:07.439
 show it naturally pepper tincture 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.549
 we also need ordinary gloves 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:15.180
 which can be purchased at the pharmacy 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:17.009
 sponzhik usual or cotton pad and such 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.680
 here is a tablespoon 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.080
 we need it for absolutely everyone 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.540
 mazov we also need olive 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.540
 I poured some butter into the cup 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.290
 after you make a fight of these 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.900
 three masks must put on your head 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.990
 polyethylene gebo is some kind of cap for 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.930
 soul either it's just a bag and wrap 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.720
 All towel is desirable to 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.540
 preheated a little bit he 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.690
 towel me so that it was slightly warm 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.119
 it will also enhance the effect and data mass and 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.369
 so we need for the first mask 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.890
 for the first mask we need 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.710
 first butter I'll take burdock with 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.440
 red olga this oil really like 1 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.710
 not a single drop is waiting on their own 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.690
 n the roots of the hair that is, it does not dry you 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.850
 can take on your own again 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.130
 it is either castor or burdock 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.989
 these two oils and first of all advice 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.930
 if not then you can, in principle, some 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.489
 another take oil further naturally to us 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.489
 need a pepper vodka 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:26.250
 and 3 on need a hair balm 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.400
 either monstr which does not contain 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.290
 composition and not a drop of silicone 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.769
 due to non silicone masks i could 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.989
 advise either homemade recipes or 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.190
 organics by natura siberica 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.620
 these three masks are perfect 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.740
 for such a purpose it is for application to 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:49.050
 scalp and so we take one 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.050
 tablespoon of pepper vodka 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.390
 the next thing we take it will be you 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:02.920
 burdock oil with red pepper again 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:06.640
 one tablespoon and third ingredient 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.790
 even masks it will be a hair balm 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:15.370
 As I said, not silicone without a slide 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:17.200
 one tablespoon also as you see 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.000
 This mask I ran away from such 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.070
 homogeneous consistency again 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.170
 I repeat that be sure to take the mask 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.630
 without silicone that is which 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.180
 absolutely no silicone content to 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.430
 she has not clogged your support and will not 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.830
 corresponding effect further you 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.280
 put on the partings leave somewhere 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.590
 from 20 minutes at least if much bakes 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.380
 if not much you can stand it 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.239
 half an hour and an hour is the maximum that you can 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.489
 keep that mask on your hair 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.670
 second recipe masks which i also 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:51.850
 I also tried three 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.739
 component is any oil on your 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.540
 discretion I will again take for 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.410
 enhance the effect of burdock oil with 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.560
 red pepper 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.360
 also it is a pepper vodka and it is ordinary water 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.760
 it is desirable that she was enough 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:09.430
 hot then take a tablespoon 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.950
 oils you can take either castor 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:17.070
 or burdock with other additives 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:21.169
 coconut for example and last 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.169
 ingredient is one tablespoon of water 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.340
 recent mask she is the easiest to 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.600
 performance 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.210
 it consists of only two 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.200
 the ingredients are like titanium tincture 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.840
 pepper and 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.930
 it's hot water i take exactly hot 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.090
 water because he is so pepper vodka 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.670
 us cold to somehow dilute it 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.370
 all do not apply a cold mixture on the skin 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.230
 in blue I take a hot meal of the year I will 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:54.660
 use one to one ratio 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:59.070
 i.e. 1 tablespoon of pepper and one 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:03.570
 a tablespoon of water and then we these two 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:05.790
 known and lastly I will repeat 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:09.120
 basic rules for the use of this 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:11.340
 masks mean you can make up for 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.500
 yourself absolutely your chains showed you those 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:17.250
 recipes that I used on myself 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:20.580
 you can make recipes based on that 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:24.600
 how to feel your hair 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:27.410
 and what is your scalp dry or fat 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.910
 on this dependency vary 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.880
 ingredient why i showed a few 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:35.820
 when i started doing this mask then 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.500
 initially there was absolutely no effect and I 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.310
 I thought that I ran into just 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.250
 fake 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.320
 pepper tinctures but in the end I 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:46.200
 I realized that the last recipe that you 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.820
 saw this is the most common most simple 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.960
 of all that I showed you 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:54.000
 I mix in equal proportions one 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.790
 a tablespoon of water and one tablespoon 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.720
 a spoonful of pepper that is the simplest 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:03.750
 a recipe by me for he gave such a warming 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.970
 effect i have no effect super same it and 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.670
 it should not be if you have much 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:11.400
 bake your scalp then be sure 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.600
 wash off this mask to not appear 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.820
 dryness just let's 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.680
 it's five minutes more every time he 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.020
 also if you bake much 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.880
 it is necessary to mix with water and with some 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.060
 oil base burdock oil 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:28.600
 castor oil, be sure to wear this 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.590
 mask in gloves to hand and not 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.650
 dried 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:35.830
 so that the skin of the hands does not dry up and on the guest 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:39.330
 what was not and a wadded tampon either 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:42.700
 donâ€™t forget with donut 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:46.000
 hair ends lubricate any oil for 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.140
 In order to avoid the hit of pepper vodka 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.570
 at the ends of the hair 

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:52.540
 she can provoke brittle hair 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:55.240
 dryness so how natural is she on 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.950
 basis of alcohol made if you 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.350
 have any questions about 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:01.750
 how to apply or how to use 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:04.510
 this mask I tried let's both 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:06.190
 more information is possible but if something 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.230
