00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.570
 until I say I'm ready 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.570
 and 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.340
 because everyone asks who 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:36.130

 the days when I wake up powers 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.020
 knees be little that is efficient 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.270
 you lose time with your perseverance the 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.940
 Rapper Fail to Chaos Go to Emergency 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.500
 and it starts very fast as if it were a 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.840
 ambulance and what really worries 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.000
 are these influences I the truth 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.340
 inside of me 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.640
 for pretending or that I superior 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.980

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.790

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.959
 in the streets, capitalism supports us 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.819
 they are strong very alive until I say 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.879

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.879
 and 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.660
 because everyone asks who 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.890
 are 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.430
 they just learned 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.430
