00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.620 
get to this game now okay so I'm
basically<00:01:32.009> doing<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.430> normal<00:01:32.549> tall<00:01:32.909> hack<00:01:33.119> 2012

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
basically doing a normal tall hack 2012

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.800 
basically doing a normal tall hack 2012
in<00:01:33.869> order<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.350> if<00:01:35.250> i'm<00:01:35.490> doing<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.759> 13-2<00:01:36.270> 11<00:01:36.630> pull

in order and if i'm doing a 13-2 11 pull
the<00:01:36.900> only<00:01:37.020> reason<00:01:37.259> people<00:01:37.350> do<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.770> is

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
the only reason people do that is

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.399 
the only reason people do that is
because<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.640> stops<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.659> opponent<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.200> that's

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.039 
because it stops the opponent it that's
basically<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.920> safe<00:01:41.310> way<00:01:41.520> like<00:01:41.759> if<00:01:41.930> you're<00:01:42.930> at

getting some pins up very soon and
going<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.200> keep<00:02:13.320> my<00:02:13.440> overload<00:02:13.800> outside<00:02:14.100> his

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
going to keep my overload outside his

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.950 
going to keep my overload outside his
base<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.520> see<00:02:14.670> when<00:02:14.850> he's<00:02:14.940> pushing<00:02:15.240> out<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.600> i

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
base to see when he's pushing out and i

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.420 
base to see when he's pushing out and i
only<00:02:16.290> get<00:02:16.440> creeped<00:02:16.650> colonies<00:02:17.010> I'm<00:02:17.160> not<00:02:17.310> gonna

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
only get creeped colonies I'm not gonna

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.800 
only get creeped colonies I'm not gonna
morph<00:02:17.670> them<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.970> some<00:02:18.150> pins<00:02:18.330> i'm<00:02:18.510> only<00:02:18.660> gonna

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
morph them to some pins i'm only gonna

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.090 
morph them to some pins i'm only gonna
morph<00:02:19.050> them<00:02:19.170> into<00:02:19.350> some<00:02:19.500> kids<00:02:19.680> when<00:02:19.800> I<00:02:19.860> see<00:02:20.040> him

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.800 
morph them into some kids when I see him
pushing<00:02:20.310> out<00:02:20.550> because<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.390> don't<00:02:21.540> need<00:02:21.630> to<00:02:21.690> mark

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
pushing out because I don't need to mark

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.260 
pushing out because I don't need to mark
them<00:02:22.110> into<00:02:22.290> some<00:02:22.440> cones<00:02:22.760> it's<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.820> small<00:02:24.060> hint

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
them into some cones it's a small hint

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.880 
them into some cones it's a small hint
and<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:24.540> saves<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.870> lot<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.050> minerals<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.680> a

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
and it saves you a lot of minerals and a

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.470 
and it saves you a lot of minerals and a
lot<00:02:26.070> of<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:26.580> can<00:02:26.730> get<00:02:26.850> extra<00:02:27.120> drones<00:02:27.360> from

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
lot of you can get extra drones from

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.050 
lot of you can get extra drones from
that<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:27.900> it's<00:02:28.050> really<00:02:28.200> helpful<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:29.060> again

zerglings are over here gonna just made
for<00:03:23.610> it<00:03:23.730> because<00:03:24.000> why<00:03:24.360> only<00:03:24.570> pushes<00:03:24.870> out<00:03:24.990> I'm

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
for it because why only pushes out I'm

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.750 
for it because why only pushes out I'm
going<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.290> go<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:25.560> pick<00:03:25.830> off<00:03:25.980> an<00:03:26.130> SUV<00:03:26.430> or<00:03:26.610> two

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
going to go and pick off an SUV or two

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.090 
going to go and pick off an SUV or two
if<00:03:27.150> I<00:03:27.420> can<00:03:27.660> that's<00:03:28.290> what<00:03:28.440> those<00:03:28.590> segments<00:03:29.010> are

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
if I can that's what those segments are

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.880 
if I can that's what those segments are
therefore<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.670> he<00:03:30.150> scouted<00:03:30.480> this<00:03:30.750> so<00:03:31.140> I<00:03:31.440> guess

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
therefore and he scouted this so I guess

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.040 
therefore and he scouted this so I guess
they're<00:03:32.310> not<00:03:32.400> going<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:32.670> be<00:03:32.760> able<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:33.120> do<00:03:33.810> some

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
they're not going to be able to do some

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.300 
they're not going to be able to do some
damage<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.530> now<00:03:34.710> I'm<00:03:34.770> going<00:03:34.920> to<00:03:34.980> get<00:03:35.070> sunken

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
damage and now I'm going to get sunken

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.470 
damage and now I'm going to get sunken
because<00:03:35.520> he<00:03:35.610> is<00:03:35.700> pushing<00:03:35.850> out<00:03:36.120> with<00:03:36.240> a<00:03:36.270> lot<00:03:36.420> of

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
because he is pushing out with a lot of

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.680 
because he is pushing out with a lot of
forces<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:37.430> this<00:03:38.430> hunk<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:39.060> right<00:03:39.330> now<00:03:39.450> again

other game he tried to drop but I failed

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.030 
other game he tried to drop but I failed
and<00:05:30.510> that's<00:05:31.260> why<00:05:31.410> I<00:05:31.440> was<00:05:31.590> gonna<00:05:31.710> get<00:05:31.920> that

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
and that's why I was gonna get that

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.560 
and that's why I was gonna get that
sunken<00:05:32.430> colony<00:05:32.790> there<00:05:32.940> but<00:05:33.120> I'm<00:05:33.180> like<00:05:33.330> screw

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
sunken colony there but I'm like screw

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.080 
sunken colony there but I'm like screw
it<00:05:33.630> and<00:05:33.840> so<00:05:34.350> I<00:05:34.380> didn't<00:05:34.620> get<00:05:34.740> it<00:05:34.860> and<00:05:35.040> now<00:05:35.820> I<00:05:35.850> got

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
it and so I didn't get it and now I got

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.960 
it and so I didn't get it and now I got
makes<00:05:36.240> gas<00:05:36.480> up<00:05:36.780> and<00:05:37.230> all<00:05:38.220> you<00:05:38.340> need<00:05:38.520> is<00:05:38.640> nine<00:05:38.790> or

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
makes gas up and all you need is nine or

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.670 
makes gas up and all you need is nine or
guess<00:05:39.240> basically<00:05:39.660> to<00:05:40.050> get<00:05:40.200> your<00:05:40.290> first<00:05:40.500> 9

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
guess basically to get your first 9

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.020 
guess basically to get your first 9
meter<00:05:40.890> this<00:05:41.010> up<00:05:41.220> and<00:05:41.400> the<00:05:41.580> first<00:05:41.760> time<00:05:41.880> you

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
meter this up and the first time you

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.210 
meter this up and the first time you
discs<00:05:42.480> are<00:05:42.690> what<00:05:42.930> her<00:05:43.170> ass<00:05:43.350> is<00:05:43.380> and<00:05:43.800> you

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
discs are what her ass is and you

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.500 
discs are what her ass is and you
basically<00:05:44.370> get<00:05:44.730> your<00:05:44.910> first<00:05:45.090> on<00:05:45.240> your<00:05:45.270> list

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
basically get your first on your list

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.540 
basically get your first on your list
and<00:05:45.930> right<00:05:46.110> and<00:05:46.260> you<00:05:46.470> her<00:05:46.680> ass<00:05:46.860> while<00:05:47.370> you're

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
and right and you her ass while you're

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.210 
and right and you her ass while you're
expanding<00:05:47.880> like<00:05:48.660> in<00:05:48.900> almost<00:05:49.410> all<00:05:49.620> matchups<00:05:50.100> in

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
expanding like in almost all matchups in

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.800 
expanding like in almost all matchups in
actually<00:05:50.760> in<00:05:50.850> every<00:05:51.060> single<00:05:51.240> match<00:05:51.480> up<00:05:51.690> you

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
actually in every single match up you

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.110 
actually in every single match up you
only<00:05:51.960> attack<00:05:52.380> when<00:05:52.680> you're<00:05:52.740> expanding<00:05:53.250> well

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
only attack when you're expanding well

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.670 
only attack when you're expanding well
you<00:05:54.270> only<00:05:54.390> expand<00:05:54.930> when<00:05:55.110> you're<00:05:55.230> attacking

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
you only expand when you're attacking

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.070 
you only expand when you're attacking
usually<00:05:56.130> because<00:05:56.580> if<00:05:56.790> you<00:05:56.910> wanna<00:05:57.120> attack<00:05:57.930> if

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
usually because if you wanna attack if

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.360 
usually because if you wanna attack if
you<00:05:58.110> want<00:05:58.380> year<00:05:58.560> if<00:05:58.680> you<00:05:58.800> want<00:05:58.950> your<00:05:59.040> opponent

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
you want year if you want your opponent

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.430 
you want year if you want your opponent
to<00:05:59.400> be<00:05:59.550> distracted<00:05:59.880> then<00:06:00.600> you<00:06:00.720> can<00:06:00.870> expand<00:06:01.260> and

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
to be distracted then you can expand and

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.320 
to be distracted then you can expand and
attack<00:06:01.710> and<00:06:02.010> your<00:06:02.250> opponent<00:06:02.460> can't<00:06:03.090> like

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
attack and your opponent can't like

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.240 
attack and your opponent can't like
attack<00:06:03.660> you<00:06:03.690> because<00:06:04.110> he's<00:06:04.650> trying<00:06:04.890> to<00:06:04.980> defend

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
attack you because he's trying to defend

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.880 
attack you because he's trying to defend
his<00:06:05.370> own<00:06:05.460> base<00:06:05.640> and<00:06:06.050> yeah<00:06:07.050> so<00:06:07.260> now<00:06:07.410> my<00:06:07.710> first
