00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:14.280
 almost everyone who flies the closing race of everything are team around the plane 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:18.029
 make exactly what happens during a flight and where do those sounds come from? 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.119
 actually from 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.970
 a look in the kitchen of the cockpit 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.169
 more than 550 euros 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:25.699
 all close 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.699
 some are but it is a blow but that actually recognizes 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.969
 ghana sometimes then you get on the plane it can sometimes happen en route 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.780
 If it were all the job then you can see what smokes from the grills on the 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.020
 The sides of the plane are no smoke that the ANP and that just comes 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.700
 from the air conditioning systems 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.380
 to sort out a sort of a very large one 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.100
 get to the plane 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.340
 terneuzen stuck 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.760
 Who goes our day picked the third one 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.890
 that his does not matter so much from gelelselaar a move backwards and during the 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.440
 truck restarts at the engines and there the kinheim the first noises 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.760
 don't recognize you 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.410
 then abort the start 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.410
 ask the judge 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.130
 luckily he explained 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.200
 only 45 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.200
 there is no guarantee 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.240
 jos wienen 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.299
 the group is he has many people in a job when tears are 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.610
 winger bergkamp therefore you always hear demands action 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.760
 it's just the properties that have the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.410
 were flat says but drive 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.540
 in that movement of traffic jams often a little bit busy 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.700
 put the flex that they see the hits on the wings of the spotlight 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.450
 extending the wing 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.000
 support 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 so make that clear 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.730
 as soon as the aircraft was to leave the captain received permission from the 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.730
 control tower to the runway 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:10.939
 go wrong of which 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.939
 very low 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.959
 able to compete 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.819
 lots of noise 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.819
 submitted the sound 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.049
 and the map that drive faster and faster 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.349
 at a certain speed 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:37.629
 take off when a little bit of the ground was around it 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:38.769
 landing gear 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.509
 and what a hypocrite 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:43.859
 Tuesday morning at half past five 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.879
 experienced noise 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.879
 however, the moment it really collapses is certain 

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:53.199
 it makes people do it 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.999
 about 180 kilometers before the destination, the commander enters the descent 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:01.399
 this changes the sound of the engines 

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:05.379
 when approaching the clubs that we leave, paul also goes on 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.649
 a different position of the aircraft 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:11.849
 hope they enter you as a passenger 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.769

 Approximately 2000 feet, these boys sit stupid landing gear langedijk 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.699
 very much 

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:33.609
 as the eye on the job of a spacious 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:38.809
 I also have a to-break system from the automatic braking system that the dim to 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:43.109
 once the with the wheels on the asphalt we stand on the runway as it 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.139
 automatic braking system 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.979
 pull at the various is as we call it 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:52.029
 That means that we also start braking on the engine 

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:55.409
 an incredible amount of noise that word passes really badly 

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:59.230
