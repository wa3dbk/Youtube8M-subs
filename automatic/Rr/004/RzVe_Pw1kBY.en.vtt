right by the manual you go by the book I

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.279 
right by the manual you go by the book I
feel<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:56.820> really<00:00:56.960> limits<00:00:57.960> your

creativity and your it limits your

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.630 
creativity and your it limits your
ability<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.750> grow<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.680> would<00:01:02.129> really<00:01:02.340> just

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
ability to grow so I would really just

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.329 
ability to grow so I would really just
encourage<00:01:03.359> everyone<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:04.229> break<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.890> rules<00:01:05.100> a

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
encourage everyone to break the rules a

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.399 
encourage everyone to break the rules a
little<00:01:05.460> bit<00:01:05.610> go<00:01:06.180> out<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.630> your<00:01:06.659> comfort<00:01:06.810> zone
