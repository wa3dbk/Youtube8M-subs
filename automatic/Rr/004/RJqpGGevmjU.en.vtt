00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
plug here that fills water in so if we

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.210 
plug here that fills water in so if we
want<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:29.810> to<00:02:29.840> fill<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.260> tank<00:02:30.530> up<00:02:30.709> we<00:02:31.069> would

want it to fill the tank up we would

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.560 
want it to fill the tank up we would
simply<00:02:31.400> pull<00:02:31.790> this<00:02:31.940> plug<00:02:32.319> but<00:02:33.319> first<00:02:33.590> we<00:02:33.800> would

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
simply pull this plug but first we would

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.400 
simply pull this plug but first we would
take<00:02:35.570> this<00:02:35.810> vent

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
take this vent

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.190 
take this vent
nozzle<00:02:38.410> up<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:39.490> then<00:02:40.270> we'd<00:02:40.480> pull<00:02:40.690> this<00:02:40.870> plug

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
nozzle up and then we'd pull this plug

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.490 
nozzle up and then we'd pull this plug
and<00:02:41.560> you'll<00:02:42.220> see<00:02:42.460> the<00:02:42.610> sink<00:02:43.260> filling<00:02:44.260> up<00:02:44.380> with
