00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
screen you got the controls that

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.060 
screen you got the controls that
everything<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.610> bet<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.510> is<00:02:22.200> under<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.770> slide

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
everything I bet that is under the slide

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.880 
everything I bet that is under the slide
of<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.640> PSP<00:02:24.030> Go<00:02:24.180> is<00:02:24.300> protected<00:02:24.960> so<00:02:25.710> it's<00:02:25.830> a

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
of the PSP Go is protected so it's a

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.030 
of the PSP Go is protected so it's a
good<00:02:26.130> thing<00:02:27.200> another<00:02:28.200> reason<00:02:28.440> why<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.770> piece

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
good thing another reason why the piece

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.760 
good thing another reason why the piece
we<00:02:29.250> go<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.640> better<00:02:30.060> than<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.870> psp-2000

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
we go is better than the psp-2000

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.880 
we go is better than the psp-2000
because<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.070> have<00:02:32.280> bluetooth<00:02:33.620> what<00:02:34.620> people

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
because you have bluetooth what people

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.230 
because you have bluetooth what people
think<00:02:34.980> bluetooth<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.520> pointless<00:02:35.880> but

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
think bluetooth is pointless but

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.690 
think bluetooth is pointless but
bluetooth<00:02:36.900> can<00:02:37.140> be<00:02:37.290> used<00:02:37.560> in<00:02:37.860> so<00:02:38.190> many<00:02:38.250> ways

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
bluetooth can be used in so many ways

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.790 
bluetooth can be used in so many ways
that's<00:02:39.120> why<00:02:39.390> it's<00:02:39.660> only<00:02:39.810> probably<00:02:40.260> added<00:02:40.650> it

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
that's why it's only probably added it

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.140 
that's why it's only probably added it

possibilities are endless with Bluetooth

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.330 
possibilities are endless with Bluetooth
so<00:03:19.140> that's<00:03:19.260> probably<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.739> reason<00:03:19.769> why<00:03:20.160> they

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
so that's probably the reason why they

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.310 
so that's probably the reason why they
added<00:03:20.790> is<00:03:20.940> because<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.450> possibilities<00:03:22.290> are

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
added is because the possibilities are

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.350 
added is because the possibilities are
endless

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.069
