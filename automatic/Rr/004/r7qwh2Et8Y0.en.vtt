00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
you spawn above ground directly below

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.889 
you spawn above ground directly below
you<00:00:38.340> well<00:00:38.760> directly<00:00:39.360> below<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.870> a

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
you well directly below you is a

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.260 
you well directly below you is a
stronghold<00:00:40.260> now<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.160> strongholds<00:00:41.790> got<00:00:42.000> very

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
stronghold now this strongholds got very

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.350 
stronghold now this strongholds got very
obscure<00:00:42.809> buildings<00:00:43.440> walls<00:00:43.829> it's<00:00:44.640> very<00:00:44.910> big

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.869 
obscure buildings walls it's very big
and<00:00:45.570> wide<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.559> do<00:00:46.739> think<00:00:47.190> it's<00:00:47.399> been<00:00:47.579> built

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
and wide so I do think it's been built

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.940 
and wide so I do think it's been built
along<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.390> ravine<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.440> do<00:00:49.620> have<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.829> be

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
along the ravine so you do have to be

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.680 
along the ravine so you do have to be
careful<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.460> don't<00:00:50.610> fall<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.210> die<00:00:51.480> and

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
careful that you don't fall and die and

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.260 
careful that you don't fall and die and
lava<00:00:51.960> now<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.680> placed<00:00:53.039> many<00:00:53.489> coordinates<00:00:53.699> in

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
lava now I placed many coordinates in

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.090 
lava now I placed many coordinates in
the<00:00:54.360> description<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.079> lot<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.620> them<00:00:55.710> are

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
the description a lot of them are

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.490

chest and this is the best of two

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.030 
chest and this is the best of two
libraries<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.900> could<00:01:31.110> find<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.619> might

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
libraries that I could find you might

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.069 
libraries that I could find you might
find<00:01:32.250> more<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.820> don't<00:01:33.270> know<00:01:33.420> guys<00:01:33.600> for<00:01:33.930> this

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
find more I don't know guys for this

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.530 
find more I don't know guys for this
many<00:01:34.439> chests<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.070> many<00:01:35.220> things<00:01:35.490> around<00:01:35.939> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
many chests and many things around the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.359 
many chests and many things around the
seeds<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.079> do<00:01:37.290> be<00:01:37.320> careful<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.950> make<00:01:38.100> sure<00:01:38.159> you

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
seeds so do be careful and make sure you

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.130 
seeds so do be careful and make sure you
do<00:01:38.520> check<00:01:38.790> high<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.180> low<00:01:39.299> because<00:01:39.509> you'll

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
do check high and low because you'll

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.420 
do check high and low because you'll
think<00:01:40.350> you've<00:01:40.619> searched<00:01:40.890> at<00:01:41.040> all<00:01:41.189> but<00:01:41.340> you

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
think you've searched at all but you
