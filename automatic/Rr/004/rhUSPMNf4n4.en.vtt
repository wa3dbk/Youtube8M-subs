the<00:02:47.290> mall<00:02:47.440> then<00:02:47.590> you're<00:02:47.709> going<00:02:47.830> to<00:02:47.920> stick<00:02:48.250> so

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
the mall then you're going to stick so

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.690 
the mall then you're going to stick so
the<00:02:49.300> only<00:02:49.570> way<00:02:49.930> will<00:02:50.680> be<00:02:50.860> to<00:02:51.010> put<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.459> mold

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
the only way will be to put the mold

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.960 
the only way will be to put the mold
with<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.330> chocolates<00:02:52.900> in<00:02:53.020> the<00:02:53.410> freezer

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
with the chocolates in the freezer

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.640 
with the chocolates in the freezer
couple<00:02:54.970> hours<00:02:55.150> then<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.080> chocolate<00:02:56.470> come

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
couple hours then the chocolate come

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.130 
couple hours then the chocolate come
very<00:02:56.860> hard<00:02:57.220> then<00:02:57.850> when<00:02:58.030> you<00:02:58.120> twist<00:02:58.420> them<00:02:58.630> all

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
very hard then when you twist them all

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.940 
very hard then when you twist them all
hopefully<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.370> chocolate<00:03:00.760> will<00:03:00.940> come<00:03:01.120> out

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
hopefully the chocolate will come out

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.150 
hopefully the chocolate will come out
now<00:03:02.950> if<00:03:03.280> anything<00:03:03.700> break<00:03:04.239> we<00:03:05.019> have<00:03:05.230> a<00:03:05.590> little

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
now if anything break we have a little

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.340 
now if anything break we have a little
piece<00:03:06.400> here<00:03:06.880> break<00:03:07.540> and<00:03:07.780> I<00:03:07.840> think<00:03:08.049> that's<00:03:08.230> the

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
piece here break and I think that's the

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.190 
piece here break and I think that's the
tail<00:03:08.650> you<00:03:09.220> can<00:03:09.250> always<00:03:09.700> take<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.299> little<00:03:10.690> bit<00:03:10.989> of

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
tail you can always take a little bit of

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.920 
tail you can always take a little bit of
the<00:03:11.410> chocolates<00:03:11.950> that<00:03:12.299> you<00:03:13.299> Mulder<00:03:13.510> earlier

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
the chocolates that you Mulder earlier

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
the chocolates that you Mulder earlier
and<00:03:14.430> glue<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:16.420> tail<00:03:16.660> on<00:03:18.390> so<00:03:19.390> that's<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.660> way

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
and glue the tail on so that's the way

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.370 
and glue the tail on so that's the way
to<00:03:20.950> fix<00:03:21.190> it
