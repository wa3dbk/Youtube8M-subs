that but we're not gonna fold this hand

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.330 
that but we're not gonna fold this hand
anyway<00:04:22.690> so<00:04:22.750> if<00:04:23.230> it's<00:04:23.440> possible<00:04:23.710> to<00:04:24.070> get<00:04:24.220> them

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
anyway so if it's possible to get them

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.800 
anyway so if it's possible to get them
off<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:24.610> hand<00:04:24.850> the<00:04:25.030> right<00:04:25.240> way<00:04:25.389> to<00:04:25.450> play<00:04:25.660> this

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
off the hand the right way to play this

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.170 
off the hand the right way to play this
is<00:04:25.990> to<00:04:26.110> push<00:04:26.350> and<00:04:27.010> just<00:04:27.160> pick<00:04:27.340> it<00:04:27.370> up<00:04:27.550> give<00:04:28.060> them

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
is to push and just pick it up give them

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.790 
is to push and just pick it up give them
a<00:04:28.210> chance<00:04:28.419> to<00:04:28.540> fold<00:04:28.930> if<00:04:29.050> he<00:04:29.139> calls<00:04:29.410> it's<00:04:29.650> not

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
a chance to fold if he calls it's not

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.500 
a chance to fold if he calls it's not
the<00:04:29.950> end<00:04:30.070> of<00:04:30.100> the<00:04:30.190> world<00:04:32.610> all<00:04:33.610> right<00:04:33.669> so<00:04:34.150> we<00:04:34.360> got

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
the end of the world all right so we got

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.280 
the end of the world all right so we got
a<00:04:34.540> chance<00:04:34.600> we<00:04:34.960> need<00:04:34.990> a<00:04:35.110> fiver<00:04:35.350> a<00:04:35.530> diamond

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
a chance we need a fiver a diamond

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.010 
a chance we need a fiver a diamond
missed<00:04:38.290> on<00:04:38.470> one<00:04:38.710> card<00:04:39.010> hey<00:04:39.910> there's<00:04:40.450> the<00:04:40.660> five

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
missed on one card hey there's the five

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.420 
missed on one card hey there's the five
one<00:04:41.530> time<00:04:41.970> young<00:04:42.970> punks<00:04:44.190> lucky<00:04:45.190> there

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
one time young punks lucky there

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.520 
one time young punks lucky there
obviously<00:04:46.000> I<00:04:46.450> felt<00:04:46.930> like<00:04:47.050> he<00:04:47.169> might<00:04:47.350> have<00:04:47.380> a

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
obviously I felt like he might have a

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.800 
obviously I felt like he might have a
queen<00:04:47.830> he<00:04:48.610> might<00:04:48.790> not<00:04:49.030> of<00:04:49.300> course<00:04:49.600> which<00:04:49.780> is

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
queen he might not of course which is

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.060 
queen he might not of course which is
why<00:04:50.050> we<00:04:50.200> make<00:04:50.350> the<00:04:50.440> play<00:04:50.620> but<00:04:50.650> even<00:04:51.010> though

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
why we make the play but even though

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.500 
why we make the play but even though
like<00:04:51.190> I<00:04:51.280> said<00:04:51.430> if<00:04:51.550> he<00:04:51.640> does<00:04:52.000> have<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.300> Queen

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
like I said if he does have the Queen

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.480 
like I said if he does have the Queen
we're<00:04:53.200> not<00:04:53.350> in<00:04:53.530> terrible<00:04:53.800> shape<00:04:54.070> simply

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
we're not in terrible shape simply

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.670 
we're not in terrible shape simply
because<00:04:54.880> he<00:04:55.300> gets<00:04:55.570> the<00:04:55.630> five<00:04:55.900> or<00:04:56.169> the<00:04:56.200> diamond

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
because he gets the five or the diamond

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.710 
because he gets the five or the diamond
which<00:04:56.770> gives<00:04:56.980> us<00:04:57.070> enough<00:04:57.340> outs<00:04:57.610> to<00:04:58.419> make<00:04:58.570> the

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
which gives us enough outs to make the

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.900 
which gives us enough outs to make the
price<00:04:58.960> right<00:04:59.260> and<00:04:59.530> to<00:04:59.919> make<00:05:00.040> the<00:05:00.160> semi-bluff

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
price right and to make the semi-bluff

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:10.500 
price right and to make the semi-bluff
right<00:05:08.729> then<00:05:09.729> you're<00:05:09.910> gonna<00:05:10.000> learn<00:05:10.240> an

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
right then you're gonna learn an

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.180 
right then you're gonna learn an
advanced<00:05:10.870> mathematical<00:05:11.620> model<00:05:11.919> for<00:05:12.130> the

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
advanced mathematical model for the

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.030 
advanced mathematical model for the
passive<00:05:12.580> aggressive<00:05:13.030> and<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.300> tight<00:05:13.479> loose

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
passive aggressive and the tight loose

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.830 
passive aggressive and the tight loose
at<00:05:15.040> first<00:05:15.370> we're<00:05:15.550> gonna<00:05:15.610> focus<00:05:15.970> on<00:05:16.270> limit<00:05:16.600> and

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
at first we're gonna focus on limit and

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.480 
at first we're gonna focus on limit and
then<00:05:17.590> we're<00:05:17.740> gonna<00:05:17.830> build<00:05:18.100> on<00:05:18.280> that<00:05:18.430> knowledge

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
then we're gonna build on that knowledge

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.260 
then we're gonna build on that knowledge
for<00:05:19.060> no<00:05:19.180> limit<00:05:19.510> play<00:05:19.720> in<00:05:20.590> limit<00:05:21.460> there<00:05:21.790> are<00:05:21.970> six

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
for no limit play in limit there are six

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.909 
for no limit play in limit there are six
things<00:05:22.570> you<00:05:22.720> must<00:05:22.870> take<00:05:23.110> into<00:05:23.260> account<00:05:23.410> before

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
things you must take into account before

things you must take into account before
you<00:05:24.220> you<00:05:24.640> play<00:05:24.880> your<00:05:25.090> first<00:05:25.300> two<00:05:25.479> cards<00:05:25.690> I'm

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
you you play your first two cards I'm

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.290 
you you play your first two cards I'm
gonna<00:05:26.380> ask<00:05:26.560> you<00:05:26.800> just<00:05:26.979> for<00:05:27.070> a<00:05:27.220> second<00:05:27.610> to<00:05:28.060> think

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
gonna ask you just for a second to think

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.820 
gonna ask you just for a second to think
of<00:05:28.540> what<00:05:28.810> those<00:05:28.930> things<00:05:28.990> six<00:05:29.680> things<00:05:29.950> are<00:05:31.650> okay

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
of what those things six things are okay

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.170 
of what those things six things are okay
you<00:05:33.010> probably<00:05:33.220> got<00:05:33.430> most<00:05:33.669> of<00:05:33.820> them<00:05:33.910> but<00:05:34.000> here

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
you probably got most of them but here

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.779 
you probably got most of them but here
they<00:05:34.330> are<00:05:34.530> how<00:05:35.530> tight<00:05:35.830> or<00:05:35.950> loose<00:05:35.979> the<00:05:36.310> table<00:05:36.640> is
