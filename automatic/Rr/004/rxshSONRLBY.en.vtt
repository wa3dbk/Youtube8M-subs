00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.960
 hello everyone here I bring you a new 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:18.700
 video of battlefield 3 today I bring you one 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.369
 little thing that I discovered and the pro 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.680
 night of the sespas 12 I do not know if there 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:27.899
 some of you will know but it is 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:32.619
 that with these 12 with laser and compost 12 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:34.510
 Kills from far away noticing as in the 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.030
 bad company 2 how it goes with shotguns 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.219
 the company 2 but it does kill from 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.250
 pretty far you can see now look at a 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:46.600
 a bullet with a bet and you kill 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:51.160
 distance as I told you in laxe and posta and 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:54.190
 then you should put a look 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.730
 why because the problem of playing with 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.489
 these accessories is that you have to 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.780
 point very very very well at the doll as 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.299
 you see 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.700
 until I give him in the last shot there 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.380
 dies we failed but it seems 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.960
 that I give him close is the custom of 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.780
 shoot with the shotgun that you give him 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.670
 you shoot almost the doll if a volley not 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.130
 you're used to killing him but of 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.290
 near by far what is the problem that 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.600
 you have to point it very very very very 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.119
 all right 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.270
 and you get to aim well as you are 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.850
 watching kills at a considerable distance 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.560
 and it goes pretty well as I told you 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.299
 this he discovered last night not 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.759
 I saw no video the respect of anyone not 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.330
 I know if someone has uploaded it and it came out has not 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.770
 uploaded because I had not seen it either 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.409
 nothing happens to the best many of you 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.850
 you will not know it even if there are more youtubers 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:51.000
 that they have raised it and I have said it post 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.560
 and laser after as far as look at me 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.560
 I recommend if you want a look 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.630
 close without telescopic sight os 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.020
 I recommend the holographic above 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.140
 the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.300
 from the rds for me it goes better 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.260
 easier to make whites to long 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.620
 distances and then also not bad 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.930
 although it is a little geek to play with look 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.730
 telescopic as you see see later what 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.380
 more than playing with the telescopic sight is 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.230
 how good up close you have the problem of 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.620
 Look at her, not another problem that she has to play 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.430
 with compost instead of with lead 12 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.320
 example with arrow is that up close 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.080
 you are very sold with this I mean 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.230
 that up close does not have just opening 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.920
 of the cartridge and then you have to 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.769
 aim very very very well at the enemy for 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.739
 give it is not worth how you play with arrow 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.720
 or with lead that you do not have to give 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.300
 adjust the doll as long as you 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.790
 the contour is already giving you the 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.730
 ammunition not not here as you see with the 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.730
 look how it's going to be 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.650
 it looks like a sniper rifle is the 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.200
 really quite pretty big I think 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.040
 that people when he killed her and saw that 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.830
 I was wearing 6x magnification 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.060
 10 benefits of you have a hack because 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.709
 do not fuck with me how can you take a 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.709
 shotgun with that look no 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.910
 and I've said it up close you've sold 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.540
 you already know by exposed 12 more laser 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.950
 I hope you liked the favorite x and 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.430
 see you in next video kids 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.430
 come on 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.380
 ah
