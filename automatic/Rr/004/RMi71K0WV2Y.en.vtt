00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 all love today there is once again a 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.120
 upset video of me because that's it 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.740
 very many of you have wished and 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.960
 my last angry post finds 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.950
 her in the infobox on my blog and 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.690
 i would say i start with the 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.759
 category hair because I have that 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.680
 now as well as on my blog post 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.699
 divided so a bit then you can 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.470
 you just look what you guys 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.939
 interested and what not and I want 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.420
 say I start with this product 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:28.859
 here 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:30.960
 So that's a hairspray 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.880
 so that the hair is still so shiny 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.380
 Say I look and ilona has become 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.610
 bought that and because they did not like that 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.800
 I like to do that again 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.730
 try and there is still quite 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.739
 a lot in it and I will do that now 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.520
 Throw away because the stuff is simple 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.620
 it does not help because it's so much for men 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.879
 Perfume and I do not necessarily want to 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.500
 my hair smells like that for the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.510
 Hair is not pretty at all 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.570
 rather on the contrary than next from 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.829
 oc from the new series miracles Schein 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.570
 I have the shampoo I have from it too 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.190
 the conditioner and the cure sent 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.629
 Although get totally sweet in such a 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.579
 carton I have some in front of you 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.579
 weeks already posted on instagram 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.730
 and i just tested it now i 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.960
 think that's pretty good 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.060
 I heard there are many 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.560
 be silicones in there but that has mine 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.090
 have not hurt completely now 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.550
 and I think that actually smells 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.950
 So I pretty well and I think that 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.960
 first time used were mine 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.910
 hair is not really long somehow 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.530
 I finished that really well 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.150
 I would also like to buy then 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.020
 I twice that every day shampoo 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.570
 green apple 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.280
 I really like shampoo every day 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.620
 not so much so I changed it 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.350
 now almost two years or so 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.700
 always used but somehow I know 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.510
 not somehow is not so good anymore 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.370
 for my hair 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.620
 I found that green apple I found yet 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.150
 so fine and then I have one more 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.340
 shampoo made empty 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.440
 that is the all color brilliance 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.150
 shampoo and I think it's really good 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.400
 is for brown red and black hair 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.990
 is without silicone or odor is on 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.590
 a little bit in each case 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.150
 getting used to but I found that 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.740
 in any case, so the really good 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.910
 I will definitely recommend it 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.620
 I have a dry shampoo empty 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.680
 that comes from england that is from the 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.450
 super truck own brand and that's it 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.090
 for brown hair so that's how it comes 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.060
 a bit brown color with out so be 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.320
 dyed and I thought I do not know 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.910
 somehow I found it good but somehow 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.370
 I do not know exactly 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.720
 it felt a bit like hairspray 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.060
 So it does not have the hair like that 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.800
 really fresh partly made such a 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.140
 bit glued but I found the 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.610
 color was just fine and that's why I have 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.290
 used it to the end but it is now 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.459
 not my favorite dry shampoo a lot 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.739
 I found this dry shampoo better 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.560
 which is of matisse and there is just 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.270
 on it medium and green at back so there 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.470
 is also colors and in and if and 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.239
 you because they feel used the 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.459
 Hair really fresh as fresh 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.410
 washed and it still stops 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.000
 a little volume with pure and it is 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.950
 also dyed what I really good 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.390
 think because so this normal dry 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.820
 look where is white and in my hair 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.380
 they turn gray and gray very fast 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.330
 that's why i think that's very good in 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.650
 england a lot cheaper times in 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.270
 england time then looks in any case 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.090
 times in the supermarket there is always very 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.130
 cheap or if your super truck or 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.260
 buht seht I would rather to super job 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.580
 go because there are always actions as 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
 next i want you mine 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.940
 show applied facial products 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.860
 and there I have two packs once 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.900
 from the primark swells towels 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.670
 Sensitive skin emptied and found 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.800
 I was okay so she was not 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.810
 bad but they were not 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.400
 the best sections so do those 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.010
 just a little puzzle so the 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.480
 Do not stay like a cloth like that 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.310
 they dissolve a bit and 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.500
 I also have these sections 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.030
 empty since I went on vacation 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.740
 bit was on the way and then needed 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.060
 I pack a small one and find it 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.890
 I'm really good, I think they exist 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.170
 not really in the big one 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.760
 version but there are also 15 pieces in it 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.650
 So it's almost like a normal pack 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.360
 and yes, I think I will 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.700
 At some point after buying then 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.709
 the gel of garnier skin gapes 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.180
 energy we always have a shower 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.550
 stand because I think that's just a lot 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.739
 easier and just have a shower 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.090
 Quick on the face and finished because 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.560
 otherwise I do not use what is 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.570
 So song sink I never do that 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.130
 only one shower and I think so 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.120
 really good i love this example 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.650
 I will definitely follow this 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.970
 I made this toothpaste empty 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.390
 that is from download 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.680
 the pan lament toothpaste and at the beginning 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.090
 I found it really cool that I the 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.590
 so my god tastes like vanilla 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.360
 pudding then someday went to me 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.739
 really annoying but now like 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.299
 me again we still have a tuba 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.250
 I had at home and traveling 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.049
 this toothpaste was the bio 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.609
 repair toothpaste and I think that 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.190
 really good so there have mine 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.080
 teeth somehow felt good after that 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.550
 he should also be so enamel again 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.800
 then I finally have it 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.390
 This balea body needs raspberry 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.010
 used up I already have that 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.479
 eternity I think I do not know if 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.090
 I showed it to a hall or something 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.190
 and now that is finally very much 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.900
 i did not find her so good so i like 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.600
 The smell like raspberry 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.430
 but I do not know I found him 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.690
 bit too watery and i had that 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.400
 Feeling now not so much 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.840
 then also the roses 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.729
 Verdi hand cream, I think 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.130
 well the times were there in the box 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.660
 and she just had her hands well cared for 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.160
 and i also like that big smell 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.870
 I like to underestimate it now 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.970
 three more scents and that once 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.830
 refreshing body spray what mango 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.180
 It was not that full 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.560
 lohne gave me that was there 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.640
 still so full and she wanted that 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.229
 somehow I do not have any more 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.070
 that 's just always thought to 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.720
 physical education with 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.010
 and of course my friends wanted 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.810
 and all that always use 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.139
 that's why it went pretty fast 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.539
 besides, I still have that escada 6 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.669
 graffiti popular made that smells very much 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:22.740
 fruity so there is nothing else 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.689
 It's just off the hook and it smells like it 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.189
 such a cocktail I think and I think 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:27.599
 It kinda cool, but I know 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:28.199
 not properly necessarily always so 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:29.759
 wants to judge 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:31.979
 That's why I think I will not 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.900
 buy it and lastly that christina 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:35.699
 aguilera sigrid porsche was for me 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.740
 rather that that smells so delicious the 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.840
 christina aguilera perfumes are not as 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.090
 expensive so that's 15 milliliters 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.830
 I think that costs 10 or 15 euros 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.870
 and they are also available at dm and rossmann 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.999
 I hope you liked my video 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.279

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.760
 category kata category so i have 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.400
 already 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:08.690
 So I'm me too now 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:18.230

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:28.220
 60 products my teeth are mine 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:29.660
 face I thought oh my first 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.280
 God tasted this mega delicious 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:36.230
 Vanilla pudding then just against me 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:41.000
 that's from dawn to dance the vanilla 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:42.920

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.600

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:51.110
 even this hand cream that is from it 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:53.330
 but also the roses hand but me 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.450
 do not know how much time three more 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:59.150
 minutes off we go 

00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:02.570
 So I got that from ilona 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:07.790
 my bed without that had already
