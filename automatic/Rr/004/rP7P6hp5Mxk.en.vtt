00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:10.010
 Nice to see you back here 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.210
 holzwerke tv today is about the topic 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.920
 Arrive city at drawing 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.929
 Normally you have the furniture 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.690
 projects your fine pencils 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.580
 pencil for example, then clean 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.140
 to bring the lines where you need them 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.119
 want to make his cut where you are 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.800
 would like to lift something and so on 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.570
 usually that is completely in 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.779
 order and also very practicable 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.750
 it is, however, cases where I to arrive 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.940
 city ​​to mark rate and therefore 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.930
 I have six small instruments here 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.489
 brought along with which one can tear 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.960
 this incentive knife is there for 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.070
 example in such a Japanese 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.760
 form classic tool in the far east 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.190
 wonderfully suitable 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.340
 then I have a home made here 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.039
 a sting saw blade and 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.280
 respectively ground and thus 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.129
 a folder provided very well as an incentive 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.250
 such scalpels are more suitable 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.729
 The artist needs great advantage 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.500
 here 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.110
 I have an alternate blade that is 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.799
 I can quickly get a dull leaf 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.740
 change 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.960
 then we have something special here 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.049
 shaped version of the rice knife 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.119
 a very long sound the whole 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.610
 on top of that artistically very nice 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.409
 elaborated relatively expensive 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.470
 worked on that later a bit 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.470
 more 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.009
 then there are such relatively coarse 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.680
 and big incentive knife the most important 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.450
 good for the carpenter area 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.159
 So for larger work if you have one 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.689
 carport for example a 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.340
 want to make a connection 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.630
 then those are long cut 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.409
 obviously much better as well 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.299
 the whole thing much more robust 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.280
 and last but not least for the picture 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.890
 I have one here to complete 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.250
 steel on rice needle hardened 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.439
 material this is just good for that 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.090
 I also tore the metal 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.090
 can bring because it is special 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.459
 difficult with a pencil stroke 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.479
 work really nice here and have 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.810
 then the start 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.130
 for my next work 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.750
 we come to the great advantage of one 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.180
 such an incentive knife no matter 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.100
 which couleur is here on the wood now 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.080
 I have a piece of larch wood and mine 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.630
 angle and now it almost does not matter 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.760
 which knife I grab I show 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.930
 you that with this big and 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.690
 Now please pay attention to that 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:36.880
 noise is now so on here and 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.610
 they already hear very clearly like this 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.260
 exactly what does it do for what to do 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.510
 it brings a visible line 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.190
 here from wood but above all I 'll do it 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.380
 again mainly by trend of this 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.330
 knife the top layer of the fibers 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.700
 and that's not really anymore 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.489
 to draw purely that is even already the 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.590
 very first step of the cultivation for 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.910
 my connection because at this point 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.130
 I can now say wonderful 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.959
 use chisel and then completely 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.600
 clean down the connection 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.880
 working for example in a slot 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.010
 and tapped connection when stemming 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.380
 or even and especially there at 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.299
 a tinker connection the topic 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.459
 drink I want to just briefly 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.310
 grab for it there is this special 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.489
 on rice knives with this very long 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.100
 blade that is good for deep into the 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.329
 already finished tine connection or 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.140
 half-finished tine connection 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.209
 in carry 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.700
 They know that usually one manufactures one 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.620
 the tines first and then you lay down 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.590
 his swallow board and then wants 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.730
 the contours of switzerland mark the 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.739
 pencil is always something 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.230
 difficult it is not exactly 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.650
 if you drop such an attractor 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.900
 They can use very far 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.180
 protrude and then make her crack 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.890
 and really only with the first 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.489
 tip and for that is such a knife 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.600
 wonderfully suitable 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.220
 of course, there are very large prizes 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.720
 differences in incentive knives 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.630
 I'll go through we have this 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.030
 Japanese model that is about the same at 15 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.850
 up to 20 euros is the self-built 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.400
 model now that is quasi free too 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.739
 get a good jigsaw sheet 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.470
 and a rest of wood left over 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:20.200
 of course have hard wood in the case 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.870
 is it partout then we have here 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.120
 this scalpel from the artist needs 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.930
 There you are with about five euros 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.090
 + alternations sound the more often you one 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.470
 the more expensive it will of course be 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.530
 then we have this very noble 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.979
 worked on rice knife one 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:42.880
 british craftsman that has about 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:44.590
 35 euros cost these hefty knives 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.639
 from the American sector would be around 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.020
 around 25 euros and one on rice 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.570
 Needle for steel you can get in 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.870
 every hardware store for a handful of euros 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.490
 well below ten euros 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.620
 assortment of two or three such 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.220
 I only have incentive to have knives 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.560
 recommend 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.110
 and I wish you much success 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.280
 and say so until next time 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.280
