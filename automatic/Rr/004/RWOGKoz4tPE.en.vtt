 The next step is to return to 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.980
 amazon 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.310
 and now yes now we can continue 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:32.470
 then let's say we're going to buy a 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.790
 stapler for example now a are not for 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.620
 what they are in Spanish then 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.260
 they're going to have to know or the words in 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.600
 English or they will have to know a little 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.760
 of English to be able to shop here 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:48.090
 then we are going to look for a stapler 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.580
 and before they start to choose 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.570
 staplers or see the details here of 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.310
 left side will go down a bit 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.260
 this section that is here this is very 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.750
 important that says insulation shipping 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.390
 and they'll make you go to apply here what 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.160
 says amazon balloon baseball what 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.039
 this does it is that it will only show the 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.709
 results of articles that can be 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.990
 sent to the address that you finish 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.209
 to add then it's just going to 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.270
 show items that they can buy and 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.670
 that can be sent to the address that 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.040
 you additional then for example 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.040
 let's say we like this recorder 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.340
 first that says that in the title I 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.110
 I have the price checked 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.280
 after they check the price 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.280
 go down a little more 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.099
 and verify that it is exactly the 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.069
 article they want once everything 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:46.640
 it's okay to go up again and give it 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.080
 to apply I want to say it at card 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.390
 because then here they will see their 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.540
 product if they are ready to buy the 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.780
 Next step is just chopping the 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.720
 precision 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.380
 and who is going to ask you if this is the 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:04.340
 address you want to send your product 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.340
 all right 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.050
 and now we're going from this page 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.000
 it is not on this page the state will see 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.580
 your product and on this side are going to have 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.980
 three options these three options are from 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.319
 the shipments and I will explain how 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.900
 works this quickly here where 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.420
 moore cell should click and 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.880
 will open a new window here an option 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.370
 that says balloons and first it's make 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.980
 doctor x 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.860
 and in this first section it says Caribbean and 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.970
 the americas go to the second option 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.710
 what is latin america 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.210
 and here he will give you all the prices 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.210
 for shipment 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:50.400
 as we had seen is of three options 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:50.400
 one two three here is one two and three 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.470
 good of these three services them 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.170
 I suggest you do not use this energy do not use 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.810
 are the zipper and use air expe or 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.300
 use prayer and now he will explain the 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.700
 xperia here is going to give you two options 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.430
 this is one and here below and another here says 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.980
 Brits take four months with the 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.590
 prices above apply to mexico the 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.650
 prices here apply profile colombia and 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.450
 I suggest that if you need it 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.959
 fast they are within a week and 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:23.000
 half the example jordi but if you can 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.490
 expect this can take two to four 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:32.910
 weeks use this I only recommend that 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:36.120
 send to mexico costa rica colombia 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.940
 chile argentina and brasil right now we are 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.130
 at the end of 2014 and those are the five 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.760
 countries that I recommend that they send 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.500
 to Latin America quickly to 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.320
 calculate the price let's say we buy 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.890
 6 books then it will be 6 99 by 6 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.780
 more 3 99 and that's the price that you're going to 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.240
 pay for shipping then I explained to you 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.710
 where to find the reference to the 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.690
 prices that will be charged for shipping 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.740
 well once they are here again 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.680
 choose issuing the 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.000
 and choose to continue quickly is going to 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.770
 ask for the payment 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.660
 but they are not going to charge you yet 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.150
 they will not be charged, they can go to the 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.800
 next to the next page and there they are and 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.820
 the will charge them nothing here 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.890
 they ask for your card 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.689
 Once card issues apply to you 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.580
 to continue 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:26.580
 they will ask you about the mail is 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.139
 debit credit card although this 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.269
 is the last page before they 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:32.879
 they charge these here verify their 

00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:35.459
 address criticize your card 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:37.319
 check what you are going to buy and here 

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:40.009
 on this side they are worth it if they are going to 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:42.509
 show how much was sent then the 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:44.879
 stapler was 32 times ca. 9 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:47.849
 cents the shipment will be 16 dollars 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:49.769
 with three cents total 49 dollars with 2 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:51.599
 cents and this would be the end of the 

00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:54.389

00:06:00.929 --> 00:06:04.649
 and how shipments work and this 

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:06.029

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.249
 to charge your country then once you 

00:06:15.179 --> 00:06:18.809

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:25.709
 countries charge for example in Mexico 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:28.110
 they will charge you 18 percent then 

00:06:25.709 --> 00:06:31.140

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.310
 you will want to add 18% here not 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.530
 they will charge them but they will charge them 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.870
 when you are going to pick up the package 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.600
