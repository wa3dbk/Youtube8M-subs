00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.630 
Shadowcat I think its shadow crap but he
was<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.180> run<00:04:07.360> the<00:04:07.600> feast<00:04:07.840> with<00:04:08.560> lava<00:04:09.070> but<00:04:09.580> if

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
was to run the feast with lava but if

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.160 
was to run the feast with lava but if
you're<00:04:09.820> gonna<00:04:09.910> do<00:04:10.209> that<00:04:10.239> I<00:04:10.480> don't<00:04:10.780> know<00:04:10.959> why

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
you're gonna do that I don't know why

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.410 
you're gonna do that I don't know why
you<00:04:11.230> would<00:04:11.410> run<00:04:11.830> out<00:04:11.940> because<00:04:12.940> then<00:04:13.180> the

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
you would run out because then the

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.270 
you would run out because then the
entire<00:04:13.660> point<00:04:13.780> of<00:04:13.959> lava<00:04:14.260> is<00:04:14.560> basically

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
entire point of lava is basically

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.330 
entire point of lava is basically
useless<00:04:16.150> but<00:04:16.870> that's<00:04:17.140> what<00:04:17.350> he<00:04:17.440> does<00:04:17.680> and<00:04:18.070> that

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
useless but that's what he does and that

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.820 
useless but that's what he does and that
was<00:04:18.489> his<00:04:18.609> mistake<00:04:18.820> so<00:04:19.330> he<00:04:19.510> is<00:04:19.600> done<00:04:19.870> for<00:04:20.109> I<00:04:20.320> am

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
was his mistake so he is done for I am

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.530

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
of the chest is a strength to pot

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.219 
of the chest is a strength to pot
because<00:04:41.320> that's<00:04:41.680> just<00:04:42.030> extremely<00:04:43.030> Opie<00:04:43.510> even

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
okay then and I almost walked into the

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.170 
okay then and I almost walked into the
lava<00:04:59.770> right<00:05:00.070> there<00:05:00.250> but<00:05:00.400> luckily<00:05:00.550> I<00:05:00.730> didn't

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
lava right there but luckily I didn't

this<00:05:01.630> guy<00:05:01.870> is<00:05:02.050> Poseidon<00:05:02.710> so<00:05:03.460> he's<00:05:03.640> doing<00:05:04.060> quite

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
this guy is Poseidon so he's doing quite

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.110 
this guy is Poseidon so he's doing quite
a<00:05:04.690> few<00:05:05.050> hearts<00:05:05.380> I'm<00:05:05.770> pretty<00:05:06.520> sure<00:05:06.790> this<00:05:06.940> was

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
a few hearts I'm pretty sure this was

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.200 
a few hearts I'm pretty sure this was
after<00:05:07.920> Poseidon<00:05:08.920> got<00:05:09.070> nerfed<00:05:09.340> so<00:05:09.880> it's<00:05:10.060> only

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
after Poseidon got nerfed so it's only

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.270 
after Poseidon got nerfed so it's only
strength<00:05:10.660> one<00:05:10.900> so<00:05:11.200> it's<00:05:11.410> not<00:05:11.590> too<00:05:11.800> powerful

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
strength one so it's not too powerful

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.340 
strength one so it's not too powerful
but<00:05:13.060> tonight<00:05:13.360> but<00:05:13.750> now<00:05:13.900> we<00:05:13.960> both<00:05:14.290> have

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
but tonight but now we both have

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.410 
but tonight but now we both have
strength<00:05:14.920> to<00:05:14.980> so<00:05:15.280> we<00:05:15.430> go<00:05:15.700> in<00:05:15.880> for<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:16.120> kill

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.420 
strength to so we go in for the kill

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.070 
strength to so we go in for the kill
easy<00:05:17.050> knock<00:05:17.650> them<00:05:17.860> right<00:05:18.340> into<00:05:18.640> the<00:05:19.000> lava<00:05:19.270> that

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
easy knock them right into the lava that

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.890 
easy knock them right into the lava that
was<00:05:20.260> placed<00:05:20.650> earlier<00:05:21.150> so<00:05:22.150> that<00:05:22.180> definitely

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
was placed earlier so that definitely
