figured i would show you guys but first

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.270 
figured i would show you guys but first
let<00:00:47.579> me<00:00:47.610> start<00:00:47.760> with<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.270> whole<00:00:48.690> system<00:00:49.280> so

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
let me start with the whole system so

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.510 
let me start with the whole system so
you<00:00:50.579> would<00:00:50.670> dig<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.030> two<00:00:51.510> block<00:00:52.129> right<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.340> block

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
you would dig a two block right to block

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.840 
you would dig a two block right to block
d<00:00:53.699> by<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> one-block<00:00:54.539> get<00:00:54.870> across<00:00:55.230> whole<00:00:56.070> drop

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
d by a one-block get across whole drop

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.790 
d by a one-block get across whole drop
down<00:00:57.090> in<00:00:57.239> your<00:00:57.360> home<00:00:57.480> then<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.379> need<00:00:58.559> your

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
down in your home then you need your

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.520 
down in your home then you need your
sticky<00:00:59.160> piston<00:00:59.780> and<00:01:00.780> then<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.289> would<00:01:01.379> need

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
sticky piston and then you would need

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.860 
sticky piston and then you would need
some<00:01:02.219> redstone<00:01:02.430> going<00:01:03.120> from<00:01:03.329> your<00:01:03.510> sticky

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
some redstone going from your sticky

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.219 
some redstone going from your sticky
piston<00:01:04.260> into<00:01:04.729> a<00:01:05.729> letter<00:01:06.030> or<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> button<00:01:06.900> or

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
piston into a letter or a button or

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.780 
piston into a letter or a button or
something<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.040> way<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.430> could

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
something like that that way you could

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.270 
something like that that way you could
turn<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.900> system<00:01:10.049> see<00:01:10.500> redstone<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.100> now

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
turn on the system see redstone is now

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.310 
turn on the system see redstone is now
connected<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.939> then<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.780> would<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:13.020> dig

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
connected and then you would just dig

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.780 
connected and then you would just dig
over<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:14.430> would<00:01:14.520> place<00:01:14.760> your

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
over here you would place your

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.940 
over here you would place your
translucent<00:01:15.270> block<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.930> then<00:01:16.650> when<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.830> hit

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
translucent block and then when you hit

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.190 
translucent block and then when you hit
the<00:01:17.070> lever<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.850> pushes<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.750> into<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
the lever it pushes it into you and

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.020 
the lever it pushes it into you and
because<00:01:19.470> it's<00:01:19.619> translucent<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.640> don't<00:01:20.820> die

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
because it's translucent you don't die

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.210 
because it's translucent you don't die
now<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> old<00:01:22.170> days<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.740> used<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:23.009> be<00:01:23.130> able

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
now in the old days you used to be able

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.710 
now in the old days you used to be able
to<00:01:23.400> see<00:01:23.520> what<00:01:23.729> was<00:01:23.850> going<00:01:24.119> on<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.479> ground

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
to see what was going on in the ground

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.460 
to see what was going on in the ground
but<00:01:24.960> as<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.290> can<00:01:25.439> see<00:01:25.740> i<00:01:26.009> see<00:01:26.820> glowstone<00:01:27.470> no

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
but as you can see i see glowstone no

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.990 
but as you can see i see glowstone no
matter<00:01:28.619> where<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:28.829> walk<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.369> walk<00:01:29.549> into<00:01:29.850> all

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
matter where I walk I can walk into all

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.319 
matter where I walk I can walk into all
four<00:01:30.240> walls<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.810> jump<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.409> everything<00:01:32.400> does

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
four walls and jump and everything does

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.210 
four walls and jump and everything does
not<00:01:33.659> work<00:01:33.990> well<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.350> reason<00:01:34.560> for<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:34.920> is

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
not work well the reason for that is

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.060 
not work well the reason for that is
because<00:01:35.840> they<00:01:36.840> fixed<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.619> can<00:01:37.860> no<00:01:38.040> longer

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
because they fixed it you can no longer

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.660 
because they fixed it you can no longer
do<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.479> system<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:39.990> all<00:01:40.950> wrong<00:01:41.400> it

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
do that so this system is all wrong it

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.620 
do that so this system is all wrong it
doesn't<00:01:42.240> work<00:01:42.320> that's<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.850> but<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.329> good<00:01:45.570> news

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
doesn't work that's it but the good news

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.889 
doesn't work that's it but the good news
is<00:01:46.170> there<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.530> much<00:01:46.860> simpler<00:01:47.520> system<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.570> you

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
is there is a much simpler system so you

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.950 
is there is a much simpler system so you
need<00:01:49.110> 8<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:50.040> same<00:01:50.280> type<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.759> hole<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.659> buy

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
need 8 the same type of hole and to buy

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.249 
need 8 the same type of hole and to buy
one<00:01:52.220> drop<00:01:53.220> down<00:01:53.460> in<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.670> whole<00:01:53.930> place<00:01:54.930> to

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
one drop down in the whole place to

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.209 
one drop down in the whole place to
fence<00:01:55.619> pieces<00:01:55.920> on<00:01:56.460> one<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.479> halves<00:01:58.219> walk

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
fence pieces on one of the halves walk

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.459 
fence pieces on one of the halves walk
all<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.610> way<00:01:59.640> up<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.149> fence<00:02:00.420> pieces<00:02:00.659> so

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
all the way up to the fence pieces so

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.230 
all the way up to the fence pieces so
you<00:02:01.560> can't<00:02:01.770> walk<00:02:01.920> any<00:02:02.159> further<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:02.850> if<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.030> try

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
you can't walk any further so if you try

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.470 
you can't walk any further so if you try
to<00:02:03.270> walk<00:02:03.509> you're<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.380> blocked<00:02:04.740> by<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.950> fence

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
to walk you're just blocked by the fence

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.480 
to walk you're just blocked by the fence
take<00:02:05.930> your<00:02:06.020> translucent<00:02:06.470> block<00:02:06.860> I<00:02:07.070> like<00:02:07.310> using

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
take your translucent block I like using

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.280 
take your translucent block I like using
redstone<00:02:07.970> blocks<00:02:08.360> just<00:02:08.630> because<00:02:08.900> it's<00:02:09.080> quite

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
redstone blocks just because it's quite

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.680 
redstone blocks just because it's quite
simple<00:02:09.560> to<00:02:09.710> get<00:02:10.010> and<00:02:10.250> survival<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.150> then<00:02:11.600> you

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
simple to get and survival and then you

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.990 
simple to get and survival and then you
just<00:02:11.810> place<00:02:12.020> those<00:02:12.200> down<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:12.740> then<00:02:13.730> you<00:02:13.880> just

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
just place those down and then you just

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.850 
just place those down and then you just
gotta<00:02:14.180> turn<00:02:14.360> around<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:14.780> walk<00:02:15.170> into<00:02:15.410> it<00:02:15.560> and

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
gotta turn around and walk into it and

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.220 
gotta turn around and walk into it and

yeah<00:02:31.130> and<00:02:31.640> on<00:02:32.000> occasion<00:02:32.750> these<00:02:32.870> blocks<00:02:33.230> will

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
yeah and on occasion these blocks will

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.140 
yeah and on occasion these blocks will
glitch<00:02:33.920> out<00:02:34.190> where<00:02:34.460> you<00:02:34.580> won't<00:02:34.760> be<00:02:34.880> able<00:02:34.970> to

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
glitch out where you won't be able to

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.300 
glitch out where you won't be able to
see<00:02:35.270> it<00:02:35.300> tada<00:02:35.800> so<00:02:36.800> all<00:02:36.860> you<00:02:36.890> have<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:37.040> do<00:02:37.190> is

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.010 
see it tada so all you have to do is
just<00:02:37.340> break<00:02:37.700> those<00:02:37.880> blocks<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.480> repeat<00:02:38.990> the

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
just break those blocks and repeat the

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.170 
just break those blocks and repeat the
system<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:39.770> just<00:02:40.220> walk<00:02:40.460> right<00:02:40.490> back<00:02:40.850> into<00:02:41.090> it

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
system and just walk right back into it

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.470 
system and just walk right back into it
and<00:02:41.390> it<00:02:41.930> is<00:02:42.080> that<00:02:42.320> simple<00:02:42.740> guys<00:02:43.070> so<00:02:43.760> hopefully

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480
