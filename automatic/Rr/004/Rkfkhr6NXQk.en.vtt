00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
that looked exciting and I was like wow

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.520 
that looked exciting and I was like wow
I<00:02:25.230> wasn't<00:02:25.590> really<00:02:25.940> excited<00:02:26.940> for<00:02:26.970> gta5<00:02:27.900> but<00:02:28.319> I'm

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
I wasn't really excited for gta5 but I'm

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.320 
I wasn't really excited for gta5 but I'm
impressed<00:02:29.040> with<00:02:29.220> how<00:02:29.340> it's<00:02:29.610> looking<00:02:29.970> on<00:02:30.120> this

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
impressed with how it's looking on this

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.350 
impressed with how it's looking on this
dated<00:02:30.720> hardware<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.760> was<00:02:32.760> actually<00:02:33.000> impressed

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
dated hardware I was actually impressed

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.290 
dated hardware I was actually impressed
that<00:02:33.870> they<00:02:33.959> were<00:02:34.019> able<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.319> get<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.739> level<00:02:35.099> of

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
that they were able to get that level of

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.540 
that they were able to get that level of
visual<00:02:36.300> fidelity<00:02:36.540> out<00:02:37.170> of<00:02:37.800> consoles<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.430> are

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
visual fidelity out of consoles that are

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.360 
visual fidelity out of consoles that are
pushing<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:39.030> decade-old<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.989> mean<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:41.130> early

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
pushing a decade-old I mean the early

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.900 
pushing a decade-old I mean the early
think<00:02:41.640> about<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:42.540> generation<00:02:43.019> of<00:02:43.319> consoles

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
think about this generation of consoles

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.150 
think about this generation of consoles
it's<00:02:44.910> impressive<00:02:45.690> what<00:02:46.620> they've<00:02:46.860> been<00:02:47.040> able

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
it's impressive what they've been able

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.699 
it's impressive what they've been able
to<00:02:47.310> do<00:02:47.549> for<00:02:47.819> so<00:02:48.209> long<00:02:48.630> with<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.230> hardware<00:02:49.650> I

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
to do for so long with the hardware I

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.539 
to do for so long with the hardware I
mean<00:02:50.180> it<00:02:51.180> back<00:02:51.600> in<00:02:51.810> previous<00:02:52.350> generations<00:02:52.560> if

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
mean it back in previous generations if

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.580 
mean it back in previous generations if
someone<00:02:54.060> told<00:02:54.269> you<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.750> life<00:02:55.080> cycle<00:02:55.350> of

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
someone told you that a life cycle of

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.070 
someone told you that a life cycle of
consoles<00:02:56.100> would<00:02:56.190> almost<00:02:56.400> be<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.730> decade<00:02:57.330> before

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
consoles would almost be a decade before

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.960 
consoles would almost be a decade before
the<00:02:58.290> next-gen<00:02:59.010> console<00:02:59.459> comes<00:02:59.640> out<00:02:59.760> I<00:02:59.790> mean

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
the next-gen console comes out I mean

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.670 
the next-gen console comes out I mean
obviously<00:03:00.360> like<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.660> ps3<00:03:01.230> was<00:03:01.260> out<00:03:01.500> in<00:03:01.620> the

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
obviously like the ps3 was out in the

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.000 
obviously like the ps3 was out in the
ps2<00:03:02.220> had<00:03:03.209> like<00:03:03.569> six<00:03:03.930> more<00:03:04.140> years<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.650> go<00:03:04.769> or

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
ps2 had like six more years to go or

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.039 
ps2 had like six more years to go or
five<00:03:05.250> more<00:03:05.459> years<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.910> go<00:03:06.060> they<00:03:06.269> kept

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
five more years to go they kept

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.589 
five more years to go they kept
supporting<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.860> ps2<00:03:08.430> even<00:03:09.269> though<00:03:09.360> it<00:03:09.420> didn't

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
supporting the ps2 even though it didn't

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.100 
supporting the ps2 even though it didn't
get<00:03:09.720> as<00:03:09.810> many<00:03:09.989> games<00:03:10.290> but<00:03:10.739> I<00:03:10.980> mean<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:12.239> ps3<00:03:12.959> and

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
get as many games but I mean the ps3 and

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.960 
get as many games but I mean the ps3 and
xbox360<00:03:14.099> remained<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:15.330> main<00:03:15.540> consoles<00:03:16.170> for

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
xbox360 remained the main consoles for

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.819 
xbox360 remained the main consoles for
7/8<00:03:17.970> years<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.780> look<00:03:18.989> at<00:03:19.109> the<00:03:19.200> games<00:03:19.500> that

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
7/8 years and look at the games that

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.380 
7/8 years and look at the games that
they're<00:03:19.980> still<00:03:20.220> coming<00:03:20.549> out<00:03:20.670> with<00:03:20.850> man

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
they're still coming out with man

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.509 
they're still coming out with man
I<00:03:21.420> mean<00:03:22.260> it's<00:03:22.440> impressive<00:03:22.799> that<00:03:23.220> they<00:03:23.340> could

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
I mean it's impressive that they could

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.759 
I mean it's impressive that they could
do<00:03:23.700> it<00:03:23.880> with<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.450> hardware<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.079> get<00:03:25.470> around

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
do it with the hardware and get around

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.250 
do it with the hardware and get around
all<00:03:25.890> those<00:03:26.010> limitations<00:03:26.519> I<00:03:27.000> mean<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:27.959> got<00:03:28.140> to

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
all those limitations I mean you got to

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.020 
all those limitations I mean you got to
applaud<00:03:28.650> Sony<00:03:29.100> and<00:03:29.310> Microsoft<00:03:29.790> for<00:03:29.940> the

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
applaud Sony and Microsoft for the

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.640 
applaud Sony and Microsoft for the
machines<00:03:30.420> that<00:03:30.540> they<00:03:30.690> built<00:03:30.989> that<00:03:31.620> they

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
machines that they built that they

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.059 
machines that they built that they
remained<00:03:32.280> relevant<00:03:32.819> for<00:03:33.209> so<00:03:33.480> long<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:34.140> it

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
remained relevant for so long and it

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.099 
remained relevant for so long and it
just<00:03:35.310> annoys<00:03:35.640> me<00:03:35.670> seeing<00:03:36.239> articles<00:03:36.720> like<00:03:36.930> this

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
just annoys me seeing articles like this

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.490 
just annoys me seeing articles like this
because<00:03:37.530> like<00:03:38.130> I<00:03:38.280> said<00:03:38.340> like<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:38.790> year<00:03:39.180> ago<00:03:39.500> they

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
because like I said like a year ago they

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.410 
because like I said like a year ago they
would<00:03:40.769> have<00:03:40.799> been<00:03:41.100> before<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.120> official

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
would have been before the official

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.800 
would have been before the official
announcement<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.350> ps4<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:44.519> Xbox<00:03:45.030> one<00:03:45.180> it
