now it turned out the marker made a very

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.180 
now it turned out the marker made a very
good<00:01:22.280> fault<00:01:23.500> yeah<00:01:24.500> but<00:01:24.740> I<00:01:24.830> don't<00:01:24.890> know<00:01:25.040> if<00:01:25.130> I

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
good fault yeah but I don't know if I

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.620 
good fault yeah but I don't know if I
could<00:01:25.430> have<00:01:25.520> with<00:01:25.640> that<00:01:25.820> little<00:01:26.030> muscle<00:01:26.390> chips

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
could have with that little muscle chips

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.320 
could have with that little muscle chips
what<00:01:26.780> do<00:01:26.840> you<00:01:26.900> think<00:01:27.280> no<00:01:28.280> way<00:01:28.460> would<00:01:29.120> have<00:01:29.240> gone

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
what do you think no way would have gone

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.450 
what do you think no way would have gone
all<00:01:29.510> in<00:01:29.540> there<00:01:29.870> so<00:01:30.680> you're<00:01:30.830> saying<00:01:30.860> set<00:01:31.220> over

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
all in there so you're saying set over

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.670 
all in there so you're saying set over
set<00:01:31.490> is<00:01:31.880> a<00:01:32.120> very<00:01:32.780> rare<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:33.110> if<00:01:33.170> you<00:01:33.260> flop<00:01:33.530> a<00:01:33.560> set

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
set is a very rare so if you flop a set

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.290 
set is a very rare so if you flop a set
you<00:01:34.010> got<00:01:34.130> to<00:01:34.220> figure<00:01:34.400> the<00:01:34.670> odds<00:01:34.700> that<00:01:34.940> nobody

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
you got to figure the odds that nobody

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.920 
you got to figure the odds that nobody
else<00:01:35.390> has<00:01:35.480> a<00:01:35.600> ser<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:38.030> chances<00:01:38.510> that<00:01:38.540> both

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
else has a ser the chances that both

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.750 
else has a ser the chances that both
players<00:01:39.140> swap<00:01:39.560> sets<00:01:39.890> is<00:01:40.070> about<00:01:40.280> 1<00:01:40.430> out<00:01:40.520> of<00:01:40.550> 100

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
players swap sets is about 1 out of 100

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.330 
players swap sets is about 1 out of 100
but<00:01:41.120> if<00:01:41.210> you<00:01:41.330> proper<00:01:41.630> set<00:01:41.990> those<00:01:42.350> odds<00:01:42.830> change

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
but if you proper set those odds change

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.980 
but if you proper set those odds change
because<00:01:43.850> you've<00:01:44.090> already<00:01:44.300> flopped<00:01:44.690> it<00:01:44.840> now

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
because you've already flopped it now

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.970 
because you've already flopped it now
we're<00:01:45.140> just<00:01:45.170> worried<00:01:45.560> about<00:01:45.740> what<00:01:45.890> the

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
we're just worried about what the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:54.580 
we're just worried about what the
chances<00:01:46.370> the<00:01:46.490> other<00:01:46.610> guy<00:01:46.790> did

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.649 

you
