00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello and welcome to my 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:08.250
 review of the lc power gaming 930 vl 1134 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.230
 midi tower in the area of ​​around 35 euros 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.450
 the housing tries by a very 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.200
 extravagant outside of the competition 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.969
 withdraw 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.740
 on the right side from behind 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.289
 we have a view window 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.539
 this is kept relatively dark 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.010
 why not without led lighting there 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.650
 there will be a lot to see 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.359
 in the front of these volumes very nice if you 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.849
 behind it has a fifth to the drive 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.349
 you can directly blind the head 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.149
 practically go to page while 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.239
 goes out power button has a good one 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:40.500
 pressure point and above we have twice 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.500
 usb 3.0 directly already and from audio so 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.670
 microphone and headset good we have 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.399
 there is room for another 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.530
 fifth inch drive and a 3.5 inch 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.899
 drive in the front are also two 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.149
 red led fan already pre-installed 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.520
 the small button on the right side 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.739
 is for a two-stage fan control 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.980
 which says one also owns a pretty 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.359
 good pressure point can be said that way 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.519
 then it is very nice for the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.790
 Price directly with two fans included 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.340
 are 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.290
 underneath we have the reset button 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.909
 very nice that is a bit out of the way 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.060
 that you do not get out of trouble 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.070
 while working in the upper area 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.470
 We also have a big one alone 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.320
 lettering and under the cover space 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.900
 for 1 240 mm radiator here too that is 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.060
 outer again very noticeable and lift 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.009
 clear by distinctive angular shape 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.210
 from the competition from or from 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.460
 helped simpler 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.470
 on the left side from behind 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.420
 Let's see the Lions Gaming 930 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.579
 lettering, and yet a leyen 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.860
 lettering and an engraved macd 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.810
 reminds me very much of the bed tech 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.390
 universe or mac games ever 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.770
 and it really is very nice 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.320
 also engraved more and not only 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.060
 imprinted so it's something too 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.829
 should be more stable behind we have 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.470
 three bushings for external 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.850
 Water cooling and space for 120 mm 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.820
 Fan but which not 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.790
 furthermore included is standard atx 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.740
 Power supply customer 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.660
 the page itself is pretty 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.119
 massive and does not have this wobbly 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.750
 It is often the fault of cheap houses 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.000
 to have each other 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.560
 The sheet is much thicker than others 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.060
 and the processing of the view window it 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.590
 also good with the braces here nice 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.300
 fitted and we have none 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.610
 scratched or bad 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.950
 paint places on the housing here 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.910
 another place two 120 mm fan 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.350
 even if the personal better 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.520
 if there had been more 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.140
 would have been visible 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.960
 above as you can see the place for 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.120
 a 240 mm radiator or two fans 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.380
 quick release on all drives at 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.480
 the 3.5 and 5 quarters alike in the 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.940
 rear area how to find one here 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.980
 real highlight we have the 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.230
 whole slot panel with thumb screws 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.670
 attached you just want housing in 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.310
 the price range are often only for 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.900
 break out or when it comes up to 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.100
 unscrew it with thumb screws 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.780
 really a solution you would otherwise over 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.709
 is used to high-quality sizes 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.690
 the three 3.5 inch drives can 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.640
 just be fixed here we have 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.610
 also bookings for 2.5 inch drives 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.530
 and we have complete in pages like this 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.620
 that the vibrations of the hard disks 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.300
 the space for 3 3 5 inches is dampened 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.010
 drives should work for most 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.080
 normal users are sufficient 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.390
 up here also a special feature 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.880
 of the housing this preinstalled 120 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.500
 mm fan with red leds is on one 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.989
 sled attached this can be 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.489
 Adjust for longer graphics cards 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.320
 he blows directly on and for longer 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.180
 Of course, rides can also take place 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.769
 Alternatively you can do the 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.890
 Of course, completely install in the front 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.180
 for a bit better airflow on 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.890
 the included fan control 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.989
 come back this can be over 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.880
 connect a 4 pin molex cable 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.470
 Furthermore, there is still room for 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.700
 another 3 pin fan for 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.830
 that means the fan control 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.580
 is not fully utilized which I very much 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.140
 think nice 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.000
 otherwise she is just like that 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.160
 dimensioned pre-installed that one 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.989
 just for the data happens the front 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.090
 Panel connections are as black 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.549
 Ribbon cable is very nice 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.799
 a small criticism at this point that 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.230
 the other cables are just the hd audio 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.610
 connector in such a computer beige 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.140
 this is how I think it should be 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.760
 not really and that would be one 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.230
 but then be able to solve something better 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.090
 However, the cables will be like that 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.790
 stow that's not big 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.350
 noticeable in the housing behind the still 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.970
 empty space for the 120th 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.760
 millimeter fan here I recommend a 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.830
 120 mm fan to retrofit one 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.240
 to ensure optimum airflow 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.310
 so we have a nice one 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.580
 flow in the housing and should not 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.800
 Problems with the education get here 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.650
 which does not install the lzr racer which also 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.720
 would recommend good we throw it out 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.280
 a look into the housing space for 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.420
 cable management is definitely 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.220
 available 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.840
 we have adequate openings 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.890
 Of course, no rapper promis on the 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.950
 something in this price range 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:48.320
 Of course it does not matter as well 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:51.110
 we have a pleasantly large opening 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.880
 for cpu cooler backplate so we at 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.410
 a montage of a new cpu cooler 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.820
 probably not the whole mainboard 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.420
 to have to build out again that is very 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.300
 practically 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.160
 the power supply also has and 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.810
 Coupler so it does not vibrate in addition 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.140
 we have a magnet down below 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.180
 Well kept dust filter next 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.970
 I will install a pc in the housing 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:15.920
 my two pc consist of msi 880 xg 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:20.480
 43 897 50 kn lc power etc 120 as well 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:26.000
 a powercolor he 72 50 ticks so until 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:28.640
 Right after the cut, you can see it well here 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.190
 we built the pc into the housing of the 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.480
 Installation was pretty easy 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.710
 have enough space for 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.410
 cable management 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.660
 As we can see we could see the cables completely 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.770
 good stowing the tv cable I would have 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.270
 can live a little better 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.220
 that's not the maximum right now 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.200
 cable management what is possible so there 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.210
 you can make it even better if you are 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.540
 a little bit more time and cable ties 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.430
 invest in itself a very nice 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.830
 case like I think everything has been fine 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.210
 let the disc you see blocked 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.160
 not much by the led 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.810
 Fans included are not enough 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.760
 to illuminate it at most in the 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.790
 mirroring my very indirect 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.040
 lighting one could perhaps still 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.750
 a red led fan in the 120th 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.360
 create a side build and have 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.880
 a better overall front comes very much 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.830
 nice to the validity of the red led fan 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.610
 which really shine for and really beautiful 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.570
 constant with the help of the fan control 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.310
 the speeds can be 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.320
 with which at the same time the 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.910
 brightness of the fan is adjusted 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.640
 which is why the fans probably 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.770
 Overvoltage be regulated 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.720
 good otherwise a very nice exterior 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.850
 light up the front as they shine 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.800
 be bright 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:38.960
 here again the LED fan in close-up 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.530
 he is really very quiet and too 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.880
 maximum volume you do not have it 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:48.200
 what would I say in conclusion 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.940
 the lc power pro 930 lions is to his 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.820
 budget a very good housing 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:55.160
 who likes the extravagant design 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.200
 and start with something like that 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.210
 who stands on white and something 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.340
 I want to put down what I think of the mass 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:04.010
 takes off is definitely good with the housing 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.570
 Advice for hardware of any kind 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.130
 actually good place and would not be the 

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.570
 most extravagant hardware installed 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.930
 should be no compatibility issues 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:13.910
 I'll be fine for that 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.060
 you have watched a hearty 

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:18.860
 thanks to lc power for the uncomplicated 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:21.200
 provide the housing and until the 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.650
 next video on my channel one 

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.650
 Have a good time
