00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.200

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:05.790
 in the course of the power they receive 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:09.140

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.869

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:16.310
 I will constantly monitor the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.310
 time is running now 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:27.480
 See the girl take her with me 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.100
 Do everything he asks me to do 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.980
 otherwise my wife brings that nicely 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.330
 they have become friends with each other 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.850
 you need your help if you want yours 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.350
 want to have a wife again 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.260
 There is a parcel in the bank 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.400
 existing is excluded 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.400
 they have no choice 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:52.950
 why because I can drive 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.420
 I say to myself right now papa very well 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.799
 this shit over here 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.799
 we are just starting 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.230
 I finish that now 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.230
 I will not die for you 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.470
 they are running out of time 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.310
 I am a woman 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.490
 jan o 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.640
 So the trailer makes a little the 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.640
 impression on me now would be sick here 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.900
 Meet slowly to 35 on transporter 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.489
 and i hope i'm not that 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.500
 only feeling of the whole just 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.810
 Packed here in an action thriller 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.390
 By the way, waging tells us wildly by the way 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.920
 Bunch on the 21 november 2013 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.959
 probably in german cinemas 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.790
 brings the story of brandt he is 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.950
 former racing driver and as one 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.769
 day his wife elin is kidnapped 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.180
 and a mysterious caller calls him 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.410
 and say goodbye to your wife 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.480
 you will get one or the other 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.580
 instruction from me 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.110
 of course he would do anything for it 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.000
 and with that you have a pretty much like me 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.560
 find a stupid basis created where 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.720
 me an action thriller on the legs too 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.250
 So burn a car 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.900
 steal and then across the city 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.340
 somehow heat thale and which 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.560
 then fulfill the orders 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.510
 owner of this stolen car the 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.849
 required only as the kit knows 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.590
 then both appear somehow 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.480
 uneven couple bent the same 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.920
 story here in front of the camera next to it 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.390
 ethan hawke as main actor 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.650
 his page is part of a gram where 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.780
 I always like a little bit with three 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.280
 question mark must say whether she is at the 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.630
 What's up to the genre is what's happening now 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.190
 not even that is very high level 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.780
 the typical action-thriller you have to 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.730
 He is fit to look good and cool 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.620
 can lead dialogues and then jon 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.120
 voight on the bad side of 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.410
 blackmailer I'm curious what the 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.209
 but film has to offer really 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.829
 also say 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.959
 21 november that's a pretty one 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.940
 crazy state period november where 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.160
 many good movies come out the direction 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.350
 oscar squint alone already strip 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.790
 like the wall street could do that completely 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.100
 easily the ranking I am expire times 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.209
 curious so how you see is getaway 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.560
 Although a trailer of the very action 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.120
 but no one is cut to me 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.170
 now I would definitely get it 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.329
 not so much today 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.980
 character actor now likes exactly that 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:12.380
 right when it comes to something 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.700
 very possibly one-dimensional figure too 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.019
 embody in this action spring 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.729
 as well as the trailer at least until now 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.799
 the appearance makes me think so too 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.940
 little questionable look mediocre 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.410
 Excited what do you say a sweetheart 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.940
 like to comment that would me 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.039
 definitely interested in that was it 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.729
 also with my coach jack to galloway 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.770
 to let 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.000
 Make Berlin and let it stay we 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.410
 I do not like to last one 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.340
 cinema reviews or on twitter and 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.570
 facebook for both 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.639
 Write a little about movies 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.500
 and this or my second channel 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.210
 if you do not have videos from and with more 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.090
 Let's miss it if 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.979
 but only you decide tomorrow 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.560
 at 15 o'clock there is a latest here 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.530
 new video and until then I hope here 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.919
 since tomorrow, of course, again 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.919
 on the 3rd
