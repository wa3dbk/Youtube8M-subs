00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.709 
is really hot so yeah they have ceramic
tops<00:02:04.560> both<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.340> them<00:02:05.460> said<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:05.880> doesn't<00:02:06.509> melt

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
tops both of them said that doesn't melt

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.230 
tops both of them said that doesn't melt
and<00:02:07.049> then

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
and then

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.080 
and then
it<00:02:08.570> comes<00:02:08.780> with<00:02:08.900> a<00:02:09.050> screen<00:02:09.260> cage<00:02:09.830> top<00:02:10.960> so<00:02:11.960> it

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
it comes with a screen cage top so it

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.790 
it comes with a screen cage top so it
that<00:02:14.090> won't<00:02:14.360> melt<00:02:14.660> if<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.170> use<00:02:15.350> a<00:02:15.380> heating

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
that won't melt if you use a heating

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.440 
that won't melt if you use a heating
lamp<00:02:16.010> but<00:02:16.280> if<00:02:16.520> you<00:02:16.670> use<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:16.940> one<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.090> comes

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
lamp but if you use the one that comes

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.890 
lamp but if you use the one that comes
from<00:02:17.630> with<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:19.040> so<00:02:19.730> it<00:02:19.850> comes<00:02:20.030> with<00:02:20.210> that<00:02:20.480> with

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
from with and so it comes with that with

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.080 
from with and so it comes with that with

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
these things I mean it shows like that

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.180 
these things I mean it shows like that
and<00:03:19.640> that<00:03:19.880> those<00:03:20.660> are<00:03:20.840> actually<00:03:21.230> in<00:03:21.410> there<00:03:21.620> but

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
and that those are actually in there but

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.100 
and that those are actually in there but
then<00:03:22.570> shows<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:24.050> bowl<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:25.430> hide<00:03:26.110> some

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
decorations and stuff and that those

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.920 
decorations and stuff and that those
just<00:03:34.190> they<00:03:34.460> don't<00:03:34.670> come<00:03:34.850> with<00:03:35.030> it<00:03:35.180> like<00:03:35.330> I've<00:03:35.570> I
