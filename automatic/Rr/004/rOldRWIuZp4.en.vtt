00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.740
 the international debut of japan giucich 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.839
 amazon lands in mexico and ya or me in 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.309
 brazil how are you greeted by vanessa hand 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:16.900
 orellana 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.019
 and welcome to another segment of the 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.960
 week in Spanish cinema gabriel is 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:25.390
 week we started it with a lot of music and 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.300
 is that they finally launched this service 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.630
 Apple music streaming and then 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.750
 we already had several service options 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.870
 similar as spotify rhapsody or 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.850
 pandora but it seems that little wants 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.130
 come and want to throw all these eager 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.070
 to do the best of all of ariel well 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:48.670
 is vanessa on Monday suddenly point with 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.250
 the update to 8 aios 8.4 we 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.040
 it came to all the support sic and suddenly 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.710
 all our music collection and clear 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.840
 also our use of music to 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.490
 through streaming because it was tied to 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.980
 this apple service if it is that you 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.229
 are users of the devices of the 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.820
 giant of cupertino and good you what 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.810
 you put to the test I put it a 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.610
 little test 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.899
 and we have our first 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.450
 impressions 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:15.700
 maybe it offers too many functions 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.110
 they do not seem very useful to me 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.289
 I do not need to 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.390
 connect with the artists and this function 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.070
 this section is called connect is of the 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.110
 most important proposals that has not been 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.090
 done to poe but good the important thing is 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.549
 put it to tests compare it with spotify 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.439
 and see if in the long run this will be the 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.299
 music service they will use most 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.189
 our friends and the truth that both 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.850
 they cost around the same gabriel 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:43.060
 would be the equivalent of 10 dollars to 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.240
 month for unlimited service to the catalog 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.100
 of songs without ads and power 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.229
 download your playlists 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.420
 to be able to play offline both 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.750
 offer this but a japanese music offers 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.520
 the plan for the family plan up to six 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.500
 people for 15 dollars while 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.959
 spotify you have to pay 5 dollars for 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.080
 each person that adds to each person 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:07.569
 up to 5 then it's a bit more expensive 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.729
 and the other also that you already put it to 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:12.010
 proof is that with japan 'giucich it 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.660
 can use siri that seems like little 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.730
 but the truth be able to tell the 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.739
 device that music wants is that 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.260
 song you would like me to play what 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.700
 are you looking for in particular I find 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.530
 great and you put it to test in 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.390
 Spanish and you liked it but there is also something 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.459
 that you did not like that much 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.700
 this the interface the way it is 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.230
 organized the platform yes clear is 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.450
 question of tastes but to me the interface 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.359
 of spotify that is a little bit like more 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.120
 cleaner simpler to me it seems more 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.980
 easy to use but it is already very question 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.200
 of tastes and many of our users 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.450
 They already commented that what they think 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.609
 support and cic seem better to them so 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.920
 will have to prove it those three months of 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:53.049
 test and how to test it you 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.870
 clear three months from the minimum for 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.220
 know if it is indeed the system that 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.380
 one wants to use for your collection of 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.480
 music and good to be tied to all your 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.090
 musical preferences and tell us about 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.030
 amazon in your country gabriel and is that 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.709
 they finally launched a doctor because our 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.290
 reporter oscar gutierrez was there 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.030
 present in the official announcement 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.219
 arrival from amazon to mexico and clear 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.790
 amazon already offered things in mexico in 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:21.280
 particular of books and books 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.980
 electronic through its website 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.680
 but the arrival is more in plan 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.450
 distribute more products and also something 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.090
 very important to vanessa is that the 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.730
 third-party vendors already 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.140
 can use the amazon platform to 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.659
 sell their products that is something very 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.540
 important business of amazon so 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:43.299
 less here in the USA something that will not come 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.310
 that I use is amazon prime that is 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.549
 this service that with an annual fee of 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.220
 100 dollars you have access not only to the 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.620
 shipments of two days but also to one 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.950
 good collection of videos and books 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.720
 also and as he told us between 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.659
 us how good it can sometimes be that 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.939
 because the shipping system in our 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:05.349
 countries is not so reliable said here 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:07.510
 You may not reach the two days that 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.269
 promises mans on fire or that and maybe 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.939
 that they could not guarantee the rights 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.739
 of all these films for the region 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:16.690
 or for Mexico in particular but as 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.739
 well you say it is very likely that you have 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.900
 to do with 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.759
 because the lack of guarantee that a 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.889
 product that a shipment can arrive in 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:26.440
 two days as is the promise of amazon 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.840
 prime here in the USA and we continue with another 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.139
 launch in Latin America but more 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.240
 south and west was Xiaomi in Brazil that 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.400
 Chinese company that has already become 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.560
 the leading phone manufacturer in 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.870
 china gabriel tell us a little bit what 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.789
 means and why it is important to them 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.979
 they had already said or vanessa that they were going to 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.110
 launch in India that they already did and 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:49.810
 I was going to follow Brazil after which 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.099
 in this sense it is not a surprise what 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.849
 important is that it arrives or is 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:56.710
 growing like foam see today 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:59.199
 they warned that they have sold 37 million 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.930
 devices only in the last quarter 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.159
 and it is a very serious competition what 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.900
 you have to take into account is that the 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:07.560
 company has said several times that its 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.240
 main goal is to sell devices 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.190
 unlocked in emerging markets to 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.220
 Although they already have a certain presence 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.530
 in the USA with my dotcom that your website 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.180
 where they only sell accessories in 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.190
 USA have not brought the phones 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.889
 we believe they are preparing 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.870
 for a launch in the US in the future 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.060
 but there was bar that is the vice president 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.669
 international of seom and who is 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.680
 Brazilian has insisted that they are not 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.729
 ready for us or at least for 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.020
 Sell ​​your phones in the USA 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:40.779
 usa is the goose that lays the golden eggs 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.960
 and it would be weird that in a moment maybe 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:46.659
 not this year or the next but in 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.939
 some time now or I decide to offer their 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:51.099
 phones in the US vanessa in particular 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:53.319
 because more and more US carriers 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:55.409
 are coming out of this idea of ​​subsidizing 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:58.240
 the phone and they're leaving the 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:59.680
 user to the customer the option to buy 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.560
 the phone they want then 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.569
 while users in the US do not 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.699
 we saw a lot the price of the phone 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:08.770
 before when we signed a contract of two 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:10.629
 years more and more people will be 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.460
 more aware of how much it costs 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:14.770
 device and maybe they will be more 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.689
 interested in purchasing devices 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.879
 very good quality but low price 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:20.740
 like yao ming and good to see 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:25.060
 nests that will be launched in Brazil gabriel 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:27.729
 it costs 164 the equivalent of 164 dollars 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.650
 gabriel so if you're right that as 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:31.330
 you mentioned unlocked 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:35.169
 in pretty good camera features 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:37.570
 8 megapixel screen in hd and good 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:39.490
 I like your saying gabriel growing 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.940
 like the foam and chickens of the eggs 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:45.009
 of gold I like them good and also they 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:48.220
 I remember that next week we will be 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:51.520
 at the comic conference in this 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:54.190
 comics conference that good I do not know 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:57.039
 a lot of gabriel comics I think you 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.840
 I followed more superheroes I good 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:00.789
 the important thing is that comedian 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.320
 only at a comics conference 

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:03.610
 vanessa but also the 

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.190
 film distributors are 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:09.780
 using to present his films 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:12.639
 more geek and will be antoine will be 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.650
 pixels that is a new sony movie 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:16.300
 pictures and good there will be some of 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.340
 the actors and they will also be there 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.440
 Claudia our reporter and tania 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.720
 gonzález our network director 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.669
 social doing coverage and good 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.260

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:28.330
 fair that is the largest in the world in 

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.190
 This sense where people dress 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.860
 and it's very funny is very 

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.510
 very active very pleasant and in addition to the 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.390
 information that comes out of the releases 

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:40.420
 of movies because there is this matter of 

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:42.790
 the costumes and the great atmosphere that 

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:45.370
 believe in santiago yes i think more more 

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:47.770
 interesting are the disguises of the 

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.580
 the fair itself that of the comics 

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.110
 but good 

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:53.230
 remember that we have all these 

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:56.500
