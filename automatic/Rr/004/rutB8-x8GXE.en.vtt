cr123<00:00:25.170> 3<00:00:26.130> volts<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.699> order<00:00:27.599> them<00:00:27.779> through<00:00:28.099> one

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
cr123 3 volts you order them through one

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.130 
cr123 3 volts you order them through one
of<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.279> vendors<00:00:29.580> through<00:00:29.789> Amazon<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.929> comes

of the vendors through Amazon it comes

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.229 
of the vendors through Amazon it comes
in<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.349> little<00:00:31.560> plastic<00:00:31.710> bag<00:00:32.040> ten<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.090> them

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
in a little plastic bag ten of them

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.790 
in a little plastic bag ten of them
stacked<00:00:33.570> up<00:00:34.160> you<00:00:35.160> know<00:00:35.250> inside<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.640> bag<00:00:36.800> and

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
stacked up you know inside the bag and

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.450 
stacked up you know inside the bag and
then<00:00:39.140> here's<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.230> test<00:00:40.590> with<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.950> multimeter

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
then here's a test with the multimeter

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:53.600 
then here's a test with the multimeter
straight<00:00:42.090> out<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.360> bag<00:00:43.940> reading<00:00:52.430> this<00:00:53.430> is

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
straight out of the bag reading this is

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.810 
straight out of the bag reading this is
a<00:00:53.640> never<00:00:53.969> used<00:00:54.329> battery<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.370> it<00:00:56.370> should<00:00:56.610> read

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
a never used battery so it should read

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.479 
a never used battery so it should read
higher<00:00:57.090> than<00:00:57.420> three<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.710> average<00:00:58.829> was<00:00:59.219> around

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
higher than three the average was around

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.279 
higher than three the average was around
three<00:00:59.699> point-two<00:01:00.030> those<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.989> didn't<00:01:01.170> see

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
three point-two those you didn't see

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.280 
three point-two those you didn't see
it's<00:01:01.410> three<00:01:01.620> point<00:01:01.890> two<00:01:02.100> four<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.390> then

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
it's three point two four and then

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.160 
it's three point two four and then
here's<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.680> battery<00:01:04.890> I've<00:01:05.159> been<00:01:05.309> using<00:01:06.020> in<00:01:07.020> a

said that in the Phoenix and I've been

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.490 
said that in the Phoenix and I've been
using<00:01:16.920> for<00:01:17.070> about<00:01:17.360> about<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.479> month<00:01:18.930> now<00:01:19.140> let's

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500

see<00:01:19.680> what<00:01:19.830> we<00:01:19.950> got<00:01:20.100> for<00:01:20.130> battery<00:01:20.640> life<00:01:20.880> so

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
see what we got for battery life so

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.010 
see what we got for battery life so
seems<00:01:23.250> like<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:23.580> pretty<00:01:23.820> slow<00:01:24.360> and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
seems like it's pretty slow and
