so basically what you need is a block of

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.729 
so basically what you need is a block of
hardened<00:04:10.409> iron

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
hardened iron

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.140 
hardened iron
basically<00:04:11.010> what<00:04:11.159> you<00:04:11.220> do<00:04:11.370> is<00:04:11.579> just<00:04:11.609> make<00:04:12.000> it

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
basically what you do is just make it

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.589 
basically what you do is just make it
block<00:04:12.419> out<00:04:12.659> of<00:04:13.340> the<00:04:14.340> hardened<00:04:14.609> iron<00:04:15.239> ingots

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
block out of the hardened iron ingots

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.449 
block out of the hardened iron ingots
which<00:04:15.720> is<00:04:15.840> gold<00:04:16.049> and<00:04:16.260> then<00:04:16.739> you'll<00:04:16.859> get<00:04:17.010> a<00:04:17.190> gold

which is gold and then you'll get a gold

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.399 
which is gold and then you'll get a gold
block<00:04:17.609> which<00:04:17.940> is<00:04:17.970> retexture<00:04:18.780> it<00:04:18.840> as<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.199> block

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:19.409 
block which is retexture it as the block

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:21.770 
block which is retexture it as the block
of<00:04:19.699> hardened<00:04:20.699> iron<00:04:21.060> so<00:04:21.419> then<00:04:21.539> you<00:04:21.630> want<00:04:21.750> to
