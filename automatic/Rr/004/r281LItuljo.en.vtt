00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
want to insert your key turn it to the

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.849 
want to insert your key turn it to the
on<00:00:26.580> position<00:00:26.670> which<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.449> right<00:00:27.689> before<00:00:27.869> you

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
on position which is right before you

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.990 
on position which is right before you
crank<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.429> engine<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.730> turn<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:31.850> then<00:00:32.850> what

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
crank the engine to turn on then what

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.970 
crank the engine to turn on then what
you<00:00:33.120> do<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.570> push<00:00:34.170> your<00:00:34.380> foot<00:00:34.590> down<00:00:34.739> on<00:00:34.800> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
you do is push your foot down on the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.130 
you do is push your foot down on the
accelerator<00:00:35.010> all<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.000> way<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.450> hold<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:36.989> for

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
accelerator all the way and hold it for

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.560 
accelerator all the way and hold it for
five<00:00:37.350> seconds<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.520> then<00:00:38.579> you're<00:00:39.000> gonna<00:00:39.239> turn

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
five seconds and then you're gonna turn

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.260 
five seconds and then you're gonna turn
the<00:00:39.690> key<00:00:39.870> back<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.430> zero<00:00:42.090> position

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
the key back to the zero position

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.930 
the key back to the zero position
without<00:00:43.230> pulling<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.710> out<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:43.980> then<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.789> can

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
without pulling it out and then you can

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.610 
without pulling it out and then you can
take<00:00:45.180> off<00:00:45.360> your<00:00:45.840> foot<00:00:46.320> from<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.590> accelerator

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
take off your foot from the accelerator

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:54.889 
take off your foot from the accelerator
so<00:00:47.129> I'll<00:00:47.190> do<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.399> right<00:00:47.550> now

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.229 

and<00:00:55.199> now<00:00:55.739> what<00:00:55.890> I'm<00:00:55.980> gonna<00:00:56.100> do<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.399> wait<00:00:56.699> two

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
and now what I'm gonna do is wait two

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.670 
and now what I'm gonna do is wait two
minutes<00:00:57.829> for<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:59.910> EC<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.570> reset<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.140> while

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
minutes for the EC to reset and while

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.020 
minutes for the EC to reset and while
this<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.039> doing<00:01:02.309> its<00:01:02.430> thing<00:01:02.489> make<00:01:02.850> sure<00:01:02.879> you

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
this is doing its thing make sure you

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.939 
this is doing its thing make sure you
don't<00:01:03.120> push<00:01:03.359> any<00:01:03.629> buttons<00:01:04.140> anything<00:01:04.470> because

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
don't push any buttons anything because

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.370 
don't push any buttons anything because
that's<00:01:05.010> gonna<00:01:05.220> disrupt<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.850> whole<00:01:06.810> process

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
that's gonna disrupt the whole process

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.060 
that's gonna disrupt the whole process
so<00:01:08.280> basically<00:01:08.640> what<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.630> will<00:01:09.869> do<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.070> reset

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
so basically what this will do is reset

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.000 
so basically what this will do is reset
your<00:01:11.939> transmission<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.960> throttle<00:01:13.650> settings

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
your transmission and throttle settings

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.940 
your transmission and throttle settings
because<00:01:14.640> when<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.509> drive<00:01:15.869> your<00:01:16.020> car<00:01:16.080> your

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
because when you drive your car your

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.179 
because when you drive your car your
transmission<00:01:17.720> adapt<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.259> way<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:20.009> you

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
transmission adapt to the way that you

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.700 
transmission adapt to the way that you
drive<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:21.210> if<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.450> drive<00:01:21.689> slower<00:01:22.140> it's<00:01:22.590> gonna

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
drive so if you drive slower it's gonna

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.469 
drive so if you drive slower it's gonna
adapt<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:24.150> us<00:01:24.630> it'll<00:01:25.200> shift<00:01:26.100> quicker<00:01:26.490> if<00:01:26.820> you

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
adapt to us it'll shift quicker if you

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.109 
adapt to us it'll shift quicker if you
go<00:01:28.049> I'm<00:01:28.170> saying<00:01:28.439> but<00:01:29.310> if<00:01:29.490> you're<00:01:29.790> more<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.060> an

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
go I'm saying but if you're more of an

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.179 
go I'm saying but if you're more of an
aggressive<00:01:30.509> driver<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:31.140> will<00:01:31.560> hold<00:01:32.009> our

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
aggressive driver it will hold our

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.130 
aggressive driver it will hold our
shifts<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.549> little<00:01:32.640> bit<00:01:32.759> longer<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.840> basically

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
shifts a little bit longer so basically

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.679 
shifts a little bit longer so basically
what<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.530> does<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.340> resets<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:36.030> throttle

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
what this does is it resets the throttle

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.649 
what this does is it resets the throttle
and<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:38.340> transmission<00:01:38.909> back<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.329> factory

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
and the transmission back to the factory

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.399 
and the transmission back to the factory
settings<00:01:40.020> where<00:01:41.030> it's<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.180> basic<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.049> brand<00:01:43.290> new

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
settings where it's a basic a brand new

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.340 
settings where it's a basic a brand new
transmission<00:01:43.950> now<00:01:44.340> transmission<00:01:44.850> but<00:01:44.970> like

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
transmission now transmission but like

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.469 
transmission now transmission but like
brand<00:01:46.350> new<00:01:46.409> car<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:48.060> gives<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.360> that

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
brand new car and it gives you that

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.499 
brand new car and it gives you that
little<00:01:49.200> extra<00:01:49.380> power<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.329> it's<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> very

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
little extra power and it's a very

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.700 
little extra power and it's a very
simple<00:01:51.750> process<00:01:51.899> -<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.290> only<00:01:52.380> takes<00:01:52.530> two

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
simple process - it only takes two

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.039 
simple process - it only takes two
minutes<00:01:53.060> so<00:01:54.710> no<00:01:55.710> wait<00:01:55.860> one<00:01:56.130> more<00:01:56.310> minute<00:01:57.049> and

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
minutes so no wait one more minute and

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.840 
minutes so no wait one more minute and
like<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.350> said<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.590> can't<00:01:58.829> touch<00:01:59.189> open<00:01:59.520> any

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
like I said you can't touch open any

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.190 
like I said you can't touch open any
doors<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.240> can't<00:02:00.420> open<00:02:00.540> any<00:02:00.689> windows<00:02:01.049> all

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
doors you can't open any windows all

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.490 
doors you can't open any windows all
