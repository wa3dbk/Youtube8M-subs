the derma roller right now it's fairly

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.289 
the derma roller right now it's fairly
small<00:01:43.890> it's<00:01:44.130> almost<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.759> know<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> little<00:01:45.210> bit

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
small it's almost you know a little bit

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.760 
small it's almost you know a little bit
smaller<00:01:45.570> than<00:01:45.720> my<00:01:45.840> hand<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.409> has<00:01:46.560> this

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
smaller than my hand and it has this

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.889 
smaller than my hand and it has this
little<00:01:46.890> cradle<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:48.329> lets<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.659> fit

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
little cradle in it that lets it fit

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.859 
little cradle in it that lets it fit
ever<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.380> nicely<00:01:49.619> into<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.280> packaging<00:01:50.869> so

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
ever so nicely into the packaging so

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.170 
ever so nicely into the packaging so
this<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.320> derma<00:01:52.590> roller<00:01:52.860> roller<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.909> tried

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
this is the derma roller roller I tried

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.789 
this is the derma roller roller I tried
really<00:01:54.329> hard<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.659> zoom<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.439> guys<00:01:55.619> can

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
really hard to zoom in so you guys can

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:56.410 
really hard to zoom in so you guys can
see<00:01:56.040> what

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
see what

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.760 
see what
needles<00:01:56.720> look<00:01:56.869> like<00:01:57.049> but<00:01:57.290> I<00:01:57.320> couldn't<00:01:57.710> just

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
needles look like but I couldn't just

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.820 
needles look like but I couldn't just
get<00:01:58.490> it<00:01:58.580> to<00:01:58.700> work<00:01:58.820> so<00:01:59.390> we<00:01:59.689> can<00:01:59.810> kind<00:02:00.020> of<00:02:00.049> see<00:02:00.380> by

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
get it to work so we can kind of see by

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.469 
get it to work so we can kind of see by
the<00:02:00.890> angle<00:02:01.340> I<00:02:01.460> kind<00:02:01.700> of<00:02:01.729> show<00:02:01.909> you<00:02:01.970> can<00:02:02.090> see<00:02:02.299> the

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
the angle I kind of show you can see the

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.830 
the angle I kind of show you can see the
tiny<00:02:02.810> Lu<00:02:03.020> needles<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:04.090> like<00:02:05.090> I<00:02:05.299> said<00:02:05.570> it's<00:02:05.780> a

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
tiny Lu needles and like I said it's a

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.840 
tiny Lu needles and like I said it's a
fairly<00:02:06.020> small<00:02:06.350> comparison<00:02:07.040> to<00:02:07.130> my<00:02:07.250> hand<00:02:07.520> and

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
fairly small comparison to my hand and

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.440 
fairly small comparison to my hand and
you<00:02:08.630> can<00:02:08.780> honestly<00:02:09.670> barely<00:02:10.670> even<00:02:10.759> see<00:02:11.180> where

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
you can honestly barely even see where

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.760 
you can honestly barely even see where
most<00:02:11.660> of<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.840> needles<00:02:12.110> are<00:02:12.230> so<00:02:12.410> it's<00:02:12.530> a<00:02:12.620> lot

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
most of the needles are so it's a lot

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.880 
most of the needles are so it's a lot
less<00:02:12.950> intimidating<00:02:13.310> when<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:15.080> lot<00:02:15.800> of<00:02:15.830> people

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
less intimidating when a lot of people

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.199 
less intimidating when a lot of people
have<00:02:16.100> heard<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.340> horror<00:02:16.550> stories<00:02:16.610> of<00:02:17.030> derma

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
have heard the horror stories of derma

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.550 
have heard the horror stories of derma
rolling<00:02:17.450> but<00:02:17.750> I<00:02:17.780> was<00:02:17.930> pretty<00:02:18.140> confident<00:02:18.470> about

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
rolling but I was pretty confident about

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.440 
rolling but I was pretty confident about
it<00:02:18.709> so<00:02:19.370> I'm<00:02:19.459> just<00:02:19.580> taking<00:02:19.850> some<00:02:19.910> rubbing

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
it so I'm just taking some rubbing

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.660 
it so I'm just taking some rubbing
alcohol<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:21.200> wish<00:02:21.770> I<00:02:21.860> had<00:02:21.950> a<00:02:22.010> higher<00:02:22.160> percentage

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
alcohol I wish I had a higher percentage

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.720 
alcohol I wish I had a higher percentage
but<00:02:22.700> this<00:02:22.970> is<00:02:23.090> 50%<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:24.110> I<00:02:24.920> just<00:02:25.250> poured<00:02:25.610> it

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
but this is 50% and I just poured it

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.640 
but this is 50% and I just poured it
right<00:02:25.760> into<00:02:26.150> that<00:02:26.360> little<00:02:26.810> cradle<00:02:27.050> that<00:02:27.410> it

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
right into that little cradle that it

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.890 
right into that little cradle that it
came<00:02:27.920> in<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.430> I<00:02:28.489> know<00:02:28.550> you<00:02:29.239> don't<00:02:29.390> have<00:02:29.630> to<00:02:29.780> do

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
came in and I know you don't have to do

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.660 
came in and I know you don't have to do
that<00:02:30.019> I<00:02:30.080> didn't<00:02:30.380> have<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.530> sterile<00:02:30.950> cup<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:31.459> I

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
that I didn't have a sterile cup so I

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.520 
that I didn't have a sterile cup so I
just<00:02:32.180> put<00:02:32.360> it<00:02:32.420> in<00:02:32.510> there<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:32.930> rolled<00:02:33.200> the

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
just put it in there and rolled the

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.530 
just put it in there and rolled the
derma<00:02:33.830> roller<00:02:34.069> back<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.549> forth<00:02:34.819> for<00:02:35.209> him<00:02:35.360> back

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
derma roller back and forth for him back

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.080 
derma roller back and forth for him back
for<00:02:35.900> about<00:02:36.140> five<00:02:36.560> minutes<00:02:36.799> total<00:02:37.220> until<00:02:38.000> I

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
for about five minutes total until I

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.699 
for about five minutes total until I
felt<00:02:38.360> that<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.690> derma<00:02:38.930> roller<00:02:39.110> was<00:02:39.319> fairly

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
felt that the derma roller was fairly

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.699 
felt that the derma roller was fairly
rinsed<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.549> then<00:02:40.700> I<00:02:40.850> shook<00:02:41.180> it<00:02:41.299> out<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:41.709> let

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
rinsed and then I shook it out and let

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.590 
rinsed and then I shook it out and let
it<00:02:42.739> air<00:02:43.069> dry<00:02:43.180> for<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.540> couple<00:02:45.049> of<00:02:45.080> minutes<00:02:45.260> and

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
it air dry for a couple of minutes and

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.759 
it air dry for a couple of minutes and
this<00:02:47.600> is<00:02:47.780> where<00:02:47.959> you<00:02:48.019> guys<00:02:48.110> see<00:02:48.350> me<00:02:48.470> start

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
this is where you guys see me start

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.670 
this is where you guys see me start
rolling<00:02:49.069> and<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:49.970> was<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.150> very<00:02:50.420> odd<00:02:50.780> feeling<00:02:51.350> at

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
rolling and it was a very odd feeling at

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.110 
rolling and it was a very odd feeling at
first<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:52.459> I<00:02:52.670> was<00:02:52.850> really<00:02:53.000> used<00:02:53.209> to<00:02:53.330> it

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.979 

we<00:02:59.120> feel<00:02:59.599> that

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
we feel that

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.760 
we feel that
you<00:03:01.109> can<00:03:01.260> definitely<00:03:01.560> feel<00:03:02.040> it

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
you can definitely feel it

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.240 
you can definitely feel it
doesn't<00:03:04.400> hurt<00:03:04.730> but

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
doesn't hurt but

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.020 
doesn't hurt but
there's<00:03:06.850> a<00:03:07.030> feeling<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.370> directions<00:03:09.790> do

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
there's a feeling so the directions do

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.380 
there's a feeling so the directions do
say<00:03:10.330> to<00:03:10.390> go<00:03:10.780> in<00:03:11.050> like<00:03:11.320> a<00:03:11.350> up<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:12.520> down<00:03:12.610> side<00:03:13.360> to

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
say to go in like a up and down side to

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.690 
say to go in like a up and down side to
side<00:03:13.720> and<00:03:13.930> then<00:03:14.050> crisscross<00:03:15.040> it's<00:03:15.310> kind<00:03:15.610> of

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
side and then crisscross it's kind of

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.780 
side and then crisscross it's kind of
the<00:03:15.790> size<00:03:16.030> of<00:03:16.330> the<00:03:16.630> asterisk<00:03:17.550> you<00:03:18.550> play

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
the size of the asterisk you play

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.980 
the size of the asterisk you play
reading<00:03:19.060> my<00:03:19.390> tongue<00:03:19.750> tickle<00:03:21.780> it's<00:03:22.780> the

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
reading my tongue tickle it's the

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.470 
reading my tongue tickle it's the
weirdest<00:03:23.380> feeling<00:03:23.470> ever

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
weirdest feeling ever

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.150 
weirdest feeling ever
and<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:25.570> just<00:03:25.720> did<00:03:25.840> that<00:03:25.990> over<00:03:26.200> my<00:03:26.500> entire<00:03:26.830> face

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
and I just did that over my entire face

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.340 
and I just did that over my entire face
until<00:03:28.030> I<00:03:28.060> felt<00:03:28.420> like<00:03:28.540> it<00:03:28.720> was<00:03:28.810> pretty<00:03:29.110> well

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
until I felt like it was pretty well

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.740 
until I felt like it was pretty well
covered<00:03:29.800> and<00:03:29.980> it<00:03:30.700> didn't<00:03:31.030> like<00:03:31.150> really<00:03:31.450> hurt

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
covered and it didn't like really hurt

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.570 
covered and it didn't like really hurt
but<00:03:31.900> it<00:03:31.990> is<00:03:32.110> you<00:03:32.410> felt<00:03:32.740> it<00:03:33.690> in<00:03:34.690> there<00:03:35.370> this<00:03:36.370> is

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
but it is you felt it in there this is

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.930 
but it is you felt it in there this is
so<00:03:36.850> odd

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.070 

because<00:03:43.480> I<00:03:43.510> can't<00:03:44.020> even<00:03:44.110> describe<00:03:45.870> all<00:03:46.870> this

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
because I can't even describe all this

00:03:47.080 --> 00:04:02.030 
because I can't even describe all this
feels<00:03:47.380> right<00:03:47.590> now<00:03:55.290> my<00:03:56.290> god<00:03:56.530> is<00:03:56.740> so<00:03:57.100> weird

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.530 

so<00:04:03.040> I<00:04:03.070> was<00:04:03.160> just<00:04:03.310> making<00:04:03.580> sure<00:04:03.640> I<00:04:03.760> cover<00:04:04.060> it<00:04:04.210> up

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
so I was just making sure I cover it up

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.360 
so I was just making sure I cover it up
you<00:04:04.660> know<00:04:04.780> pretty<00:04:05.230> much<00:04:05.320> all<00:04:05.590> over<00:04:05.920> my<00:04:06.070> face

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
you know pretty much all over my face

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.800 
you know pretty much all over my face
but<00:04:06.610> I<00:04:06.730> want<00:04:06.910> to<00:04:06.970> make<00:04:07.090> sure<00:04:07.120> it's<00:04:07.450> fairly

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
but I want to make sure it's fairly

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.620 
but I want to make sure it's fairly
evenly<00:04:08.230> distributed<00:04:10.320> used<00:04:11.320> to<00:04:11.530> it<00:04:11.620> now<00:04:11.890> so<00:04:12.630> I

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
evenly distributed used to it now so I

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.770 
evenly distributed used to it now so I
can't<00:04:13.990> really

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.030 

skin<00:04:20.380> is<00:04:20.500> like<00:04:20.829> oh<00:04:20.980> okay<00:04:21.340> this<00:04:21.730> is<00:04:21.910> a<00:04:21.940> thing<00:04:23.040> if

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
skin is like oh okay this is a thing if

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.170 
skin is like oh okay this is a thing if
that<00:04:24.250> makes<00:04:24.460> sense<00:04:26.280> and<00:04:27.280> this<00:04:27.490> is<00:04:27.670> actually

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
that makes sense and this is actually

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.370 
that makes sense and this is actually
the<00:04:28.270> last<00:04:28.450> clip<00:04:28.690> I<00:04:28.810> have<00:04:28.840> when<00:04:29.170> I<00:04:29.260> was

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
look like after derma rolling of course

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.420 
look like after derma rolling of course
I<00:06:08.450> don't<00:06:08.510> really<00:06:08.630> see<00:06:08.960> a<00:06:09.200> big<00:06:09.500> difference<00:06:10.220> but

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
I don't really see a big difference but

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.360 
I don't really see a big difference but
I<00:06:10.490> did<00:06:10.910> notice<00:06:11.180> that<00:06:11.450> my<00:06:11.750> products<00:06:12.410> that<00:06:13.160> I<00:06:13.190> put

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
I did notice that my products that I put

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.100 
I did notice that my products that I put
on<00:06:13.460> after<00:06:13.880> really<00:06:14.210> absorbed<00:06:14.720> very<00:06:14.960> quickly

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
on after really absorbed very quickly

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.470 
on after really absorbed very quickly
and<00:06:15.740> so<00:06:16.370> that's<00:06:16.610> definitely<00:06:16.910> a<00:06:17.120> good<00:06:17.210> sign<00:06:17.450> for

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480 
and so that's definitely a good sign for

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.750 
and so that's definitely a good sign for
me<00:06:17.750> so<00:06:18.080> we'll<00:06:18.620> see<00:06:18.800> if<00:06:18.920> there's<00:06:19.100> any<00:06:19.280> changes
