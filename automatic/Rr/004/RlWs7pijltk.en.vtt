00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
of the core of the onion just work it

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.060 
of the core of the onion just work it
out<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:01.270> that<00:02:01.960> what<00:02:02.080> it's<00:02:02.230> got<00:02:02.380> some<00:02:02.530> fibrous

material inside of there and it

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.900 
material inside of there and it
sometimes<00:02:05.560> it<00:02:05.890> helps<00:02:06.010> if<00:02:06.280> you<00:02:06.430> just<00:02:06.610> remove

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
sometimes it helps if you just remove

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.680 
sometimes it helps if you just remove
that<00:02:08.340> if<00:02:09.340> there's<00:02:09.610> some<00:02:09.790> corrine<00:02:10.180> tools<00:02:10.450> like

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
that if there's some corrine tools like

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.960 
that if there's some corrine tools like
Apple<00:02:11.140> pouring<00:02:11.530> tools<00:02:11.740> and<00:02:12.040> stuff<00:02:12.190> there<00:02:12.880> it

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
Apple pouring tools and stuff there it

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.310 
Apple pouring tools and stuff there it
is<00:02:13.030> see<00:02:13.600> how<00:02:13.690> that's<00:02:13.900> discolored<00:02:15.030> up<00:02:16.030> there

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
is see how that's discolored up there
