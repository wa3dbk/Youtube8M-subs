00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 Friend, watch the nest, did you know? 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.599
 that it is formed by exchange funds 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.620
 friendly with the locals generates food 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.650
 for both 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.540
 the leaves taken to the niches 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.930
 support the funds that transform the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.859
 starch of sugar plants for the 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.650
 ants 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.670
 interesting is the fuel of this 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.090
 process 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.390
 you know the humidity the water you are in 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.090
 doha form of gas that we breathe 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.579
 that same water that comes in contact with 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.399
 leaves and produces the droplets that 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.670
 we call dew in chemistry classes 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.559
 we learn that warmer air 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.469
 with the coldest surface and 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.050
 passing the gaseous state to the liquid is 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.739
 the condensation of an eye in this process 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.809
 Natural 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.960
 this company has developed a kind of 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.670
 mini water plant ready to drink and 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.510
 this water is then stored in the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.219
 pure clean drinking water reservoir and 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.769
 ready to sell 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.689
 technology only needs power to 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.479
 the parts go through a 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.580
 strict hygienization process are 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.000
 taken to the assembly line and 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.040
 receive motors and accessories and wires 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.520
 the equipment looks like a common water cooler 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.509
 but alone it is able to absorb and 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.909
 filter donate 25 liters of water per day 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.549
 but who manufactures ensures the return is 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.390
 fast as you only need to turn it on 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.790
 power plug 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.950
 is really is the point technology of 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.530
 dew that we have just presented and 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.060
 surprising our consumer 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.150
 small machines are being 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.450
 produced on a large scale but in the 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.710
 ability to generate water from the air 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.170
 is infinite 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.600
 so much that large companies requested the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.299
 mounting of even larger machines 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.119
 this one is moved by computer indicates 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.340
 temperature and humidity percentage 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.689
 other important details to generate 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:08.009
 thousand liters of water it is 40 times more 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:12.300
 ie potent can fill in 24 hours 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.390
 two boxes like this one with drinking water is 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.690
 one water 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.970
 does not hurt but everything in life is 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.690
 necessity dosage question 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:26.650
 you need certain certain minerals 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.959
 This water will not hold up, but you 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.209
 you need to eliminate substances in your 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.660
 blood that are harmful to this water 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:37.180
 will help the river thank the technology 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.310
 developed in mines can be the 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.670
 solution to the region's difficulties 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.670
 northeast and even from other parts of the world
