00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.300
We are now open!

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.300
Today I am going to make a dish you can find in cook-to-order restaurants.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.100
Fried Sliced Pork with Garlic.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.660
This is a quick meal that you can have both at home and street restaurants.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.260
Don’t underestimate this simple dish because it requires some skills.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.460
First of all, we need to marinade the pork.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:00.100
I use the leg part because it’s tender and contains fat.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.980
Slice it into bite size pieces.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.300
Just about this size.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.680
After that, marinade with oyster sauce.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.180
You can choose whatever brands you like.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.040
The one that tastes good is the one you like.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.960
The one that you like will taste so good.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.000
Add 2 spoonfuls.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.480
And 2 spoons of soy sauce

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.660
followed by a spoon of sugar.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.420
Add 2 tablespoons of water to soften the pork.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.040
Then it’s spa time.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:05.120
Give it a massage. Knead it for 5 minutes until the pork soaks up all the marinade.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.580
Leave in the fridge for about half an hour before use.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.220
Meanwhile, we will prepare fried garlic.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.780
Use Thai garlics like this.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.280
Small cloves, aromatic

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.840
and most importantly, it can act like organic seasoning powder.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.060
Smash the garlics and roughly chop.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.920
Don’t have to be fine little pieces.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.440
Before turn on the heat, add chopped garlics and oil in the pan.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.280
turn on the heat

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.600
You will need to use low heat to fry the garlics.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.260
Have you ever tasted sticky and bitter fried garlics?

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.160
That is a result of using wrong level of heat.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.940
The perfect fried garlics have to be aromatic and crisp, not bitter.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.760
When the color of the garlics starts to change, it means they are getting cooked very quickly.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.800
You will need to remove them from the heat as they will continue to get cooked after that.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.840
Now the garlics are done

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.940
and while we are waiting for marinated pork, let’s cook fried eggs.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.320
I will fry it sunny side up with runny egg yolk and crispy white egg.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.600
Our pork is ready

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.680
so turn on the heat and use the oil left after frying garlics.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.520
Add 3 tablespoons on the pan over medium heat.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:10.020
When it gets hot, put the meat in the pan and toss until it’s all cooked and turns brown on the outside.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.020
Add the fried garlics as much as you need

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.500
and season with ground pepper.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.000
You can turn off the heat now.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.580
Get the rice ready.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.220
Use jasmine rice for its nice fragrance.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.840
Place the pork over steamed rice

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.400
and then top with sunny side up fried egg.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.380
Serve with sliced cucumbers.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.920
This is an ultimate food.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.220
It is best to enjoy it hot.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.480
Fried Sliced Pork with Garlic

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.480
tender pork and aromatic garlic.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.720
You can find full recipe on Sangdad Publishing Facebook page.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.620
I can cook and so can you.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.340
Cook it yourself.
