coming<00:01:54.420> out<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.569> a<00:01:54.659> forward<00:01:54.990> roll<00:01:55.170> or<00:01:55.770> your

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
coming out of a forward roll or your

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.499 
coming out of a forward roll or your
just<00:01:56.039> your<00:01:56.189> backs<00:01:56.490> rolling<00:01:57.000> against<00:01:57.270> the

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
just your backs rolling against the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.260 
just your backs rolling against the
floor<00:01:58.009> if<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.189> hit<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.459> with<00:01:59.490> an<00:01:59.729> arched<00:02:00.000> back

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
floor if you hit it with an arched back

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.050 
floor if you hit it with an arched back
that<00:02:00.810> kind<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.229> does<00:02:01.439> for<00:02:01.709> it<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:01.979> don't<00:02:02.609> arch

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
that kind of does for it so don't arch

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.969 
that kind of does for it so don't arch
your<00:02:03.149> back<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.689> should<00:02:03.929> roll<00:02:05.780> so<00:02:06.979> you're

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
your back you should roll so you're

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:14.800 
your back you should roll so you're
gonna<00:02:08.069> handstand<00:02:09.739> Hill<00:02:10.739> your<00:02:10.950> back<00:02:11.209> and<00:02:12.209> then

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.800 

that's<00:02:15.810> basically<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.980> first<00:02:17.130> step<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.879> if

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
that's basically the first step and if

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.569 
that's basically the first step and if
you're<00:02:18.989> afraid<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.410> like<00:02:19.860> hitting<00:02:20.220> your<00:02:20.370> head

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
you're afraid of like hitting your head

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:21.440 
you're afraid of like hitting your head
on<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.910> ground

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
on the ground

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.750 
on the ground
that's<00:02:22.019> understandable<00:02:23.010> because<00:02:23.160> it's<00:02:23.579> just

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
that's understandable because it's just

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
falling out of a handstand or if you're

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.059 
falling out of a handstand or if you're
first<00:03:39.180> learning<00:03:39.480> this<00:03:39.780> skill<00:03:39.959> it's<00:03:40.680> okay<00:03:41.010> to

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
first learning this skill it's okay to

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.440 
first learning this skill it's okay to
bend<00:03:41.250> your<00:03:41.459> arms<00:03:41.700> a<00:03:41.790> little<00:03:41.849> bit<00:03:42.120> because<00:03:42.239> that

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
bend your arms a little bit because that

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.780 
bend your arms a little bit because that
makes<00:03:42.629> it<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:42.840> little<00:03:43.019> bit<00:03:43.230> easier<00:03:43.670> when<00:03:44.670> you're

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
makes it a little bit easier when you're

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.119 
makes it a little bit easier when you're
first<00:03:44.940> learning<00:03:45.209> it<00:03:45.510> cuz<00:03:46.349> it's<00:03:46.590> just<00:03:46.799> less<00:03:47.010> of

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
first learning it cuz it's just less of

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.630 
first learning it cuz it's just less of
a<00:03:47.250> fall<00:03:47.640> like<00:03:47.970> your<00:03:48.209> pusher<00:03:48.540> to<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.780> ground

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
a fall like your pusher to the ground

00:03:49.640 --> 00:04:00.319 
a fall like your pusher to the ground
so<00:03:50.640> it's<00:03:51.269> like<00:03:55.879> pick<00:03:56.879> up<00:03:57.440> your<00:03:59.000> feet<00:04:00.000> up<00:04:00.150> going

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
so it's like pick up your feet up going

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:05.569 
so it's like pick up your feet up going
over<00:04:00.660> their<00:04:01.260> arms<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:02.159> then<00:04:04.310> you<00:04:05.310> should<00:04:05.400> also

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
over their arms and then you should also

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:06.890 
over their arms and then you should also
stand<00:04:05.849> up<00:04:06.060> in<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.239> end<00:04:06.360> I'm<00:04:06.480> just<00:04:06.540> trying<00:04:06.870> to

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
stand up in the end I'm just trying to

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.880 
stand up in the end I'm just trying to
do<00:04:06.989> it<00:04:07.110> slow<00:04:07.319> and<00:04:08.690> see<00:04:09.690> how<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.019> back<00:04:10.530> of<00:04:10.739> my

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
do it slow and see how the back of my

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.160 
do it slow and see how the back of my
neck<00:04:10.950> hit<00:04:11.430> against<00:04:11.670> the<00:04:11.849> ground<00:04:12.030> not<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.989> top

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
neck hit against the ground not the top

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.770 
neck hit against the ground not the top
of<00:04:13.200> my<00:04:13.500> head<00:04:13.970> that's<00:04:14.970> because<00:04:15.209> I<00:04:15.299> talked<00:04:15.569> in<00:04:15.750> my

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
of my head that's because I talked in my

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.629 
of my head that's because I talked in my
chest<00:04:16.169> my<00:04:16.799> head

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
chest my head

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.629 
chest my head
okay<00:04:18.539> so<00:04:18.600> now<00:04:19.560> I'm<00:04:19.739> gonna<00:04:19.889> go<00:04:20.070> over<00:04:20.190> how<00:04:20.430> to<00:04:20.459> get

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
okay so now I'm gonna go over how to get

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.610 
okay so now I'm gonna go over how to get
with<00:04:20.760> straight<00:04:21.060> arms<00:04:21.120> this<00:04:22.049> is<00:04:22.169> a<00:04:22.260> little<00:04:22.500> bit

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
with straight arms this is a little bit

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.570 
with straight arms this is a little bit
harder<00:04:23.070> and<00:04:23.100> it<00:04:23.870> might<00:04:24.870> result<00:04:25.320> in<00:04:25.770> some

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
harder and it might result in some

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.240 
harder and it might result in some
falling<00:04:27.240> if<00:04:27.360> you're<00:04:27.539> new<00:04:27.690> at<00:04:27.840> this<00:04:27.870> so<00:04:28.229> if<00:04:28.979> you

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
falling if you're new at this so if you

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.180 
falling if you're new at this so if you
have<00:04:29.760> Matt<00:04:30.330> or<00:04:30.810> if<00:04:31.199> you<00:04:31.320> have<00:04:31.470> like<00:04:31.650> cushions

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
have Matt or if you have like cushions

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.650 
have Matt or if you have like cushions
on<00:04:32.370> a<00:04:32.400> capture<00:04:32.850> you<00:04:32.970> can<00:04:33.000> practice<00:04:33.510> on<00:04:33.630> a

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
on a capture you can practice on a

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.020 
on a capture you can practice on a
trampoline<00:04:33.990> or<00:04:34.139> something<00:04:34.590> that<00:04:35.490> might<00:04:35.850> be

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
trampoline or something that might be

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.670 
trampoline or something that might be
better<00:04:36.210> and<00:04:36.479> well<00:04:36.750> you<00:04:36.960> don't<00:04:37.050> need<00:04:37.320> to<00:04:37.380> though

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
better and well you don't need to though

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.640 
better and well you don't need to though
because<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:38.070> floor<00:04:38.310> and<00:04:38.430> really<00:04:38.580> want<00:04:38.880> to<00:04:39.650> you

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
because the floor and really want to you

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.180 
because the floor and really want to you
start<00:04:41.010> in<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:41.220> ones<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.580> same<00:04:41.760> way<00:04:43.039> more<00:04:44.039> than

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
start in the ones the same way more than

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.029 
start in the ones the same way more than
you<00:04:44.490> can<00:04:44.639> try<00:04:44.820> to<00:04:44.880> hold<00:04:45.060> the<00:04:45.270> handstand<00:04:45.419> first

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 
you can try to hold the handstand first

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:48.800 
you can try to hold the handstand first
okay<00:04:47.039> and<00:04:47.520> this<00:04:48.000> time<00:04:48.210> instead<00:04:48.450> of<00:04:48.599> bending

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
okay and this time instead of bending

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.300 
okay and this time instead of bending
your<00:04:49.080> arms<00:04:49.139> think<00:04:49.919> about<00:04:50.130> your<00:04:50.580> shoulders

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310
