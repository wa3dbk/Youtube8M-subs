let's get these started in the oven

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.370 
let's get these started in the oven
since<00:01:55.549> they<00:01:55.670> take<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.060> long<00:01:56.210> to<00:01:56.420> bake<00:01:56.570> need<00:01:57.259> to

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
since they take so long to bake need to

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.380 
since they take so long to bake need to
bake<00:01:57.530> them<00:01:57.710> at<00:01:57.830> 250<00:01:58.490> degrees<00:01:58.520> for<00:01:59.000> about<00:01:59.060> two

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.039 
bake them at 250 degrees for about two
hours<00:01:59.420> so<00:01:59.810> they<00:01:59.930> get<00:02:00.020> really<00:02:00.200> hard<00:02:01.990> okay<00:02:02.990> so

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
hours so they get really hard okay so

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.719 
hours so they get really hard okay so
now<00:02:03.409> they<00:02:03.590> baked<00:02:03.799> for<00:02:04.039> two<00:02:04.220> hours<00:02:04.340> and<00:02:04.610> they're

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.220 
cool okay well let's put some roses on
these<00:04:05.580> and<00:04:05.760> we'll<00:04:06.060> use<00:04:06.269> white<00:04:06.540> glue<00:04:06.720> for<00:04:07.049> that

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
these and we'll use white glue for that

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.729 
these and we'll use white glue for that
okay<00:04:07.680> because<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:08.760> hot<00:04:09.390> glue<00:04:09.600> sometimes<00:04:10.170> gets

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
okay because the hot glue sometimes gets

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.140 
okay because the hot glue sometimes gets
kind<00:04:11.010> of<00:04:11.130> stringy<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:11.489> that's<00:04:11.760> hard<00:04:12.000> to

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
kind of stringy and that's hard to

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.780 
kind of stringy and that's hard to
manage<00:04:12.360> oh<00:04:12.750> yeah<00:04:13.170> that'll<00:04:13.950> take<00:04:14.130> take<00:04:14.549> a<00:04:14.580> few

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
manage oh yeah that'll take take a few

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.250 
manage oh yeah that'll take take a few
minutes<00:04:14.970> for<00:04:15.330> it<00:04:15.360> to<00:04:15.420> dry<00:04:15.720> but<00:04:15.959> I<00:04:16.079> think

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
minutes for it to dry but I think

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.420 
minutes for it to dry but I think
that'll<00:04:16.530> look<00:04:16.560> nice<00:04:16.859> plus<00:04:17.190> it'll<00:04:17.430> dry<00:04:17.639> clear

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
that'll look nice plus it'll dry clear

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.360 
that'll look nice plus it'll dry clear
now<00:04:20.430> what<00:04:20.700> we're<00:04:20.850> going<00:04:20.940> we<00:04:21.180> can<00:04:21.329> either<00:04:21.479> do
