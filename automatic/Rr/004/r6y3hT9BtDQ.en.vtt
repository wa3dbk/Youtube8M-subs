 12 small sweet cherry tomatoes then the two cloves of garlic and the two

 50 ml of oil and a sauce based on cream and yogurt 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.090

 face - 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.200
 and then 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.660
 let's get cut into cubes in this way lookouts 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.300
 practically 3 I love you 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.000
 flan we beat 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.959
 in the pan in the pan year 

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:07.100
 milan arcore 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.190
 naturally 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.460
 ask him if I have any bacteria that are these little tomatoes 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.230
 tiny look a little 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.200
 we have to stress with our fork 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.220
 photo of the crushed their liquid inside 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.860
 blsd practically dissolves in the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.860
 in the pan we descend cont the beech limit to the deeds to logs in this 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.620
 way lookouts 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.900
 we just have to cook more easily 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.900
 add water from the pasta 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.900
 camon i iene et 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.540
 we pick our rigatoni our maccheroni are rigatoni so they have 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.140
 about 10 12 minutes of cooking 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.910
 let's drain enough al dente we await some pasta water from 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.990
 be able 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.600
 stretch a little bit to jump 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.639
 they are rigatoni here with me about 10 12 minutes of cooking 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.210
 let's drain enough al dente we await some pasta water from 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.270
 be able 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.919
 stretch a little bit to jump 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:12.290
 the fire under the medium then we go to cream it slowly in a pan 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.829
 strictly in aluminum 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:16.249
 and then 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:20.459
 let's take the salmon cut it in half in this way 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.759
 bette 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:26.219
 we go 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.219
 skin 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:35.959
 we remove the skin completely 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.589
 from the pulp in this way 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:41.879
 naturally the part of the ventresca is very fat therefore 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.389
 last part of the belly is always better not - use it 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.299
 we remove the bones 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.949
 in this way and then 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:55.949
 we cut into cubes 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:05.829
 perfect 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.829
 having done this we put on the salmon 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:11.099
 to the pasta 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.239
 so 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.719
 face has a little goccino but its own 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.829
 of water 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.439
 and then dulcis in fundo 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:26.329
 take this chive you see among other things very large this 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:29.419
 schnee we take off 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:32.419
 the bottom then the base 

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:38.119
 we pray about herself and we go to get the barron of the immense 

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:40.269
 thin 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.299
 so' 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.829
 you see not very naturally because chives taste too 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.359
 quite determined 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:51.809
 we throw it 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:53.719
 loosen our pan 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:56.719
 and then we skip it all over enough, 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:04.049
 the salmon is the puppy only with the heat of the pot then in 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:05.419
 need 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:11.019
 throw it in the pan only at the end, at the end of cooking end skip 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.199
 let's skip our times well 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:16.409
 we go there 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:18.279
 enslave 

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.779
 let's stop them in the water 

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.610
 it's a bit more restrained 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.210
 but what can we use the spoon 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.259
 see the black cat 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:31.180
 we tend to whisk well 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.889
 lunar misses only the last thing but this is something to put to its own 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.909
 at the last and also in 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:39.999
 in small doses 

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:41.840
 this is a mixture of 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.999
 cream than yogurt 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:45.539
 ok 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.159
 we open it and pour it 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:51.159
 in our rigatoni we jump well 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:54.389
 and let's go 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.169
 enslave 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.300
 ooi pizzichi or rather look 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.300
 a little strip we put chives on 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.280
 rather 2
