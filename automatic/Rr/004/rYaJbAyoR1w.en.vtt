 or not if I love why if I don't love 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.690
 why generally answer 10 questions 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.759
 which we came up with with the girl 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.009
 Hi Annie very glad to shoot with you 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.470
 Today video is the third video well, very happy 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.420
 what we shoot this video together hope 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.609
 that we will meet soon will not be able to 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.220
 ok together sit down and make a video and 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.590
 Although a walk For now we will answer 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.630
 to each other's questions 5 answers and 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.189
 questions will be on my channel and five 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.960
 questions with answers will find on the channel 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.730
 diana so be sure to go to 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.140
 her on the channel after you view 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.950
 this video is how i slept i'm creepy 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.250
 merzlyachka 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.890
 I'd rather wear just 333 layers 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.379
 clothes and it will not be cold than me 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.410
 I will go out and freeze well 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.149
 pretty logical but every winter I dream 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.090
 about having a spacesuit 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.190
 in which people walk in space and 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.710
 so I can just put it on and 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.670
 turn on the heating and move on 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.149
 of course we would have Estonian winter 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.850
 fierce 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.170
 and we still have such humid air which 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.780
 still somehow aggravates the weather outside and 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.110
 I rescue myself some tea warm coffee break all here 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.020
 these warming drinks make me real 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.659
 I save them very much and by the way one 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.869
 of the most favorite drinks is ginger 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.659
 I advise everyone to advise tea for advising everyone 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.360
 covenant you for metal such a difficult question 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.400
 because in London it rarely happens 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.210
 subzero temperature at least i 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.400
 for 4 years never caught and therefore 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.409
 so that we have some frosts from 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.470
 which need to be protected by care 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.829
 there is no such means but there are some 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.149
 anyway means that help me 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:51.509
 protect for example my lips 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.820
 these shines from clarins they are so big 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.710
 brilliance and a balm and they are very very 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.719
 moisturize lips well and know kumho 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.570
 I would also attribute this product 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.969
 hat and gloves because i have 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.240
 that's my favorite hat that I wear 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:09.360
 most of all that's basically my hair 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.459
 cap protects it from the cold and to 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.410
 hands also if there is no cream with me 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.060
 Gloves protect my own 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.220
 ordinary red gloves 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.350
 but for what I love them for what is possible in them 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.080
 use iphone without problems 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.790
 these gloves are sensory reacting and 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.710
 I do not really like and fits 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.570
 my red jackets and puhovichki 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.810
 favorite separate song and here to me 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.390
 for some reason it comes to mind 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.020
 american song george michael last 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:40.470
 christmas 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:44.040
 in general, it's the song speaking 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:47.160
 it is about winter songs like a song about winter 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.470
 or somehow connected and in winter then this song 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.210
 last christmas I told a video about 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.130
 my musical associations are straight 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.650
 my favorite new year song 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.990
 george michael lacquer favorite winter 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.490
 sweater here at all it is very hard 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.750
 because i don't have a favorite 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.400
 a particular winter sweater 1 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.200
 every year somehow i find something 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.010
 i like best this year 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.360
 I liked these hairy sweaters 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.800
 which is called weed but it is not 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.510
 mean that her next year is very 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.880
 I want to wear them for example or there 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.830
 they will be my favorites that is all that 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.020
 warm to me probably even more precisely 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.000
 like warm outerwear i 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.070
 For example here, this park is a warm and 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.260
 I bought it because they were me and 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.030
 warm most about sweaters this 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.340
 generally a very difficult question because 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.350
 choose some one sweater favorite 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.880
 very hard 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.280
 decided but I will show three sweaters 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.320
 first he conquered absolutely it seems to me 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.200
 all this white sweater with a bow like 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.450
 as if i have a present 2 holy times 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.160
 penguins who are insanely cute i 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.080
 Gave for the new year the same mom and 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.630
 she is also completely thrilled with us 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.150
 new year and 3 sweater sweater from here 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.590
 baker he's just crimson he has very 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.080
 cool feminine style here 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.660
 In fact, these three sweaters I adore and 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.910
 probably most this year by 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.190
 at least it was their favorite 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.020
 winter holiday and winter holiday 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.720
 probably still very trite but 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.910
 new year because for the new year I and with 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.980

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.140
 and we exchange gifts this is the most 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.970
 some title such holiday still we 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.950
 very often we are planning a new year 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.930
 usually some trips are therefore very 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.440
 lots of memories here for every new 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.570
 year it is actually these days here 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.640

 they are all filled here soars in the air 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.400
 I adore this festive mood 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.650
 go shopping at this time because 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.990
 that in the stores, too, everything is beautiful 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.050
 fabulous connection that even people 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.790
 much somehow kinder and discovery and 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.680
 benevolent at this time because 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.140
 all congratulate each other and all 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.270
 smile so i really love it 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.220
 I prefer time 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.900
 holidays have changed because in 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.660
 last year I would say that I do not like 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.340
 no holiday in winter that is i somehow 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.410
 Calmly very not the same 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.830
 love just not calm 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.240
 treat 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.710
 this year was the first such 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.770
 solemn very festive and mine 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.140
 mood on chris mass 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.240
 christmas here in england because 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.880
 Catholic celebrated Christmas for the first time 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.100
 and it so happened that we were just 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.650
 London and here everyone is celebrating Christmas 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.480
 not that big but just 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.640
 probably the grandest holiday 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.270
 in the year and so I really liked him 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.430
 I can say that it is safe that this winter 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:37.340
 hrismas was a favorite what thing thing 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.140
 I associate the day with the new year 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.450
 here probably just 5 is the most banal 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.490
 banalism is a natural tree 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:46.100
 New Year in general, I just love 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:49.100
 decorate the Christmas tree I adore 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.980
 buy some new thematic 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.660
 These toys on the Christmas tree calculation in the winter 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:57.110
 associated small such 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:00.200
 pretty little bullfinch birds of course 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:03.440
 the lights here are these beautiful garlands all 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.960
 so brilliant all bright burning it 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:09.050
 everything makes me exactly such associations 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.660
 in the winter here I can take the classics and 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.510
 there tangerines because the smell of tangerine 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:17.060
 this is exactly for miss winter smell and yet 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.760
 one association is warm slippers from 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.919
 they do not get out at all, and these slippers 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.200
 of course I am associated with winter 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:26.450
 Well, we answered 5 questions 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.640
