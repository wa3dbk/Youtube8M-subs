hard drive for the last six seven months
I<00:00:29.970> don't<00:00:30.150> know<00:00:30.240> why<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.420> haven't<00:00:30.660> used<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.199> until

I don't know why I haven't used it until

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.170 
I don't know why I haven't used it until
now<00:00:31.619> but<00:00:32.070> it's<00:00:32.189> sort<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.399> quite<00:00:32.610> fitting<00:00:33.000> for

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
now but it's sort of quite fitting for

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.510 
now but it's sort of quite fitting for
today's<00:00:33.600> topic<00:00:34.079> but<00:00:34.559> again<00:00:34.770> play<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.160> a

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
today's topic but again play is a

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.729 
today's topic but again play is a
nuclear<00:00:36.210> on<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.450> map<00:00:36.750> take<00:00:37.140> off<00:00:37.380> using<00:00:37.680> the

nuclear on the map take off using the
swat-556<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.820> think<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.059> get<00:00:39.210> four<00:00:39.390> or<00:00:39.420> five

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629

swat-556 I think I get four or five
kills<00:00:39.870> at<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.079> very<00:00:40.230> end<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.620> street

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
gives in the no 94 that had to pick up I

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.479 
gives in the no 94 that had to pick up I
would<00:00:43.530> have<00:00:43.649> liked<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.890> make<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:44.309> an

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
would have liked to make this an

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.930 
would have liked to make this an
all-kill<00:00:45.059> SWAT<00:00:45.870> new<00:00:46.079> kila<00:00:46.379> gameplay<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.070> but

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
all-kill SWAT new kila gameplay and but

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.190 
all-kill SWAT new kila gameplay and but
it<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.329> didn't<00:00:48.539> work<00:00:48.629> out<00:00:48.809> like<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:48.989> there

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
it just didn't work out like that there

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.540 
it just didn't work out like that there
was<00:00:49.289> no<00:00:49.410> scat<00:00:49.649> pack<00:00:49.890> surround<00:00:50.250> me<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.460> that

was no scat pack surround me and that

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.709 
was no scat pack surround me and that
was<00:00:50.610> quite<00:00:50.879> annoying<00:00:51.180> because<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.510> would<00:00:51.629> have

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719

was quite annoying because I would have
just<00:00:51.750> loved<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.260> have<00:00:52.410> just<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.890> SWAT<00:00:53.250> new

killer if you're not I mean but this
gameplay<00:00:55.770> sort<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.160> fits<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.699> with<00:00:56.940> what<00:00:57.090> I

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
I don't feel any hype for this game

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.230 
I don't feel any hype for this game
which<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.070> really<00:01:08.369> strange<00:01:08.760> because<00:01:09.090> you

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
which is really strange because you

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.270 
which is really strange because you
usually<00:01:09.600> get<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.080> little<00:01:10.350> bit<00:01:10.439> hyped<00:01:10.680> call<00:01:11.159> of

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
usually get a little bit hyped call of

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.800 
usually get a little bit hyped call of
duty<00:01:11.310> especially<00:01:11.880> when<00:01:12.030> we<00:01:12.119> get<00:01:12.240> information

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
duty especially when we get information

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.170 
duty especially when we get information
and<00:01:12.900> stuff<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:14.010> was<00:01:14.250> crazy<00:01:14.580> we<00:01:14.970> never

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
and stuff and this was crazy we never

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.240 
and stuff and this was crazy we never
get<00:01:15.299> this<00:01:15.450> much<00:01:15.689> information<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.830> early<00:01:17.220> on

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
get this much information this early on

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.039 
get this much information this early on
in<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> year<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.330> should<00:01:18.570> be<00:01:18.689> hyped<00:01:18.900> right

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
in the year so I should be hyped right

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.929 
in the year so I should be hyped right
but<00:01:19.470> I'm<00:01:19.560> just<00:01:19.680> not<00:01:19.830> feeling<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.400> after<00:01:20.790> what

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
but I'm just not feeling it after what

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.789 
but I'm just not feeling it after what
am<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.180> only<00:01:21.270> one<00:01:21.509> that's<00:01:21.720> not<00:01:22.560> feeling

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
am I the only one that's not feeling

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.320 
am I the only one that's not feeling
this<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.310> I'm<00:01:23.460> not<00:01:23.580> just<00:01:23.790> getting<00:01:23.970> older

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
this is it I'm not just getting older

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.719 
this is it I'm not just getting older
and<00:01:24.479> wiser<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.229> I'm<00:01:25.320> just<00:01:25.530> not<00:01:25.710> feeling<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.250> or

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
and wiser and I'm just not feeling it or

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.490 
and wiser and I'm just not feeling it or
is<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.030> because<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.420> last<00:01:27.630> iterations<00:01:28.320> of

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
is it because of the last iterations of

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.109 
is it because of the last iterations of
call<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.740> duty<00:01:29.040> on<00:01:29.130> PC<00:01:29.460> have<00:01:29.700> just<00:01:29.880> been

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
call of duty on PC have just been

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.300 
call of duty on PC have just been
horrendous<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.170> think<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:31.860> probably<00:01:32.009> because

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
horrendous I think it's probably because

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.130 
horrendous I think it's probably because
they've<00:01:32.549> been<00:01:32.579> horrendous<00:01:33.180> advanced<00:01:34.020> warfare

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
they've been horrendous advanced warfare

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.399 
they've been horrendous advanced warfare
and<00:01:34.560> pc<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.159> just<00:01:35.579> awful<00:01:36.000> at<00:01:36.119> times<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.689> cod

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
and pc is just awful at times and cod

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.710 
and pc is just awful at times and cod
ghosts<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:38.280> not<00:01:38.549> even<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.820> pc<00:01:39.119> game<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.479> don't

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
ghosts it's not even a pc game I don't

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.240 
ghosts it's not even a pc game I don't
know<00:01:39.869> why<00:01:40.079> they<00:01:40.259> wasted<00:01:40.680> their<00:01:40.710> time<00:01:40.860> trying

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
know why they wasted their time trying

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.950 
know why they wasted their time trying
to<00:01:41.369> port<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.759> because<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.210> runs<00:01:42.450> like<00:01:42.600> dog

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
to port that because it runs like dog

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.010 
to port that because it runs like dog
poop<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.680> yeah<00:01:44.310> it's<00:01:44.880> probably<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.360> mix<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:45.960> both

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
poop so yeah it's probably a mix of both

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.389 
poop so yeah it's probably a mix of both
i'm<00:01:46.470> probably<00:01:46.649> getting<00:01:46.799> older<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.250> wiser

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
i'm probably getting older and wiser

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.700 
i'm probably getting older and wiser
coming<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.360> realize<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.720> call<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.200> duty<00:01:49.530> is

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
coming to realize that call of duty is

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.249 
coming to realize that call of duty is
just<00:01:50.040> not<00:01:50.310> what<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.610> used<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.970> be<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.299> I'm<00:01:52.020> just

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
just not what it used to be and I'm just

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.530 
just not what it used to be and I'm just
not<00:01:52.320> feeling<00:01:52.500> anything<00:01:52.860> at<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.369> moment<00:01:53.540> so

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
not feeling anything at the moment so

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.850 
not feeling anything at the moment so
one<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> main<00:01:54.990> things<00:01:55.200> with<00:01:55.350> black<00:01:55.530> ops<00:01:55.680> 3

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
one of the main things with black ops 3

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.230 
one of the main things with black ops 3
trailer<00:01:55.890> for<00:01:56.280> me<00:01:56.369> was<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.579> see<00:01:56.820> how<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.030> new

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
trailer for me was to see how the new

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.149 
trailer for me was to see how the new
movement<00:01:57.600> mechanics<00:01:57.689> would<00:01:58.469> affect<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.860> game

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
movement mechanics would affect the game

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.560 
movement mechanics would affect the game
and<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.729> have<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.880> say<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.210> looks<00:02:00.360> fairly

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
and I have to say it looks fairly

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.999 
and I have to say it looks fairly
interesting<00:02:01.110> we've<00:02:01.229> got<00:02:01.350> wall<00:02:01.530> running<00:02:01.799> in

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
interesting we've got wall running in

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.399 
interesting we've got wall running in
this<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.490> we've<00:02:03.149> got<00:02:03.329> other<00:02:03.479> stuff<00:02:03.630> like

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
this and we've got other stuff like

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.590 
this and we've got other stuff like
boost<00:02:04.649> sliding<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.490> stuff<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.909> thrust<00:02:06.299> packs

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
boost sliding and stuff and thrust packs

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.109 
boost sliding and stuff and thrust packs
they're<00:02:06.960> saying<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.380> not<00:02:07.770> like<00:02:08.069> EXO<00:02:08.670> movement

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
they're saying is not like EXO movement

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.970 
they're saying is not like EXO movement
but<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.750> looks<00:02:09.899> very<00:02:10.170> reminiscent<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.979> it

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
but it looks very reminiscent of it

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.710 
but it looks very reminiscent of it
there's<00:02:12.250> no<00:02:12.370> denying<00:02:12.700> that<00:02:12.849> with<00:02:13.599> the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
there's no denying that with the

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.600 
there's no denying that with the
addition<00:02:14.050> of<00:02:14.110> wall<00:02:14.290> running<00:02:14.500> but<00:02:15.310> one<00:02:15.430> thing

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
addition of wall running but one thing

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.920 
addition of wall running but one thing
they<00:02:15.640> have<00:02:15.909> said<00:02:16.090> about<00:02:16.239> wall<00:02:16.390> running<00:02:16.599> is

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
they have said about wall running is

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.630 
they have said about wall running is
it's<00:02:17.230> going<00:02:17.379> to<00:02:17.440> be<00:02:17.500> very<00:02:17.560> limited<00:02:18.220> on<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.610> map

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
it's going to be very limited on the map

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.640 
it's going to be very limited on the map
and<00:02:19.060> you're<00:02:19.390> not<00:02:19.450> going<00:02:19.599> to<00:02:19.720> have<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:20.080> like

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
and you're not going to have to like

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.190 
and you're not going to have to like
will<00:02:20.860> run<00:02:21.040> all<00:02:21.220> over<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.640> map<00:02:21.760> which<00:02:22.540> is<00:02:22.810> quite

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
will run all over the map which is quite

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.320 
will run all over the map which is quite
good<00:02:23.440> I<00:02:23.620> think<00:02:23.680> that's<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.280> way<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:24.700> do<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.150> it's

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
good I think that's a way to do it it's

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.259 
good I think that's a way to do it it's
not<00:02:25.540> going<00:02:25.629> to<00:02:25.720> make<00:02:25.810> it<00:02:26.110> Oh<00:02:26.290> paid<00:02:26.830> to<00:02:27.010> hell

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
not going to make it Oh paid to hell

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.309 
not going to make it Oh paid to hell
where<00:02:28.269> people<00:02:28.660> were<00:02:28.720> going<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:28.989> constantly

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
where people were going to constantly

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.869 
where people were going to constantly
using<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:29.739> like<00:02:29.830> in<00:02:29.980> advanced<00:02:30.310> warfare<00:02:30.580> people

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
using it like in advanced warfare people

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.550 
using it like in advanced warfare people
just<00:02:31.060> constantly<00:02:31.450> double<00:02:31.780> jump<00:02:31.959> every<00:02:32.410> way

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
just constantly double jump every way

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.050 
just constantly double jump every way
they<00:02:32.830> double<00:02:33.129> jump<00:02:33.310> cap<00:02:33.489> in<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.640> flag<00:02:33.879> they

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
they double jump cap in the flag they

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.880 
they double jump cap in the flag they
double<00:02:34.390> jump<00:02:34.599> jump<00:02:35.140> in<00:02:35.260> across<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.709> map

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
double jump jump in across the map

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.680 
double jump jump in across the map
really<00:02:36.160> really<00:02:36.370> fast<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:37.060> just<00:02:37.269> makes<00:02:37.420> it

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
really really fast it just makes it

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.680 
really really fast it just makes it
really<00:02:37.989> awkward<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:39.370> just<00:02:39.760> not<00:02:40.060> fun<00:02:40.660> to

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
really awkward and and just not fun to

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.300 
really awkward and and just not fun to
play<00:02:41.110> at<00:02:41.440> times<00:02:41.769> so<00:02:42.730> I'm<00:02:43.060> really<00:02:43.329> hoping<00:02:43.720> that

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
play at times so I'm really hoping that

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.490 
play at times so I'm really hoping that
the<00:02:45.510> wall<00:02:46.510> running<00:02:46.720> isn't<00:02:47.019> going<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:47.319> be<00:02:47.410> an

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
the wall running isn't going to be an

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.080 
the wall running isn't going to be an
issue<00:02:47.590> on<00:02:47.739> that<00:02:48.099> front<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.579> I<00:02:48.640> think<00:02:48.849> if

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
issue on that front and I think if

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.610 
issue on that front and I think if
there's<00:02:49.420> going<00:02:49.629> to<00:02:49.720> be<00:02:49.750> very<00:02:49.959> limited<00:02:50.109> I<00:02:50.410> think

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
there's going to be very limited I think

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.240 
there's going to be very limited I think
it's<00:02:50.799> going<00:02:50.920> to<00:02:51.010> be<00:02:51.160> like<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.810> black<00:02:52.810> ops<00:02:53.019> 1

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250

advanced warfare done now I feel like if

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:27.720 
advanced warfare done now I feel like if
they<00:03:26.319> put<00:03:26.500> more<00:03:26.650> emphasis<00:03:27.190> on<00:03:27.370> map<00:03:27.549> design

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
that sort of movement and I'm hoping

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:48.990 
that sort of movement and I'm hoping
where<00:03:48.040> they've<00:03:48.220> come<00:03:48.459> out<00:03:48.489> and<00:03:48.730> said<00:03:48.849> well

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000

this<00:03:49.180> is<00:03:49.359> an<00:03:49.480> EXO<00:03:49.810> movement<00:03:50.200> you're<00:03:50.590> not<00:03:50.709> going

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
this is an EXO movement you're not going

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.710 
this is an EXO movement you're not going
to<00:03:50.889> jump<00:03:51.220> that<00:03:51.340> high<00:03:51.519> I'm<00:03:51.790> really<00:03:52.269> hoping<00:03:52.660> that

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
to jump that high I'm really hoping that

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.080 
to jump that high I'm really hoping that
it's<00:03:53.620> going<00:03:53.799> to<00:03:53.859> make<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:54.489> maps<00:03:54.760> more

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
it's going to make the maps more

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.390 
it's going to make the maps more
playable<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:55.780> a<00:03:56.440> lot<00:03:56.590> more<00:03:56.620> bearable<00:03:57.040> I<00:03:57.250> don't

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.559 
playable and a lot more bearable I don't
want<00:03:57.519> to<00:03:57.579> be<00:03:57.639> shot<00:03:57.790> in<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:58.000> back<00:03:58.120> constantly
