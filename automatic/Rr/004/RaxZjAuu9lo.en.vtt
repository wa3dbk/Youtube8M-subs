00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
before and after are the vanilla and the

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.900 
before and after are the vanilla and the
mana<00:00:13.530> version<00:00:13.920> so<00:00:14.099> you<00:00:14.160> guys<00:00:14.340> can<00:00:14.549> have<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.670> feel

mana version so you guys can have a feel

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.000 
mana version so you guys can have a feel
of<00:00:14.940> each<00:00:15.450> form<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:16.049> so<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.710> first<00:00:16.830> thing<00:00:16.980> I

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
of each form of it so the first thing I

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.460 
of each form of it so the first thing I
want<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.160> show<00:00:17.340> here<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.630> end<00:00:18.930> portal

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
want to show here is that the end portal

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.290 
want to show here is that the end portal
the<00:00:19.980> particles<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.699> everything<00:00:21.000> like<00:00:21.090> that

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
the particles and everything like that

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.910 
the particles and everything like that
has<00:00:21.779> been<00:00:22.020> changed<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.439> make<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.710> look<00:00:22.859> a

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
has been changed to make it look a

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.040 
has been changed to make it look a
little<00:00:23.070> cooler<00:00:23.369> if<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.150> look<00:00:24.359> carefully<00:00:24.510> you

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
little cooler if you look carefully you

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.230 
little cooler if you look carefully you
can<00:00:25.109> see<00:00:25.230> an<00:00:25.740> in-depth<00:00:26.250> area<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.880> where<00:00:27.210> the

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
can see an in-depth area of where the

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.570 
can see an in-depth area of where the
potential<00:00:27.750> sky<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.439> going<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.710> be<00:00:28.800> if<00:00:29.460> you

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
potential sky is going to be if you

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.560 
potential sky is going to be if you
can't<00:00:29.760> really<00:00:29.880> see<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.150> difference<00:00:30.449> here

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
can't really see the difference here

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.640 
can't really see the difference here
like<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:30.840> said<00:00:30.990> I'm<00:00:31.050> going<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.230> show<00:00:31.380> the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
like I said I'm going to show the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.380 
like I said I'm going to show the
vanilla<00:00:31.980> part<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.610> then<00:00:32.910> we're<00:00:33.120> going<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.270> go

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
vanilla part and then we're going to go

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.060 
vanilla part and then we're going to go
to<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.690> end<00:00:33.840> right<00:00:34.020> now<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.739> let's<00:00:34.920> just<00:00:35.040> jump

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
to the end right now so let's just jump

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.709 
to the end right now so let's just jump
in<00:00:35.280> here<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.610> as<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.090> see<00:00:36.239> here<00:00:36.390> when<00:00:36.540> we<00:00:36.570> go

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
in here and as you see here when we go

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.630 
in here and as you see here when we go
to<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.930> end<00:00:37.020> we<00:00:37.200> have<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> very<00:00:37.590> nice<00:00:38.160> sky

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
to the end we have a very nice sky

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.819 
to the end we have a very nice sky
instead<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.270> current<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.840> believe<00:00:40.590> right

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
instead of the current I believe right

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.229 
instead of the current I believe right
now<00:00:40.920> they<00:00:41.070> changed<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.489> purple<00:00:41.700> but<00:00:41.940> still

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
now they changed it to purple but still

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.299 
now they changed it to purple but still
looks<00:00:42.660> very<00:00:43.050> very<00:00:43.350> nice<00:00:43.590> compared<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.190> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
looks very very nice compared to the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.490 
looks very very nice compared to the
other<00:00:44.460> one<00:00:44.610> now<00:00:45.300> if<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.510> just<00:00:45.570> dip<00:00:45.930> down<00:00:46.140> below

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
other one now if I just dip down below

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.529 
other one now if I just dip down below
the<00:00:46.620> surface<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.340> you'll<00:00:47.430> actually<00:00:47.940> just<00:00:48.420> go

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
the surface and you'll actually just go

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.000 
the surface and you'll actually just go
over<00:00:48.629> here<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.020> you'll<00:00:49.110> see<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.289> better<00:00:49.469> view

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
over here and you'll see a better view

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.770 
over here and you'll see a better view
of<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.160> now<00:00:50.969> many<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.539> are<00:00:51.660> probably

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
of it now many of you are probably

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.420 
of it now many of you are probably
saying<00:00:51.989> well<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.620> probably<00:00:53.160> just<00:00:53.219> a

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
saying well this is probably just a

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.670 
saying well this is probably just a
modified<00:00:53.940> texture<00:00:54.300> pack<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.750> half<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.469> its

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
modified texture pack and half of its

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.619 
modified texture pack and half of its
right<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:57.000> other<00:00:57.120> half<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.420> wrong

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
right and the other half is wrong

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.420 
right and the other half is wrong
because<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.050> montt<00:00:58.320> actually<00:00:58.859> changes<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> few

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
because the montt actually changes a few

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.130 
because the montt actually changes a few
things<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.969> changes<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.449> render<00:01:00.750> global

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
things it changes the render global

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.260 
things it changes the render global
position<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:02.340> changes<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.820> render<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
position it changes the render of the

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.840 
position it changes the render of the
ender<00:01:03.539> portal<00:01:03.870> changes<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.470> render<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:05.040> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
ender portal changes the render of the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.240 
ender portal changes the render of the
hell<00:01:06.090> which<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> nether<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:08.040> end

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
hell which is the nether and the end

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.450 
hell which is the nether and the end
area<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.180> let's<00:01:09.420> go<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:10.049> nether<00:01:10.740> which<00:01:11.340> is

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
area so let's go to the nether which is

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.580 
area so let's go to the nether which is
over<00:01:11.670> here<00:01:11.909> now<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.630> just<00:01:12.750> spawned<00:01:13.140> myself<00:01:13.500> a

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
over here now I just spawned myself a

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.289 
over here now I just spawned myself a
little<00:01:13.710> portal<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:14.939> could<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.270> jump

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
little portal just I could just jump

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.990 
little portal just I could just jump
straight<00:01:15.930> into<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.350> nether<00:01:16.530> now<00:01:17.130> as<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.759> right

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
straight into the nether now as of right

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.929 
straight into the nether now as of right
now<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.210> nether<00:01:19.430> background<00:01:20.430> kind<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.759> looks

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
now the nether background kind of looks

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.929 
now the nether background kind of looks
a<00:01:21.030> little<00:01:21.299> dirt<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.170> course<00:01:22.409> yeah<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.790> is

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
a little dirt and of course yeah this is

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.580 
a little dirt and of course yeah this is
how<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.180> looks<00:01:24.330> like<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.750> he<00:01:25.140> could<00:01:25.320> clearly

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
how it looks like and he could clearly

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.340 
how it looks like and he could clearly
see<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.860> borders<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.180> pitcher<00:01:27.509> like<00:01:28.259> I

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
see the borders of the pitcher like I

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.929 
see the borders of the pitcher like I
said<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.650> can<00:01:28.950> change<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.759> will

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
said you can change this and I will

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.370 
said you can change this and I will
explain<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.329> little<00:01:30.540> bit<00:01:30.630> more<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:30.960> just<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.200> few

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
explain a little bit more in just a few

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.200 
explain a little bit more in just a few
seconds<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.890> right<00:01:32.430> now<00:01:32.520> I'm<00:01:32.670> spazzing<00:01:32.909> out

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
seconds and right now I'm spazzing out

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.960 
seconds and right now I'm spazzing out
but<00:01:33.570> as<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.320> see<00:01:34.500> there<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:35.009> very

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
but as you see there is a very

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.060 
but as you see there is a very
definitive<00:01:36.329> box<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.500> really<00:01:37.799> don't<00:01:37.950> like

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
definitive box and I really don't like

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.249 
definitive box and I really don't like
it<00:01:38.250> as<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:39.030> right<00:01:39.180> now<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.960> let<00:01:40.079> me<00:01:40.140> just

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
it as of right now so let me just

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.460 
it as of right now so let me just
quickly<00:01:40.470> go<00:01:40.710> back<00:01:40.740> go<00:01:41.220> back<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.520> here<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.470> don't

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
quickly go back go back in here I don't

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.749 
quickly go back go back in here I don't
know<00:01:43.619> why<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.799> always<00:01:43.829> spawns<00:01:44.250> me<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.520> lava

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
know why I always spawns me in lava

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.389 
know why I always spawns me in lava
let's<00:01:45.360> go<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:45.840> weird<00:01:46.049> now<00:01:46.619> initially<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.220> does

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
let's go so weird now initially it does

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.080 
let's go so weird now initially it does
seem<00:01:47.610> cool

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
seem cool

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.030 
seem cool
but<00:01:48.360> if<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.960> look<00:01:49.110> at<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.259> very<00:01:49.439> ceiling<00:01:49.920> it

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
but if you look at the very ceiling it

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.920 
but if you look at the very ceiling it
cuts<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.490> off<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:51.240> here<00:01:51.420> let<00:01:51.600> me<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:51.689> go<00:01:51.840> to

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
cuts it off so here let me just go to

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.139 
cuts it off so here let me just go to
where<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.439> portal<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:52.920> where<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.430> my<00:01:53.460> portal<00:01:54.000> I

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
where the portal is where is my portal I

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.209 
where the portal is where is my portal I
know<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:54.899> had<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.110> portal<00:01:55.500> here<00:01:55.680> somewhere<00:01:56.070> okay

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
know I had a portal here somewhere okay

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.620 
know I had a portal here somewhere okay
oh<00:01:56.729> there<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.360> again

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
oh there it is again

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.590 
oh there it is again
so<00:01:58.590> as<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.860> see<00:01:59.009> here<00:01:59.250> also<00:01:59.880> changes<00:02:00.479> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
so as you see here also changes the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.359 
so as you see here also changes the
render<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.140> make<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.409> bright<00:02:01.740> orange<00:02:02.189> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
render to make it bright orange the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.010 
render to make it bright orange the
further<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.790> go<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.420> like<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.659> said<00:02:03.719> I'm<00:02:03.899> gonna

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
further you go and like I said I'm gonna

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.600 
further you go and like I said I'm gonna
be<00:02:04.110> showing<00:02:04.290> up<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.619> four<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:04.950> after<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:05.430> right

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
be showing up a four and after so right

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.039 
be showing up a four and after so right
now<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.790> probably<00:02:06.000> you're<00:02:06.479> probably<00:02:06.780> seeing

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
now you probably you're probably seeing

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.450 
now you probably you're probably seeing
the<00:02:07.200> vanilla<00:02:07.500> form<00:02:07.770> and

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
the vanilla form and

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.580 
the vanilla form and
does<00:02:08.550> not<00:02:08.790> render<00:02:09.150> orange<00:02:09.990> backgrounds<00:02:10.500> like

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
does not render orange backgrounds like

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.980 
does not render orange backgrounds like
this<00:02:10.830> now<00:02:11.640> as<00:02:11.880> you<00:02:12.000> see<00:02:12.210> here<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:12.780> little

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
this now as you see here the little

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.770 
this now as you see here the little
thing<00:02:13.380> kind<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:13.950> gets<00:02:14.100> cut<00:02:14.310> off<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:14.820> of<00:02:15.540> course

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
thing kind of gets cut off and of course

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.840 
thing kind of gets cut off and of course
if<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:15.990> had<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.320> you<00:02:16.620> know<00:02:16.710> further<00:02:17.010> out<00:02:17.220> you'll

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
if I had it you know further out you'll

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.420 
if I had it you know further out you'll
see<00:02:17.940> like<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.570> box<00:02:19.200> at<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.530> very<00:02:19.680> top<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.280> it

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
see like a box at the very top and it

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.350 
see like a box at the very top and it
just<00:02:20.460> looks<00:02:20.760> nasty

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
just looks nasty

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.000 
just looks nasty
now<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:21.930> am<00:02:22.200> going<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.410> be<00:02:22.500> switching<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:22.890> a

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
now I am going to be switching to a

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.040 
now I am going to be switching to a
custom<00:02:23.670> texture<00:02:24.000> pack<00:02:24.180> now<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.600> first<00:02:24.840> one<00:02:25.020> I

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
custom texture pack now the first one I

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.220 
custom texture pack now the first one I
want<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.260> show<00:02:25.470> is<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:26.690> potential<00:02:27.690> one<00:02:27.930> that<00:02:28.080> was

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
want to show is a potential one that was

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.230 
want to show is a potential one that was
gonna<00:02:28.410> do<00:02:28.590> many<00:02:29.130> of<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.340> actually<00:02:29.850> haven't

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
gonna do many of you actually haven't

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.730 
gonna do many of you actually haven't
really<00:02:30.450> many<00:02:30.600> of<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.840> probably<00:02:31.050> some<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.650> you

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
really many of you probably some of you

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.400 
really many of you probably some of you
will<00:02:31.920> know<00:02:32.360> where<00:02:33.360> this<00:02:33.540> mountain<00:02:34.020> came<00:02:34.230> from

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
will know where this mountain came from

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.020 
will know where this mountain came from
if<00:02:34.590> you<00:02:34.680> know<00:02:34.710> what<00:02:35.070> game<00:02:35.280> this<00:02:35.580> comes<00:02:35.880> from

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
if you know what game this comes from

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.330 
if you know what game this comes from
then<00:02:36.300> telling<00:02:36.630> so<00:02:37.200> as<00:02:37.320> you<00:02:37.440> see<00:02:37.560> here<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:37.980> kind

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
then telling so as you see here it kind

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.310 
then telling so as you see here it kind
of<00:02:38.430> derps<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.240> it<00:02:39.510> goes<00:02:39.630> sideways<00:02:39.900> goes

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
of derps it and it goes sideways goes

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.050 
of derps it and it goes sideways goes
whatever<00:02:40.500> so<00:02:41.250> it's<00:02:41.370> very<00:02:41.490> hard<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.820> choose<00:02:42.030> a

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
whatever so it's very hard to choose a

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.330 
whatever so it's very hard to choose a
very<00:02:42.360> good<00:02:42.690> picture<00:02:43.230> for<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.920> if<00:02:44.070> I<00:02:44.160> was

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
very good picture for it and if I was

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.980 
very good picture for it and if I was
actually<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.030> think<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.420> could<00:02:45.570> actually<00:02:45.600> go<00:02:45.960> to

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
actually I think I could actually go to

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.540 
actually I think I could actually go to
the<00:02:46.200> very<00:02:46.350> top<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.740> nether<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:46.950> wish<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.430> was

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
the very top of the nether I wish I was

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.290 
the very top of the nether I wish I was
going<00:02:47.730> faster

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
going faster

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.450 
going faster
I<00:02:48.330> wish<00:02:48.900> zombies<00:02:49.290> fly<00:02:49.470> mod<00:02:49.710> had<00:02:49.950> no<00:02:50.220> clip

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
I wish zombies fly mod had no clip

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.910 
I wish zombies fly mod had no clip

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
point three is very derpy when it comes

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
you see here this is the custom picture

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.970 
you see here this is the custom picture
I<00:02:59.670> did<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.600> like<00:03:01.080> I<00:03:01.200> just<00:03:01.320> said<00:03:01.470> many<00:03:01.770> of<00:03:01.890> you

you<00:03:03.930> may<00:03:04.110> know<00:03:04.290> where<00:03:04.440> this<00:03:04.530> comes<00:03:04.710> from<00:03:04.980> if

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
you may know where this comes from if

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.080 
you may know where this comes from if
you<00:03:05.190> do<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.430> then<00:03:05.520> leave<00:03:05.640> in<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.820> comments

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
you do and then leave in the comments

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.150 
you do and then leave in the comments
below<00:03:06.150> but<00:03:07.020> as<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:07.200> see<00:03:07.320> here<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.560> have<00:03:07.830> the

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
below but as you see here you have the

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.890 
below but as you see here you have the
one<00:03:08.460> facing<00:03:08.880> forward<00:03:09.300> you<00:03:09.420> have<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:09.630> facing

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
one facing forward you have it facing

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.050 
one facing forward you have it facing
sideways<00:03:10.170> sideways<00:03:10.520> backwards<00:03:11.520> and<00:03:12.000> then

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
sideways sideways backwards and then

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.000 
sideways sideways backwards and then
weird<00:03:12.930> like<00:03:13.620> that

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
weird like that

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.520 
weird like that
so<00:03:14.610> if<00:03:15.030> you're<00:03:15.210> gonna<00:03:15.330> change<00:03:16.050> it<00:03:16.260> make<00:03:16.500> sure

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
so if you're gonna change it make sure

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.800 
so if you're gonna change it make sure
you<00:03:16.800> change<00:03:16.980> it<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.220> something<00:03:17.520> good<00:03:17.670> now<00:03:18.390> I'm

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
you change it to something good now I'm

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.630 
you change it to something good now I'm
gonna<00:03:18.960> flip<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.680> last<00:03:19.890> one<00:03:20.160> which<00:03:20.370> is<00:03:20.400> a

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
gonna flip to the last one which is a

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.970 
gonna flip to the last one which is a
very<00:03:20.790> good<00:03:21.240> texture<00:03:21.570> pack<00:03:21.750> that<00:03:21.980> complements

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
very good texture pack that complements

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.400 
very good texture pack that complements
this<00:03:23.100> area<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.670> all<00:03:24.570> I<00:03:24.600> did<00:03:24.780> was<00:03:24.930> just<00:03:25.320> change

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
this area and all I did was just change

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.520 
this area and all I did was just change
the<00:03:25.860> background<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.870> what<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:28.050> was<00:03:28.260> initially

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
the background to what it was initially

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.650 
the background to what it was initially
rendering<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.340> so<00:03:29.940> this<00:03:30.180> makes<00:03:30.390> it<00:03:30.510> like<00:03:30.630> a

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
rendering to so this makes it like a

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.080 
rendering to so this makes it like a
never-ending<00:03:31.110> hell<00:03:31.740> type<00:03:32.010> fog<00:03:32.340> for<00:03:32.670> anywhere

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
never-ending hell type fog for anywhere

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.970 
never-ending hell type fog for anywhere
in<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.420> nether<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:34.110> this<00:03:34.650> is<00:03:34.770> just<00:03:34.890> a

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
in the nether and this is just a

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.530 
in the nether and this is just a
suggestion<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.550> the<00:03:35.640> mod<00:03:35.790> maker<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.420> know

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
suggestion to the mod maker you know

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.320 
suggestion to the mod maker you know
just<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.440> make<00:03:37.650> it<00:03:37.680> not<00:03:38.280> so<00:03:38.340> in-your-face<00:03:38.790> with

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
just to make it not so in-your-face with

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330 
just to make it not so in-your-face with
the<00:03:39.420> other<00:03:39.570> part<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.140> if<00:03:40.770> you<00:03:40.890> want<00:03:41.100> to<00:03:41.190> see

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
the other part and if you want to see

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.340 
the other part and if you want to see
the<00:03:41.460> other<00:03:41.640> one<00:03:41.760> this<00:03:42.150> is<00:03:42.210> the<00:03:42.570> original<00:03:43.110> form

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
the other one this is the original form

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.410 
the other one this is the original form
I'm<00:03:44.340> gonna<00:03:44.460> be<00:03:44.550> showing<00:03:44.700> you<00:03:44.820> right<00:03:45.030> about<00:03:45.270> now

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
I'm gonna be showing you right about now

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.070 
I'm gonna be showing you right about now
and<00:03:45.690> as<00:03:46.170> you<00:03:46.230> see<00:03:46.500> it's<00:03:46.770> pretty<00:03:47.550> pretty<00:03:48.300> cut

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
and as you see it's pretty pretty cut

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.170 
and as you see it's pretty pretty cut
off<00:03:49.230> you<00:03:49.410> can<00:03:49.560> see<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.770> edges<00:03:50.130> and<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:51.000> just

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
off you can see the edges and it just

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.690 
off you can see the edges and it just
doesn't<00:03:51.510> look<00:03:51.540> as<00:03:51.780> great<00:03:52.110> as<00:03:52.260> I<00:03:52.380> was<00:03:52.770> hoping<00:03:52.950> so

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
doesn't look as great as I was hoping so

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.370 
doesn't look as great as I was hoping so
hopefully<00:03:54.180> he'll<00:03:54.810> see<00:03:55.020> this<00:03:55.200> little

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
hopefully he'll see this little

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.320

modification<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.400> add<00:03:56.580> just<00:03:56.880> a<00:03:56.970> regular

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
modification and add just a regular

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.770 
modification and add just a regular
background<00:03:57.900> of<00:03:58.200> red<00:03:58.650> or<00:03:58.920> orange<00:03:59.570> and<00:04:00.570> yeah

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
background of red or orange and yeah

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.030 
background of red or orange and yeah
that's<00:04:00.990> pretty<00:04:01.110> much<00:04:01.320> over<00:04:01.440> this<00:04:01.530> mod<00:04:01.740> it<00:04:01.890> just

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
that's pretty much over this mod it just

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.770 
that's pretty much over this mod it just
changes<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.490> background<00:04:02.670> of<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.330> end<00:04:03.510> and

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780
