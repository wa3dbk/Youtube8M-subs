00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.679
 at 15 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.289
 the difference with respect to previous 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:26.480
 really that a little the top 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.550
 you can see that the buttresses 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.769
 are much finer materials what 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.739
 which makes it lighter but the serious one is 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.390
 very very similar leaves behind 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.180
 certainly the foot with a very 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.030
 open as you can see 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.460
 and the surface is quite wide if the 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.590
 we compare with the mingus is a 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.750
 shoe a little more open with what 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.190
 which is going to adapt better to the feet a 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.710
 slightly wider to the very narrow 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.710
 substantial differences has been in the 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.019
 gel that now appreciates some of the 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.909
 blocks in the back is not the 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:00.090
 front that before the clusters 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:05.900
 normativity 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.900
 there are two new ones in the front 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:14.870
 but also their weight they are more but 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.870
 also the motivation is greater 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.240
 the difference from the heel to the tip has 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.370
 changed a little bit before it was 9 mm 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.659
 they are 11 millimeters by which there is a 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.090
 little bit more fall 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.250
 here we have 3 16 millimeters 25 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.659
 millimeter is a shoe our 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.580
 assistant with good volume for 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.340
 runners we need a lot of 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.619
 motivation talent many pilots not 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.409
 They are overweight and exciting to go 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.990
 really protected the second in the 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.600
 last difference is in the sole the 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.060
 rubber rubber blocks are very 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.280
 wide with a thickness that they have achieved 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.780
 that the furrows are encounters 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.970
 continues to maintain good flexibility 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.740
 of the shoes is not excessively 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.810
 flexible but is designed for a 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.299
 runner that needs consistency between 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.520
 the kilometers is not so much here either 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.470
 really very very elastic so 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.780
 we have neutral sideburns to run 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.979
 what many kilometers does he get 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.370
 that would be needed very timely 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.370
 how are you?
