00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.492
Empty wound

00:00:44.428 --> 00:00:48.873
At a single draft alone

00:00:56.315 --> 00:00:59.303
Drain this run

00:00:59.919 --> 00:01:05.442
The farthest one can come too close

00:01:11.293 --> 00:01:16.339
Life could be better if I let me in

00:01:16.339 --> 00:01:19.529
(What is to hold onto?)

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:24.255
But I force myself towards departing

00:01:24.255 --> 00:01:28.079
(Leaving is what you do)

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:31.695
I had to rub my dirty in the soil

00:01:32.118 --> 00:01:35.907
I have to be the rascal taking all

00:01:36.143 --> 00:01:39.824
I wanted us to live in times of bliss

00:01:40.121 --> 00:01:45.102
I couldn't evoke the memories I had missed

00:02:00.265 --> 00:02:03.353
Left this wound

00:02:03.895 --> 00:02:08.294
Abandoned my ideals for what?

00:02:12.547 --> 00:02:16.403
(Want to be just like you)

00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:24.470
Molded like I'm shaped in size with anyone

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.476
(Standing like I'm next to)

00:02:28.476 --> 00:02:32.359
(Everyone just like you)

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.947
I had to rub my dirty in the soil

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:40.096
I have to be the rascal taking all

00:02:40.318 --> 00:02:44.136
I wanted us to live in times of bliss

00:02:44.136 --> 00:02:48.230
I couldn't evoke the memories I had missed

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.989
Shut your eyes fast, it all goes blank

00:02:52.298 --> 00:02:56.250
and channel the vision, feel the scent of

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.018
Someone who dares to lose it all

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:05.430
Someone who's ready to take the fall for it

00:03:20.594 --> 00:03:30.892
(Shut and lightened up, when we rose)

00:04:03.884 --> 00:04:09.568
I'm taking all, am I taking all

00:04:10.342 --> 00:04:16.848
(As a rascal I'm taking all) Am I taking you all?

00:04:17.617 --> 00:04:23.057
I'm taking all, am I taking you all

00:04:23.868 --> 00:04:29.764
I was the rascal taking all, am I taking you all?
