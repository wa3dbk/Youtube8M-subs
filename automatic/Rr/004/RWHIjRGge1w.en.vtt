other things and they want more meat and
it<00:01:10.570> takes<00:01:10.840> 8<00:01:11.640> kilograms<00:01:12.640> of<00:01:13.210> grain<00:01:13.390> to<00:01:13.600> make<00:01:13.780> 1

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020

poultry and so this is also then calling

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.010 
poultry and so this is also then calling
for<00:01:23.830> the<00:01:23.950> grain<00:01:24.460> crunch<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:25.510> you<00:01:25.570> pull<00:01:25.900> off

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
for the grain crunch and you pull off

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.000 
for the grain crunch and you pull off
all<00:01:26.200> that<00:01:26.380> corn<00:01:26.970> well<00:01:27.970> it<00:01:28.600> affects<00:01:29.500> everything

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
all that corn well it affects everything

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.490 
all that corn well it affects everything
and<00:01:30.520> of<00:01:31.150> course<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.570> fertilizer<00:01:32.140> is

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
and of course the fertilizer is

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.830 
and of course the fertilizer is
essential<00:01:33.490> to<00:01:33.640> all<00:01:33.670> of<00:01:34.090> it<00:01:34.270> you're<00:01:34.479> not<00:01:34.570> going

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
to get that kind of nutrient production

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.240 
to get that kind of nutrient production
to<00:01:39.729> make<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:40.060> ethanol<00:01:40.450> or<00:01:40.870> to<00:01:41.799> feed<00:01:42.040> the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
to make the ethanol or to feed the

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.500 
to make the ethanol or to feed the
livestock<00:01:42.460> to<00:01:43.799> increase<00:01:44.799> the<00:01:45.070> changing<00:01:45.640> food

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
livestock to increase the changing food

couple of years and that's certainly

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.400 
couple of years and that's certainly
going<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:22.000> affect<00:02:22.239> and<00:02:22.599> with<00:02:22.750> all<00:02:22.870> this<00:02:23.020> effect

Tokyo needs it a lot more than Guyana

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.780 
Tokyo needs it a lot more than Guyana
and<00:02:45.940> Iowa<00:02:46.350> now<00:02:47.350> with<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.280> price<00:02:48.760> of

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
and Iowa now with the price of

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.199 
and Iowa now with the price of
fertilizer<00:02:49.239> is<00:02:49.780> just<00:02:50.049> double<00:02:50.560> triple<00:02:51.150> in<00:02:52.150> the

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
fertilizer is just double triple in the

fertilizer is just double triple in the
United<00:02:52.569> States<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:54.330> I<00:02:55.330> don't<00:02:56.319> see<00:02:56.709> it's<00:02:57.010> going

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
United States and I don't see it's going

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.120 
United States and I don't see it's going
to<00:02:57.340> be<00:02:57.459> almost<00:02:57.730> impossible<00:02:58.000> in<00:02:58.810> Africa<00:02:59.440> and

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
to be almost impossible in Africa and

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.979 
to be almost impossible in Africa and
also<00:03:00.519> that's<00:03:00.970> gonna<00:03:01.150> be<00:03:01.330> one<00:03:01.510> of<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.720> area's

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
also that's gonna be one of the area's

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.660 
also that's gonna be one of the area's
greatest<00:03:02.440> challenges<00:03:03.069> in<00:03:03.780> in<00:03:04.780> Africa<00:03:05.459> if<00:03:06.459> we

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
greatest challenges in in Africa if we

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.570 
greatest challenges in in Africa if we
if<00:03:07.060> indeed<00:03:07.870> there's<00:03:08.200> another<00:03:08.620> African<00:03:09.310> Green

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
if indeed there's another African Green

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.319 
if indeed there's another African Green
Revolution<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:10.510> I'm<00:03:11.609> IFD<00:03:12.609> see<00:03:12.850> you<00:03:13.060> have<00:03:13.180> been

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
Revolution and I'm IFD see you have been

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.390 
Revolution and I'm IFD see you have been
a<00:03:13.390> part<00:03:13.750> of<00:03:13.840> this<00:03:13.959> whole<00:03:14.230> planning<00:03:15.190> of<00:03:15.280> this

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
a part of this whole planning of this

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.349 
a part of this whole planning of this
and<00:03:15.579> everything<00:03:15.850> like<00:03:16.000> that

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
and everything like that

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.699 
and everything like that
but<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.850> Green<00:03:19.090> Revolution<00:03:19.299> ran<00:03:20.260> on

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
but the Green Revolution ran on

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.770 
but the Green Revolution ran on
fertilizer<00:03:21.340> there's<00:03:22.060> just<00:03:22.299> no<00:03:22.480> way<00:03:22.750> around

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
fertilizer there's just no way around

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.900 
fertilizer there's just no way around
that

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
that

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.390 
that
if<00:03:24.910> what<00:03:25.690> ran<00:03:25.930> on<00:03:26.140> plant<00:03:26.440> nutrients<00:03:27.100> and<00:03:27.310> the

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
if what ran on plant nutrients and the

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.300 
if what ran on plant nutrients and the
way<00:03:27.519> to<00:03:27.579> get<00:03:27.850> plant<00:03:28.180> nutrients<00:03:28.750> into<00:03:28.930> a

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
way to get plant nutrients into a

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.920 
way to get plant nutrients into a
consolidated<00:03:30.310> form<00:03:30.700> that<00:03:30.940> you<00:03:31.060> can<00:03:31.239> apply<00:03:31.540> is

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
consolidated form that you can apply is

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.890 
consolidated form that you can apply is
through<00:03:32.380> fertilizers<00:03:33.070> there<00:03:33.910> is<00:03:34.120> not<00:03:34.540> enough

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
through fertilizers there is not enough

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.550 
through fertilizers there is not enough
organic<00:03:35.560> matter<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:37.090> be<00:03:37.239> used<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.840> switch<00:03:38.290> to

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
organic matter to be used to switch to

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.920 
organic matter to be used to switch to
organic<00:03:38.680> fertilizers<00:03:39.670> that<00:03:39.850> sounds<00:03:40.239> like<00:03:40.900> a

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
organic fertilizers that sounds like a

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.349 
organic fertilizers that sounds like a
really<00:03:41.260> neat<00:03:41.680> idea<00:03:41.859> but<00:03:42.340> it<00:03:42.489> isn't<00:03:42.970> going<00:03:43.239> to

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
really neat idea but it isn't going to

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:44.960 
really neat idea but it isn't going to
work<00:03:43.510> it's<00:03:43.810> not<00:03:43.930> going<00:03:44.260> to<00:03:44.350> feed<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.680> world

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
work it's not going to feed the world

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.190 
work it's not going to feed the world
and<00:03:45.970> I<00:03:46.030> think<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.359> biggest<00:03:46.600> challenge<00:03:47.140> that

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
and I think the biggest challenge that

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.920 
and I think the biggest challenge that
here<00:03:47.500> he's<00:03:47.590> gonna<00:03:47.829> have<00:03:48.040> that<00:03:48.220> Africa<00:03:48.700> is<00:03:48.940> oh

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
here he's gonna have that Africa is oh

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.199 
here he's gonna have that Africa is oh
you<00:03:50.680> know<00:03:50.920> how<00:03:51.160> are<00:03:51.310> you<00:03:51.489> going<00:03:51.790> to<00:03:51.940> get<00:03:52.060> the

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
you know how are you going to get the

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.259 
you know how are you going to get the
