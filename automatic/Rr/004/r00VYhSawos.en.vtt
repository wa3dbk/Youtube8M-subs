fuck were Microsoft thinking this also

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.280 
fuck were Microsoft thinking this also
ties<00:01:47.729> into<00:01:48.000> another<00:01:48.420> thing<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:48.899> wanted<00:01:49.170> to

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
ties into another thing that I wanted to

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.899 
ties into another thing that I wanted to
talk<00:01:49.470> about<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.340> blockage<00:01:50.759> of

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
talk about and that is the blockage of

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.600 
talk about and that is the blockage of
used<00:01:51.659> games<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.649> my<00:01:52.829> thoughts<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.460> the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
used games so my thoughts on the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.090 
used games so my thoughts on the
reasoning<00:01:54.060> behind<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.659> 24<00:01:55.110> hours<00:01:55.350> sign-in<00:01:55.890> is

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
reasoning behind the 24 hours sign-in is

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.609 
reasoning behind the 24 hours sign-in is
when<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.640> buy<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.880> game<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.570> next<00:01:57.689> Xbox<00:01:58.409> of

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
when you buy a game on the next Xbox of

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.170 
when you buy a game on the next Xbox of
the<00:01:58.740> xbox<00:01:59.189> one<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.430> whatever<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.939> want<00:02:00.090> to

the xbox one and whatever you want to
call<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.390> after<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.049> buy<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.439> will<00:02:01.619> have

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
call it after you buy it you will have

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.130 
call it after you buy it you will have
to<00:02:01.920> install<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.430> onto<00:02:02.790> your<00:02:03.060> actual<00:02:03.420> xbox<00:02:03.810> they
