00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Hello everyone, probably the majority and 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.460
 watched watching this video know what 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.500
 recently released a new pension 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.160
 a system called windows 9 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.049
 and that is windows 10 and more precisely officially 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.269
 she hasn't come out yet 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.160
 only English version is available. 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.869
 which microsoft posted to the network later 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.210
 some time after the presentation 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.070
 but in this video I wanted to tell you 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.410
 microsoft company news 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.810
 about the new operating system or rather 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.619
 its several differences from its 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.750
 predecessors 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.850
 1 and perhaps the most important difference 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.480
 appearance of the start menu yes yes you do not 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.880
 misheard 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.040
 most real start menu which has 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.079
 familiar content and tiles 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.809
 who by the way completely preserved their 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.629
 functionality in the start menu displays the name 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.160
 user and his avatar by pressing 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.320
 on which you can change the avatar 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.750
 block user or exit a 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.120
 also the off button by pressing on 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.460
 which you can put off to sleep or 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.289
 restart computer besides that 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.180
 there is a list of programs inlet 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.280
 actually as in windows 7 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.159
 as well as a button that will show you the whole 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.020
 software installed on this computer 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.610
 there is still a cool search for that 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.130
 allows you to find any information on 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.240
 your while I for example find the command 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.580
 string by typing query 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.549
 cmd and smooth ad front 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.369
 next innovation and so next 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.770
 new feature is clipboard 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.500
 before microsoft added to the command line 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.240
 clipboard and now we can paste 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.650
 in him information using a combination 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.840
 kontrol keys 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.450
 general functions unexpectedly but how 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.280
 turned out to be very convenient and further I would 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.110
 I wanted to say a few words about the tiles 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.119
 firstly now we can easily 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.549
 transfer them to the desktop 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.350
 which means the application can be stored not 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.409
 only in or start-up but also directly on the worker 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.329
 table besides this as before we have 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.250
 it is possible to change their size 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.540
 pin on the taskbar or even 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.970
 remove from start menu 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.070
 after removing all the icons by the way 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.649
 it turns out the usual Windows start 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.479
 only in the flat interface yet 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.579
 there is a search that work 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.850
 just like this one that is enshrined in 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.420
 start menu is unclear why microsoft if you 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.649
 its separate icon oh well 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.120
 next and also very important 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.310
 innovation is work 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.010
 metro applications 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.810
 desktop mode now this is not some 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.870
 tablet system and fully 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.610
 desktop operating system to work 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.540
 with applications in this situation was 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.910
 much more convenient 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.980
 I personally approve this new feature more 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.769
 everyone else would like to 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.090
 talk about multitasking now in 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.910
 the system is much more convenient and beautiful 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.550
 switch between windows about 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.290
 the same theme is operating systems 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.760
 mac os and in some versions and linux 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.650
 Virtual desktops also appeared 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.019
 a function that was also taken from others 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.440
 operating systems done very 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.940
 not bad and most importantly it is really convenient 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.430
 in addition to the above, I would like to 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.069
 note the fact that the menus drop down from 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.720
 right side disappeared temporarily or 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.019
 no I have no idea but at this stage 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.120
 not working yet I would like to say that 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.280
 windows 10 will be available at all 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.630
 platforms simultaneously and will have 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.150
 general app store 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.830
 what does it mean yes what for not 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.290
 smartphones tablets and computers 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.180
 working on windows 10 will be alone 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.400
 same applications so you can 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.650
 set completely identical is full on 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.780
 your computer and smartphone and later 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.519
 sync information in it also 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.859
 it says that all applications are running 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.230
 on will run on gaming 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:32.690
 x-box console function in principle 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.730
 promising insanely useful look 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.230
 what will actually be but 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.420
 last interesting novelty is 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.250
 application adaptability is now in 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.739
 depending on the size of the window 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.480
 his work changes completely 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.579
 deeds are clearly visible on the store 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.590
 applications as you can see when 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:50.750
 reducing the width of the window and not decreasing 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.920
 and the search turns into small 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.410
 harmless icon 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.450
 and on this perhaps all in this video we 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.340
 tried to collect for you all 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.810
 relevant information related to 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.660
 new operating opportunities 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:06.489
 windows 10 system download links 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.489
 and activation key in the description for the video
