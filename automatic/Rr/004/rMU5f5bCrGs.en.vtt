the F sub 3 and G 2 is a 1 is B so now
we're<00:01:00.840> just<00:01:00.870> going<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.260> reverse<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.649> pattern

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
we're just going to reverse the pattern

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.630 
we're just going to reverse the pattern

were just gonna reverse the pattern
going<00:02:12.500> down

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
going down

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.770 
going down
bob<00:02:13.760> is<00:02:14.350> b4<00:02:15.350> is<00:02:15.530> a<00:02:16.060> three<00:02:17.060> and<00:02:17.209> G<00:02:17.860> 2<00:02:18.860> is<00:02:18.890> f<00:02:19.250> sharp

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
bob is b4 is a three and G 2 is f sharp

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.140 
bob is b4 is a three and G 2 is f sharp
one<00:02:20.780> is<00:02:20.959> e<00:02:21.140> if<00:02:21.770> I<00:02:21.860> take<00:02:22.070> finger<00:02:22.340> number<00:02:22.640> three

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
one is e if I take finger number three

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.729 
one is e if I take finger number three
we're<00:02:23.330> gonna<00:02:23.420> cross<00:02:23.630> over<00:02:23.660> fan<00:02:24.020> number<00:02:24.170> one<00:02:24.500> to

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
we're gonna cross over fan number one to

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:33.250 
we're gonna cross over fan number one to
the<00:02:24.890> D<00:02:26.739> 2<00:02:27.739> is<00:02:27.920> C<00:02:28.100> sharp<00:02:28.959> one<00:02:29.959> is<00:02:30.110> B<00:02:32.080> so<00:02:33.080> that's

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
the D 2 is C sharp one is B so that's

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.870 
the D 2 is C sharp one is B so that's
the<00:02:33.440> pattern<00:02:33.620> going<00:02:33.890> up<00:02:34.070> and<00:02:34.250> coming<00:02:34.370> down<00:02:34.520> for

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
the pattern going up and coming down for

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.729 
the pattern going up and coming down for
the<00:02:34.940> right<00:02:35.150> hand<00:02:35.360> so<00:02:35.630> great<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.380> see<00:02:36.410> chain

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
the right hand so great to see chain

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.260 
the right hand so great to see chain
individually<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:37.550> when<00:02:37.670> you're<00:02:37.790> comfortable

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
individually and when you're comfortable

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.540 
individually and when you're comfortable
with<00:02:38.420> it<00:02:38.480> put<00:02:38.810> both<00:02:39.020> hands<00:02:39.260> together<00:02:39.440> so<00:02:40.250> until

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
with it put both hands together so until

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.010 
with it put both hands together so until
the<00:02:40.670> next<00:02:40.700> lesson<00:02:41.239> have<00:02:41.390> yourself<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:41.780> blessed

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
the next lesson have yourself a blessed

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:51.520 
the next lesson have yourself a blessed
life

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530
