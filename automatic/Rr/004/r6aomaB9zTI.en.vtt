diary despite making the most authentic

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.500 
diary despite making the most authentic
experience<00:00:21.279> possible<00:00:21.460> and<00:00:22.090> is<00:00:22.180> also<00:00:22.330> about

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
experience possible and is also about

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.689 
experience possible and is also about
making<00:00:23.349> the<00:00:23.560> call<00:00:23.710> handling<00:00:23.890> predictable<00:00:24.490> and

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699 
making the call handling predictable and

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.849 
making the call handling predictable and
consistent<00:00:24.910> I<00:00:25.420> think<00:00:25.960> there's<00:00:26.109> huge<00:00:26.439> interest

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:26.859 
consistent I think there's huge interest

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:28.650 
consistent I think there's huge interest
in<00:00:27.099> terms<00:00:27.310> of<00:00:27.400> the<00:00:27.519> balance<00:00:27.820> that<00:00:28.000> we<00:00:28.090> have<00:00:28.330> for

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
in terms of the balance that we have for

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.660 
in terms of the balance that we have for
arcade<00:00:29.260> or<00:00:29.289> simulation<00:00:29.890> handling<00:00:30.310> and

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
arcade or simulation handling and

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.060 
arcade or simulation handling and
personally<00:00:31.390> my<00:00:32.020> preference<00:00:32.590> is<00:00:32.680> always<00:00:32.800> been

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
personally my preference is always been

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.740 
personally my preference is always been
to<00:00:33.190> go<00:00:33.280> down<00:00:33.460> the<00:00:33.580> simulation<00:00:34.090> part<00:00:34.270> you<00:00:34.600> can

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
to go down the simulation part you can

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.869 
to go down the simulation part you can
make<00:00:34.930> a<00:00:34.960> realistic<00:00:35.680> seem<00:00:36.129> easier<00:00:36.520> to<00:00:36.670> play<00:00:36.820> for

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
make a realistic seem easier to play for

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.030 
make a realistic seem easier to play for
somebody<00:00:37.090> but<00:00:37.809> it's<00:00:37.989> very<00:00:38.320> very<00:00:38.620> difficult<00:00:38.680> to

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
somebody but it's very very difficult to

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.860 
somebody but it's very very difficult to
take<00:00:39.250> them<00:00:39.430> off<00:00:39.489> a<00:00:39.730> pending<00:00:40.149> system<00:00:40.329> and<00:00:40.750> make

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
take them off a pending system and make

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.420 
take them off a pending system and make
that<00:00:41.050> appeal<00:00:41.379> to<00:00:41.410> the<00:00:41.860> people<00:00:42.039> that<00:00:42.190> prefer

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
that appeal to the people that prefer

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.250 
that appeal to the people that prefer
the<00:00:42.610> simulation<00:00:43.090> handling<00:00:43.450> your<00:00:43.840> line<00:00:44.079> the

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
the Brawn test and reserve driver from

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.020 
the Brawn test and reserve driver from
2009<00:00:47.320> all<00:00:47.739> of<00:00:47.950> that<00:00:48.070> job<00:00:48.250> is<00:00:48.460> developing<00:00:48.910> the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
2009 all of that job is developing the

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.819 
2009 all of that job is developing the
simulator<00:00:49.420> as<00:00:49.600> well<00:00:49.780> we've<00:00:50.170> had<00:00:50.199> access<00:00:50.739> to

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
simulator as well we've had access to

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.040 
simulator as well we've had access to
the<00:00:50.949> teams<00:00:51.190> to<00:00:51.670> the<00:00:51.760> engineers<00:00:52.180> the<00:00:52.570> drivers

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
the teams to the engineers the drivers

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.860 
the teams to the engineers the drivers
so<00:00:53.469> what<00:00:53.829> I<00:00:53.860> do<00:00:53.980> is<00:00:54.100> try<00:00:54.699> and<00:00:54.820> bounce<00:00:55.090> my<00:00:55.510> level

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
so what I do is try and bounce my level

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.220 
so what I do is try and bounce my level
of<00:00:55.960> expectation<00:00:56.710> off<00:00:56.920> aunt<00:00:57.219> who<00:00:58.050> gives<00:00:59.050> us<00:00:59.170> a

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
of expectation off aunt who gives us a

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.650 
of expectation off aunt who gives us a
lot<00:00:59.350> of<00:00:59.410> feedback<00:00:59.620> week<00:01:00.219> by<00:01:00.430> week<00:01:00.640> the<00:01:01.270> onboard

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
lot of feedback week by week the onboard

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.810 
lot of feedback week by week the onboard
footage<00:01:01.930> when<00:01:02.440> you<00:01:02.500> see<00:01:02.680> on<00:01:02.800> TV<00:01:02.829> they<00:01:03.519> was<00:01:03.670> like

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
footage when you see on TV they was like

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.910 
footage when you see on TV they was like
incredibly<00:01:04.510> easy<00:01:04.750> to<00:01:04.930> drive<00:01:05.260> when<00:01:05.800> you're

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
incredibly easy to drive when you're

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.740 
incredibly easy to drive when you're
inside<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:06.460> car<00:01:06.640> Sarah<00:01:06.940> so<00:01:07.450> much<00:01:07.600> more

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
inside the car Sarah so much more

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.240 
inside the car Sarah so much more
twitchy<00:01:08.080> and<00:01:08.350> nervous<00:01:08.710> that's<00:01:08.920> one<00:01:09.100> thing

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
twitchy and nervous that's one thing

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.590 
twitchy and nervous that's one thing
that's<00:01:09.400> incredibly<00:01:10.030> hard<00:01:10.210> to<00:01:10.300> get<00:01:10.450> right

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
that's incredibly hard to get right

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.730 
that's incredibly hard to get right
unless<00:01:10.930> you've<00:01:11.110> got<00:01:11.200> someone<00:01:11.500> that's

most authentic experience night I think
it's<00:01:38.440> very<00:01:38.500> important<00:01:39.130> not<00:01:39.310> to<00:01:39.430> blunt<00:01:39.820> the

it's very important not to blunt the

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.420 
it's very important not to blunt the

when you start applying the driving

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.840 
when you start applying the driving
needs<00:01:44.470> to<00:01:44.980> kind<00:01:45.130> of<00:01:45.220> make<00:01:45.430> it<00:01:45.610> accessible
