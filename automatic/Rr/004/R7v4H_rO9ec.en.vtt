make I don't I don't know if you can see

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.089 
make I don't I don't know if you can see
it<00:01:24.979> good<00:01:25.250> but<00:01:25.429> the<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:26.149> black<00:01:26.390> parts<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:27.649> the

00:01:28.089 --> 00:01:28.099 
it good but the the black parts the the

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:29.710 
it good but the the black parts the the
darker<00:01:28.429> parts<00:01:28.459> of<00:01:28.819> the<00:01:28.880> shrimp<00:01:29.179> that's<00:01:29.509> his

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
darker parts of the shrimp that's his

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.050 
darker parts of the shrimp that's his
vitals<00:01:30.200> you<00:01:30.890> want<00:01:31.069> to<00:01:31.160> stay<00:01:31.340> away<00:01:31.580> from<00:01:31.610> them

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
vitals you want to stay away from them

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.570 
vitals you want to stay away from them
so<00:01:32.360> in<00:01:32.750> between<00:01:33.050> the<00:01:33.410> eyes<00:01:33.560> and<00:01:34.009> the<00:01:34.069> first

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
so in between the eyes and the first

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.120 
so in between the eyes and the first
dark<00:01:34.910> spot<00:01:35.209> underneath<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.259> horn<00:01:36.530> come

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
dark spot underneath the horn come

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.850 
dark spot underneath the horn come
through<00:01:37.399> the<00:01:37.520> side<00:01:37.729> and<00:01:38.240> go<00:01:39.229> out<00:01:39.380> just<00:01:39.709> like

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
through the side and go out just like

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.830 
through the side and go out just like
that<00:01:39.970> and<00:01:40.970> it's<00:01:41.179> basically<00:01:41.599> the<00:01:41.720> same

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
that and it's basically the same

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.080 
that and it's basically the same
principle<00:01:42.319> and<00:01:42.770> then<00:01:43.190> that<00:01:43.369> that<00:01:43.610> shrimp<00:01:43.940> will

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
principle and then that that shrimp will

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.080 
principle and then that that shrimp will
get<00:01:44.240> excited<00:01:44.810> and<00:01:44.899> he'll<00:01:45.289> pop<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:45.860> if<00:01:46.700> there's

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
get excited and he'll pop and if there's
