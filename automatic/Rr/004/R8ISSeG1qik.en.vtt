00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:13.889
 hello everyone with you fil and in this part I 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.460
 I'll show you how to build a snake yes this is my 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.850
 mechanism 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.150
 actually real I built it but 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.789
 Cattle are already titan yu tuba in general 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.250
 built exactly the same garbage answer 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.369
 it is stupid my shadow is I do not care 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.740
 in general it was so easy to build that 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.059
 it is not even experienced that the mechanism 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.309
 Ukraine you faded invented let's say straight 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.680
 a super duper well, not super-duper and 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.629
 if you inject a generator in general and this one 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.980
 the mechanism that everyone now uses 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.190
 who invented it, I stole both then 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.449
 Abdullah this is certainly a tragedy well, in general 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.110
 as you can see I have already built it all 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.780
 self this 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.309
 In general, all the blocks themselves such garbage 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.760
 it is possible more in fact to all blocks 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.159
 such a world and generally in the hole here on 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.880
 the third block of height we do this 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.299
 hole two blocks depth and here 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.909
 but let's make a hole 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:21.630
 put sticky pistons on the hole here 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.509
 damn forgot to take sticky pistons like this 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.020
 here so here so here so on 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:31.200
 sticky pistons we put a light stone 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:35.100
 it's a backlight type snake like this 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:43.979
 generally break here one here 2 here 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:47.070
 three here in general attack the construction 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.920
 do here one repeater at all 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.770
 can be done as here let's say 23 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.090
 then 121 and well, in general, I prefer 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.090
 such a dream 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.080
 and in general, put on the first piston 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.909
 one repeater to the second 2 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.560
 repeater to third 3 repeater 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:10.179
 then comes this thing 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:13.540
 here she unfolds all this whole 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:17.080
 bullshit with three delay view that is 3 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.560
 repeater 3 delays and again 1 and 2 in 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:24.670
 In general, the whole thing is connected so 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:29.760
 so here so here and this thing 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.760
 joins in like this 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.940
 who's that you all know 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:41.890
 my favorite clone generator in general is everything 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:44.440
 I forgot to leave this case here 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.500
 In general, I include the whole thing and apparently 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.850
 such a beautiful speed scene here 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.860
 you can increase that is absolutely 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:59.410
 calmly put delays everywhere 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:02.530
 the most maximum from this is nothing 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:10.030
 change will not change unless 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:13.570
 longer but it is of course all duty one pan 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.890
 leaving as one in general to all 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:19.780
 Thank you for watching 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:22.420
 it was the fifth part of the meine mechanism and in 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.670
 next part I'll show you the snake version 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.470
 2 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.500
 which I myself am on which I really am myself 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.590
 I thought that is not more convenient than you need 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.760
 was seen somewhere in y-tuba oh well 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.040
 thanks again for watching 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.940
 subscribe to the channel to all while swami 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.940
 was white
