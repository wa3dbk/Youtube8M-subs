 see they told you to just play and 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:14.659
 not recorded and so simple and does not mean 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.920
 I donâ€™t know that much 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.159

 I always have such a tactic 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.380
 center 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:30.530
 go to the center and 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.289
 yet for the big ones here i never go 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.270
 on the sides of the Nina start and really fuck 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.890
 the most important thing is that he sirun how much 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.500
 the person will put on the main thing 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.829
 so he was there though juggernaut he is not 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:47.179
 cheater film where to look for from three kinds 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:49.670
 St. Petersburg so so here it is 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:52.850
 interesting then the river 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.020
 hand or someone else I don't remember just 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.619
 a friend said that there are three kinds of cunning 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.500
 coins. 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.509
 lush thing no okay he is a river 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.670
 exactly imba does not contort how much she has 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.459
 all that no one else knows 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.330
 although he may be talking about the wiki series 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.180
 for wolking 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.519
 it is also the survivability of the hand also 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:19.390
 And this hem komem kontritsya so 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:19.390
 decide themselves puncture he says clearly 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.560
 village bedroom 1 already filled it 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.040
 guesses at the cleave treacherous half 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.189
 drop 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.500
 In short, always when he ryk me I always 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:44.840
 I buy these two things, I thought that 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.819
 it was rick a blockage Candy that turned out to be 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:53.930
 rights still then buy this here 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:56.629
 good thing but rarely this one is that 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.450
 The days were very much to save and now what 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.650
 remembered this here it is very much 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.829
 digging adverb 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:16.099
 usually it will save because it is so easy 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:18.400
 it is easy on it and now you will be serious 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:22.900
 surprised and kind of schoolchildren they are very well 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:28.870
 stupid and this guide ends like this 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.870
 that's so full 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.380
 known yourself are looking at starting already 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.770
 bomb them 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.410
 click breaking most important center 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.510
 he missed 30 minutes of his video and 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.080
 called such a house in general, peak 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.630
 jagger 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.460
 go to mid one hundred percent need to go mid 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.160
 don't care who's worth much there 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.020
 man stands then collect 3 crystalys 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.870
 and no matter what we have our creed and 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.030
 more interest because it does not hurt but also 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.610
 Of course we do not swing by itself during 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.680
 games are leaving for 30 minutes and when you come 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.500
 you will win it on any school student 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.320
 it turns out that we will succeed too 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.240
 then he tried I got 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.200
 they just gave me priority to him 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.210
 for some reason did not give 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.010
