00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.440
 let me give you a creative five 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.619
 see strands of braid with ribbon first 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.730
 made a tail and so I have one and 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.220
 knotted herein 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.240
 I specifically chose blue because 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.240
 what fine stands 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:35.050
 do four strands grab you like you 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:42.610
 her like that 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:47.200
 are you going to wave this over the two this lettuce 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:50.310
 you about that and that 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.310
 immediately grab two 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:58.080
 then make the ribbon in between fall 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.080
 so to say so out 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.830
 now grab it underneath 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.580
 about you 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:18.579
 these exactly the same under and over 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.039
 that struggle but now you are in trouble 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:24.210
 her but you should always win that 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.210
 come back in the middle 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:31.630
 so next then you will not go there 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.470
 underneath we you go over it 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.470
 across 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.560
 under the land over here too 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.630
 under this fight well they ribbon us 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.310
 here but you let it fall back again 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.310
 in the middle on one and over it 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.780
 what we have done over it 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.780
 we now pass underneath again 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.780
 underneath 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:07.840
 over underneath 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.170
 over the wind let you fall back in 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.170
 the middle 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.180
 over it underneath 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.200
 over under it and it takes 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.200
 leave your story back in the middle 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:36.099
 education about the ribbon one 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:44.360
 for corn on can be found in fall 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:50.680
 the middle 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:53.060
 over underneath over it 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:03:01.700
 underneath 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:05.840
 relapse in the middle was over 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.190
 recently over the ribbon again 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.870
 the middle 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.870
 she is constantly doing one round 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:20.410
 over to continue 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:24.049
 sometimes look short on it from a language 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:27.680
 underneath and the ribbon 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:37.000
 back in the lakes ribbon must be a3 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:37.000
 come back in the middle or not 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:49.760
 underneath such a female 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:52.730
 underneath and over the ribbon 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.500
 back in the middle and then I grab 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.500
 my piece but it gets too short for me 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.799
 how do you see that there is a double layer 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.840
 that the beauty of this can be that 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:16.109
 bottom layer you can very nice output 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.109
 to pull 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:35.440
 five strands of braid with them 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:46.150
 The last one must be a bit away
