should look and here's how that one

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.240 
should look and here's how that one
looks<00:01:50.490> see<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.000> difference<00:01:51.799> it's<00:01:52.799> got<00:01:52.950> nice

one
see<00:02:01.680> how<00:02:01.740> it's<00:02:01.920> all<00:02:02.070> bent<00:02:02.610> out<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.790> shape

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.960 

see<00:02:06.149> that

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
see that

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.230 
see that
that<00:02:08.720> focused<00:02:09.850> trying<00:02:10.850> to<00:02:10.940> get<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.090> little

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
that focused trying to get a little

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.940 
that focused trying to get a little
closer<00:02:11.600> here<00:02:11.810> so<00:02:12.170> that's<00:02:12.380> all<00:02:12.560> been<00:02:12.740> on<00:02:12.890> a

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
closer here so that's all been on a

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.390 
closer here so that's all been on a
shape<00:02:13.330> so<00:02:14.330> if<00:02:14.450> these<00:02:14.660> things<00:02:14.990> are<00:02:15.440> straight

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
shape so if these things are straight

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.120 
shape so if these things are straight
coming<00:02:16.790> down<00:02:17.030> here<00:02:17.270> like<00:02:17.420> that<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:18.050> you<00:02:18.800> stick

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
coming down here like that and you stick

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.300 
coming down here like that and you stick
your<00:02:19.280> guide<00:02:19.580> pin<00:02:19.970> back<00:02:20.270> in<00:02:23.920> see<00:02:24.920> it's<00:02:25.070> going<00:02:25.220> to

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
your guide pin back in see it's going to

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
your guide pin back in see it's going to
make<00:02:25.490> good<00:02:25.820> contact<00:02:26.660> with<00:02:27.790> those<00:02:28.790> copper

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
make good contact with those copper

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.470 
make good contact with those copper
prongs<00:02:29.630> see<00:02:29.900> how<00:02:29.960> they're<00:02:30.140> both<00:02:30.170> lifting<00:02:30.890> up

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
prongs see how they're both lifting up

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.120 
prongs see how they're both lifting up
that's<00:02:32.480> what<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:32.900> want<00:02:33.140> because<00:02:33.500> you're

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
that's what you want because you're

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.190 
that's what you want because you're
getting<00:02:34.310> power<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:35.000> each<00:02:35.390> one<00:02:35.750> of<00:02:35.780> those<00:02:35.960> which

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
getting power to each one of those which

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.540 
getting power to each one of those which
is<00:02:36.230> giving<00:02:36.650> power<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:37.250> which<00:02:37.370> is

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
is giving power to you which is

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.700 
is giving power to you which is
basically<00:02:38.060> a<00:02:38.180> circuit<00:02:38.690> a<00:02:38.750> complete<00:02:39.170> circuit

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
basically a circuit a complete circuit

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.740 
basically a circuit a complete circuit
and<00:02:39.920> if<00:02:40.610> you<00:02:40.730> don't<00:02:40.910> have<00:02:41.120> that<00:02:41.300> that's<00:02:41.510> why

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
and if you don't have that that's why

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.199 
and if you don't have that that's why
your<00:02:41.930> compact<00:02:42.440> car<00:02:42.680> is<00:02:42.800> not<00:02:42.980> working<00:02:43.580> there<00:02:44.060> is

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
your compact car is not working there is

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.420 
your compact car is not working there is
nothing<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.900> these<00:02:45.080> cars<00:02:45.500> as<00:02:45.890> you<00:02:46.070> can<00:02:46.250> see

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
nothing to these cars as you can see

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.370 
nothing to these cars as you can see
it's<00:02:46.580> just<00:02:46.790> a<00:02:46.940> simple<00:02:47.150> motor<00:02:47.570> in<00:02:47.780> a<00:02:47.870> circuit

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
it's just a simple motor in a circuit

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.480 
it's just a simple motor in a circuit
okay<00:02:49.870> these<00:02:50.870> are<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:51.110> compact<00:02:51.680> cars<00:02:51.980> this<00:02:52.310> is

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
okay these are the compact cars this is

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.260 
okay these are the compact cars this is
a<00:02:52.520> NASCAR<00:02:53.770> that's<00:02:54.770> an<00:02:54.950> analog<00:02:55.400> or<00:02:55.730> I<00:02:55.850> mean<00:02:56.060> this

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
a NASCAR that's an analog or I mean this

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.540 
a NASCAR that's an analog or I mean this
was<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.630> Aeros<00:02:56.990> car<00:02:57.290> and<00:02:57.530> this<00:02:57.620> is<00:02:57.800> the<00:02:57.980> co<00:02:58.190> T

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
was the Aeros car and this is the co T

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.730 
was the Aeros car and this is the co T
but<00:02:58.790> there's<00:02:59.000> there's<00:02:59.630> really<00:02:59.870> no<00:03:00.170> other

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
but there's there's really no other

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.460 
but there's there's really no other
design<00:03:01.340> change<00:03:01.820> other<00:03:02.150> than<00:03:02.270> you<00:03:03.170> know<00:03:03.290> the

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
design change other than you know the

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.949 
design change other than you know the
chassis<00:03:04.070> you<00:03:04.670> know<00:03:04.790> it's<00:03:05.000> more<00:03:05.360> of<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.540> squarish

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
chassis you know it's more of a squarish

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.530 
chassis you know it's more of a squarish
look<00:03:06.380> but<00:03:07.220> you<00:03:07.370> want<00:03:07.550> to<00:03:07.640> make<00:03:07.820> sure<00:03:10.360> that<00:03:11.360> your

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
look but you want to make sure that your

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.320 
look but you want to make sure that your
prongs<00:03:12.070> see<00:03:13.070> now<00:03:13.220> I<00:03:13.250> just<00:03:13.310> by<00:03:13.640> taking<00:03:14.000> that<00:03:14.120> out

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
prongs see now I just by taking that out

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.880 
prongs see now I just by taking that out
I<00:03:14.360> bent<00:03:14.780> that<00:03:14.870> one<00:03:15.230> see<00:03:15.410> how<00:03:15.470> I've<00:03:15.590> bent<00:03:15.800> that

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
I bent that one see how I've bent that

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.090 
I bent that one see how I've bent that
over<00:03:16.280> so<00:03:17.000> what<00:03:17.180> you<00:03:17.300> want<00:03:17.510> to<00:03:17.540> do<00:03:17.750> is<00:03:18.019> you<00:03:18.920> want

to push your finger on one side and kind
of<00:03:21.290> just<00:03:22.360> cup<00:03:23.360> it<00:03:23.510> over<00:03:25.690> see<00:03:26.690> that<00:03:30.519> so<00:03:31.519> that

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
of just cup it over see that so that

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.240 
of just cup it over see that so that
there<00:03:31.910> they<00:03:32.330> look<00:03:32.570> exactly<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:33.530> same<00:03:33.680> going

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
there they look exactly the same going

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:41.289 
there they look exactly the same going
across<00:03:37.420> exactly<00:03:38.420> the<00:03:38.540> same<00:03:38.810> right<00:03:39.200> here<00:03:40.299> okay

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
across exactly the same right here okay

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.600 
across exactly the same right here okay
not<00:03:41.570> ones<00:03:41.930> up<00:03:42.230> or<00:03:42.440> ones<00:03:42.650> down<00:03:42.920> but<00:03:43.250> there<00:03:43.430> and

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
not ones up or ones down but there and

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.610 
not ones up or ones down but there and
there<00:03:44.209> tension<00:03:44.480> see<00:03:44.930> how<00:03:45.019> that<00:03:45.200> goes<00:03:45.380> in

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
there tension see how that goes in

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.770 
there tension see how that goes in
that's<00:03:45.830> how<00:03:45.980> you<00:03:46.100> want<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:46.519> if<00:03:47.299> they've<00:03:47.540> lost

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
that's how you want it if they've lost

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.289 
that's how you want it if they've lost
the<00:03:48.110> tension<00:03:48.680> this<00:03:49.400> probably<00:03:49.910> has<00:03:50.060> come

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
the tension this probably has come

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.150 
the tension this probably has come
undone<00:03:50.660> here<00:03:50.959> the<00:03:51.080> little<00:03:51.200> soldering<00:03:51.799> there

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
undone here the little soldering there

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.250 
undone here the little soldering there
and<00:03:52.430> if<00:03:52.910> you've<00:03:53.060> lost<00:03:53.239> your<00:03:53.480> tension<00:03:53.989> then<00:03:54.140> it

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
and if you've lost your tension then it

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.440 
and if you've lost your tension then it
won't<00:03:54.410> stay<00:03:54.860> on<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:55.160> I<00:03:55.640> won't<00:03:56.030> stand<00:03:56.239> the

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
won't stay on the I won't stand the

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.330 
won't stay on the I won't stand the
brush<00:03:56.690> and<00:03:56.900> therefore<00:03:57.350> you<00:03:57.920> won't<00:03:57.980> have<00:03:58.190> good

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
brush and therefore you won't have good

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.789 
brush and therefore you won't have good
contact<00:03:58.970> with<00:03:59.180> your<00:03:59.360> compact<00:03:59.959> cars<00:04:00.370> okay<00:04:02.799> this
