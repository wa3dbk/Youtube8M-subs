00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
is the name of the town action so let's

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.370 
is the name of the town action so let's
say<00:05:04.880> we<00:05:04.940> were<00:05:05.120> in<00:05:05.240> Italy<00:05:05.360> right<00:05:05.510> now<00:05:05.780> this

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
say we were in Italy right now this

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.320 
say we were in Italy right now this
would<00:05:06.560> be<00:05:06.590> called<00:05:06.830> malboro<00:05:07.400> instead<00:05:08.210> of

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
would be called malboro instead of

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.080 
would be called malboro instead of
Chianti<00:05:08.810> if<00:05:08.900> it<00:05:09.020> were<00:05:09.110> Chianti<00:05:09.730> now<00:05:10.730> the

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
Chianti if it were Chianti now the

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.430 
Chianti if it were Chianti now the
reason<00:05:11.240> it's<00:05:11.450> called<00:05:11.510> super<00:05:11.960> tuscan<00:05:12.350> is

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
reason it's called super tuscan is

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.129 
reason it's called super tuscan is
because<00:05:12.710> it<00:05:12.830> still<00:05:13.040> comes<00:05:13.250> from<00:05:13.460> Tuscany

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
because it still comes from Tuscany

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.390 
because it still comes from Tuscany
however<00:05:15.139> it<00:05:15.350> doesn't<00:05:15.590> follow<00:05:15.950> those<00:05:16.250> rules

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
however it doesn't follow those rules

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.820 
however it doesn't follow those rules
that<00:05:17.090> would<00:05:17.210> allow<00:05:17.720> it<00:05:17.780> to<00:05:17.900> be<00:05:18.080> called<00:05:18.350> let's

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
that would allow it to be called let's

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.680 
that would allow it to be called let's
say<00:05:18.980> a<00:05:19.010> Chianti<00:05:19.550> or<00:05:19.669> chianti<00:05:20.030> classico<00:05:20.120> in

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
say a Chianti or chianti classico in

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.840 
say a Chianti or chianti classico in
that<00:05:21.010> there's<00:05:22.010> Cabernet<00:05:22.430> in<00:05:22.550> there<00:05:22.730> as<00:05:22.820> well

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
people in Kathy don't necessarily think

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.920 
people in Kathy don't necessarily think
that<00:05:27.700> you<00:05:28.700> need<00:05:28.850> to<00:05:28.970> do<00:05:29.090> that<00:05:29.330> yeah<00:05:29.720> it's<00:05:29.870> a

that you need to do that yeah it's a
great<00:05:30.050> wine<00:05:30.320> but<00:05:30.620> why<00:05:30.860> makers<00:05:31.130> realize<00:05:31.669> that

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
great wine but why makers realize that

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
in cooking everything is balanced is the

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:42.370 
in cooking everything is balanced is the
sum<00:05:37.100> of<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:39.500> final<00:05:39.860> product<00:05:40.100> is<00:05:40.400> always<00:05:41.380> more

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
sum of the final product is always more

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.659
