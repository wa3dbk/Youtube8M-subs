00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.650 
DC Direct okay so first thing you notice
about<00:00:16.640> jet<00:00:17.420> is<00:00:17.720> it's<00:00:18.560> 160<00:00:19.550> scale<00:00:19.880> so<00:00:20.360> it's

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
about jet is it's 160 scale so it's

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.070 
about jet is it's 160 scale so it's
about<00:00:20.780> this<00:00:21.230> name<00:00:21.710> of<00:00:21.949> this<00:00:22.160> law<00:00:22.369> and<00:00:22.930> it<00:00:23.930> is

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
about this name of this law and it is

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.120 
about this name of this law and it is
made<00:00:24.380> out<00:00:24.680> of<00:00:24.880> transparent<00:00:25.880> aluminum<00:00:27.130> which

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
made out of transparent aluminum which

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.760 
made out of transparent aluminum which
you<00:00:28.220> don't<00:00:28.310> see<00:00:28.460> a<00:00:28.520> lot<00:00:28.699> in<00:00:28.820> toys<00:00:29.500> normally<00:00:30.500> the

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
you don't see a lot in toys normally the

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.779 
you don't see a lot in toys normally the
vectorscope<00:00:31.130> for<00:00:31.910> cheaper<00:00:32.419> materials<00:00:32.719> but<00:00:33.789> to

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:34.789 
vectorscope for cheaper materials but to

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:39.400 
vectorscope for cheaper materials but to
get<00:00:34.910> the<00:00:35.120> whole<00:00:35.989> invisible<00:00:36.860> jet<00:00:37.130> feel<00:00:38.230> you<00:00:39.230> had

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
get the whole invisible jet feel you had

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.250 
get the whole invisible jet feel you had
to<00:00:39.440> use<00:00:39.620> a<00:00:39.649> transparent<00:00:40.130> material<00:00:40.840> so<00:00:41.840> it

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
to use a transparent material so it

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.490 
to use a transparent material so it
comes<00:00:42.590> as<00:00:42.890> you<00:00:43.010> can<00:00:43.130> see<00:00:43.250> on<00:00:43.430> a<00:00:43.460> stand<00:00:43.820> and<00:00:44.500> the

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
comes as you can see on a stand and the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.139 
comes as you can see on a stand and the
stand<00:00:45.530> is<00:00:45.980> made<00:00:46.130> out<00:00:46.250> of<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.399> same<00:00:46.430> material

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
stand is made out of the same material

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.530 
stand is made out of the same material
and<00:00:47.770> you<00:00:48.770> can<00:00:48.950> remove<00:00:49.219> the<00:00:49.399> jet<00:00:49.640> from<00:00:50.360> the

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
and you can remove the jet from the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.930 
and you can remove the jet from the
stand<00:00:50.840> alongside<00:00:54.039> so<00:00:55.039> you<00:00:55.460> can<00:00:55.610> see<00:00:55.789> it's

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
stand alongside so you can see it's

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.660 
stand alongside so you can see it's
that's<00:00:56.539> pretty<00:00:56.840> big<00:00:57.079> it's<00:00:57.829> got<00:00:57.980> a<00:00:58.010> significant

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
that's pretty big it's got a significant

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.220 
that's pretty big it's got a significant
amount<00:00:58.879> of<00:00:59.030> weight<00:00:59.090> to<00:00:59.539> it<00:01:00.610> but<00:01:01.610> it's<00:01:02.030> not<00:01:02.300> so

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
amount of weight to it but it's not so

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.689 
amount of weight to it but it's not so
heavy<00:01:03.469> that<00:01:03.620> you<00:01:03.949> don't<00:01:04.100> feel<00:01:04.430> like<00:01:04.460> you<00:01:04.670> can

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
heavy that you don't feel like you can

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.730 
heavy that you don't feel like you can
pick<00:01:05.269> it<00:01:05.390> up<00:01:05.509> play<00:01:06.020> with<00:01:06.200> it<00:01:06.320> so<00:01:08.319> you<00:01:09.319> can<00:01:09.499> see

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
pick it up play with it so you can see

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.099 
pick it up play with it so you can see
in<00:01:10.639> the<00:01:10.819> cockpit<00:01:11.090> there<00:01:11.779> is<00:01:11.990> a<00:01:12.159> opens<00:01:13.159> up<00:01:13.369> and

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:14.109 
in the cockpit there is a opens up and

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:16.510 
in the cockpit there is a opens up and
there's<00:01:15.109> a<00:01:15.139> space<00:01:15.499> for<00:01:16.009> a<00:01:16.039> Wonder<00:01:16.429> Woman

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
there's a space for a Wonder Woman

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.300 
there's a space for a Wonder Woman
figure<00:01:17.079> wonder<00:01:18.079> we<00:01:18.170> figured<00:01:18.469> you<00:01:18.590> not<00:01:18.770> good<00:01:19.159> it

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
figure wonder we figured you not good it

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.660 
figure wonder we figured you not good it
which<00:01:19.789> is<00:01:19.969> really<00:01:20.299> really<00:01:20.599> an<00:01:20.959> omission

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
which is really really an omission

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.849 
which is really really an omission
clearly<00:01:22.749> it<00:01:23.749> should<00:01:23.810> have<00:01:24.079> come<00:01:24.109> with<00:01:24.349> a

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:24.859 
clearly it should have come with a

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:29.230 
clearly it should have come with a
wonder<00:01:25.249> woman<00:01:25.599> puts<00:01:26.599> back<00:01:26.929> here<00:01:27.819> you<00:01:28.819> can<00:01:28.999> see

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
wonder woman puts back here you can see

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.690 
wonder woman puts back here you can see
that<00:01:29.599> it<00:01:29.869> has<00:01:29.899> the<00:01:30.049> dual<00:01:30.469> fans<00:01:30.799> that<00:01:31.399> are

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
that it has the dual fans that are

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.629 
that it has the dual fans that are
indicative<00:01:32.179> of<00:01:32.569> the<00:01:32.840> f-16<00:01:33.349> which<00:01:34.069> this<00:01:34.340> jet<00:01:34.609> is

00:01:34.629 --> 00:01:34.639 
indicative of the f-16 which this jet is

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:36.190 
indicative of the f-16 which this jet is
modeled<00:01:35.240> after<00:01:35.329> although<00:01:35.689> they<00:01:35.899> did<00:01:36.049> take

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
modeled after although they did take

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.429 
modeled after although they did take
some<00:01:36.259> liberties<00:01:36.499> with<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:36.889> design<00:01:37.249> of<00:01:37.520> course

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
some liberties with the design of course

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.330 
some liberties with the design of course
it<00:01:39.439> does<00:01:39.799> have<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.069> front<00:01:40.279> intake<00:01:41.060> nozzles

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
it does have the front intake nozzles

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.279 
it does have the front intake nozzles
the<00:01:43.340> wings<00:01:43.639> are<00:01:43.849> pretty<00:01:44.270> solid<00:01:46.599> turn<00:01:47.599> turn

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
the wings are pretty solid turn turn

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.559 
the wings are pretty solid turn turn
around<00:01:48.619> here<00:01:48.979> for<00:01:49.369> a<00:01:49.399> minute<00:01:49.609> you<00:01:50.119> can<00:01:50.239> see<00:01:50.450> the

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
around here for a minute you can see the

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.319 
around here for a minute you can see the
back<00:01:50.779> this<00:01:51.079> of<00:01:51.349> engine<00:01:51.679> detail<00:01:52.039> I<00:01:52.130> mean<00:01:52.340> it's

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
back this of engine detail I mean it's

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.269 
back this of engine detail I mean it's
tough<00:01:53.599> to<00:01:53.749> see<00:01:53.899> cuz<00:01:54.139> it<00:01:54.259> is<00:01:54.380> an<00:01:54.499> invisible<00:01:54.770> jet

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:55.279 
tough to see cuz it is an invisible jet

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:58.539 
tough to see cuz it is an invisible jet
you<00:01:55.819> know<00:01:55.969> but<00:01:56.539> if<00:01:57.079> you<00:01:57.259> really<00:01:57.560> look<00:01:57.799> hard<00:01:58.009> you

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
you know but if you really look hard you

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.760 
you know but if you really look hard you
can<00:01:58.729> you<00:01:58.819> can<00:01:58.939> see<00:01:59.149> the<00:01:59.329> engines<00:01:59.689> over<00:02:00.529> here

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
can you can see the engines over here

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.609 
can you can see the engines over here
okay<00:02:01.479> so<00:02:02.979> if<00:02:03.979> you<00:02:04.159> take<00:02:04.369> it<00:02:04.399> and<00:02:04.700> flip<00:02:05.029> it<00:02:05.119> over

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
okay so if you take it and flip it over

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.040 
okay so if you take it and flip it over
see<00:02:06.619> that<00:02:06.859> there<00:02:07.130> are<00:02:07.239> landing<00:02:08.239> gear<00:02:08.509> that

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
see that there are landing gear that

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.390 
see that there are landing gear that
open<00:02:09.739> there's<00:02:10.369> three<00:02:10.610> hatches<00:02:11.950> all<00:02:12.950> made<00:02:13.280> out

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
open there's three hatches all made out

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.670 
open there's three hatches all made out
of<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.519> same<00:02:13.549> aluminum<00:02:14.030> so<00:02:14.180> no<00:02:14.299> rubber<00:02:14.510> boats

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
of the same aluminum so no rubber boats

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.920 
of the same aluminum so no rubber boats
aluminum<00:02:16.189> is<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.459> only<00:02:16.640> fully<00:02:17.510> transparent

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
aluminum is the only fully transparent

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.759 
aluminum is the only fully transparent
material<00:02:19.030> so<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.299> entire<00:02:20.599> vehicle<00:02:20.989> is<00:02:21.290> 8<00:02:21.560> out

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
material so the entire vehicle is 8 out

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.890 
material so the entire vehicle is 8 out
of<00:02:21.799> there<00:02:22.099> are<00:02:22.159> no<00:02:22.370> details<00:02:22.609> and<00:02:23.269> there's<00:02:23.510> no

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
of there are no details and there's no

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.399 
of there are no details and there's no
assembly<00:02:24.909> so<00:02:25.909> I<00:02:26.329> would<00:02:26.840> think<00:02:26.989> that<00:02:27.109> if<00:02:27.290> you

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
assembly so I would think that if you

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.369 
assembly so I would think that if you
lost<00:02:27.590> parts<00:02:28.040> of<00:02:28.159> this<00:02:28.250> thing<00:02:28.489> would<00:02:28.730> be<00:02:29.379> unit

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
lost parts of this thing would be unit

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:38.110 
lost parts of this thing would be unit
so<00:02:32.079> no<00:02:33.079> parts<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:36.200> is<00:02:36.439> a<00:02:36.590> good<00:02:36.859> piece<00:02:37.250> nice<00:02:37.849> and

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
so no parts it is a good piece nice and

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.190 
so no parts it is a good piece nice and
solid<00:02:38.420> but<00:02:40.180> let's<00:02:41.180> check<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:41.719> against<00:02:42.109> the

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
solid but let's check it against the

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.140 
solid but let's check it against the
transparency<00:02:43.040> of<00:02:43.069> some<00:02:43.400> some<00:02:43.670> other<00:02:43.849> pieces
