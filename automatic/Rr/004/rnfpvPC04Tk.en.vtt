00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
that we addressed both needs so totally

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.390 
that we addressed both needs so totally
completely<00:02:17.569> different<00:02:17.810> machines<00:02:18.109> and<00:02:18.469> you

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
completely different machines and you

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.709 
completely different machines and you
know<00:02:19.519> I<00:02:19.549> think<00:02:19.670> if<00:02:19.849> you<00:02:19.939> driving<00:02:20.329> both<00:02:20.480> you'd

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:20.719 
know I think if you driving both you'd

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:23.140 
know I think if you driving both you'd
really<00:02:20.959> understand<00:02:21.349> and<00:02:21.969> possibly<00:02:22.969> the<00:02:23.120> most

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
really understand and possibly the most

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.729 
really understand and possibly the most
important<00:02:23.689> question<00:02:23.989> that<00:02:24.019> we<00:02:24.170> had<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:24.709> you

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
important question that we had and you

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.920 
important question that we had and you
probably<00:02:25.010> will<00:02:25.400> also<00:02:25.819> is<00:02:26.000> what<00:02:26.510> sets<00:02:26.780> the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
probably will also is what sets the

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.479 
probably will also is what sets the
Wolverine<00:02:27.319> apart<00:02:27.709> from<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.069> rest<00:02:28.250> of<00:02:28.430> the

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
Wolverine apart from the rest of the

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.390

competition in the industry the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.670 
competition in the industry the

of the four-wheel drive system you can

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.210 
of the four-wheel drive system you can
actually<00:03:32.449> fully<00:03:32.870> walk<00:03:33.199> down<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.979> drive

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
actually fully walk down the drive

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.000 
actually fully walk down the drive
system<00:03:34.489> so<00:03:35.239> what<00:03:35.840> that<00:03:35.959> does<00:03:36.199> for<00:03:36.260> us<00:03:36.620> is<00:03:36.859> when

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
system so what that does for us is when

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.309 
system so what that does for us is when
you're<00:03:37.220> say<00:03:37.939> going<00:03:38.180> down<00:03:38.449> that<00:03:38.689> hill<00:03:38.900> with<00:03:39.139> it

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
you're say going down that hill with it

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.409 
you're say going down that hill with it
with<00:03:39.530> all-wheel<00:03:40.340> engine<00:03:40.579> braking<00:03:40.790> those

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:41.419 
with all-wheel engine braking those

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:42.969 
with all-wheel engine braking those
tires<00:03:41.689> are<00:03:41.900> now<00:03:41.989> physically<00:03:42.379> locked<00:03:42.739> together

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:42.979 
tires are now physically locked together

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:45.640 
tires are now physically locked together
with<00:03:43.669> the<00:03:43.819> engine<00:03:44.180> so<00:03:44.599> all<00:03:44.750> four<00:03:45.079> tires<00:03:45.349> now

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
with the engine so all four tires now

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.580 
with the engine so all four tires now
are<00:03:45.799> providing<00:03:46.340> traction<00:03:46.939> and<00:03:47.120> control<00:03:48.049> as

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
are providing traction and control as

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.740 
are providing traction and control as
you're<00:03:49.220> descending<00:03:49.549> down<00:03:49.849> a<00:03:49.909> hill<00:03:50.209> some<00:03:50.659> of

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
you're descending down a hill some of

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:51.879 
you're descending down a hill some of
the<00:03:50.810> other<00:03:50.930> models<00:03:51.290> out<00:03:51.379> there<00:03:51.439> they<00:03:51.709> only

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
the other models out there they only

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:53.920 
the other models out there they only
have<00:03:52.159> engine<00:03:52.819> braking<00:03:53.030> or<00:03:53.329> hold<00:03:53.479> back<00:03:53.659> on<00:03:53.840> the

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
have engine braking or hold back on the

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.780 
have engine braking or hold back on the
rear<00:03:54.109> tires<00:03:54.319> so<00:03:54.919> you<00:03:55.009> can<00:03:55.220> imagine<00:03:55.609> if<00:03:55.699> you're

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
rear tires so you can imagine if you're

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.460 
rear tires so you can imagine if you're
in<00:03:55.879> a<00:03:55.909> very<00:03:56.000> slippery<00:03:56.449> situation<00:03:57.109> you<00:03:57.319> can

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
in a very slippery situation you can

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.809 
in a very slippery situation you can
kind<00:03:57.859> of<00:03:57.919> start<00:03:58.159> getting<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:58.459> back<00:03:58.609> end

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
kind of start getting the back end

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:00.759 
kind of start getting the back end
sliding<00:03:59.180> around<00:03:59.239> and<00:03:59.659> you<00:03:59.989> lose<00:04:00.199> that<00:04:00.439> overall

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
sliding around and you lose that overall

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.039 
sliding around and you lose that overall
confidence<00:04:01.159> so<00:04:01.819> by<00:04:02.060> locking<00:04:02.540> down<00:04:02.659> the<00:04:02.720> full

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
confidence so by locking down the full

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.449 
confidence so by locking down the full
wheel<00:04:03.169> drive<00:04:03.379> system<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:03.889> having<00:04:04.069> complete

exactly what's going to happen when you

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.360 
exactly what's going to happen when you
give<00:04:09.199> it<00:04:09.319> brakes<00:04:09.590> or<00:04:09.829> you<00:04:09.919> give<00:04:10.040> it<00:04:10.159> throttle

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
give it brakes or you give it throttle

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.699 
give it brakes or you give it throttle
and<00:04:10.729> that<00:04:11.120> just<00:04:11.389> instills<00:04:11.870> confidence<00:04:11.959> in<00:04:12.590> you

can actually continue on the trail some

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.710 
can actually continue on the trail some
of<00:04:31.820> the<00:04:31.910> other<00:04:32.030> models<00:04:32.540> out<00:04:32.660> there

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
of the other models out there

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.300 
of the other models out there
competitive<00:04:33.320> models<00:04:33.590> they<00:04:33.710> don't<00:04:33.920> have<00:04:34.100> that

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
competitive models they don't have that

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.610 
competitive models they don't have that
so<00:04:34.610> you<00:04:34.880> have<00:04:35.270> gaps<00:04:35.600> or<00:04:35.840> big<00:04:35.960> holes<00:04:36.169> underneath

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
so you have gaps or big holes underneath

on or a tree stump to get hung up on so

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.530 
on or a tree stump to get hung up on so
design<00:04:42.530> elements<00:04:43.070> in<00:04:43.190> place<00:04:43.340> really<00:04:44.270> gives

out<00:04:46.130> on<00:04:46.160> the<00:04:46.310> trail<00:04:46.520> and<00:04:46.880> so<00:04:47.480> you<00:04:48.169> know<00:04:48.260> that's

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
out on the trail and so you know that's

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.900 
out on the trail and so you know that's
what<00:04:48.650> we're<00:04:48.830> really<00:04:48.860> going<00:04:49.220> after<00:04:49.460> we<00:04:49.760> want
