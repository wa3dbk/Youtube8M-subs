00:00:05.696 --> 00:00:07.896
 Hi how are you? Justin here. 

00:00:07.896 --> 00:00:11.909
 Today we learn the names of empty wires 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:17.040
 ie what are the notes on each of them. 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.398
 Because the final goal is to know all the notes on the guitar neck 

00:00:20.413 --> 00:00:22.613
 and we begin by learning the notes on the loose wires. 

00:00:22.613 --> 00:00:26.050
 To get started we need a little space here 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.231
 that we can show the gang door diagram 

00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:33.081
 so I'll lean slightly. And about "Sad!" 

00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:39.108
 Here's a little gig guides where you can see EADGB E. 

00:00:39.108 --> 00:00:42.284
 And that's the names of empty wires. 

00:00:42.284 --> 00:00:45.516
 And I talked to you, starting with the thickest wire. 

00:00:45.516 --> 00:00:49.664
 If now and off we have E 

00:00:49.664 --> 00:00:51.863
 AND 

00:00:51.863 --> 00:00:53.915
 D 

00:00:53.915 --> 00:00:55.616
 MR 

00:00:55.616 --> 00:00:57.641
 B 

00:00:57.641 --> 00:01:00.211
 and again E. 

00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:03.525
 You will notice that both external E. 

00:01:03.525 --> 00:01:08.069
 That's why I sometimes call them a thick wire 

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:10.406
 and thin or thin wire. 

00:01:10.406 --> 00:01:13.546
 Because if I call each other E wire we will have a problem. 

00:01:13.546 --> 00:01:15.393
 How to remember them 

00:01:15.393 --> 00:01:18.065
 it's nice to figure out a word game 

00:01:18.065 --> 00:01:20.192
 or some mailbox. 

00:01:20.192 --> 00:01:25.131
 For example: Here's Right Guitar Stretching Atmosphere Team. 

00:01:25.131 --> 00:01:27.399
 This starts from the tapping of the wire. 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.078
 Here's Right Guitar Raises the Team Atmosphere. 

00:01:32.078 --> 00:01:34.305
 This is not so bad. 

00:01:34.305 --> 00:01:37.032
 You must have been in company or at a party 

00:01:37.032 --> 00:01:39.259
 where someone had a guitar and knew how to play. 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.012
 That must have raised the atmosphere in your team. 

00:01:43.012 --> 00:01:46.090
 This could remind you of this mailbox. 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.465
 But you can think of something else you like. 

00:01:49.465 --> 00:01:53.512
 There are various combinations. 

00:01:54.531 --> 00:02:00.465
 Eduard Bira Guitar, Two, Acoustic (Electric). 

00:02:00.465 --> 00:02:03.125
 Eduard is, of course, Eduard Jimmy Matešić. 

00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:06.880
 He is an excellent guitar teacher. And likes to buy them. 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.076
 What would be more comfortable? 

00:02:10.076 --> 00:02:13.533
 When Eduard is playing he probably never says something like that 

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:17.558
 Edi Ajde Doma Grozno Bučiš Edi. 

00:02:17.558 --> 00:02:20.880
 Of course this starts on the worst wire. 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.693
 It does not matter what you think. 

00:02:23.693 --> 00:02:25.907
 Just have something 

00:02:25.907 --> 00:02:29.175
 which will help you remember the name of the wire. 

00:02:29.175 --> 00:02:31.612
 This is important because we will soon 

00:02:31.612 --> 00:02:33.763
 in the next stage 

00:02:33.763 --> 00:02:37.066
 study the notes in the open position. 

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:39.531
 If you do not know the names of empty wires 

00:02:39.531 --> 00:02:42.429
 it will be almost impossible.
