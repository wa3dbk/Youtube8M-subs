but<00:02:20.490> we<00:02:20.640> went<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:21.000> little<00:02:21.180> over<00:02:22.140> so<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.560> might

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
but we went a little over so that might

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.520 
but we went a little over so that might
have<00:02:22.890> been<00:02:23.040> two<00:02:23.870> because<00:02:24.870> we're<00:02:25.020> not<00:02:25.110> packing

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
have been two because we're not packing

have been two because we're not packing
experts<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.160> was<00:02:26.340> my<00:02:26.430> first<00:02:26.670> time<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.150> once

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
experts this was my first time and once

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.850 
experts this was my first time and once
you<00:02:27.450> have<00:02:27.540> them<00:02:27.690> all<00:02:27.870> packed<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.410> just<00:02:28.650> sleep

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
you have them all packed you just sleep

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.190 
you have them all packed you just sleep
them<00:02:29.130> somewhere<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:29.880> dry<00:02:30.360> maybe<00:02:30.840> near<00:02:31.170> a

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
them somewhere to dry maybe near a

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.780 
them somewhere to dry maybe near a
window<00:02:31.440> or<00:02:31.920> somewhere<00:02:32.280> warm

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
window or somewhere warm

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.420 
window or somewhere warm
and<00:02:32.930> leave<00:02:33.930> on<00:02:34.110> board<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.710> think<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.190> direction

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
and leave on board I think the direction

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.530 
and leave on board I think the direction
said<00:02:35.910> 24<00:02:36.660> hours<00:02:36.960> so<00:02:37.910> we're<00:02:38.910> gonna<00:02:39.240> go<00:02:39.420> with

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
said 24 hours so we're gonna go with

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.120 
said 24 hours so we're gonna go with
that<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:40.050> then<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.350> should<00:02:40.530> be<00:02:40.620> able<00:02:40.740> to<00:02:40.890> pop

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
that and then you should be able to pop

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.740 
that and then you should be able to pop
them<00:02:41.280> out<00:02:41.400> like<00:02:41.610> ice<00:02:41.880> cubes<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.510> if<00:02:42.660> you

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
them out like ice cubes and if you

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.360 
them out like ice cubes and if you
packed<00:02:42.960> them<00:02:43.080> all<00:02:43.200> enough<00:02:43.440> then<00:02:43.860> they<00:02:44.070> should

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
packed them all enough then they should

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.580 
packed them all enough then they should
stay<00:02:44.670> in<00:02:44.820> their<00:02:44.940> form<00:02:45.270> this<00:02:45.900> is<00:02:46.080> really<00:02:46.320> all<00:02:46.470> an

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
stay in their form this is really all an

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.900 
stay in their form this is really all an
experiment<00:02:46.920> so<00:02:47.340> we'll<00:02:47.460> see<00:02:47.610> how<00:02:47.760> it<00:02:47.790> goes

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
experiment so we'll see how it goes

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:48.590 
experiment so we'll see how it goes
tomorrow

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
tomorrow

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.350 
tomorrow
and<00:02:48.990> due<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.590> Sarah's<00:02:50.370> scientific<00:02:51.060> math

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
and due to Sarah's scientific math

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.650 
and due to Sarah's scientific math
calculations<00:02:52.640> when<00:02:53.640> we<00:02:53.730> calculated<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.480> cost

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
calculations when we calculated the cost

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.810 
calculations when we calculated the cost
of<00:02:55.020> all<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.260> items<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:56.010> make<00:02:56.160> this<00:02:56.430> and

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
of all the items to make this and

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.020 
of all the items to make this and
compared<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:58.380> costs<00:02:58.860> of<00:02:59.130> buying<00:02:59.790> the

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
compared it to the costs of buying the

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.720 
compared it to the costs of buying the
