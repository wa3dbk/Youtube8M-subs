bit<00:01:59.219> lower<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.909> can<00:02:00.000> usually<00:02:00.149> buy<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.509> sights

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
bit lower you can usually buy the sights

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.600 
bit lower you can usually buy the sights
for<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.200> front<00:02:01.439> sight<00:02:01.649> post<00:02:01.680> it'll<00:02:02.310> have

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
for in the front sight post it'll have

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.609 
for in the front sight post it'll have
that<00:02:02.790> difference<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:03.689> contour<00:02:04.259> with<00:02:04.469> the

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
that difference so it's contour with the

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.060 
that difference so it's contour with the
rails

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
rails

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.839 
rails
so<00:02:05.399> it's<00:02:05.520> contour<00:02:05.969> with<00:02:06.299> your<00:02:06.630> rear<00:02:06.869> sight

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
so it's contour with your rear sight

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:10.279 
so it's contour with your rear sight
because<00:02:08.849> course<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.539> know<00:02:09.660> how<00:02:10.020> these<00:02:10.110> are

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
because course you know how these are

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.420 
because course you know how these are
set<00:02:10.739> up<00:02:10.860> when<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.099> fold<00:02:11.370> them

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
set up when you fold them

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.390 
set up when you fold them
they<00:02:13.299> fit<00:02:13.840> pretty<00:02:14.079> darn<00:02:14.290> flush<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:14.980> mean<00:02:15.280> you

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
they fit pretty darn flush I mean you

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.220 
they fit pretty darn flush I mean you
know<00:02:15.519> it's<00:02:15.670> don't<00:02:16.299> take<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.450> pause<00:02:16.689> space

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
know it's don't take a pause space

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.380 
know it's don't take a pause space
you're<00:02:17.439> able<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:17.680> use<00:02:18.310> other<00:02:18.489> optics<00:02:19.000> as<00:02:19.180> an

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
you're able to use other optics as an

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.530 
you're able to use other optics as an
EOTech<00:02:19.840> on<00:02:20.500> there<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.219> you<00:02:21.579> know<00:02:21.670> it<00:02:21.760> makes<00:02:22.390> it

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
EOTech on there and you know it makes it

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.729 
EOTech on there and you know it makes it
for<00:02:22.719> a<00:02:22.780> really<00:02:23.379> really<00:02:23.980> nice<00:02:24.540> gun<00:02:25.540> backup<00:02:26.500> site

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
for a really really nice gun backup site

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.429 
for a really really nice gun backup site
or<00:02:26.950> primary<00:02:27.430> site<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.030> then<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.079> great<00:02:29.290> thing

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:29.439 
or primary site and then the great thing

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:32.399 
or primary site and then the great thing
about<00:02:29.530> these<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:30.099> you<00:02:30.340> push<00:02:30.849> this<00:02:31.209> up<00:02:31.379> sorry

push this button but as you'll see it's

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.569 
push this button but as you'll see it's
this<00:02:38.170> is<00:02:38.319> like<00:02:38.469> me<00:02:38.620> pushing<00:02:38.980> extraordinarily

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
this is like me pushing extraordinarily

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.569 
this is like me pushing extraordinarily
hard<00:02:40.269> alee<00:02:40.480> and<00:02:40.689> that<00:02:41.500> site<00:02:41.769> you<00:02:42.189> know<00:02:42.280> doesn't

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
hard alee and that site you know doesn't

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.520 
hard alee and that site you know doesn't
how<00:02:42.670> really<00:02:43.030> move<00:02:43.269> I'll<00:02:44.079> bring<00:02:44.260> it<00:02:44.379> to<00:02:44.470> the

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
how really move I'll bring it to the

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.520 
how really move I'll bring it to the
other<00:02:44.620> side<00:02:44.709> here<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.930> this<00:02:46.930> is<00:02:47.139> where<00:02:47.319> the

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
other side here and this is where the

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.000 
other side here and this is where the
locking<00:02:47.950> is<00:02:48.129> as<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.180> can<00:02:49.209> see<00:02:49.419> there's<00:02:49.599> just<00:02:49.659> a

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
locking is as you can see there's just a

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.470 
locking is as you can see there's just a
little<00:02:51.010> bit<00:02:51.250> of<00:02:51.340> wobble<00:02:51.489> there<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:52.150> then<00:02:52.329> when

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
little bit of wobble there and then when

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.089 
little bit of wobble there and then when
you're<00:02:52.599> firing<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:53.049> gun<00:02:53.200> you<00:02:53.530> know<00:02:53.620> you<00:02:53.950> don't

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
you're firing the gun you know you don't

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.559 
you're firing the gun you know you don't
even<00:02:54.220> notice<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:54.760> wobble<00:02:55.090> there's<00:02:55.269> not

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
even notice the wobble there's not

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.709 
even notice the wobble there's not
enough<00:02:55.930> recoil<00:02:56.409> for<00:02:56.650> that<00:02:56.769> stuff<00:02:57.040> to<00:02:57.189> wobble

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:57.719 
enough recoil for that stuff to wobble

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:02.520 
enough recoil for that stuff to wobble
and<00:02:58.719> when<00:02:59.709> you<00:02:59.769> push<00:03:00.010> in<00:03:00.129> that<00:03:00.280> other<00:03:00.430> side<00:03:01.530> you

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
and when you push in that other side you

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.379 
and when you push in that other side you
see<00:03:02.709> how<00:03:02.799> it<00:03:02.889> pushes<00:03:03.129> that<00:03:03.400> out<00:03:03.609> that<00:03:04.060> allows

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
see how it pushes that out that allows

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:06.080 
see how it pushes that out that allows
you<00:03:04.569> to<00:03:04.780> fold<00:03:05.290> it<00:03:05.500> down

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
you to fold it down

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.209 
you to fold it down
and<00:03:07.090> then<00:03:07.299> when<00:03:08.139> you<00:03:08.230> open<00:03:08.500> it<00:03:08.530> up<00:03:08.650> it<00:03:08.919> locks

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:09.219 
and then when you open it up it locks

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:16.349 
and then when you open it up it locks
with<00:03:10.030> those<00:03:11.159> very<00:03:13.500> very<00:03:14.700> very<00:03:15.700> neat<00:03:16.150> thing<00:03:16.329> to

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
with those very very very neat thing to

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.020 
with those very very very neat thing to
do<00:03:16.629> and<00:03:17.040> these<00:03:18.040> were<00:03:18.250> actually<00:03:18.549> purchased

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
do and these were actually purchased

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.490 
do and these were actually purchased
from<00:03:19.120> spikes<00:03:19.449> tactual<00:03:19.989> that's<00:03:20.169> why<00:03:20.260> they<00:03:20.379> have

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
from spikes tactual that's why they have

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.589 
from spikes tactual that's why they have

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
them especially the HK style it makes it

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.760 
them especially the HK style it makes it
the<00:04:58.740> AR<00:04:59.330> acquisition<00:05:00.330> so<00:05:00.810> much<00:05:01.020> faster<00:05:01.620> it's

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
the AR acquisition so much faster it's

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.790 
the AR acquisition so much faster it's
ridiculous<00:05:02.400> I<00:05:02.670> mean<00:05:03.510> I<00:05:03.570> just<00:05:03.630> just<00:05:04.140> haven't

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
popped up and it just makes it so much

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.630 
popped up and it just makes it so much
easier<00:05:08.070> compared<00:05:08.880> to<00:05:08.970> your<00:05:09.930> standard<00:05:10.640> ar-15

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
easier compared to your standard ar-15
