I<00:02:13.840> very<00:02:14.140> much<00:02:14.200> doubt<00:02:14.590> it<00:02:14.800> i<00:02:14.890> think<00:02:15.099> that<00:02:15.220> the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
I very much doubt it i think that the

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.220 
I very much doubt it i think that the
United<00:02:15.640> States<00:02:15.670> is<00:02:16.120> showing<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:16.660> it<00:02:16.810> had<00:02:17.020> its

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
United States is showing that it had its

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.589 
United States is showing that it had its

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
its geopolitical stands in the long run

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.620 
its geopolitical stands in the long run
fails<00:02:20.319> they<00:02:21.099> have<00:02:21.430> installed<00:02:22.120> puppet

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
fails they have installed puppet

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.780 
fails they have installed puppet
governments<00:02:23.200> throughout<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:24.160> whole<00:02:24.280> region

governments throughout the whole region

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.150 
governments throughout the whole region
very<00:02:25.180> very<00:02:25.510> much<00:02:25.750> specifically<00:02:26.650> in<00:02:26.800> Egypt

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
very very much specifically in Egypt

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.309 
very very much specifically in Egypt
with<00:02:27.370> after<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.060> assassination<00:02:28.750> of

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
with after the assassination of

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.410 
with after the assassination of
President<00:02:29.770> Sadat<00:02:30.099> with<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.790> fullest<00:02:31.239> support

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
to hosni mubarak who has now gone and I

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.180 
to hosni mubarak who has now gone and I
think<00:02:35.110> that<00:02:35.319> we<00:02:35.410> have<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.650> understand<00:02:36.130> that

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
think that we have to understand that

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.979 
think that we have to understand that
what<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.459> United<00:02:36.610> States<00:02:36.790> now<00:02:37.360> i<00:02:37.390> believe<00:02:37.720> is

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
what the United States now i believe is

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.070 
what the United States now i believe is
trying<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.410> achieve<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:39.730> way<00:02:40.599> to<00:02:40.660> promote

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
trying to achieve is a way to promote

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.140 
trying to achieve is a way to promote
change<00:02:41.650> in<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.250> way<00:02:42.489> that<00:02:42.760> will<00:02:42.910> facilitate

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
change in a way that will facilitate

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.050 
change in a way that will facilitate
things<00:02:43.870> for<00:02:44.230> them<00:02:44.410> at<00:02:45.190> this<00:02:45.430> one<00:02:45.670> point<00:02:45.880> that

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
things for them at this one point that

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.850 
things for them at this one point that
thing<00:02:46.180> is<00:02:46.299> worth<00:02:46.330> making<00:02:46.750> here<00:02:47.200> we<00:02:47.530> shouldn't

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
thing is worth making here we shouldn't

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.890 
thing is worth making here we shouldn't
think<00:02:48.040> so<00:02:48.160> much<00:02:48.340> in<00:02:48.670> terms<00:02:48.850> of<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.450> United

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
think so much in terms of the United

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.809 
think so much in terms of the United
States<00:02:49.930> does<00:02:50.590> this<00:02:50.860> or<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.220> United<00:02:51.580> States

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819

of<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.030> united<00:03:22.329> states<00:03:22.600> so<00:03:22.720> i<00:03:22.780> think<00:03:22.840> we<00:03:23.350> have

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
of the united states so i think we have

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.110 
of the united states so i think we have
to<00:03:23.560> be<00:03:23.590> very<00:03:23.769> careful<00:03:24.070> when<00:03:24.370> we<00:03:24.549> speak<00:03:24.880> of<00:03:25.000> the

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
to be very careful when we speak of the

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.840 
to be very careful when we speak of the

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
Washington not even ask Obama or bush

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.460 
Washington not even ask Obama or bush
before<00:03:30.340> him<00:03:30.760> but<00:03:31.180> rather<00:03:31.390> at<00:03:31.630> what<00:03:31.870> we<00:03:32.200> have<00:03:32.350> to
