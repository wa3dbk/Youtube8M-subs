00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
so basically and you get it from mining

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.980 
so basically and you get it from mining
smelting<00:01:54.370> and<00:01:54.460> breeding<00:01:54.640> which<00:01:54.910> is<00:01:55.090> all<00:01:55.270> in

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
smelting and breeding which is all in

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.230 
smelting and breeding which is all in
the<00:01:56.140> pc<00:01:56.440> version<00:01:56.470> i'm<00:01:56.920> pretty<00:01:57.100> sure<00:01:57.310> and

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
the pc version i'm pretty sure and

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.540 
the pc version i'm pretty sure and
basically<00:01:59.140> they<00:01:59.320> did<00:01:59.500> 30<00:01:59.770> and<00:01:59.950> not<00:02:00.040> 50<00:02:00.310> which<00:02:00.460> i

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
basically they did 30 and not 50 which i

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.100 
basically they did 30 and not 50 which i
think<00:02:00.610> is<00:02:00.820> a<00:02:00.880> very<00:02:01.120> cool<00:02:01.540> because<00:02:01.780> it'll<00:02:02.020> be<00:02:02.050> a

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
think is a very cool because it'll be a

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.690 
think is a very cool because it'll be a
little<00:02:02.230> faster<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:02.860> rank<00:02:03.040> up<00:02:03.220> and<00:02:03.490> a<00:02:03.550> little

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
little faster to rank up and a little

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.700 
little faster to rank up and a little
