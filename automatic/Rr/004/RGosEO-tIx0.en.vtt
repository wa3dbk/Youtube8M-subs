00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
hero factory so that is what he's going

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.950 
hero factory so that is what he's going
to<00:01:07.080> try<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.380> do<00:01:08.060> since<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.450> break-up<00:01:09.900> happened

easily swipe in front of him and the
whole<00:03:05.280> little<00:03:05.580> line<00:03:05.820> will<00:03:06.090> be<00:03:06.210> burnt<00:03:06.570> up<00:03:06.780> or

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
whole little line will be burnt up or

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.730 
whole little line will be burnt up or
destroyed

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
destroyed

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.250

so<00:03:10.740> those<00:03:11.640> Iraq<00:03:12.000> Nick's<00:03:12.300> drones<00:03:12.750> are<00:03:12.960> a<00:03:12.990> real

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
so those Iraq Nick's drones are a real

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:20.660 
so those Iraq Nick's drones are a real
pest<00:03:13.800> as<00:03:14.610> he<00:03:14.820> likes<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.180> say<00:03:17.600> so<00:03:18.600> he's<00:03:19.670> very

he's got this silver part right here on
his<00:03:34.410> back<00:03:34.680> that<00:03:35.540> actually<00:03:36.540> connected<00:03:37.320> with

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
his back that actually connected with

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.880 
his back that actually connected with
just<00:03:37.830> a<00:03:38.040> simple<00:03:38.340> pin<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:40.110> connected<00:03:40.680> right

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
just a simple pin and connected right

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.980 
just a simple pin and connected right
here<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:42.530> voila<00:03:43.970> there<00:03:44.970> you<00:03:45.030> go<00:03:45.240> armor<00:03:45.870> to

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
here and voila there you go armor to

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.200 
here and voila there you go armor to
cover<00:03:46.200> up<00:03:46.380> his<00:03:46.530> back<00:03:46.740> then<00:03:47.550> I<00:03:47.640> added<00:03:47.910> this

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
cover up his back then I added this

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.830 
cover up his back then I added this
right<00:03:48.450> here<00:03:48.720> which<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.370> jetpack<00:03:51.000> that<00:03:51.720> he

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
right here which is a jetpack that he

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.220 
right here which is a jetpack that he
can<00:03:52.050> use<00:03:52.320> to<00:03:52.350> be<00:03:53.310> able<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.550> run<00:03:53.820> very<00:03:54.330> fast<00:03:54.720> or

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
can use to be able to run very fast or

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.560 
can use to be able to run very fast or
to<00:03:55.770> jump<00:03:56.240> or<00:03:57.240> to<00:03:57.600> just<00:03:57.840> move<00:03:58.740> around<00:03:58.890> quickly

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
to jump or to just move around quickly

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.500 
to jump or to just move around quickly
it's<00:04:00.570> very<00:04:00.900> useful<00:04:01.830> and<00:04:02.040> very<00:04:02.580> convenient<00:04:03.240> in

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
it's very useful and very convenient in

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.920 
it's very useful and very convenient in
his<00:04:03.630> opinion<00:04:04.020> it's<00:04:04.800> very<00:04:05.190> cool<00:04:06.150> I'd<00:04:06.660> have<00:04:06.810> to

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
his opinion it's very cool I'd have to

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.630 
his opinion it's very cool I'd have to
say<00:04:07.110> and<00:04:08.720> since<00:04:09.720> he<00:04:09.900> is<00:04:09.930> biomechanical<00:04:10.640> he

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
say and since he is biomechanical he

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.440 
say and since he is biomechanical he
does<00:04:11.880> have<00:04:12.240> to<00:04:12.540> rest<00:04:13.250> but<00:04:14.250> he<00:04:14.640> could<00:04:14.820> also<00:04:14.970> use

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
does have to rest but he could also use

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.870 
does have to rest but he could also use
his<00:04:15.750> hero<00:04:16.049> core<00:04:16.380> to<00:04:16.830> give<00:04:17.010> him<00:04:17.130> some<00:04:17.370> energy

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
his hero core to give him some energy

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.140 
his hero core to give him some energy
boosts<00:04:18.390> so<00:04:19.200> he<00:04:19.350> can<00:04:19.560> continue<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.220> move

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
boosts so he can continue to move

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.090 
boosts so he can continue to move
and<00:04:21.320> continue<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.440> battle<00:04:22.860> if<00:04:23.070> need<00:04:23.610> be<00:04:24.530> but<00:04:25.530> he

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
and continue to battle if need be but he

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.600 
and continue to battle if need be but he
usually<00:04:26.610> prefers<00:04:27.300> rest<00:04:27.810> and<00:04:28.530> gives<00:04:29.190> him<00:04:29.400> all

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
usually prefers rest and gives him all

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.060 
usually prefers rest and gives him all
ready<00:04:30.180> for<00:04:30.270> anything<00:04:31.080> and<00:04:33.860> one<00:04:34.860> of<00:04:34.949> the

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
ready for anything and one of the

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.219 
ready for anything and one of the
coolest<00:04:35.820> features<00:04:35.940> in<00:04:36.449> my<00:04:36.600> opinion<00:04:36.960> about

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
coolest features in my opinion about

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:44.439 
coolest features in my opinion about
this<00:04:37.820> is<00:04:39.229> his<00:04:40.229> helmet<00:04:41.010> or<00:04:41.720> mask<00:04:42.720> if<00:04:43.139> you<00:04:43.530> are

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
this is his helmet or mask if you are

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.890 
this is his helmet or mask if you are
more<00:04:45.449> known<00:04:45.900> as<00:04:46.080> a<00:04:46.110> Bionicle<00:04:46.800> fan<00:04:47.090> and<00:04:48.090> the

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
more known as a Bionicle fan and the

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:56.110 
more known as a Bionicle fan and the
kanohi<00:04:49.680> how<00:04:52.280> so<00:04:53.280> it's<00:04:53.970> a<00:04:54.060> very<00:04:54.360> iconic

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.689 
kanohi how so it's a very iconic
Bionicle<00:04:57.120> symbol<00:04:58.130> probably<00:04:59.130> one<00:04:59.310> of<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.460> most

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
Bionicle symbol probably one of the most

Bionicle symbol probably one of the most
known<00:05:00.350> in<00:05:01.350> the<00:05:02.070> history<00:05:02.520> of<00:05:02.550> Bionicle<00:05:04.370> and<00:05:05.930> as

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
you can see I like to incorporate

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.689 
you can see I like to incorporate
Bionicle<00:05:10.350> elements<00:05:10.830> into<00:05:11.070> the<00:05:11.190> hero<00:05:11.430> factory

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
Bionicle elements into the hero factory

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.939 
Bionicle elements into the hero factory
mocks<00:05:12.180> that<00:05:12.389> I<00:05:12.479> make<00:05:12.660> like<00:05:13.470> I've<00:05:13.680> said<00:05:13.889> before

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
mocks that I make like I've said before

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.980 
mocks that I make like I've said before
it's<00:05:14.550> just<00:05:15.590> makes<00:05:16.590> it<00:05:16.740> look<00:05:17.010> cool<00:05:17.370> and

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
whenever I use them I try to make it

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.870 
whenever I use them I try to make it
work<00:05:20.760> and<00:05:21.180> my<00:05:21.990> opinion<00:05:22.430> this<00:05:23.430> one<00:05:23.699> really

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
work and my opinion this one really

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.440 
work and my opinion this one really
worked<00:05:24.180> out<00:05:24.590> put<00:05:25.590> the<00:05:25.740> sword<00:05:26.099> I<00:05:26.310> use<00:05:26.970> the<00:05:27.150> idea

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
worked out put the sword I use the idea

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.480 
worked out put the sword I use the idea
from<00:05:28.220> one<00:05:29.220> of<00:05:29.400> the<00:05:29.750> glatorian<00:05:30.750> but<00:05:31.740> added<00:05:32.160> the

from one of the glatorian but added the

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.879 
from one of the glatorian but added the
new<00:05:33.380> Tahu's<00:05:34.669> blade<00:05:35.669> right<00:05:35.970> here<00:05:36.710> and<00:05:37.710> right

new Tahu's blade right here and right
here<00:05:38.160> I<00:05:38.190> just<00:05:38.639> used<00:05:39.450> one<00:05:39.750> of<00:05:39.780> these<00:05:39.900> Bionicle

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
here I just used one of these Bionicle

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.710 
here I just used one of these Bionicle
shields<00:05:41.039> and<00:05:41.190> got<00:05:41.370> one<00:05:41.610> of<00:05:41.700> these<00:05:41.789> these<00:05:42.150> disks

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
shields and got one of these these disks
