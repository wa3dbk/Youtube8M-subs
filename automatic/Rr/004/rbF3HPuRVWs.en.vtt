00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
yourself invulnerable and maybe even

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.180 
yourself invulnerable and maybe even
have<00:04:33.270> bro<00:04:33.479> spawning<00:04:33.810> but<00:04:34.110> really<00:04:34.830> you're<00:04:35.160> not

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
have bro spawning but really you're not

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.129 
have bro spawning but really you're not
gonna<00:04:35.340> die<00:04:35.580> and<00:04:35.850> then<00:04:36.360> there<00:04:36.539> you<00:04:36.660> go<00:04:36.840> you<00:04:36.900> can

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
gonna die and then there you go you can

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.810 
gonna die and then there you go you can
walk<00:04:37.260> through<00:04:37.560> and<00:04:37.979> depending<00:04:38.370> on<00:04:38.430> what<00:04:38.610> map

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
walk through and depending on what map

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.850 
walk through and depending on what map
it<00:04:39.000> is<00:04:39.120> and<00:04:39.449> what<00:04:40.050> objective<00:04:40.500> points<00:04:40.770> you're

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
it is and what objective points you're

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.089 
it is and what objective points you're
able<00:04:41.250> to<00:04:41.340> spot<00:04:41.610> put<00:04:42.150> down<00:04:42.330> for<00:04:42.570> vehicles

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:45.500 
able to spot put down for vehicles
you'll<00:04:44.099> either<00:04:44.250> have<00:04:44.490> to<00:04:44.669> spawn<00:04:44.880> yourself<00:04:45.270> as

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
you'll either have to spawn yourself as

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.219 
you'll either have to spawn yourself as
a<00:04:46.280> forge<00:04:47.280> monitor<00:04:47.729> or<00:04:48.360> you<00:04:48.539> can<00:04:48.690> go<00:04:48.840> around<00:04:48.960> in

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
a forge monitor or you can go around in

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:50.839 
a forge monitor or you can go around in
different<00:04:49.320> vehicles<00:04:49.889> and<00:04:49.979> have<00:04:50.130> some<00:04:50.370> style
