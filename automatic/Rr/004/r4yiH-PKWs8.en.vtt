00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.820
 hello and welcome to earth because this 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.920
 today to let the new 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.629
 renault zoÃ© is to ask two for 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.690
 zero emissions since this vehicle all 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.690
 electric 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.760
 the electric motor with behind the 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.820
 renault logo took it to reload the 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.820
 vehicle 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.810
 just 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.360
 the area that wants to be futuristic you 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.360
 arrive at the colleges 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.520
 as the retrovision also a 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.520
 sitting and comfortable 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.460
 a pretty operating silence 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.460
 remarkable 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.400
 and what is small when braking is 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.140
 that you recover some energy 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.269
 which allows to extend the autonomy of the 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.290
 vehicle that is in the order of 160 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:49.090
 kilometers behind the wheel for 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.890
 find a digital display that said 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.599
 more more information 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.609
 important was of course that 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.939
 left in this case the other half 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.939
 remaining 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:05.110
 we just started the vehicle and you 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.180
 do not hear any noise and if the p 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:12.030
 parking brake loan walk 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.030
 neutral back or even machhad 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.240
 in a functioning silence 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:23.890
 always so nice so what 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:26.890
 you see left back is when 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.890
 we use the battery if ge accelerates a 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.420
 little I release the accelerator 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.140
 it becomes blue that's it 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.140
 energy recovery 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:43.600
 to note that the digital display and 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:46.270
 customizable to return to 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.560
 much simpler things breaks to the 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.560
 command that is located at burps 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.000
 find here the airlink system with 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.290
 phone you can forgive connect 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.070
 your blue tooth phone you have 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.070
 the radio obviously 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.379
 and you find below a catch 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.590
 jack 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:12.819
 a port and best sd and usb plug 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.209
 with the cigarette lighter that right there the 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.030
 air conditioning 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.870
 obviously heating that solicits a 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.940
 little more battery 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:25.860
 to note the eco2 driving menu here and if 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.860
 tells you the result of your trip 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.479
 to optimize the load volume 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.680
 of the chest 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.350
 renault preferred to put the batteries 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.030
 below the rear seat this 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.350
 which allows to have a chest more than 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.630
 reasonable in particular to leave in 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.720
 holidays even though the electric has its 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.720
 limitations 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.090
 nozoe so a real car a little too much 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:55.340
 futuristic may be in the eyes of some 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.020
 which offers a proper autonomy for a 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.500
 price against very attractive by 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.500
 compared to the competition 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.900
 display in this finish around the 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.490
 22000 euros it will take a cost 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.370
 total of fifteen thousand five hundred one time 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:12.510
 that state aid is deducted from 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.370
 what is added for example 79 euros per 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:18.560
 month of battery rental with a 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.560
 mileage of 2500 kilometers annually 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.509
 A big thank you to the whole team 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:28.220
 marketing renault luxembourg for the 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:29.930
 vehicle loan and you will find 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.319
 as usual the photos to that the
