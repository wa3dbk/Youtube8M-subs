tile now the X tile is a dryland

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.490 
tile now the X tile is a dryland
flooring<00:00:09.389> tile<00:00:09.570> but<00:00:10.080> it's<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.230> little<00:00:10.349> bit

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
flooring tile but it's a little bit

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.390 
flooring tile but it's a little bit
different<00:00:10.769> than<00:00:10.860> maybe<00:00:10.920> some<00:00:11.130> of<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.280> other

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
different than maybe some of the other

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.430 
different than maybe some of the other
dryland<00:00:11.759> flooring<00:00:12.030> tiles<00:00:12.240> that<00:00:12.990> you've<00:00:13.200> seen

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
dryland flooring tiles that you've seen

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.350 
dryland flooring tiles that you've seen
out<00:00:13.590> there<00:00:13.620> one<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.610> main<00:00:14.759> features<00:00:15.000> is

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
out there one of the main features is

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.880 
out there one of the main features is
that<00:00:15.690> they're<00:00:15.839> huge<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.320> always<00:00:16.529> say<00:00:16.650> bigger

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
that they're huge I always say bigger

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.410 
that they're huge I always say bigger
the<00:00:17.039> better<00:00:17.160> with<00:00:17.490> dryland<00:00:17.880> flooring<00:00:18.150> tiles

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
the better with dryland flooring tiles

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.510 
the better with dryland flooring tiles
is<00:00:18.539> just<00:00:18.720> because<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.529> fewer<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.980> seems<00:00:20.250> the

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
is just because the fewer the seems the

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.890 
is just because the fewer the seems the
more<00:00:20.699> smooth<00:00:21.029> surface<00:00:21.420> you're<00:00:21.539> going<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.750> have

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
more smooth surface you're going to have

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.349 
more smooth surface you're going to have
and<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:23.160> flatter<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.550> pucks<00:00:23.820> gonna<00:00:24.000> lay<00:00:24.119> for

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
and the flatter the pucks gonna lay for

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.480 
and the flatter the pucks gonna lay for
you<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:24.720> these<00:00:24.840> are<00:00:25.019> 2<00:00:25.500> feet<00:00:25.710> by<00:00:25.890> 2<00:00:25.920> feet<00:00:26.130> that's

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
you so these are 2 feet by 2 feet that's

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.089 
you so these are 2 feet by 2 feet that's
24<00:00:27.060> inches<00:00:27.210> by<00:00:27.300> 24<00:00:27.660> inches<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.590> it's<00:00:28.710> really

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
24 inches by 24 inches so it's really

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.540 
24 inches by 24 inches so it's really
big<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:30.529> one<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.679> things<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:31.949> really<00:00:32.369> like

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
big and one of the things I really like

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.790 
big and one of the things I really like
about<00:00:32.579> these<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.930> they're<00:00:34.140> easy<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.620> snap

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
about these is that they're easy to snap

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.680 
about these is that they're easy to snap
together<00:00:35.100> but<00:00:35.700> they're<00:00:35.820> also<00:00:36.000> easy<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.480> take

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
together but they're also easy to take

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.540 
together but they're also easy to take
apart<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.530> means<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:38.070> changing

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
apart so that means that changing

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.549 
apart so that means that changing
configurations<00:00:39.180> or<00:00:39.420> moving<00:00:40.140> them<00:00:40.260> from<00:00:40.350> one

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
configurations or moving them from one

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.080 
configurations or moving them from one
location<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:41.010> another<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.460> always<00:00:41.940> going<00:00:42.059> to

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
location to another is always going to

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.880 
location to another is always going to
be<00:00:42.180> really<00:00:42.510> easy<00:00:42.719> they<00:00:42.960> go<00:00:43.110> together<00:00:43.230> take

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
be really easy they go together take

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.369 
be really easy they go together take
apart<00:00:44.190> real<00:00:44.700> simple<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.780> addition<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.260> those

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
apart real simple in addition to those

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.049 
apart real simple in addition to those
two<00:00:46.440> features<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.190> main<00:00:47.430> thing<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.730> really

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
see I started by mapping out the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.630 
see I started by mapping out the
configuration<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.950> was<00:01:08.070> going<00:01:08.310> for<00:01:08.490> with

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
together before I started snapping

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.050 
together before I started snapping
things<00:01:13.470> into<00:01:13.710> place<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.520> I'm<00:01:14.760> not<00:01:14.850> going<00:01:14.970> to

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
things into place so I'm not going to

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.580

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
go ahead and speed it up and that way we

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.120 
go ahead and speed it up and that way we
can<00:01:18.630> kind<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.380> show<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.619> what<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.860> looks<00:01:19.979> like

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
put together you can see it's quite

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.570 
put together you can see it's quite
large<00:02:42.570> this<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:42.840> two<00:02:43.110> boxes<00:02:43.320> worth<00:02:43.709> I'm<00:02:43.950> using

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
large this is two boxes worth I'm using

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.880 
large this is two boxes worth I'm using
a<00:02:44.790> five<00:02:45.060> by<00:02:45.360> three<00:02:45.390> tile<00:02:45.840> setup<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:46.620> it's<00:02:46.769> about

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
a five by three tile setup so it's about

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.820 
a five by three tile setup so it's about
15<00:02:47.250> tiles<00:02:47.430> total<00:02:47.850> I've<00:02:48.780> got<00:02:48.930> one<00:02:49.230> extra<00:02:49.410> there

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
15 tiles total I've got one extra there

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.560 
15 tiles total I've got one extra there
didn't<00:02:50.459> use<00:02:50.610> it<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:51.650> these<00:02:52.650> are<00:02:52.769> some<00:02:52.890> of<00:02:52.950> the

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
didn't use it and these are some of the

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.940 
didn't use it and these are some of the
auxilary<00:02:54.570> things<00:02:55.080> that<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.320> can<00:02:55.440> do<00:02:55.560> with<00:02:55.739> it

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
auxilary things that you can do with it

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.800 
auxilary things that you can do with it
so<00:02:56.100> you<00:02:56.519> can<00:02:56.580> see<00:02:56.790> we've<00:02:56.940> got<00:02:56.970> our<00:02:57.120> X<00:02:57.330> saucer

so you can see we've got our X saucer

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.830 
so you can see we've got our X saucer
setup<00:02:58.140> here<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:59.190> links<00:02:59.580> right<00:02:59.880> into<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.540> X

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
setup here and it links right into the X

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.660 
setup here and it links right into the X
tiles<00:03:01.080> so<00:03:01.980> that's<00:03:02.130> really<00:03:02.310> cool

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670

we'll<00:03:02.820> show<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.120> what<00:03:03.720> that<00:03:03.870> looks<00:03:04.050> like<00:03:04.110> in

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
we'll show you what that looks like in

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.860 
we'll show you what that looks like in
action<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.970> then<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.269> can<00:03:06.390> also<00:03:06.540> pick<00:03:06.840> up

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
action and then you can also pick up

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.400 
action and then you can also pick up
these<00:03:07.459> X<00:03:08.459> tile<00:03:08.940> pockets<00:03:09.540> in<00:03:09.720> these<00:03:10.080> X<00:03:10.260> tile

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
these X tile pockets in these X tile

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.540 
these X tile pockets in these X tile
pockets<00:03:10.890> we'll<00:03:11.850> hold<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.480> X<00:03:13.010> deviator<00:03:14.010> this

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
pockets we'll hold the X deviator this

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.729 
pockets we'll hold the X deviator this
is<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.760> X<00:03:14.880> deviator<00:03:15.239> mini<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:15.720> we'll<00:03:16.650> be

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
is the X deviator mini and we'll be

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.710 
is the X deviator mini and we'll be
using<00:03:16.830> that<00:03:17.010> as<00:03:17.280> well<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.670> then<00:03:18.330> you<00:03:18.390> can<00:03:18.600> also

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
using that as well and then you can also

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.290 
using that as well and then you can also
get<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.110> X<00:03:19.290> tiles<00:03:19.560> Pasir<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.790> this<00:03:21.150> is

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
get the X tiles Pasir and this is

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.660 
get the X tiles Pasir and this is
another<00:03:21.769> passing<00:03:22.769> rebounder<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:23.370> can<00:03:23.489> kind

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
another passing rebounder you can kind

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.660 
another passing rebounder you can kind
of<00:03:23.730> see<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.000> there<00:03:24.209> and<00:03:24.920> again<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.220> integrates

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
of see it there and again it integrates

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.520 
of see it there and again it integrates
right<00:03:26.910> in<00:03:27.030> with<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.300> tiles<00:03:27.570> so<00:03:28.050> it<00:03:28.140> all<00:03:28.260> snaps

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
right in with the tiles so it all snaps

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.860 
right in with the tiles so it all snaps

black dot paint in the middle the idea

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.700 
black dot paint in the middle the idea
is<00:04:43.570> you<00:04:43.690> get<00:04:43.780> used<00:04:44.020> to<00:04:44.080> seeing<00:04:44.170> a<00:04:44.410> smaller

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
is you get used to seeing a smaller

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.920 
is you get used to seeing a smaller
black<00:04:44.920> dot<00:04:45.160> and<00:04:45.430> then<00:04:45.970> when<00:04:46.270> you<00:04:46.390> jump<00:04:46.780> back<00:04:46.900> up

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
black dot and then when you jump back up

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.020 
black dot and then when you jump back up
to<00:04:47.170> the<00:04:47.260> full<00:04:47.380> size<00:04:47.590> puck<00:04:47.860> that's<00:04:48.700> all<00:04:48.850> black

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
to the full size puck that's all black

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.480 
to the full size puck that's all black
then<00:04:49.690> the<00:04:50.410> puck<00:04:50.560> seems<00:04:50.770> a<00:04:50.830> lot<00:04:50.950> bigger<00:04:51.160> for<00:04:51.400> you
