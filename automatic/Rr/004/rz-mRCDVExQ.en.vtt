00:06:06.739 --> 00:06:06.749 
how deep it actually is but that's

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:08.749 
how deep it actually is but that's

a shower in and actually the little drop
off<00:06:11.819> is<00:06:11.939> probably<00:06:12.299> about<00:06:12.479> three<00:06:12.839> inches<00:06:13.199> here

00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:13.439
