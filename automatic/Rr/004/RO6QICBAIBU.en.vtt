00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:13.759
 antiseptics 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.730
 limits lead to which we already 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.519
 talked 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:18.519
 we talked about the need 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.519
 close it under elimination 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.919
 his plan 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:25.539
 for he 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.659
 which works on twitter 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:30.009
 20 degrees 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.220
 that's about which 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.530
 applied to the surface inside 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.290
 after 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.290
 antiseptic impregnation 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.090
 protects the surface 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.920
 surface dilemma from pollution 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.840
 so the actions of the authorities 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.230
 on such a data basis 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.940
 it is so but here based 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.920
 excavation site 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.809
 in exmo but here we are new and after 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.609
 drying forms quite firmly 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.700
 close friend paloma of that film 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.110
 which allows you to protect dependent on 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.100
 protocol department 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.289
 if this plan is not on the track 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:09.680
 can say that 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.050
 it dries quickly 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.350
 and not available 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.340
 yes he really has practically no 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.810
 smell and pretty quickly swell already 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.630
 second saturday on saturday 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.770
 chili stadinchuk ability 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.920
 Kirovsk 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.920
 What is the layout of the composition of the photo 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.290
 one face it while you can cover 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.110
 square 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.110
 70 kopecks 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.110
 one of the frequently asked questions 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.970
 Wednesday 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.740
 opening up 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.440
 antiseptic no they together 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.900
 at buyers 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.570
 chambers of congress 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.690
 it is quite popular 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.840
 delusion very many believe that 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.330
 any topcoat thief carpets 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.120
 which 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.910
 it contains greece 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.710
 enough 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.620
 however, it already seemed that it was not 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.160
 So 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.950
 the fact is that mold fungi spores 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.659
 because they are quite aggressive they can 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.000
 penetrate to a sufficient depth 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.960
 impurities 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.450
 calmly develop under a layer 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.860
 shop around finish coatings 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.339
 decorative 

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:13.900
 therefore necessarily 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.119
 impregnation antiseptic 1 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:18.499
 and then after drying we can 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:19.779
 already 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:20.979
 finishing decorative 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:21.859
 coating 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:25.009
 if there held held greece 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:27.769
 poor coverage then this means that they 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:28.809
 guard their own 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:31.869
 finish coating 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:33.439
 is defined 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:36.439
 own security service 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:42.359
 if i capital 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.499
 on these funds for what then me 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:47.119
 spit expert 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:50.170
 the fact is that all mortal antiseptics 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.099
 prone dropout 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:53.539
 and we have to 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:56.109
 protect first of all here you are 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.669
 antiseptic 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:00.169
 among other things 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.789
 as usual cause covered 

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:05.479
 film and cup waterproof 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:07.549
 with the bank of a jail, it saves you 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.639
 pollution year like 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:12.799
 everyone is sitting in these networks 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.629
 try them freedoms 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.680
 and in order to avoid this profile 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.959
 which shortens the term 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.889
 specific protection 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.019
 in order to 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.090
 and keep the life of the RF network r less 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.679
 200 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:28.720
 calmly 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.529
 with a lesson at 10 12 years 

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:33.729
 covered with film coating which 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:35.269
 protects car loans 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.949
 also care for 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:39.929
 inside the bath is quite comfortable 

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:41.289
 as reduced 

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:43.049
 Purovsky zpk wood 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.529
 and she is already sudden 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:47.049
 at the peak of retirement 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.629
 scheme to work 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:50.329
 steam room 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.579
 how effective will it be 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.019
 let's remind the steam room really 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.239
 as it is a weak link 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.949
 and here is another bath or sauna 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:02.579
 please antiseptic volume 200 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:03.830
 can handle everything 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.450
 he died in the sauna and he perfectly serves not 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.040
 collapses in high conditions 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.279
 temperature but went out on the street 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:12.169
 growth only cover 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:15.249
 reason to win saunas 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:17.819
 in principle it is possible but it should 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:19.319
 take into account the fact that 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:22.210
 this is soft films of poor coating 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.280
 speech wear out pretty quickly 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.800
 goes about reverse contributions and therefore 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.409
 it may be worth updating more often 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:30.469
 coating 

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:33.469
 and so it is quite possible 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.020
 either choose 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.189
 from another composition 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:44.389
 more resistant 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.669
 more solid film more satellite 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.129
 brazil 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:50.210
 and when the question arises what 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.069
 guys in the steam room high temperature 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:54.729
 here we can say that does not happen 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.080
 wins and crafts and temperature 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.240
 new ipatovka and at the same level as the floor 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.979
 if there are 100 degrees there it doesnâ€™t mean that 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:04.860
 wooden floor heat to such 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:05.529
 temperatures 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:07.919
 most likely in the parade will take such 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.199
 products 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:10.809
 or 50 

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:12.430
 although under the ceiling 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.180
 all 120 minutes besides 60 and of course his actions 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.249
 complete drying we can proceed 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:24.159
 finishing stage of processing our bath 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:26.029
 and saunas 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:29.169
 lats for baths and saunas are not available and he us on 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.929
 3 new basis he has almost no 

00:05:31.929 --> 00:05:33.439
 the smell 

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:34.719
 looks like 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:37.579
 whitish but after drying it becomes 

00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:39.449
 completely transparent 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:41.169
 before applying it to the surface 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.520
 wood follows carefully for 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.969
 mix 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:47.770
 wood must be dry and clean 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.770
 do not contain old paint residue 

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:54.719
 song not flu kn if available on wood 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:57.319
 mold and mildew should be treated 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:00.710
 wood bleach or less than 500 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.430
 there is no dirt on our wood 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.710
 no remnants of old paint 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.720
 so we can proceed to 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.830
 processing 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.819
 lagged on the surface 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:11.939
 wood 

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:14.309
 can be in several ways 

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:16.960
 brush roller or spray 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.289
 if my composition was applied 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:20.650
 spray 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.119
 something pre 

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:23.979
 would water it 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:26.639
 no more than 10 percent 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:29.639
 we chose the brush synthetic box 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.789
 and gently apply the composition along the fibers 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:36.099
 to the surface of the wood 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:39.009
 on wood the composition looks whitish but 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:40.939
 after drying it will become completely 

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:43.779
 transparent and we will see the texture 

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:44.900
 wood 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.780
 ambient temperature and 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.740
 me wood temperature 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.050
 should not be lower than plus 5 degrees 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.099
 the first layer dries over three hours 

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:58.550
 and after that we can apply 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.409
 subsequent layer 

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:02.199
 lag the surface 

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:04.550
 recommended in 2 3 layers 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.009
 surface appearance 

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:08.690
 will improve if after application and drying 

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.610
 first layer 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.830
 we slightly polish the surface and remove 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.740
 pl 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.399
 immediately after completion of work 

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:20.399
 Rinse instruments with plain water. 

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:23.080
 here we see a whitish film on 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.960
 wood surface 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.270
 after drying it will become transparent 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.639
 and in three hours we can put a second 

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:31.479
 layer 

00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:34.610
 if the composition gets on the skin 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.169
 rinse it thoroughly with water 

00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:38.710
 should use customized 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.669
 safety glasses and gloves
