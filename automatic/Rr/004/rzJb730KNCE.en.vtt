00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.479 
know from all sides angles and
what-have-you<00:00:49.079> but<00:00:49.260> when<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.890> look<00:00:50.070> at<00:00:50.219> some

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
what-have-you but when you look at some

what-have-you but when you look at some
of<00:00:50.520> these<00:00:50.700> things<00:00:51.379> to<00:00:52.379> create<00:00:52.739> these<00:00:52.890> out<00:00:53.129> of

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
of these things to create these out of

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.279 
of these things to create these out of
real<00:00:53.430> Rock<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:54.390> just<00:00:54.690> not<00:00:54.840> going<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.110> happen

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
real Rock it's just not going to happen

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.560 
real Rock it's just not going to happen
this<00:00:55.949> here<00:00:56.250> stands<00:00:56.550> probably<00:00:56.730> about<00:00:57.000> six<00:00:57.360> feet

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
this here stands probably about six feet

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.650 
this here stands probably about six feet
tall<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.140> what<00:00:58.680> makes<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.070> nice<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.390> does

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
tall and what makes this nice is it does

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.680 
tall and what makes this nice is it does
look<00:01:00.899> realistic<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.070> way<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.460> they<00:01:02.609> do<00:01:02.690> use

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
look realistic in a way that they do use

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.010 
look realistic in a way that they do use
real<00:01:04.049> stone<00:01:04.830> its<00:01:05.280> pulverized<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.210> using<00:01:06.990> a

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
real stone its pulverized and using a

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.690 
real stone its pulverized and using a
formulation<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.130> can<00:01:08.280> see<00:01:08.460> all<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
formulation so you can see all the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.390 
formulation so you can see all the
different<00:01:09.119> Browns<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.860> it<00:01:10.860> almost<00:01:11.070> looks

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
different Browns and it almost looks

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.789 
different Browns and it almost looks
like<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.549> little<00:01:11.790> bit<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.119> gold<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.869> that

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
like a little bit of a gold to it that

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.830 
like a little bit of a gold to it that
one<00:01:14.010> airs<00:01:14.220> are<00:01:14.490> large<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.180> it's<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.689> vertical

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
one airs are large and it's a vertical

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.890 
one airs are large and it's a vertical
which<00:01:16.470> makes<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.920> really<00:01:17.549> nice<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:18.479> leaning

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
which makes it really nice for leaning

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.109 
which makes it really nice for leaning
against<00:01:19.259> their<00:01:19.490> mounting<00:01:20.490> against<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.939> house

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
against their mounting against a house
