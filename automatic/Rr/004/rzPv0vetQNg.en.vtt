00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
disappointing my second one was I'd like

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.999 
disappointing my second one was I'd like
to<00:01:40.459> say<00:01:40.580> perfect<00:01:40.940> but<00:01:41.509> I<00:01:41.539> did<00:01:41.750> some<00:01:42.009> minor

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
to say perfect but I did some minor

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.669 
to say perfect but I did some minor
mistakes<00:01:43.610> that<00:01:43.849> I<00:01:43.970> could<00:01:44.179> improve<00:01:44.509> after<00:01:45.319> that

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
mistakes that I could improve after that

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:48.339 
mistakes that I could improve after that
we<00:01:45.920> started<00:01:46.550> talking<00:01:46.910> a<00:01:47.000> lot<00:01:47.179> and<00:01:47.240> improved<00:01:48.200> in

00:01:48.339 --> 00:01:48.349 
we started talking a lot and improved in

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:51.040 
we started talking a lot and improved in
streams<00:01:48.709> and<00:01:49.420> before<00:01:50.420> coming<00:01:50.690> to<00:01:50.720> today's

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
streams and before coming to today's

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.749 
streams and before coming to today's
game<00:01:51.289> I<00:01:51.530> thought<00:01:51.890> we<00:01:52.069> couldn't<00:01:52.369> sustain<00:01:52.520> a

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
game I thought we couldn't sustain a

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.089 
game I thought we couldn't sustain a
well<00:01:53.179> it<00:01:53.509> did<00:01:53.750> sadly<00:01:54.080> happens<00:01:54.410> so<00:01:54.739> that<00:01:54.920> means

00:01:55.089 --> 00:01:55.099 
well it did sadly happens so that means

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:58.710 
well it did sadly happens so that means
