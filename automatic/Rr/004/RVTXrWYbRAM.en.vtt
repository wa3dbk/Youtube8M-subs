five<00:02:07.240> or<00:02:07.420> six<00:02:07.450> years<00:02:07.690> ago<00:02:07.960> we<00:02:08.170> said<00:02:08.320> we'll

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
five or six years ago we said we'll

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.350 
five or six years ago we said we'll
never<00:02:08.740> flood<00:02:09.100> but<00:02:09.700> we<00:02:09.850> wanted<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.179> house<00:02:10.330> to

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
never flood but we wanted the house to

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.750 
never flood but we wanted the house to
be<00:02:10.630> elevated<00:02:11.380> and<00:02:11.530> I<00:02:11.830> think<00:02:12.070> the<00:02:12.280> guidelines

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
be elevated and I think the guidelines

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.880 
be elevated and I think the guidelines
for<00:02:13.240> business<00:02:13.570> land<00:02:13.750> in<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:13.959> States<00:02:14.230> is<00:02:14.500> what

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
for business land in the States is what

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.130 
for business land in the States is what
eight<00:02:15.790> inches<00:02:16.180> above<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.510> street<00:02:16.840> or<00:02:16.959> so

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
eight inches above the street or so

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.780 
eight inches above the street or so
above<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.590> crown<00:02:17.800> in<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.130> screen<00:02:18.459> in<00:02:18.670> the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
above the crown in the screen in the

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.699 
above the crown in the screen in the
road<00:02:18.910> in<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.209> road<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.750> I<00:02:19.959> think<00:02:19.990> we<00:02:20.260> did<00:02:20.410> two

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
road in the road and I think we did two

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.460 
road in the road and I think we did two
and<00:02:20.860> a<00:02:20.890> half<00:02:21.130> feet<00:02:21.459> up<00:02:21.820> but<00:02:22.810> we<00:02:22.930> wanted<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.230> have

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
and a half feet up but we wanted to have

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.590 
and a half feet up but we wanted to have
a<00:02:23.500> portico<00:02:24.370> shade<00:02:24.640> that<00:02:24.940> was<00:02:25.090> like<00:02:25.300> you<00:02:25.450> were

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
a portico shade that was like you were

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.380 
a portico shade that was like you were
going<00:02:25.959> into<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.740> property<00:02:27.190> so<00:02:27.700> with<00:02:28.180> those

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
going into the property so with those

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.740 
going into the property so with those
two<00:02:28.450> ideas<00:02:29.310> we<00:02:30.310> decided<00:02:30.820> to<00:02:30.910> build<00:02:31.120> a<00:02:31.270> house<00:02:31.450> up
