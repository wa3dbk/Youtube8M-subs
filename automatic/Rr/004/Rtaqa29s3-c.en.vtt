00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.710
 anomalous specialists 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.650

 breathing or saying it is just luck 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.270
 that at the time of their fire with her husband 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.050

 disasters and a bright cloud appeared 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.130
 smoke they did not understand what was going on 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.869
 Andrei ran into the apartment everything was burning and 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.000
 whose affairs metal trim 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.310
 the refrigerator was melting before our eyes 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.640
 literally some seconds quick it 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.009
 all his documents, I managed to save it we 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.590
 still wanted to fill a bucket with water 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:27.119
 neighbors can breathe everything was already 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.600
 we just ran out of neighbors with this 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.150
 opposite the door they boots covered 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.580
 in the doorway someone breathe was nothing this 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.630
 there was no act of terrorism by fire or explosion 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.759
 domestic gas force emanzhelinska attacked 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.450
 unidentified flying object i saw 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.450
 ball 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.240
 he does not know how ball ball charge 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.000
 so a circle he flew in the blink of an eye 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.250
 after the killing gold according 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.409
 eyewitnesses the ball was moving on a fancy 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.830
 trajectories he pierced the roof of one of 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.440
 houses 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.720
 started flying through the apartments exploded 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.060
 The object in the kitchen of the blair couple 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.479
 the neighbors were luckier they just 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.069
 burned out all electrical engineering 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.179
 At first, everyone decided that she flew into the house. 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.670
 fireball 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.980
 but authoritative ufologist yuri senkin this 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.650
 version denied the object behaved like 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.019
 as if reasonable creature 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.239
 something or someone in the building is likely 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.060
 it was a plasmoid says researcher 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.299
 such flying balloons often appear 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.840
 in the photos are translucent 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.510
 luminous spots 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.390
 but they were met and live most often on 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.239
 the Urals, according to the ufologist, plasmoids led 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.720
 themselves like they wanted to make contact with 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.120
 by people 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.829
 circling around leisurely flew 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.320
 closer then farther away 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:45.620
 No aggression was shown. 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.970
 such a version that it is a kind of probes which 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.160
 achieve elsa run on others 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.739
 planets for exploration how we explore 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.290
 Mars is quite possible that this is a transmitter 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:57.170
 and receiver in one bottle 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.230
 there is a lot of this object 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.150
 devices which serves to 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.570
 communication with us at the flying object 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.230
 there was no purpose to kill or cripple 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.870
 anyone in the village near Chelyabinsk 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.570
 sure ufolog research probe 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.820
 aliens could just get out from under 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.250
 control and explode into any 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.890
 technology fails and even beyond 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.420
 reasonable civilization can not be 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.640
 insured against errors 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.530
 here are just the blair spouses 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.770
 an explanation is hardly comforting 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:33.510
 has gone 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:35.730
 it 's not even the whole practice on the first floor 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.970
 only one question is passed by locals 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.400
 not too expensive it costs an error 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.140
