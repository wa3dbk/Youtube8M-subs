00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:53.290
 that its own future is no longer going 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:13.570
 new as born today then we can 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:14.500
 start to repeat what i am 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:25.119
 doing 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:28.300
 operation market version of via 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:33.119
 also here a sign of blessed bioceramics 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.119
 everything and shops just unleashed 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.319
 midnight new life 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:02:00.350
 and now here I am 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:05.220
 doctor combined what a boy wants 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:11.820
 party too far enough is enough now 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:13.800
 that valentine after making the 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.260
 start up procedure you have to choose the 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.800
 mapping according to the type of route 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:23.310
 for which one goes then there are three 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.780
 types of mappings the first serve 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.410
 essentially to go down the street 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:32.010
 because the economic one is enough 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:35.070
 Pressing this key a pressure 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.050
 half a second to pass into 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.640
 headquarters of the first the second the third e 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.410
 the second and third if a mapping 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.020
 that need a little for the off-road the 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.090
 second sweeter the third a little more a 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.810
 a bit tougher 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:52.380
 obviously more power gives you more energy 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.290
 it consumes and the battery lasts less time 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.440
 now we import glasses 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:04.080
 traditional and not photonic ones and yes 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:06.209
 part as if it were a normal motorcycle e 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.010
 interesting reports that we must start 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.720
 you have to joke the little button of 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.400
 goodwill as if it were a motorcycle 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.400
 engine all goes well 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.650
 Pope 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.259
 and you who own a free ride 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:36.169
 I am happy with this 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:39.110
 protests because the exchange problem is 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:44.240
 a motorcycle scooter and not very dark 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:45.500
 here is the automatic clutch ie 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.870
 always the right gear 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.860
 the couple also has very low turns 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:55.940
 in another than wherever you want 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:58.180
 but I find good in a America that I don't know 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.460
 until a wall, however, will be so for 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.050
 hundreds of kilometers 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.729
 apart from that we are the ages and we are 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.009
 mid-afternoon we are here again at 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.729
 half but still there is a nice one 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:12.440
 difference between goals in the way of driving 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:15.259
 it is because you are on the jacket from 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.110
 jocks to the water , I beg you all or not 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:20.150
 you're a tourist derrick I yes if it's clear 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.800
 that there is that the first ears there 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:26.569
 logic of the first hours that sticks 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.659
 we returned to uncle frankestein 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:32.029
 also based on the display 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:34.789
 green cleats are finished for which it is 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:36.830
 only a quarter of an hour to be able to 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:41.449
 go home and now I'll show you 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:43.569
 how do you fill in what you need to do 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:47.750
 full 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:51.349
 a key of 10 two keys of 10 one 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:53.469
 beat a spare part of mine and 10 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:53.469
 seconds 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:04.990
 here's how to fill up with gasoline 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:08.020
 indeed easier and if it were not because 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.599
 it's just wolves outside is 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.490
 now because it rains hard, strong, strong 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:14.969
 another round I would gladly do it 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.969
 Hello 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:47.590
 good with her on energy and analogy 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:52.550
 I know energy and I'm ready I'm ok 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:55.190
 wait wait for totals then when 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:58.240
 I see you when you take it on 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:05.479
 stew of silence of you 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:07.760
 finally he can say when he gets there 

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:13.210
 that there are no more green chopsticks 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:13.210
 on the south as this is called
