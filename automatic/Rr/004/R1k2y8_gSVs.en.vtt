00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
the net making sure that even if my

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.490 
the net making sure that even if my
clips<00:04:32.790> become<00:04:33.180> loose<00:04:33.450> and<00:04:33.780> my<00:04:33.870> hair<00:04:34.080> will<00:04:34.260> stay

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
clips become loose and my hair will stay

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.630 
clips become loose and my hair will stay
in<00:04:34.740> place<00:04:34.890> I<00:04:36.410> also<00:04:37.410> take<00:04:37.770> a<00:04:37.800> wet<00:04:38.100> paper<00:04:38.280> towel

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
in place I also take a wet paper towel

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.120 
in place I also take a wet paper towel
and<00:04:38.910> apply<00:04:39.150> it<00:04:39.270> over<00:04:39.570> my<00:04:39.900> hair<00:04:40.170> this<00:04:40.740> actually

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
and apply it over my hair this actually

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.250 
and apply it over my hair this actually
protects<00:04:41.580> myself<00:04:42.120> from<00:04:42.480> the<00:04:42.720> warm<00:04:43.020> air

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
protects myself from the warm air

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.010 
protects myself from the warm air
blowing<00:04:43.560> directly<00:04:44.250> on<00:04:44.430> it<00:04:44.670> I<00:04:44.850> think<00:04:45.240> sometimes

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
blowing directly on it I think sometimes

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.780 
blowing directly on it I think sometimes
so<00:04:46.260> this<00:04:46.410> also<00:04:46.620> helps<00:04:47.010> my<00:04:47.160> hair<00:04:47.190> from<00:04:47.460> drying

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790
