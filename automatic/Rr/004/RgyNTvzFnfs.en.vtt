00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:26.580
 and here I have sent and it is already vÃ©lez 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.780
 without cameras that as we will see here more or 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.450
 less 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.430
 Now what I have is a screw what 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:38.510
 what I'm going to do is pass it with a mica 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.510
 with the one we took a screwdriver 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.090
 it can be anyone is love but a 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.090
 little bit younger 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.460
 let's take out the screw 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:04.199
 and I'm messing with the screwdriver like that 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:09.250
 as you can see the bikes 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.490
 if you see here I 'm not already sealed 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.829
 the band is still two mules 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.520
 what I'm going to do here is with some 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:22.119
 Cutting tongs I'm going to start cutting 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.610
 the rap not so flush and not so behind 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:28.990
 because here I might say a good 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:32.110
 horse can be made that way but 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.200
 also here to have a pair of tweezers at hand 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.220
 in gauze shipowner of small boy and a 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.260
 league in the special 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.590
 this can enter the stock market 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:48.630
 they occupy cameras as much as if a rubber and 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:51.790
 occupy the lack of love the league and a pair of tweezers 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.810
 to cut leagues 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.230
 and current droughts that is not on air 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.120
 perfectly fine 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.659
 to be here is to blow it 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.789
 buy if they have pumps 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.789
 with a buyer or at gas stations 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.930
 and recalculating the vivas 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:24.780
 this is so that it is always sealed 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.780
 in moments of degree 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:35.900
 my new invention made fast 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:39.700
 and it sounds very good indeed 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.700
 if this works, I recommend it
