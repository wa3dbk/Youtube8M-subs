Cal seven now these I think the
lazarevic<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.100> best<00:00:59.340> one<00:00:59.609> simply

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
lazarevic is is the best one simply

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.270 
lazarevic is is the best one simply
because<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:01.050> has<00:01:01.230> increased<00:01:01.710> blindfire

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
gunning the gun seems to be made for

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.149 
gunning the gun seems to be made for
just<00:01:27.869> two<00:01:27.990> holding<00:01:28.229> down<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.590> trigger<00:01:28.979> and

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
just two holding down the trigger and

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.580 
just two holding down the trigger and
blind<00:01:29.460> firing<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.090> running<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.509> people<00:01:30.900> to

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
blind firing and running that people to

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.080 
blind firing and running that people to
either<00:01:31.740> finish<00:01:32.130> off<00:01:32.280> with<00:01:32.430> them<00:01:32.579> LA<00:01:32.759> or

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
either finish off with them LA or

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.999 
either finish off with them LA or
hopefully<00:01:33.990> they<00:01:34.170> die<00:01:34.320> before<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.710> can<00:01:34.890> get

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
hopefully they die before you can get

that<00:01:35.040> close<00:01:36.619> now<00:01:37.640> this<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.479> course

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
that close now this is this is of course

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.830 
that close now this is this is of course
there's<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.829> reason<00:01:41.159> for<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:42.659> is

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
there's a reason for this and that is

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.230 
there's a reason for this and that is
simply<00:01:42.990> because<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.619> gun<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.159> dire<00:01:44.880> and

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
simply because the gun is dire and

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.630 
simply because the gun is dire and
medium<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.079> long<00:01:46.259> ranges<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:47.399> can

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
medium to long ranges it can

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.630 
medium to long ranges it can
occasionally<00:01:47.939> pull<00:01:48.360> off<00:01:48.509> some<00:01:48.720> medium<00:01:49.140> ranges

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
occasionally pull off some medium ranges

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.950 
occasionally pull off some medium ranges
but<00:01:50.960> it's<00:01:51.960> not<00:01:52.350> really<00:01:52.619> recommended<00:01:53.780> and<00:01:54.780> that

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
but it's not really recommended and that

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.870 
but it's not really recommended and that
long<00:01:55.170> range<00:01:55.439> there's<00:01:55.920> not<00:01:56.070> even<00:01:56.130> any<00:01:56.460> point<00:01:56.729> in

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
long range there's not even any point in

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.850 
long range there's not even any point in
even<00:01:56.939> trying<00:01:57.439> the<00:01:58.439> Recon<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.579> so<00:02:00.500> high<00:02:01.500> that

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
even trying the Recon it is so high that

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.469 
even trying the Recon it is so high that
it<00:02:02.850> makes<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.810> wreck<00:02:04.170> or<00:02:04.759> uncontrollable<00:02:05.759> at

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
it makes the wreck or uncontrollable at

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.080 
it makes the wreck or uncontrollable at
least<00:02:06.689> that's<00:02:06.899> how<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:07.020> feel<00:02:07.320> about<00:02:07.380> it

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.759 

now<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.150> guns<00:02:11.450> bullets<00:02:11.750> are<00:02:12.290> actually

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
now the guns bullets are actually

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.940 
now the guns bullets are actually
individually<00:02:13.700> quite<00:02:13.970> weak<00:02:14.180> but<00:02:14.900> like<00:02:15.349> the<00:02:15.500> m9

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
individually quite weak but like the m9

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.819 
individually quite weak but like the m9
it<00:02:16.310> has<00:02:16.849> a<00:02:17.180> high<00:02:17.750> rate<00:02:18.079> of<00:02:18.110> fire<00:02:18.200> probably<00:02:18.739> the

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
it has a high rate of fire probably the

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.640 
it has a high rate of fire probably the
highest<00:02:19.040> in<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.430> game<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:19.879> as<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:20.900> result<00:02:21.170> if

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
highest in the game and as a result if

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.940 
highest in the game and as a result if
you<00:02:22.310> can<00:02:22.489> manage<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.760> put<00:02:23.030> pull<00:02:23.659> off<00:02:23.810> a<00:02:24.049> string

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
you can manage to put pull off a string

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.280 
you can manage to put pull off a string
of<00:02:25.040> hits<00:02:25.310> whilst<00:02:26.060> blind<00:02:26.359> firing<00:02:26.810> or<00:02:26.900> something

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
of hits whilst blind firing or something

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.610 
of hits whilst blind firing or something
then<00:02:28.189> they<00:02:28.970> can<00:02:29.150> bring<00:02:29.329> a<00:02:29.510> player<00:02:29.750> down<00:02:29.959> quite

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
then they can bring a player down quite

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.360 
then they can bring a player down quite
quickly<00:02:33.159> now<00:02:34.159> this<00:02:34.879> can<00:02:35.090> also<00:02:35.269> be<00:02:36.220> enhanced<00:02:37.220> I

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
quickly now this can also be enhanced I

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.740 
quickly now this can also be enhanced I
mean<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:37.879> rate<00:02:38.030> of<00:02:38.060> fire<00:02:38.239> can<00:02:38.420> also<00:02:38.540> be

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
mean the rate of fire can also be

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.530 
mean the rate of fire can also be
enhanced<00:02:39.230> if<00:02:39.319> you<00:02:39.439> mod<00:02:39.680> it<00:02:39.829> with<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.909> rate<00:02:41.510> of

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
enhanced if you mod it with the rate of

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.069 
enhanced if you mod it with the rate of
fire<00:02:41.840> mod<00:02:42.250> now<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:44.000> treasure<00:02:44.239> guns<00:02:44.510> don't<00:02:44.840> use

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
fire mod now the treasure guns don't use

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.030 
fire mod now the treasure guns don't use
these<00:02:45.379> so<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:45.709> don't<00:02:46.040> actually<00:02:46.430> use<00:02:46.700> it<00:02:47.769> but<00:02:48.769> it

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
these so I don't actually use it but it

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.729 
these so I don't actually use it but it
just<00:02:49.069> makes<00:02:49.459> it<00:02:49.639> more<00:02:49.819> potent<00:02:52.930> now<00:02:53.930> one<00:02:54.500> of<00:02:54.530> the

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
just makes it more potent now one of the

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.339 
just makes it more potent now one of the
things<00:02:55.129> about<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.549> cow<00:02:55.700> seven<00:02:56.349> especially

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
things about the cow seven especially

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.440 
things about the cow seven especially
when<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.560> game<00:02:57.739> was<00:02:57.769> first<00:02:58.069> released<00:02:58.340> is<00:02:58.730> it

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
when the game was first released is it

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.339 
when the game was first released is it
caused<00:02:59.870> quite<00:03:00.170> a<00:03:00.260> bit<00:03:00.470> controversy<00:03:01.310> because

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
caused quite a bit controversy because

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.069 
caused quite a bit controversy because
it<00:03:03.349> was<00:03:03.500> so<00:03:03.620> powerful<00:03:03.829> a<00:03:04.250> lot<00:03:05.180> of<00:03:05.389> players<00:03:05.629> were

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
it was so powerful a lot of players were

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.309 
it was so powerful a lot of players were
just<00:03:06.290> using<00:03:06.530> this<00:03:06.769> gun<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.220> nothing<00:03:07.670> else

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
just using this gun and nothing else

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.599 
just using this gun and nothing else
everyone<00:03:09.319> was<00:03:09.470> running<00:03:09.650> around<00:03:09.980> just<00:03:10.280> running

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
everyone was running around just running

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.180 
everyone was running around just running
and<00:03:10.790> gunning<00:03:10.939> not<00:03:11.299> bothering<00:03:11.810> to<00:03:11.840> aim<00:03:12.169> and<00:03:12.500> it

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
and gunning not bothering to aim and it

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.610 
and gunning not bothering to aim and it
was<00:03:13.310> all<00:03:13.430> just<00:03:13.459> a<00:03:13.790> bit<00:03:13.940> of<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.180> mosh<00:03:15.109> pit<00:03:15.139> where

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
was all just a bit of a mosh pit where

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.920 
was all just a bit of a mosh pit where
we<00:03:15.739> you'd<00:03:16.579> run<00:03:16.849> into<00:03:16.879> each<00:03:17.299> other<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:17.780> just

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
we you'd run into each other and just

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.559 
we you'd run into each other and just
melee<00:03:18.199> each<00:03:18.440> other<00:03:18.739> and<00:03:19.060> hope<00:03:20.060> you<00:03:20.209> came<00:03:20.389> off

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
melee each other and hope you came off

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.149 
melee each other and hope you came off
on<00:03:20.720> top<00:03:21.400> now<00:03:22.569> this<00:03:23.569> was<00:03:23.810> slightly<00:03:24.230> fixed<00:03:24.919> with

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:25.159 
on top now this was slightly fixed with

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:28.920 
on top now this was slightly fixed with
the<00:03:25.400> recent<00:03:25.609> patch<00:03:26.060> I<00:03:26.510> think<00:03:27.290> was<00:03:27.409> patch<00:03:27.650> 1.02

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
the recent patch I think was patch 1.02

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.369 
the recent patch I think was patch 1.02
where<00:03:29.930> it<00:03:30.049> reduced<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.739> blind<00:03:31.129> fire<00:03:31.400> accuracy

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
where it reduced the blind fire accuracy

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.780 
where it reduced the blind fire accuracy
this<00:03:33.379> has<00:03:33.560> made<00:03:33.709> things<00:03:33.980> a<00:03:34.099> lot<00:03:34.250> more<00:03:34.310> fairer

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
this has made things a lot more fairer

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.000 
this has made things a lot more fairer
and<00:03:35.090> a<00:03:35.870> lot<00:03:36.019> more<00:03:36.109> balanced<00:03:36.560> in<00:03:36.650> my<00:03:36.769> opinion

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
and a lot more balanced in my opinion

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.039 
and a lot more balanced in my opinion
that<00:03:37.699> being<00:03:37.970> said<00:03:38.150> for<00:03:38.359> me<00:03:38.449> personally<00:03:38.690> I

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
that being said for me personally I

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.580 
that being said for me personally I
don't<00:03:39.250> feel<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.430> cow<00:03:40.669> seven<00:03:41.599> is<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:41.810> gun<00:03:42.139> for<00:03:42.409> me

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
don't feel the cow seven is a gun for me

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.369 
don't feel the cow seven is a gun for me
I<00:03:43.220> die<00:03:43.639> too<00:03:43.879> many<00:03:44.329> times<00:03:44.659> when<00:03:44.930> I'm<00:03:45.019> using<00:03:45.199> the

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379 
I die too many times when I'm using the

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.020 
I die too many times when I'm using the
cow<00:03:45.560> simply<00:03:46.190> because<00:03:46.310> I'm<00:03:46.549> running<00:03:46.790> into

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
cow simply because I'm running into

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.750 
cow simply because I'm running into
situations<00:03:47.209> and<00:03:47.840> that<00:03:47.989> and<00:03:48.199> I<00:03:49.069> just<00:03:49.430> ended<00:03:49.639> up

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
situations and that and I just ended up

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.259 
situations and that and I just ended up
dying<00:03:49.940> I<00:03:50.389> don't<00:03:51.319> know<00:03:51.379> if<00:03:51.500> you<00:03:51.590> find<00:03:51.769> this

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
dying I don't know if you find this

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.890 
dying I don't know if you find this
anyway<00:03:53.269> let's<00:03:53.989> recap<00:03:54.409> a<00:03:54.440> bit<00:03:55.209> now<00:03:56.209> the<00:03:56.269> cow<00:03:56.510> 7

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
anyway let's recap a bit now the cow 7

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.719 
anyway let's recap a bit now the cow 7
is<00:03:56.989> a<00:03:57.019> submachine<00:03:57.620> gun<00:03:57.799> that<00:03:58.250> is<00:03:58.340> probably<00:03:58.639> the

00:03:58.719 --> 00:03:58.729 
is a submachine gun that is probably the

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:01.869 
is a submachine gun that is probably the
best<00:03:59.000> gun<00:03:59.329> at<00:04:00.260> close<00:04:00.590> range<00:04:01.010> combat<00:04:01.159> in<00:04:01.729> the

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
best gun at close range combat in the

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.110 
best gun at close range combat in the
game<00:04:02.739> this<00:04:03.739> is<00:04:03.919> of<00:04:04.040> course<00:04:04.069> aided<00:04:04.790> by<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:04.970> fact

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
game this is of course aided by the fact

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.390 
game this is of course aided by the fact
that<00:04:05.419> probably<00:04:05.989> got<00:04:06.169> one<00:04:06.319> of<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:06.620> best<00:04:06.650> blind

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
that probably got one of the best blind

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.770 
that probably got one of the best blind
fires<00:04:07.790> in<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.120> game<00:04:08.359> as<00:04:08.540> well<00:04:10.180> it<00:04:11.180> has<00:04:11.540> also

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
fires in the game as well it has also

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.890 
fires in the game as well it has also
got<00:04:12.109> probably<00:04:12.739> the<00:04:12.859> highest<00:04:13.129> fire<00:04:14.060> rate<00:04:14.359> out

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
got probably the highest fire rate out

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.019 
got probably the highest fire rate out
of<00:04:14.959> any<00:04:15.139> gun<00:04:15.349> in<00:04:15.470> the<00:04:15.560> game<00:04:15.709> but<00:04:16.459> as<00:04:16.579> a<00:04:16.609> result

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:17.029 
of any gun in the game but as a result

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.640 
of any gun in the game but as a result
it's<00:04:17.150> got<00:04:17.269> insane<00:04:17.779> recoil

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
it's got insane recoil

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.180 
it's got insane recoil
and<00:04:19.739> it<00:04:20.489> has<00:04:20.880> a<00:04:21.180> very<00:04:21.660> bad<00:04:22.019> long-range<00:04:22.770> medium

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
and it has a very bad long-range medium

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.890 
and it has a very bad long-range medium
combat<00:04:23.669> capabilities<00:04:24.240> and<00:04:24.389> each<00:04:24.600> bullet

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
combat capabilities and each bullet

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.820 
combat capabilities and each bullet
individually<00:04:25.560> is<00:04:25.710> very<00:04:26.220> very<00:04:26.610> low<00:04:27.830> anyway

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
individually is very very low anyway

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.740 
individually is very very low anyway

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
hits to the head to kill someone and

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
tend to the body this shows how low the

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.580 
tend to the body this shows how low the
damages<00:04:37.139> of<00:04:37.380> each<00:04:37.530> bullet<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:38.610> high<00:04:38.759> fire

damages of each bullet the high fire
rate<00:04:40.590> makes<00:04:40.979> up<00:04:41.160> for<00:04:41.310> this<00:04:41.430> but<00:04:42.210> like<00:04:42.300> I<00:04:42.449> said

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
rate makes up for this but like I said

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.540 
rate makes up for this but like I said
before<00:04:42.690> this<00:04:42.930> is<00:04:42.990> not<00:04:43.259> a<00:04:43.289> gun<00:04:43.500> for<00:04:43.650> me<00:04:43.830> I<00:04:44.009> find

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
before this is not a gun for me I find

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.120 
before this is not a gun for me I find
it's<00:04:44.729> a<00:04:44.789> bit<00:04:44.940> of<00:04:45.030> a<00:04:45.090> suicide<00:04:45.270> gun<00:04:45.750> as<00:04:45.960> I<00:04:45.990> die<00:04:46.470> too

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130
