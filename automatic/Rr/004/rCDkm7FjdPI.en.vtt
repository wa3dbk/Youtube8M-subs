right and then I'm going to take a
smaller<00:01:37.350> knife<00:01:37.500> because<00:01:37.680> it's<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.829> little

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
smaller knife because it's a little

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.859 
smaller knife because it's a little
easier<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.369> control<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.030> I'm<00:01:39.360> going<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.570> cut

easier to control and I'm going to cut

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.730 
easier to control and I'm going to cut
that<00:01:40.680> portion<00:01:41.130> out<00:01:41.600> just<00:01:42.600> lift<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.899> up<00:01:43.020> oh<00:01:43.229> okay

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
and then I'm going to place it here and

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.899 
and then I'm going to place it here and
I<00:01:45.659> stand<00:01:45.869> up<00:01:45.990> high<00:01:46.290> exactly<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.250> now<00:01:47.549> we're

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
what I recommend doing is sort of trying

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.570 
what I recommend doing is sort of trying
to<00:02:06.869> use<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.110> full<00:02:07.380> length<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.860> your<00:02:08.009> spatula

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
and sort of go back and forth pushing is

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.490 
and sort of go back and forth pushing is
you<00:02:11.400> know<00:02:11.520> with<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.940> pretty<00:02:12.390> firm<00:02:12.750> touch

back and forth almost like a wave you

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.899 
back and forth almost like a wave you
can<00:02:15.450> see<00:02:15.599> I<00:02:15.659> Ingle<00:02:16.080> my<00:02:16.230> spatula<00:02:16.860> just<00:02:17.489> a<00:02:17.670> little

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
and then for a small cake like this you

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.069 
and then for a small cake like this you
have<00:02:21.000> an<00:02:21.090> option<00:02:21.329> you<00:02:21.420> can<00:02:21.540> do<00:02:21.689> the<00:02:21.810> sides

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
have an option you can do the sides

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.619 
have an option you can do the sides
first<00:02:22.879> after<00:02:23.879> you<00:02:23.909> have<00:02:24.030> all<00:02:24.120> your<00:02:24.209> icing<00:02:24.540> on

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
first after you have all your icing on

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.420 
first after you have all your icing on
and<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:24.840> gets<00:02:25.049> a<00:02:25.140> lip<00:02:25.349> on<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.709> top<00:02:25.739> and<00:02:26.189> you

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
and that gets a lip on the top and you

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.970 
and that gets a lip on the top and you
can<00:02:26.579> scrape<00:02:27.329> that<00:02:27.569> off<00:02:27.629> or<00:02:28.049> you<00:02:28.680> can<00:02:28.709> do<00:02:28.890> the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
can scrape that off or you can do the

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.979 
can scrape that off or you can do the
top<00:02:29.189> first<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.819> then<00:02:29.879> just<00:02:30.510> sort<00:02:30.659> of<00:02:30.690> scrape

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
top first and then just sort of scrape

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.059 
top first and then just sort of scrape
it<00:02:31.170> off<00:02:31.730> down<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.940> side<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.319> pull<00:02:34.319> away<00:02:34.440> now

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
it off down the side and pull away now

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.890 
it off down the side and pull away now
the<00:02:35.129> hardest<00:02:35.459> part<00:02:35.670> is<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.790> corners<00:02:36.239> so<00:02:36.870> I

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
the hardest part is the corners so I

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.259 
the hardest part is the corners so I
recommend<00:02:37.319> is<00:02:37.409> going<00:02:37.769> all<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.400> way<00:02:38.700> up<00:02:38.909> and

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
recommend is going all the way up and

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.849 
recommend is going all the way up and
even<00:02:39.359> over<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.900> corner<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.230> little<00:02:40.379> bit<00:02:40.530> so

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
even over the corner a little bit so

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.500 
even over the corner a little bit so
again<00:02:41.069> you<00:02:41.129> get<00:02:41.190> that<00:02:41.250> lip<00:02:41.579> on<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:41.849> corner

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
again you get that lip on that corner

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.440 
again you get that lip on that corner
and<00:02:42.829> then<00:02:43.829> you<00:02:43.950> can<00:02:44.099> scrape<00:02:44.459> at<00:02:44.670> all<00:02:44.819> how<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.060> say

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
and then you can scrape at all how I say

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.059 
and then you can scrape at all how I say
okay<00:02:45.750> what<00:02:46.349> we're<00:02:46.440> going<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.590> do<00:02:46.680> is<00:02:46.769> after<00:02:46.890> you

have everything crumb coated would put

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.670

a little bit so again I'm just getting
it<00:03:37.620> covered<00:03:38.129> looks<00:03:38.549> a<00:03:38.639> little<00:03:38.730> messy<00:03:39.000> but

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299
