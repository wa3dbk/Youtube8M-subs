00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.859
 in this tutorial I'm going to teach you 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.710
 how to set lips to start a 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.690
 operating system the operating system 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.870
 that I'm going to start in this tutorial is going to 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.459
 be windows 8 since I've made a 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.130
 tutorial on how to install it and people who 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.690
 I did not know how to tear it from this lips 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.310
 Well first thing we're going to do is going to 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.310
 be start our computer 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.390
 and we are going to give him 10 repeatedly 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.460
 Efe 10 because it is configuration 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.770
 we could give escaped to efe 11 but 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.590
 our case was asked for configuration voucher 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.780
 we have already entered lips 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.420
 Okay now how do we want to start 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.020
 from the cb that we created in the 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.360
 previous history with windows 8 lo 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.730
 only thing that we have to go is moving 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.620
 with the arrows for the sides 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.320
 boot start up let's give the 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.000
 priority of startup devices 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.970
 good in all bios is similar if 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.430
 we would start or leave wood and 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.670
 we would give a device priority 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.290
 start and we would give out as 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.960
 that will start the flop first and 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.050
 then the cd-rom then the hard drive and 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.840
 then we want to put the cd-rom 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:27.270
 First of all, click and masters 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.490
 cd-rom we would give the enter 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.860
 and we would substitute them by flop and that is 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.620
 the one who is first 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.520
 we would replace them and we already have first 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.890
 the cd-rom is worth it now we would give him the 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.820
 escape 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.350
 we would give him out 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:50.400
 and we would give you save changes and exit 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.400
 and we would give him 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.110
 now we would pay good we would put the 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.189
 the cb 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.580
 the floppy disk and to pay of the button 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.560
 of the computer 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.200
 we would understand the computer and now 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.030
 I would have to boot the system 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.030
 operative that we have got into the cd 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.459
 let's pass the bios 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.940
 tells us to press any key 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.940
 we give to any of the keyboard 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.260
 and as you can see, the 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.260
 installation process windows 8 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:43.379
 and in the typical installation then good 

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:45.229
 next we would create the 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:48.029
 partitions and all that then when 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.979
 when we have just been the system 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:51.929
 operative and we would enter again to the 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.670
 bios on leaving we would give it to restore 

00:04:51.929 --> 00:04:57.280
 predetermined values 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.990
 we would already have windows 8 and 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.830
 it would no longer boot from the hard drive 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.830
 thank you
