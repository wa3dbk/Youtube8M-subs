a 25 five cats 50 and that's the size

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.370 
a 25 five cats 50 and that's the size
comparison<00:06:09.440> with<00:06:09.979> the<00:06:10.069> reason<00:06:10.340> why<00:06:10.430> is<00:06:10.490> as<00:06:10.970> a

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
comparison with the reason why is as a

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:17.159 
comparison with the reason why is as a
as<00:06:12.380> opposed<00:06:12.800> to<00:06:12.949> having<00:06:13.690> big<00:06:14.690> ones<00:06:15.160> like<00:06:16.160> whoa

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:17.169 
as opposed to having big ones like whoa

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:23.110 
as opposed to having big ones like whoa
it<00:06:18.169> has<00:06:18.319> like<00:06:20.110> 50<00:06:21.110> a<00:06:21.289> bunch<00:06:22.220> of<00:06:22.370> small<00:06:22.580> ones<00:06:22.789> so

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
it has like 50 a bunch of small ones so

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.640 
it has like 50 a bunch of small ones so
that's<00:06:23.599> why<00:06:23.750> they<00:06:23.900> charge<00:06:24.169> it<00:06:24.349> more<00:06:26.650> safety

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
that's why they charge it more safety

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.770 
that's why they charge it more safety
