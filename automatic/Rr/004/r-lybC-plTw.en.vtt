00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.420
 What are the big success stories in the field of new cameras? 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.699

 she comes from the house of Pic and what is the secret of success 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.490
 yes that was the idea 2010 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.690
 the secret of success is simple 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.910
 the 7th 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.910
 the small is compact and lightweight 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.290
 Without much prior knowledge, it quickly leads to very good digital photos 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.690
 okay here we already have here on the photokina Tron Legacy successor 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.550

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.860
 yes the 3100 were in many areas lending Rosenberger 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.430
 the country changed 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.060
 what has remained is smaller but do high quality housing 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.740
 the colorful program

 A trading system in Guyana is getting better 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.010
 but then come normal to the watershed comrades 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.390
 I'm told to use notebooks as well 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.820
 for everyone 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.950
 then immediately 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.530
 fully automatically take pictures when he comes from the compact camera who 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.679

 Pauli against the Camorra a guide me o los 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:16.120
 the entry for step 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.179
 for recordings for 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:20.529
 the solar questions answer game to come now also normal discussions 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:24.429
 across the market segment a very large market segment of entry-level models 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:25.500
 entry-level models 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.530
 in the field of digital SLR cameras 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.880
 and that is a target group that is not necessarily for the previous knowledge 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.270
 brings with it what education Flanders setting which differ 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.370
 Set speed clearly and as they hear something quite Nikon 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.039
 special on the legs 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:44.599
 To what other market players have not yet we have developed a spirit with 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.009
 how did work 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:49.009
 but you feel simply lined up convinced 

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:52.619
 Euro left besides I was heated up you can see that 

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:58.219
 wa 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:01.040
 it was just in the garden or SAS tracker that's what we do 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.260
 taking photos 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.869
 Display dead bodies 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:06.619
 Keeping this topic up of pets 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:10.059
 then he asks for beginners or advanced 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:12.419
 For example, it was about beginners 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:16.479
 Blurs Vista Without Bite Photographing Removed Subjects Close-Ups The 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:19.239
 weight of love with children 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.419
 can be supported then you can go on 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:25.419
 Raúl says Embacher will do it and I can say take pictures 

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:27.470
 and 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.389
 use the Loburger live-blog 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:31.829
 you can choose 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.069
 you can just take pictures of that 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.129
 So I hope that we got it because it really is very 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.849
 impressed we have the situation 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.549
 In this target group, there is partly some foreknowledge one has 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:45.150
 Naturally 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.719
 or even had cameras before » 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:52.259
 when is something more ambitious by getting in to the Nikon d3100 than 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:56.449
 Entry-level drug into the large product family the sensors for the e3 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:59.040
 first the sizes professional cameras Leybold Optics 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.680
 so now I really want to take that so I am 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.099
 Getting started from the first get easily offended 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.639
 to be exact 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.639
 how much forget it is in the middle of it 

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:12.919
 Actually, there are no additional lying next to it 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.079
 Cameraman question mark provided 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.109
 here everyone can have a line to query a hand son program guide mode 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.229
 if you do not have that, you will be done piece by piece 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.410
 the daughter was so swirling at the game in a row showing what the setting was 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:26.669
 belongs 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.860
 «If you set 7 in a shipwreck tokyo buzzer Summer whole 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.690
 make it plastic for the audience 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.999
 I now have a job I have the device for 

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:39.999
 taken away and organic farmers place and through the situation centers the motive now on Levi 

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:43.550
 Fi summer times a water water rights or are special but so 

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:46.799
 a waterfall does not want Ferrell troops to stay here right before the 

00:04:46.799 --> 00:04:48.010
 Camera in hand 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.010
 and how far does that help me? 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.800
 then you can show that even the advanced Monroes 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.870
 Percent there you go in the advanced Volos 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.680
 and then the camera started too 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.469
 more depth of field motion freezing 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.469
 Percent flowing water and now I believe addressed 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:08.680
 There is free time 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.430
 Kamrath becomes an example 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.490
 So the characters are correct even if I do not like that 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.850
 Picture then look it is important that the effects with an example 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.719
 Bilfinger Berger a waterfall 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:20.880
 and at 11 the exposure time down here 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.880
 she emphasizes the movements a side shutter speed of one second 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.440
 with the longer exposure time then that on the waterfall just this 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.930
 typical fleece jacket gets clear with the blur 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.930
 and with short exposure times games in the water movement 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:39.600
 if I like that »so first scoring awarded okay say 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.660
 whoever is up to the recording I like it even further and then quite once 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.930
 have to leave or are there many examples so are not alone 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.879
 other tasks have become noisy conditions and conditions yes 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:55.090
 again a question about the price and the market appearance when the d3100 am 

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:57.210
 Market available 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.419
 come now 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:01.550
 at the end of September in the market 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.860
 a and 12 to them 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.879
 in the kit in the splendid Kitz offered Kreisklasse good weather 56 euro in the 

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:11.180
 Starter package 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.310
 So that means an objectively even with it in the truck 55 with this 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.589
 stabilization 

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:20.240
 Percent of what nine more of his camera do what an important game revealed against 

00:06:20.239 --> 00:06:23.589
 Fatigue home sitting can sit a full hd video mode 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:25.039
 it's called GameCom 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:28.039
 Perkovac percent the highest resolutions movies 

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:32.659
 he has just presented Jung's photograph in the amount of Akamai to her 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:35.689
 Picture i have a contrast autofocus team performance 

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:37.749
 I always use for possible 

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:39.729
 to this alternative 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:42.469
 Percent to the optical viewfinder show whether we still can of course 

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:44.990
 looking forward 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.460
 known SLR cameras full table 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.509
 coupled to it 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:50.439
 Focus on the league 

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:51.180
 also painter 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.560
 all others can also have a compact camera advertised to us and the whole 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.330
 already available in the pre-Christmas business 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.259
 So that means you can already mark and already percent 

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:02.029
 The trucks are packed so they are all on the road 

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:04.949
 I want to thank you soon for that, too 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:08.129
 Of course, we have learned a lot of new things like this 

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:09.050
 new 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.139
 Also seen below it would not surprise us if the best selling camera 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:17.740
 In 2010, a second half of Europe again in Europe 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.080
 Wollenweberstraße corpses has flared up 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.800
 if the idea 3100 v but just these days tear and user guidance 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.740
 something I also like to be able to call the market participants 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.310
 surely Europe is gone 

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.580
 pick up where they have the camera when Ausparken in hand 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.380
 and so we lead ourselves a little further straight in the entry area 

00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:42.139
 Often the people were very unconscious of the devices 

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:46.629
 the converted model done and for that Nicole has the record 

00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:50.780
 nominated players with nonsense would have been in the next one 

00:07:50.779 --> 00:07:55.300
 Issue of the print edition of Belm Bärbel the d3100 closer to the shirt 

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:58.650
 Franz Wittmann flirted with a lighter magazine 

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:04.889
 unfortunately so Hofer 20 the siren in Cologne we have some exciting is only 

00:08:04.889 --> 00:08:05.629
 unfortunately again
