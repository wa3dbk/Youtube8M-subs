00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.950
 destination let's talk about the possible and 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.500
 future of lc is since it has leaked 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.930
 what is a picture an image that it took 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.629
 the same worker took from bonn filled 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.580
 the conference which does not look good 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.470
 quality of which could not even be 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.949
 see what are the names of the dlc is 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.839
 but an English or African Chinese youtube 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.090
 I fucking fucking time I'll know where it's from 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:49.399
 the youtube has done what would be a 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.219
 image a remastering of the image 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.110
 but at high quality ok now you can 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.670
 see what all the contents of 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.640
 all the dlc from the futures of the 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.469
 stress this 2015 and maybe 2016 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.449
 this image this information 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.940
 possibly it is not true or is not true 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.850
 be certain the best in the end be final and 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.220
 in the end be final at the end be false or 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.840
 in the end it's true you do not know but 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.640
 good and nothing else would be expected 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.080
 wait this time to see what brings us 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.840
 bungee and then good with nothing more than 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.000
 say let's start ok first let's go to 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.150
 have what are four more 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.740
 it's more on the part of giving it to me in 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.870
 this image we can see all five of 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.880
 LEDs that are going to be expected to 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.160
 leave one already left that is to give veil 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.400
 in the deep darkness the next 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.890
 it would be in March on March 10, 2015 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.530
 called the house of wolves the house of 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.010
 the wolves which as a location 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.440
 is going to be the earth mars and venus not the 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.000
 earth the moon and venus and will have a 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.590
 new location which is going to be the 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.060
 reef a location which does not 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.460
 we've been in the game like this 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.890
 directly since nothing else we have gone to 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.540
 see what are the things cinematics 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.030
 so for the queen of history which 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.890
 history and then everyone is the 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.590
 know also we are going to have what they are 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.440
 three new missions a new strike or 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.959
 a new assault 3 not not that 3 a new 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.680
 king and four new multiplayer maps 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.959
 ok not four new pp maps which is 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.030
 something similar to what the halo brought 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.709
 brought the previous drs to give more veil 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.810
 that they added what are four 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.000
 new multiplayer maps ok then 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.400
 I would also block that a new one like 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.630
 an expansion type of destinations that does not 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.640
 know if it is destiny 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.110
 and a new expansion if they are going to want 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.030
 put what would be a content of a 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.130
 destination and two but instead of a game going 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.590
 to be this what would be an expansion already 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.450
 that this expansion called comet or 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.790
 place of darkness the plague of 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.000
 darkness is going to be located on the moon 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.840
 on Mars and this as it is called in venus and 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.310
 will bring what is a new 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.820
 location like the previous 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.610
 called the hive ship ok from hyde 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.130
 chip is this this expansion is going to have 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.290
 what are 12 new missions four 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.480
 new assaults and imagine four 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.110
 new assaults new a new event 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.090
 public a new patrol mission a 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.700
 new king and six new maps 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.250
 multiplayer ok you see that this expansion 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.770
 something fat is going to come fat like me 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.650
 no matter agreed not fucking woman 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.940
 fucking this is going to be something is going to be 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.400
 something big what this expansion would be 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.990
 we do not know the price that this 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.730
 expansion I say it's going to be 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.890
 relatively greater than the previous ones and 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.970
 that as a is a larger expansion 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.010
 that the previous ones I think is the 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.990
 double one of a normal expansion 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.910
 but we see that it brings many things 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.470
 it would be to see wait for us 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.850
 bring to the best is a destination 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.890
 maybe what they do not want to do 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.570
 is that it was another new game and put the 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.550
 content a new game but in form 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.350
 of expansion is not known but good 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.610
 let's leave that aside and you arrive 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.290
 I finish with the comments that you think of 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.110
 this would also have what is the 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.690
 episode 3 of good expansion 3 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.970
 called vex boy I think it's how you 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.680
 called vex void I think it's the empty vex 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.720
 I think it's called in Spanish which 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.540
 as location is going to be venus and mars 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.340
 you do not know the date the date was not set 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.530
 of what would be this dlc until now 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.680
 you do not know is going to have what are three 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.780
 new missions two new rounds a 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.090
 new king and three new maps 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.980
 multiplayer ok this is not known the date 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.310
 until now we do not know we know the 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.799
 date until I think that I think it 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.030
 predicts that it will come out by December I 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.950
 I think it's going to come out because then the 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.900
 first be in December then march 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.120
 then September here is repeated from 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.410
 then December through March and then 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.810
 December I think they're going to have 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.300
 planned for them in a year or two 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.660
 years and finally we would have what 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.690
 are 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.580
 episode 4 of expansion 4 the dlc 4 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.980
 as you want to call it called 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.900
 the force of gods I think it's the 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.690
 to give no no no yes as it is said in 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.370
 Spanish porsche got this not known 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.350
 nothing until now of that of lcds 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.940
 expansion is seen that on horses 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.670
 of the cabal I do not know how they arrive 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.410
 you do not know anything about the date or 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.600
 of the missions or anything until now 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.730
 It is what we have in this image 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.320
 here below in the description are going to have 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.150
 what would this image be if they want 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.130
 do some other video in case they want 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.260
 take her for who steal the portion 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.150
 who to edit and trolling a friend 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.470
 that I know there they're going to have it out with 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.120
 description but good this video what 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.330
 I ask for your opinions to tell me what 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.760
 they think of this if they would like more dlc 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.370
 is they would like stress every I do not know 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.200
 how 5 treats every year I know and 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.490
 I think it would be virtually 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.530
 I hope you liked what 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.680

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:30.640

 until the next bye
