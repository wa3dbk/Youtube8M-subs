00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.790
 hi then in this video series i have 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:19.090
 wanted to collect a collection of 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:22.720
 rather simple pentatonic phrases 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.230
 which constitutes a sort of abc of 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.789
 basic vocabulary for yours 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.699
 improvisations and for your solos in the 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.960
 meaning that as you may know or even one 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.490
 series of videos on the subject 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.080
 improvisation 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.930
 but who treat improvisation a 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.940
 little more wide-ranging looking 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.730
 a whole series of rhythmic issues 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.829
 of pronunciation of sound to interpretation 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.620
 agree here instead you want to own 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:51.160
 offer the fate of phrases made that 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.140
 serve as clichÃ©s to be used in 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.680
 your improvisations because one of the 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.109
 difficulty I realized is 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.550
 this is so much talk of fantasy 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.719
 in improvising we talk a lot about 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.750
 invent something 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:07.480
 in reality at the beginning it is a good rule 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.780
 he was able to tap into the sentences of others 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.030
 guitarists that is to say have some sort of it 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.040
 handbook of sentences to use 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.150
 at least initially to build the 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.280
 own vocabulary will be divided 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.320
 these phases in a series of 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.409
 chapters the first one today 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.079
 will essentially cover the use of the notes 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.000
 let's say flat with no details 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.920
 guitar techniques but with the 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.040
 concern to resolve on 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.649
 We will always use the tonic of the scale 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.110
 parallel pentatonic of the minor 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.659
 that as you may know it is the same 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.570
 that is, two shades are the best 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.090
 then related to them 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.899
 note however we will always see the phases 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.520
 solve in minor on the tonic of la 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.850
 higher on tonic than do then 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.979
 all packages will have this double 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.380
 functionality the other bets will be 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.990
 about 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:10.160
 the discourse of merone related to pool of 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:12.660
 glissandos days of bending phrases 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.060
 blueseianti and so-called double 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.489
 that is, the sentences they contemplate 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.080
 using multiple ropes 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.190
 at the same time let's go and see though 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.120
 the 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.970
 Today's theme is that of the notes that 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.040
 tend to resolution 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.690
 then let's see some phrases that 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.610
 tend to settle on tones that 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.050
 let's see first what tones that 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:40.230
 then we will use the toned peta of la 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:41.940
 minor then this agreement is in 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.510
 this case the tonic over there just that 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.580
 there 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.230
 on the fifth on the sixth fifth string 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:54.069
 button this on the fourth string 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:58.030
 seventh fret and this has it on the first one 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:00.879
 rope sing me key 5 this is fine 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.159
 in the case we will tend to resolve in minor 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:05.110
 then on the minor scale the first ones 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.209
 stages that simply offer you 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.890
 of resolutions on these tones that 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.390
 therefore very short phases that tend to 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.629
 resolve in solving on the atomic 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.629
 so 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.710
 or this one 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.410
 I still have a little bit longer 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.769
 ok now i'm always solving on 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.209
 central tonic but the whole can be 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.340
 also seen for example of solvendo 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:54.659
 down on the most serious tonic is 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:54.659
 party or on the high tonic 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.850
 ok be a slight vibrato on the last one 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.740
 final note can only render 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.270
 pleasant phrasing 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.590
 if instead we were talking about one 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.660
 higher resolution 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.260
 the tones we should consider are the 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.780
 note do and so this is me 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.650
 sing states agree with this 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.950
 this little finger 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:27.210
 this is the soul rope 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.210
 on my fat then these three 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.800
 phrases similar to those we have 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.510
 visa should therefore settle on 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.510
 these notes will make you feel 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.730
 here is how you feel about the deal 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.730
 do 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.430
 while a minor resolution was fine 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.430
 on the minor's agreement 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.080
 agree high resolution on the notes 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:23.890
 could be for example pest up 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:23.890
 a docu tu o fundo low 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.870
 this is wonderful on this note 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.870
 big 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:39.120
 the agreement therefore invents the whole series 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.730
 of very short sentences that simply 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.590
 they go around and end up on their tonic 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:47.570
 of reference that are the actuality 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.570
 greater a minor tonic
