00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
here I haven't created it but it's very

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.570 
here I haven't created it but it's very
simple

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
simple

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.420 
simple
you<00:04:55.210> grab<00:04:55.750> natural<00:04:56.230> items<00:04:56.910> so<00:04:59.430> basically

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
you grab natural items so basically

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.890 
you grab natural items so basically
flowers

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:17.060 

and<00:05:09.200> you<00:05:10.200> dig<00:05:10.500> a<00:05:10.770> 2x2<00:05:11.460> hole<00:05:11.820> in<00:05:11.970> the<00:05:12.060> ground<00:05:16.070> no

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
and you dig a 2x2 hole in the ground no

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:23.180 
and you dig a 2x2 hole in the ground no
bigger<00:05:17.370> nose<00:05:17.760> smaller<00:05:18.560> yes<00:05:21.800> and<00:05:22.800> then<00:05:22.980> you

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
bigger nose smaller yes and then you

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.160 
bigger nose smaller yes and then you
surround<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:23.910> and<00:05:24.360> then<00:05:24.540> you<00:05:24.660> surround<00:05:24.990> it

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.170 
surround the and then you surround it

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:34.510 
surround the and then you surround it
with<00:05:25.200> your<00:05:25.410> items

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:43.600 

and<00:05:34.940> it<00:05:35.720> has<00:05:35.840> come<00:05:36.020> be<00:05:36.500> completely<00:05:37.099> surrounded

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.010 

I'm<00:05:44.610> not<00:05:44.790> sure<00:05:44.940> if<00:05:45.060> C's<00:05:45.330> will<00:05:45.510> work<00:05:45.720> actually<00:05:46.260> I

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
I'm not sure if C's will work actually I

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.680 
I'm not sure if C's will work actually I
think<00:05:49.020> one<00:05:49.200> more<00:05:49.230> would<00:05:49.590> do<00:05:49.740> the<00:05:49.860> trick<00:05:50.570> but<00:05:51.570> as

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
think one more would do the trick but as

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:59.450 
think one more would do the trick but as
your<00:05:51.810> saplings<00:05:52.230> work

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.750 

and<00:06:00.030> then<00:06:00.360> break<00:06:00.600> this<00:06:00.750> one<00:06:01.460> and<00:06:02.460> then<00:06:02.610> you

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
and then break this one and then you

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.550 
and then break this one and then you
fill<00:06:03.030> it<00:06:03.180> with<00:06:03.210> water<00:06:03.330> and<00:06:03.840> then<00:06:04.260> you<00:06:04.380> throw

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
fill it with water and then you throw

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.710 
fill it with water and then you throw
diamond<00:06:04.980> in<00:06:05.100> the<00:06:05.190> middle<00:06:05.430> now<00:06:06.150> I<00:06:06.180> obviously

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
diamond in the middle now I obviously

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.530 
diamond in the middle now I obviously
don't<00:06:07.200> have<00:06:07.320> water<00:06:07.770> or<00:06:08.070> diamond<00:06:08.820> but<00:06:09.090> I<00:06:09.270> have

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
don't have water or diamond but I have

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.290
