eternal<00:00:25.650> are<00:00:25.800> not<00:00:26.039> just<00:00:26.250> don't<00:00:26.609> see<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:26.789> too

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
eternal are not just don't see that too

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.210 
eternal are not just don't see that too
often<00:00:27.240> but<00:00:27.930> unfortunately<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.560> way<00:00:29.039> he's<00:00:29.160> not

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
often but unfortunately I way he's not

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.349 
often but unfortunately I way he's not
really<00:00:29.400> gonna<00:00:29.550> be<00:00:29.640> able<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.820> do<00:00:29.970> much<00:00:30.150> with

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
really gonna be able to do much with

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.049 
really gonna be able to do much with
this<00:00:30.740> his<00:00:31.740> natural<00:00:32.130> expansion<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.610> fully

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
this his natural expansion is fully

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.790 
this his natural expansion is fully
contained<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.600> his<00:00:33.930> two<00:00:34.110> bases<00:00:34.500> getting<00:00:34.649> a

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
contained to his two bases getting a

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.170 
contained to his two bases getting a
second<00:00:35.160> robotics<00:00:35.520> facilities<00:00:35.880> who's<00:00:36.030> hoping

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
second robotics facilities who's hoping

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.690 
second robotics facilities who's hoping
to<00:00:36.450> mass-produce<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.860> when<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.129> get<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.520> out

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
to mass-produce and when it get this out

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.160 
to mass-produce and when it get this out
there<00:00:38.879> with<00:00:39.059> Reavers<00:00:39.450> get<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.840> done<00:00:39.989> with

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
there with Reavers get this done with

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.680 
there with Reavers get this done with
rivers<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.969> shuttles<00:00:41.969> he's<00:00:42.300> been<00:00:42.510> workin

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
rivers and shuttles he's been workin

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.819 
rivers and shuttles he's been workin
expanding<00:00:43.260> at<00:00:43.350> three<00:00:43.530> o<00:00:43.590> clock<00:00:43.620> position

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
expanding at three o clock position

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.410 
expanding at three o clock position
she's<00:00:44.190> gonna<00:00:44.280> try<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.520> take<00:00:44.730> additional<00:00:44.940> bases

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
she's gonna try to take additional bases

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.700 
she's gonna try to take additional bases
there<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.780> hope<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.079> flash<00:00:46.230> can't<00:00:46.440> really<00:00:46.590> be

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
there and hope the flash can't really be

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.860 
there and hope the flash can't really be
if<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.370> just<00:00:47.489> can't<00:00:47.670> really<00:00:47.820> be<00:00:47.910> 0<00:00:48.149> across<00:00:48.690> the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
if I just can't really be 0 across the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.360 
if I just can't really be 0 across the
map<00:00:49.140> because<00:00:49.800> he's<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.190> need<00:00:50.340> some

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
map because he's going to need some

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.619 
map because he's going to need some
forces<00:00:50.700> back<00:00:50.820> home<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.120> defense<00:00:51.390> he's<00:00:51.510> not

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
forces back home to defense he's not

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.150 
forces back home to defense he's not
gonna<00:00:51.719> push<00:00:52.079> up<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.350> fold<00:00:52.590> but<00:00:52.800> flights<00:00:53.070> just

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
gonna push up to fold but flights just

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.220 
gonna push up to fold but flights just
gonna<00:00:53.370> stay<00:00:53.579> content<00:00:54.510> for<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> little<00:00:55.079> while

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
gonna stay content for a little while

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.170 
gonna stay content for a little while
with<00:00:55.469> just<00:00:55.649> holding<00:00:55.980> off<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.640> has<00:00:56.789> his<00:00:56.969> three

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
with just holding off it has his three

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.270 
with just holding off it has his three
money<00:00:57.360> basis<00:00:57.750> right<00:00:57.870> now<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.170> violets<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.920> and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
money basis right now to violets to and

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.860 
money basis right now to violets to and
violet<00:00:59.699> economically<00:01:00.239> at<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> moment<00:01:00.660> very

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
violet economically at the moment very

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.209 
violet economically at the moment very
far<00:01:01.199> behind<00:01:01.350> because<00:01:01.649> he<00:01:01.739> hasn't<00:01:01.890> really<00:01:02.100> done

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
far behind because he hasn't really done

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.130 
far behind because he hasn't really done
economic<00:01:02.730> damage<00:01:03.030> whatsoever<00:01:05.840> well<00:01:06.840> flies

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
economic damage whatsoever well flies

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.910 
economic damage whatsoever well flies
just<00:01:07.170> adding<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.950> bunch<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.490> factories<00:01:09.240> and

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
just adding in a bunch of factories and

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.070 
just adding in a bunch of factories and
just<00:01:10.920> slowly<00:01:11.479> closing<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.689> this<00:01:12.840> game

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
just slowly closing in on this game

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.780 
just slowly closing in on this game
basically<00:01:13.530> closing<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.250> off<00:01:14.400> making<00:01:14.610> sure

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
basically closing this off making sure

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.950 
basically closing this off making sure
that<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.030> can<00:01:15.119> win<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.390> there's<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.659> shuttle

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
that you can win this there's a shuttle

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.249 
that you can win this there's a shuttle
air<00:01:16.200> what<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.619> left<00:01:16.890> hand<00:01:17.509> with<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.750> no

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
air what the left hand with that no

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.350 
air what the left hand with that no
speed<00:01:20.250> still<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.640> think<00:01:20.909> actually<00:01:21.060> might<00:01:21.330> be

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
speed still I think actually might be

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.999 
speed still I think actually might be
speed<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.960> shuttle<00:01:22.140> can't<00:01:22.409> wait<00:01:22.530> spot

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
speed on the shuttle can't wait spot

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.700 
speed on the shuttle can't wait spot
them<00:01:23.280> but<00:01:23.520> just<00:01:23.729> spot<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.600> much<00:01:25.049> easiest<00:01:25.650> to

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
them but just spot that much easiest to

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.719 
them but just spot that much easiest to
spot<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.950> think<00:01:26.009> there<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.369> speed<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
spot I think there is speed on the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.190 
spot I think there is speed on the
channel<00:01:27.030> yeah<00:01:27.180> just<00:01:27.479> easiest<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.869> spot<00:01:27.900> where

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
channel yeah just easiest to spot where

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.649 
channel yeah just easiest to spot where
the<00:01:28.259> shuttle<00:01:28.500> has<00:01:28.590> speed<00:01:28.950> or<00:01:29.100> not<00:01:29.540> when<00:01:30.540> it's

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
the shuttle has speed or not when it's

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.109 
the shuttle has speed or not when it's
next<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.259> curse<00:01:32.100> Harris<00:01:32.400> if<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.700> can<00:01:32.820> keep<00:01:33.000> up

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
next to curse Harris if it can keep up

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.330 
next to curse Harris if it can keep up
with<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.299> Corsairs<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:34.439> got<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.920> got<00:01:35.040> speed

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
with the Corsairs you got you got speed

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.319 
with the Corsairs you got you got speed
but<00:01:35.549> pretty<00:01:35.729> sure<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.880> have<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.030> shell<00:01:36.180> has

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
but pretty sure you have the shell has

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.149 
but pretty sure you have the shell has
speed<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.689> with<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.110> school's<00:01:37.350> goliaths<00:01:37.979> out

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.150 
denied as soon as those shuttles spotted
out<00:03:46.700> so<00:03:47.209> it's<00:03:47.600> really<00:03:47.780> stiff<00:03:48.290> they<00:03:48.440> go<00:03:48.739> and<00:03:48.860> do

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
out so it's really stiff they go and do

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.100 
out so it's really stiff they go and do
that<00:03:49.190> now<00:03:49.340> would<00:03:50.239> be<00:03:50.299> good<00:03:50.450> position<00:03:50.780> but<00:03:50.900> I

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
that now would be good position but I

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.410 
that now would be good position but I

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
understand it's perfectly understanding

the nines ready scan that out Wow but

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.640 
the nines ready scan that out Wow but
yeah<00:04:03.590> just<00:04:03.860> basically<00:04:04.160> scan<00:04:04.640> that<00:04:04.910> and<00:04:05.650> think

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
yeah just basically scan that and think

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.770 
yeah just basically scan that and think
