code it searches and you can see that I

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.230 
code it searches and you can see that I
can<00:01:58.320> get<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> kmart<00:01:59.490> for<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.790> buck<00:02:00.710> so<00:02:01.969> this<00:02:02.969> works

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
can get a kmart for a buck so this works

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.219 
can get a kmart for a buck so this works
with<00:02:03.509> many<00:02:03.810> things<00:02:04.229> food<00:02:05.210> drinks<00:02:06.229> anything

that has a UPC code pretty much her skin

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.050 
that has a UPC code pretty much her skin
this<00:02:13.569> there<00:02:14.569> we<00:02:14.719> go<00:02:15.010> no<00:02:16.010> price<00:02:16.310> is<00:02:16.340> found<00:02:16.849> and
