I'm thinking about doing but in case at
the<00:00:48.750> end<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.110> kind<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.469> like<00:00:49.590> any<00:00:49.800> other

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
the end is kind of like any other

to it's got the free tail in that you

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.880 
to it's got the free tail in that you
would<00:00:53.940> thread<00:00:54.239> through<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.780> buckle<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.800> it

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
would thread through the buckle and it

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.670 
would thread through the buckle and it
comes<00:00:56.100> back<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:57.239> course<00:00:57.870> attaches<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.440> the

see<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.469> gives<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.949> little<00:01:02.520> over<00:01:02.820> six<00:01:03.059> inches<00:01:03.210> of

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
see it gives a little over six inches of

see it gives a little over six inches of
loop<00:01:03.660> on<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.589> side<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.640> give<00:01:05.760> quite<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.150> bit<00:01:06.390> of

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
loop on this side to give quite a bit of

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.500 
loop on this side to give quite a bit of
adjustment<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.229> length<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.040> belt<00:01:08.510> what
