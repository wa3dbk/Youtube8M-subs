knuckle shot but in this case you

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.650 
knuckle shot but in this case you
contact<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:45.950> ball<00:01:46.100> in<00:01:46.310> a<00:01:46.400> different<00:01:46.790> angle<00:01:47.119> to

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
contact the ball in a different angle to

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.330 
contact the ball in a different angle to
create<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.110> effect<00:01:48.200> of<00:01:48.530> topspin<00:01:49.100> and

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
create the effect of topspin and

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.760 
create the effect of topspin and
increasing<00:01:49.940> the<00:01:50.000> dipping<00:01:50.360> of<00:01:50.510> the<00:01:50.630> ball<00:01:50.810> make

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
increasing the dipping of the ball make

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.440 
increasing the dipping of the ball make
sure<00:01:51.979> you<00:01:52.130> contact<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.760> ball<00:01:52.940> right<00:01:53.210> in<00:01:53.360> the

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
sure you contact the ball right in the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.870 
sure you contact the ball right in the
middle<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:53.990> create<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:54.380> knuckle<00:01:54.680> effect<00:01:54.880> you

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
middle to create the knuckle effect you

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.310 
middle to create the knuckle effect you
contact<00:01:56.330> the<00:01:56.450> ball<00:01:56.600> from<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:56.900> lower<00:01:57.080> angle

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
contact the ball from a lower angle

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.219 
contact the ball from a lower angle
toward<00:01:57.920> an<00:01:58.040> upward<00:01:58.430> thrust<00:01:58.460> emotion

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
toward an upward thrust emotion

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.780 
toward an upward thrust emotion
therefore<00:02:00.229> you're<00:02:00.410> creating<00:02:00.920> enforcing<00:02:01.700> the

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
therefore you're creating enforcing the

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.880 
therefore you're creating enforcing the
topspin<00:02:02.240> on<00:02:02.300> the<00:02:02.479> ball<00:02:02.570> as<00:02:02.899> you<00:02:03.140> can<00:02:03.229> see<00:02:03.470> my

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
topspin on the ball as you can see my

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.499 
topspin on the ball as you can see my
left<00:02:04.100> ankle<00:02:04.250> is<00:02:04.580> in<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:04.790> pretty<00:02:04.970> extreme

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
left ankle is in a pretty extreme

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.300 
left ankle is in a pretty extreme
position<00:02:06.050> by<00:02:06.229> putting<00:02:06.590> my<00:02:06.710> ankle<00:02:07.070> in<00:02:07.160> this

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
position by putting my ankle in this

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.160 
position by putting my ankle in this
position<00:02:07.820> this<00:02:08.119> helps<00:02:08.420> lower<00:02:08.630> my<00:02:08.810> center<00:02:09.140> of

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
position this helps lower my center of

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.110 
position this helps lower my center of
gravity<00:02:09.290> this<00:02:10.190> will<00:02:10.340> help<00:02:10.489> increase<00:02:10.759> the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
gravity this will help increase the

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.210 
gravity this will help increase the
angle<00:02:11.300> and<00:02:11.660> power<00:02:11.900> behind<00:02:12.350> upward<00:02:12.830> thrusting

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
angle and power behind upward thrusting

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.520 
angle and power behind upward thrusting
motion<00:02:13.340> as<00:02:13.670> you<00:02:13.790> contact<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.360> ball<00:02:14.570> this<00:02:15.350> will

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
motion as you contact the ball this will

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.650 
motion as you contact the ball this will
help<00:02:15.680> maximize<00:02:16.250> potential<00:02:16.790> topspin<00:02:17.420> and

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
help maximize potential topspin and

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.660 
help maximize potential topspin and
dipping<00:02:18.020> effect<00:02:18.380> on<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.680> ball<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:19.489> should

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
dipping effect on the ball you should

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.340 
dipping effect on the ball you should
take<00:02:19.880> cautious<00:02:20.390> as<00:02:20.630> you<00:02:20.840> can<00:02:20.989> sprain<00:02:21.320> your

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
take cautious as you can sprain your

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.290 
take cautious as you can sprain your
ankle<00:02:21.500> very<00:02:22.040> easily<00:02:22.280> by<00:02:22.670> performing<00:02:23.030> this

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
ankle very easily by performing this

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.750 
ankle very easily by performing this
technique<00:02:23.780> an<00:02:24.230> alternative<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:25.280> this<00:02:25.400> is<00:02:25.640> to

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
technique an alternative to this is to

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.449 
technique an alternative to this is to
jump<00:02:25.970> forward<00:02:26.380> this<00:02:27.380> may<00:02:27.590> help<00:02:27.709> minimize<00:02:28.220> the

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
jump forward this may help minimize the

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.600 
jump forward this may help minimize the
potential<00:02:28.820> injuries<00:02:29.450> on<00:02:29.660> your<00:02:29.989> left<00:02:30.170> ankle
