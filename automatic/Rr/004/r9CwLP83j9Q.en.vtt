00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:20.854
- WELL,
SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS I HAD

00:00:20.888 --> 00:00:23.156
BEFORE I WAS DIAGNOSED,
I DIDN'T REALLY, LIKE,

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.691
THINK ABOUT IT AT THE TIME.

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:27.461
AT CERTAIN TIMES, PART OF MY
BODY WOULD GO NUMB, AND I

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:31.365
WOULD KIND OF GET BLURRY VISION,
AND MY SPEECH WOULD BE SLURRED.

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:32.633
RIGHT WHEN I GOT
PREGNANT WITH MY SON,

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.468
I STARTED SHAKING, LIKE A
LITTLE BIT OF THE SHAKING

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:37.104
AND TREMORS, BUT I KIND
OF DIDN'T THINK NOTHING

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:38.605
OF THAT, EITHER.

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:41.041
BUT IT GOT MORE AND WORSE
AFTER I HAD MY SON, AND I WENT

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:44.645
TO THE NEUROLOGIST TO
START SEEING WHAT IT WAS.

00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:47.614
- CHARITY IS A PATIENT OF
MINE WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE.

00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:50.484
I INITIALLY SAW HER WHEN
SHE'D HAD SYMPTOMS FOR SOME

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:52.119
PERIOD OF TIME.

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:55.322
SHE'S QUITE YOUNG, SO I THINK
BECAUSE OF HER AGE, SHE HAD BEEN

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:58.592
SEEN BY OTHER PHYSICIANS
AND EVEN NEUROLOGIST,

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:01.828
AND PARKINSON'S DISEASE REALLY
HADN'T BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT.

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:04.064
- WHEN I FOUND OUT, I REALLY
DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING OTHER THAN

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:08.502
THAT MICHAEL J. FOX HAD IT, AND
THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH IT.

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:12.572
I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IF IT
WAS HEREDITARY, AND I'VE HEARD

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:17.344
THAT IT IS AND IT CAN BE
HEREDITARY, IT MAY NOT BE.

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:20.414
SO, LIKE, I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT IF MY KIDS GET IT?

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:22.950
BUT THERE'S REALLY NO WAY TO
REALLY TELL IF THEY'RE GOING

00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:27.587
TO OR NOT BECAUSE I'M THE ONLY
ONE IN MY FAMILY WHO HAS IT.

00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:33.727
- FOR YOUNGER-ONSET PATIENTS,
SO UNDER THE AGE OF 45,

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:41.468
THE CHANCES THAT THEIR
PARKINSON'S HAS A LARGER

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:45.639
GENETIC COMPONENT, WHETHER
IT'S A SINGLE GENE DISORDER OR

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:49.910
JUST A GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY,
IS QUITE A LOT GREATER.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:55.349
SO FOR UNDER 45s, THE GENETIC
COMPONENT AS OPPOSED TO THE

00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:58.585
ENVIRONMENTAL COMPONENT OF THE
DISEASE IS QUITE A BIT BIGGER.

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:00.821
- FIRST-DEGREE RELATIVES,
WHICH ARE CHILDREN

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:04.224
AND PARENTS, SIBLINGS, ARE
AT ABOUT TWICE THE RISK TO

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:07.494
DEVELOP PARKINSON'S DISEASE
AS THE GENERAL POPULATION.

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:11.665
WHAT THIS MEANS IS BY 65,
EVERYONE HAS ABOUT A 1% RISK

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:14.201
OF DEVELOPING PARKINSON'S
DISEASE, SO IT INCREASES THEIR

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:15.836
RISK TO ABOUT 2%.

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:20.040
- YOU MAY HAVE A PARTICULAR
GENETIC MAKEUP THAT MIGHT PUT

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:24.611
YOU AT RISK FOR A GIVEN
DISEASE, BUT WITHOUT SOME

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:28.715
ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCE OR
SOME OTHER GENETIC INFLUENCE,

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:30.884
YOU MAY NEVER SHOW
SIGNS OF THE DISEASE.

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:35.022
- SO IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED
INTERPLAY OF GENETICS

00:02:35.055 --> 00:02:38.792
AND ENVIRONMENT, WE THINK,
AND NOT JUST A SINGLE GENE

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.861
PROBABLY CAUSING THE
DISEASE IN THE VAST MAJORITY

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:43.563
OF CASES, BUT A NUMBER
OF DIFFERENT GENES,

00:02:43.597 --> 00:02:46.233
THEN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT
SOMEONE'S EXPOSED TO.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:49.536
THERE ARE RARE CASES WHERE
THERE IS AN AUTOSOMAL

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.905
RECESSIVE FORM, WHICH MEANS
BOTH PARENTS WOULD HAVE TO HAVE

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:56.476
A COPY OF THE GENE FOR THE
CHILD TO GET IT, OR OCCASIONAL

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.613
AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT FORMS, BUT
THESE REPRESENT AN EXTREMELY

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:02.115
SMALL PORTION OF
THOSE AFFECTED BY

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:03.750
PARKINSON'S DISEASE.

00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:07.154
- GENETICS IS COMPLICATED,
AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS AS SIMPLE

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:12.559
AS HAVING A GENE MEANS
YOU WILL GET THE DISEASE.

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:15.228
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF
COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES

00:03:15.262 --> 00:03:16.630
OUT THERE.

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:22.469
IT CAN GIVE YOU SOME BROAD
INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR RISKS

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:26.239
FOR SPECIFIC DISEASES,
BUT WHETHER THOSE RISKS

00:03:26.273 --> 00:03:31.445
ACTUALLY PREDICT THAT YOU WILL
DEVELOP THOSE DISEASES OR NOT

00:03:31.478 --> 00:03:33.880
IS REALLY VERY LIMITED.

00:03:33.914 --> 00:03:37.884
THE TESTS REALLY DON'T
HAVE ANY CLINICAL UTILITY.

00:03:37.918 --> 00:03:43.090
ONE CONCERN THAT IS OFTEN
ASKED ABOUT IS THE RISKS

00:03:43.123 --> 00:03:44.825
TO INSURABILITY.

00:03:44.858 --> 00:03:47.260
THERE ARE SOME PROTECTIONS
IN PLACE BOTH AT THE LEVEL

00:03:47.294 --> 00:03:49.262
OF THE STATE AND ALSO FEDERAL.

00:03:49.296 --> 00:03:51.898
THERE'S A RELATIVELY NEW FEDERAL

00:03:51.932 --> 00:03:55.168
LAW CALLED "GINA," WHICH
IS THE GENETIC INFORMATION

00:03:55.202 --> 00:04:00.941
NONDISCRIMINATION ACT,
THAT PROVIDES SOME PROTECTIONS

00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:04.478
FOR HEALTH INSURANCE
IN THE FACE OF GENETIC

00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:06.847
INFORMATION DISCLOSURE.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.818
THERE IS A GENERAL CONSENSUS
THAT WE WILL NOT TEST MINORS

00:04:11.852 --> 00:04:16.590
FOR AN ADULT-ONSET DISEASE,
PARTICULARLY ONE WHERE THERE

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:20.160
IS NO DISEASE-MODIFYING
TREATMENT, SO WE CAN'T GIVE THE

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:23.864
PERSON SOMETHING THAT WILL
DELAY OR PREVENT ONSET.

00:04:23.897 --> 00:04:25.966
FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF
PEOPLE WHO HAVE PARKINSON'S

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:30.437
DISEASE, GENETIC TESTING
REALLY DOESN'T HAVE A ROLE,

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.141
AND FOR A VERY FEW PEOPLE
WHERE IT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED,

00:04:34.174 --> 00:04:38.578
IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE UNDERTAKEN
IN A CAREFULLY CONSIDERED WAY

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:42.816
WITH THE APPROPRIATE PROVIDERS
INVOLVED, INCLUDING THEIR

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.652
NEUROLOGIST, PERHAPS A
MEDICAL GENETICIST,

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:47.521
AND A GENETICS COUNSELOR.

00:04:47.554 --> 00:04:50.590
- ONE THING OF IMPORTANCE IS
THAT THE PERSON WANTING THE

00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:53.760
GENETIC TESTING IS THE ONE WHO
HAS TO GO FOR THE COUNSELING.

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:56.129
SO IT MAY BE THAT A PARENT
HAS PARKINSON'S DISEASE AND IS

00:04:56.163 --> 00:04:58.331
WORRIED ABOUT THE
RISK TO THEIR CHILD.

00:04:58.365 --> 00:05:00.600
THAT CHILD HAS TO MAKE
THE DECISION TO GO TO

00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:02.035
GENETIC COUNSELING.

00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:03.503
EXCELLENT.

00:05:03.537 --> 00:05:05.272
NOW LET YOUR ARMS COME DOWN,
AND OPEN YOUR EYES.

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.908
- WHEN MY DAUGHTER'S 18 OR
MY SON'S 18, AT THAT TIME,

00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:11.044
IF THAT'S WHAT THEY CHOOSE,
THEN I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO THEM.

00:05:11.077 --> 00:05:12.846
IF THEY KNOW THERE'S NOT
REALLY ANYTHING THEY CAN DO,

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:15.315
THEN IF THEY WANT TO KNOW,
THEN FINE.

00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:17.384
IF NOT,
THEN JUST LET IT BE.

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:20.253
- AND GENERALLY IN THOSE
PEOPLE, WE SEE IT WITHIN

00:05:20.287 --> 00:05:22.355
A FAMILY OR MULTIPLE
MEMBERS HAVE IT.

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.292
WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY
TO TEST FOR ALL THE GENES THAT

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:26.793
MAY BE INVOLVED.

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:29.296
SO JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE'S
TESTING COMES BACK NEGATIVE

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:32.065
FOR WHAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE
DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY'RE NOT

00:05:32.098 --> 00:05:33.700
GONNA DEVELOP
PARKINSON'S DISEASE.

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:35.735
SO THINK THAT REALLY HAS TO
BE STRONGLY UNDERSTOOD

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:38.738
WITH A DISEASE LIKE
PARKINSON'S, THAT WE MAY BE

00:05:38.772 --> 00:05:42.943
ABLE TO CHECK FOR THESE VERY
COMMON MUTATIONS, BUT WITHIN

00:05:42.976 --> 00:05:45.378
THE WHOLE POPULATION, THOSE
REPRESENT A REALLY SMALL

00:05:45.412 --> 00:05:51.051
PORTION OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
GONNA GET PARKINSON'S DISEASE.

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:54.721
- MANY OF THE GENES THAT HAVE
BEEN FOUND, THE MOST VALUABLE

00:05:54.754 --> 00:05:58.892
THING ABOUT THEM IS THAT THEY
HAVE HELPED US TO UNDERSTAND

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:01.595
THE BIOLOGY OF
PARKINSON'S DISEASE.

00:06:01.628 --> 00:06:03.496
- SO IT'S REALLY AT THIS
POINT GAINING INFORMATION

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.801
FOR THE BROADER POPULATION AS
A WHOLE RATHER THAN LIKELY TO

00:06:07.834 --> 00:06:10.470
BENEFIT ANY INDIVIDUAL
PATIENT.

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:13.573
- THERE IS A LOT OF ONGOING
RESEARCH INTO THE GENETICS

00:06:13.607 --> 00:06:15.308
OF PARKINSON'S DISEASE.

00:06:15.342 --> 00:06:17.777
THERE ARE MANY RESEARCH
PROJECTS THAT ARE GOING

00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:22.515
ON BOTH WITHIN THE VETERANS
ADMINISTRATION AND OUTSIDE,

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:26.453
AND SO IF PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT WHAT RESEARCH PROJECTS

00:06:26.486 --> 00:06:31.124
MIGHT BE INVOLVED AT THEIR
PARTICULAR INSTITUTION,

00:06:31.157 --> 00:06:37.497
THEY CAN CHECK IN WITH THEIR
PADRECC OR THEIR VA PROVIDER,

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.867
WHO USUALLY HAS A LISTING
OF THOSE TYPES OF STUDIES.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.336
- SO TO SUMMARIZE
ON PARKINSON'S AND GENETICS,

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.574
IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED ISSUE
AT THIS POINT, AND WE'RE REALLY

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:51.878
AT THE POINT OF DOING RESEARCH
IN THIS AREA AND NOT--IT'S NOT

00:06:51.912 --> 00:06:53.480
SOMETHING THAT IT'S CLINICALLY
APPROPRIATE TO BE

00:06:53.513 --> 00:06:55.282
TESTING PEOPLE.

00:06:55.315 --> 00:06:56.783
- CHARITY HASN'T SAID
ANYTHING ABOUT PASSING IT

00:06:56.816 --> 00:06:58.184
ON TO HER KIDS.

00:06:58.218 --> 00:06:59.886
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S REALLY
THOUGHT ABOUT IT OR IF SHE

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.956
JUST TRIES NOT TO THINK ABOUT
THAT TYPE OF ASPECT OF IT

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:05.058
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T WANT TO
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT'S GONNA

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:06.660
HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE.

00:07:06.693 --> 00:07:08.762
I THINK SHE'S JUST MORE
FOCUSED ON LIVING THE BEST

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:11.064
LIFE SHE CAN NOW AND NOT
WORRYING ABOUT WHAT IT'S GONNA

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:12.799
DO IN THE FUTURE.

00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:15.402
- THE BEST ADVICE I CAN
GIVE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:19.005
DIAGNOSED IS, YEAH, IT'S
KIND OF SHOCKING AT FIRST,

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:22.309
AND YOU MIGHT SIT THERE AND
BE LIKE, "WELL, WHY ME?"

00:07:22.342 --> 00:07:25.445
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU
CAN'T STOP LIVING.
