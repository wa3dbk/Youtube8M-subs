00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
important for what we're doing today

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
important for what we're doing today
remember<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.000> said<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.570> was<00:01:45.689> going<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.869> give

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
remember I said that I was going to give

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.719 
remember I said that I was going to give
you<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> table<00:01:46.500> which<00:01:46.950> lists<00:01:47.250> grayscale

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
you a table which lists grayscale

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.370 
you a table which lists grayscale
settings<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.299> chroma<00:01:48.509> settings<00:01:48.899> for<00:01:49.049> various

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
settings and chroma settings for various

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.840 
settings and chroma settings for various
skin<00:01:49.710> types<00:01:50.570> well<00:01:51.570> that's<00:01:51.990> what<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.320> is

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
skin types well that's what this is

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.490
