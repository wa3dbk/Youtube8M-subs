00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:10.820
 In the Ventures pipeline 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.350
 I want to do it today 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:19.240
 Let's do the tuning first 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.240
 I think that I want to go from the 6th string 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.960
 6 strings 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.100
 The original of the above will not match if the match this sound 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.770
 It is Aiko matter 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.860
 Is it a bit low? 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.590
 I did it while looking at the tuner now 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.850
 It has had this 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.240
 7 minutes 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.800
 It is 4 cases 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:57.560
 Well it's gone 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.850
 3 things are perfect 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.850
 Higher or a little a 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.000
 Yes 2 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.230
 It is popular 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.950
 Glimpse 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.950

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:32.300

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.300
 Good 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.370
 Hmm 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.040
 me 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.080
 Hmm 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.570
 Hm 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.000
 ame 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.000
 bgm 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Hmm 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.269
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.269
 me 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.819
 male 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.290
 me 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.360
 cane 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.360
 me 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.360
 me 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.750
 I think that I want to go into the commentary on how to play 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.560
 First of all, intro 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.560
 It is an intro 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.579
 Well that 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:54.269
 The youtube other people are playing 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.780
 There are many ways to play when you look at it , so I think it's a fairly simple song. 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.080
 but 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.080
 Oh dear 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:10.209
 It is not the other big thing that there is a difference of maa . 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:15.670
 For example, where does this come from? 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:19.840
 Some people are playing with six strings 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.660
 I I think that it is strange actually hit that child roughly this 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:27.270
 Hmm 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:33.300
 I think these 15 frets or so are coming in from here 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:36.870
 Why did you hear the proverb song once in a while 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.200
 It seems like this is fine I think I do not have to be such a fine place cat 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:45.690
 but 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:45.690
 Five of the 15 frets per five I felt I heard 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:52.769
 It is 2 frets to woman It is feeling to go to 2 frets 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.190
 bouvet 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:11.710
 I might sound have to feel like you're doing it great something is for beginners 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:16.210
 Great easy Eho compass itself there end Nde not at all like that but is 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:18.910
 It may be difficult for everyone but if you get used to it you can do it right away 

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:22.709
 Across that matter 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.709
 Say to go 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:34.160
 I think it would be difficult to go over it, but only one string is doing this 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:35.390
 If done it is not that so great difficult 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.310
 Hmm 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.840
 Where are you slowly 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:44.700
 Down there 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.210
 Up and down up and down this repetition 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.210
 is not it 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:05:01.900
 You should now say your right hand late left hand so that it gradually descends from the 15th fret 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.900
 is not it 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.960
 5 minutes 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.620
 Have 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.620
 Only this 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.889
 This may also need some practice at first but I think it will be possible soon 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.889
 Hmm 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.529
 6 minutes 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.700
 Hmm 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:27.970
 Boo minutes 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.970
 I will
