 Hello everyone and welcome to this new 

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.200
 tutorial 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.120
 to see is to show the 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.760
 way of working the way to transfer 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.770
 files to computer through 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.770
 ios devices without cables 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.080
 as you saw in another video that had 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.760
 made for android devices today what 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.250
 I do for them so this tutorial 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.080
 I had asked for it and well first thing 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.660
 what they have to do for this is to have 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:34.040
 is not thirsty anymore in the jailbreak in the 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:37.280
 ios device to iphone ipad ipod 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.870
 it does not matter once they have the site 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.870
 installed with jailbreak open it 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.359
 and they are going to add the next one repose 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.320
 go down in the description of the video to 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:53.250
 that can add it well 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:56.960
 goodfuente is edit add and there they go to 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.960
 simply put 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.560
 revol 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.080
 dot com 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.550
 you can see the camera is focused 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.550
 wait 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.420
 and what is necessary is good 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.330
 already from mena found the pastry that is 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.980
 the address they just described 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.690
 john sometimes adds the source 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:33.330
 he is simply in the search 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.330
 and they're going to write the following there's 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.539
 faith 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.539
 the benefits of space 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.640
 is already looking for the against here is the 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.940
 possible since I already have it installed 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.010
 you just have to click there 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.340
 and will appear to install from the 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:10.400
 replenishment there file once the 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.280
 it restarts and once they have it 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.730
 will appear in this part but I have 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.310
 here is fire I will do it in this application 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.040
 because I already had it is not since the return 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.570
 to install but for those who are not 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.300
 way the familiar with these 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.150
 applications is a browser 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.819
 files but it is in having the option 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.999
 to be done in a wifi network 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.670
 for that you just have to give this to 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:42.810
 this symbol that is like an antenna 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.780
 they give click I say press it now let's go 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.510
 is loading the web server and now 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.840
 here is the most important in this 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.840
 part 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.860
 Here you see some codes 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.810
 is this last this code what are going to 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.540
 do is enter 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.540
 in the computer's web browser 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.600
 it's just putting http two points and 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.760
 this number is going to show now in 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.620
 they have to give it like this has every 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.510
 device like this while you're going to 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.220
 show peace by passing to the computer the 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.030
 computer 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.920
 Well, ready , I'm already in the 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.480
 computer now I will enter 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.040
 simply an internet browser 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.490
 good users who want internet 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.070
 explore mozilla safari i use in this 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.690
 case the google chrome in these areas 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.020
 arid where is that in the directions 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.280
 they will write the address they give 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.290
 the address with the numbers of 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.930
 identification that he gave him the 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.930
 device in this case http 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.739
 two 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.340
 and here it puts in the direction in this case 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.340
 is this 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.080
 good time apart 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.650
 I reserve it to avoid those problems 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.650
 we wait for him to load 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.500
 we load both 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.190
 ready in is warned in jazz and I 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.560
 I find in the folders of the ipod 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.480
 here in this part is there file is like 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.920
 a kind of server that is created 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.630
 between the computer and the device 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.440
 this is which are connected in the 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:45.630
 same wifi network and here you can 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.630
 upload files selection files 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:52.890
 he was choosing from any images 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:55.290
 photos and videos and you have it loaded has 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.380
 to choose the folder in this case by 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:01.880
 example if you want to take pictures of the 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:04.240
 Unam if you need to connect it to the cable 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.139
 possibly to whom 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.139
 in bookstores 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.150
 no other 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.450
 half 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.779
 this zinc is usually the 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:24.309
 the default the camera is going to open it 

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:24.309
 and I'm going to show you support 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.229
 and here are all the photos that are here 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:36.420
 for example is online online 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.420
 just double click and it would give me an image 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:43.030
 and we can give you save as 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.980
 and we keep it anywhere where 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.620
 we want sinesia and this can be done 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.540
 without having to connect the 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.700
 cable 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.620
 and well this yes, this is practically 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.630
 everything to close simply did the 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:06:01.270
 browser 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:04.600
