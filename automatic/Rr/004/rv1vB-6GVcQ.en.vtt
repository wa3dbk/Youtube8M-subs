00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
people as well as you should do but I

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.300 
people as well as you should do but I
mean<00:01:18.470> I<00:01:18.530> think<00:01:18.560> James<00:01:18.860> castle<00:01:19.190> has<00:01:19.280> been

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
mean I think James castle has been

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.680 
mean I think James castle has been
fantastic<00:01:19.550> and<00:01:20.030> he<00:01:20.180> does<00:01:20.360> have<00:01:20.480> a<00:01:20.540> name

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
fantastic and he does have a name

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.060 
fantastic and he does have a name
extremely<00:01:21.200> similar<00:01:21.410> to<00:01:21.650> mine<00:01:21.800> which<00:01:22.040> is

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
extremely similar to mine which is

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.800 
extremely similar to mine which is
highly<00:01:22.700> irritating<00:01:23.180> I<00:01:23.210> did<00:01:23.330> try<00:01:23.480> and<00:01:23.570> make<00:01:23.690> him

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
highly irritating I did try and make him

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.510 
highly irritating I did try and make him
change<00:01:24.020> it<00:01:24.230> but<00:01:24.350> he's<00:01:24.740> actually<00:01:24.920> a<00:01:25.130> me<00:01:25.310> playing

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
change it but he's actually a me playing

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
change it but he's actually a me playing
pretty<00:01:25.670> well<00:01:25.790> so<00:01:26.060> maybe<00:01:26.150> I<00:01:26.270> might<00:01:26.420> have<00:01:26.510> to

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
pretty well so maybe I might have to
