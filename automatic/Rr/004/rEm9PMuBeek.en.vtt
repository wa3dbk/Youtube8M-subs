the computer beautiful lines dis despite
of<00:02:10.530> lots<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:10.979> lots<00:02:11.130> of<00:02:11.310> Crossman's<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.210> plane

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
of lots of lots of Crossman's the plane

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.860 
of lots of lots of Crossman's the plane
follows<00:02:13.140> with<00:02:13.440> exact<00:02:14.010> precision<00:02:14.210> the<00:02:15.210> line<00:02:15.570> to

follows with exact precision the line to
the<00:02:15.960> Waypoint<00:02:16.380> insurance<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.040> now<00:02:17.100> it's

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
the Waypoint insurance and now it's

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.490 
the Waypoint insurance and now it's
coming<00:02:17.490> back<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.000> way<00:02:18.120> point<00:02:18.390> five<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:18.960> it

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
coming back to the way point five and it

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.080 
coming back to the way point five and it
will<00:02:19.710> either<00:02:19.860> move<00:02:20.190> or<00:02:20.370> we<00:02:20.490> will<00:02:20.640> just<00:02:20.820> cancel

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
will either move or we will just cancel

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.320 
will either move or we will just cancel
it<00:02:21.360> when<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.800> goes<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.310> way<00:02:23.490> point2<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.030> will

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
it when it goes to the way point2 I will

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.020 
it when it goes to the way point2 I will
bring<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.690> home<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.500> so<00:02:26.340> after<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:26.970> we

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
bring it to home and so after that we

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.730 
bring it to home and so after that we
will<00:02:27.210> fly<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.510> again<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:27.990> we'll<00:02:28.170> turn<00:02:28.410> off<00:02:28.560> the

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
will fly it again and we'll turn off the

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.130 
will fly it again and we'll turn off the
GCS<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.880> plane<00:02:30.120> will<00:02:30.330> follow<00:02:30.630> the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
GCS and the plane will follow the

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.580 
GCS and the plane will follow the
waypoints<00:02:31.620> actually<00:02:35.990> it<00:02:36.990> will<00:02:37.170> come<00:02:37.380> back<00:02:37.530> to

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
waypoints actually it will come back to

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.960 
waypoints actually it will come back to
home<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:38.430> will<00:02:38.610> take<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.820> turn<00:02:40.550> do<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:41.670> see<00:02:41.850> the

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
home it will take a turn do you see the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:49.070 
home it will take a turn do you see the
homing<00:02:42.300> button<00:02:42.600> that's<00:02:42.810> green

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:03:00.120 

ok<00:02:49.830> so<00:02:50.460> it<00:02:50.520> will<00:02:50.700> turn<00:02:50.880> back

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.310 

I<00:03:00.360> will<00:03:01.360> cancel<00:03:01.600> all<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:01.930> commands

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
I will cancel all the commands

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:25.360 
I will cancel all the commands

now<00:03:26.370> I'm<00:03:26.610> flying<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.150> plane<00:03:28.010> I'll<00:03:29.010> shoot<00:03:29.220> the

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
now I'm flying the plane I'll shoot the
