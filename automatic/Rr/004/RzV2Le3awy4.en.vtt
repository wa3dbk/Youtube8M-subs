background who was in there and it

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.950 
background who was in there and it
allows<00:00:15.650> you<00:00:15.950> to<00:00:15.980> kind<00:00:16.369> of<00:00:16.580> get<00:00:16.820> a<00:00:17.029> sense<00:00:17.060> what

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
allows you to kind of get a sense what

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.589 
allows you to kind of get a sense what
you<00:00:18.140> saw<00:00:18.439> from<00:00:19.130> above<00:00:19.460> in<00:00:19.640> rough<00:00:19.849> water<00:00:20.180> under

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:20.599 
you saw from above in rough water under

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:22.960 
you saw from above in rough water under
water<00:00:20.810> it<00:00:21.020> looks<00:00:21.230> like<00:00:21.440> this<00:00:21.770> even<00:00:22.670> in<00:00:22.789> rough

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
water it looks like this even in rough

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.120 
water it looks like this even in rough
water<00:00:23.300> because<00:00:23.570> this<00:00:23.779> the<00:00:24.230> turbulence<00:00:24.770> is<00:00:24.949> all

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
water because this the turbulence is all

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.920 
water because this the turbulence is all
then<00:00:25.310> surfaced<00:00:25.789> so<00:00:25.910> as<00:00:26.060> long<00:00:26.240> as<00:00:26.390> I<00:00:26.480> do<00:00:26.539> these

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
then surfaced so as long as I do these

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.680 
then surfaced so as long as I do these
things<00:00:26.960> that<00:00:27.949> you<00:00:28.130> see<00:00:28.340> me<00:00:28.490> do<00:00:28.670> here

whereas I'm thinking about my right
hands<00:01:00.150> got<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.750> go<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.019> separate<00:01:01.890> molecules

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
hands got to go in separate molecules

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.100 
hands got to go in separate molecules
then<00:01:02.730> I'm<00:01:02.820> going<00:01:02.970> to<00:01:03.000> realign<00:01:03.330> up<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.629> rest<00:01:03.900> of

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
then I'm going to realign up the rest of

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.710 
then I'm going to realign up the rest of
my<00:01:04.170> body<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:05.339> fit<00:01:05.610> through<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.450> hole

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
my body to fit through that that hole

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.510 
my body to fit through that that hole
that<00:01:06.750> my<00:01:07.050> right<00:01:07.229> arm<00:01:07.470> cuts<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.920> then<00:01:08.340> you'll

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
that my right arm cuts and then you'll

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.100 
that my right arm cuts and then you'll
watch<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.700> left<00:01:09.090> arm<00:01:09.330> also<00:01:09.630> notice<00:01:09.960> the

goes in the fingers are down in the palm

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.609 
goes in the fingers are down in the palm
is<00:01:56.700> back<00:01:56.910> because<00:01:57.630> as<00:01:57.780> long<00:01:57.959> as<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.259> palm<00:01:58.470> is

is back because as long as the palm is

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.650 
is back because as long as the palm is
back<00:01:58.830> if<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.099> apply<00:01:59.399> any<00:01:59.640> pressure<00:01:59.729> the

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
back if I apply any pressure the

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.139 
back if I apply any pressure the
resultant<00:02:01.110> force<00:02:01.380> moves<00:02:01.709> me<00:02:01.890> forward<00:02:02.149> all

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
resultant force moves me forward all

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.790 
resultant force moves me forward all
right<00:02:03.209> if<00:02:03.599> you<00:02:03.959> look<00:02:04.110> at<00:02:04.229> other<00:02:04.349> people

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
right if you look at other people

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.949 
right if you look at other people
there's<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.119> tremendous<00:02:06.119> amount<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.509> time<00:02:06.720> when

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
there's a tremendous amount of time when

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:08.749 
there's a tremendous amount of time when
the<00:02:07.050> hand<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.319> going<00:02:07.619> back<00:02:07.800> where<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.369> palm<00:02:08.580> is

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
the hand is going back where the palm is

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.850 
the hand is going back where the palm is
facing<00:02:08.910> somewhere<00:02:09.539> other<00:02:09.690> than<00:02:09.810> back<00:02:10.140> all

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
facing somewhere other than back all

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.440 
facing somewhere other than back all
right<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.250> it's<00:02:11.430> an<00:02:11.550> idea<00:02:11.880> of<00:02:12.060> one<00:02:12.239> of<00:02:12.330> those

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
right so it's an idea of one of those

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.839 
right so it's an idea of one of those
consequential<00:02:13.260> things<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.800> this<00:02:14.459> is<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.640> group

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849
