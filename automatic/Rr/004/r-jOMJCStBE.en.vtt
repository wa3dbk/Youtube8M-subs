00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
we're going to sanitize this which means

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.670 
we're going to sanitize this which means
pour<00:01:41.970> boiling<00:01:42.360> water<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.079> be<00:01:43.259> careful<00:01:43.619> of

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
course they're going to heat this up to

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.639 
course they're going to heat this up to
just<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.740> little<00:01:46.920> bit<00:01:47.009> over<00:01:47.100> room<00:01:47.399> temperature

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649
