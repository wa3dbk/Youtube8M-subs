for the Apple iPad so you can see here
right<00:02:16.040> away<00:02:16.160> know<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.550> difference<00:02:16.880> but<00:02:17.060> let's

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
right away know the difference but let's

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.780 
right away know the difference but let's
see<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.720> first<00:02:17.930> check<00:02:18.320> out<00:02:18.500> again<00:02:19.130> more<00:02:19.610> a

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
see the first check out again more a

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.910 
see the first check out again more a
little<00:02:19.970> bit<00:02:20.060> more<00:02:20.270> of<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.960> device<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:21.830> we

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
little bit more of the device and so we

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.800 
little bit more of the device and so we
can<00:02:22.100> see<00:02:22.310> here<00:02:22.460> once<00:02:23.120> we<00:02:23.270> are<00:02:23.330> connected<00:02:23.720> we

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
can see here once we are connected we

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.010 
can see here once we are connected we
can<00:02:23.990> go<00:02:24.140> here<00:02:24.440> use<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.720> keyboard<00:02:26.720> keyboard

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
can go here use the keyboard keyboard

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.930 
can go here use the keyboard keyboard
and<00:02:27.320> everything<00:02:27.650> quite<00:02:27.920> nicely<00:02:28.130> but<00:02:28.490> once<00:02:28.730> you

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
and everything quite nicely but once you

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.030 
and everything quite nicely but once you
unlock<00:02:29.600> it<00:02:29.780> here<00:02:29.960> from<00:02:30.110> this<00:02:30.290> magnetic<00:02:30.620> stand

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
unlock it here from this magnetic stand

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.620 
unlock it here from this magnetic stand
actually<00:02:31.340> which<00:02:31.490> is<00:02:31.520> quite<00:02:32.030> nice<00:02:32.210> since<00:02:32.480> it

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
actually which is quite nice since it

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.570 
actually which is quite nice since it
doesn't<00:02:33.020> fall<00:02:33.290> out<00:02:33.320> that<00:02:33.590> easily<00:02:33.740> you<00:02:34.430> will

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
doesn't fall out that easily you will

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.540 
doesn't fall out that easily you will
see<00:02:34.730> that<00:02:34.820> once<00:02:35.300> we<00:02:35.540> our<00:02:36.230> undocked<00:02:36.740> here<00:02:37.100> and

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
see that once we our undocked here and

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.280 
see that once we our undocked here and
you<00:02:37.730> can't<00:02:38.030> actually<00:02:38.209> use<00:02:38.450> these<00:02:39.050> buttons

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
you can't actually use these buttons

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.560 
you can't actually use these buttons
anymore<00:02:39.800> so<00:02:40.070> this<00:02:40.250> is<00:02:40.400> quite<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:40.820> stranger<00:02:41.360> but

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
anymore so this is quite a stranger but

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.720 
anymore so this is quite a stranger but
for<00:02:41.780> me<00:02:41.900> that<00:02:42.530> you<00:02:42.680> have<00:02:42.770> to<00:02:42.920> really<00:02:43.310> have<00:02:43.610> it

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
for me that you have to really have it

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.070 
for me that you have to really have it
connected<00:02:43.940> like<00:02:44.270> this<00:02:44.300> even<00:02:44.750> though<00:02:44.870> it's

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
connected like this even though it's

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.900 
connected like this even though it's
Bluetooth<00:02:45.350> so<00:02:46.100> otherwise<00:02:46.459> we<00:02:46.670> can<00:02:46.790> of<00:02:46.880> course

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
Bluetooth so otherwise we can of course

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.430 
Bluetooth so otherwise we can of course
here<00:02:47.330> browse<00:02:47.810> through<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.050> program's

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
here browse through the program's

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.560 
here browse through the program's
everything<00:02:49.280> is<00:02:49.400> quite<00:02:49.700> quick<00:02:49.970> here<00:02:50.180> can<00:02:50.390> just

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
everything is quite quick here can just

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.600 
everything is quite quick here can just
open<00:02:50.840> up<00:02:50.930> Chrome<00:02:51.230> for<00:02:51.740> example<00:02:52.190> half<00:02:52.370> you're<00:02:52.580> a

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
open up Chrome for example half you're a

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.730 
open up Chrome for example half you're a
little<00:02:52.820> bit<00:02:52.910> of<00:02:53.000> advertisement<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:53.870> can<00:02:54.620> just

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
little bit of advertisement and can just

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.380 
little bit of advertisement and can just
zoom<00:02:54.950> in<00:02:55.130> and<00:02:55.280> also<00:02:55.430> this<00:02:55.700> is<00:02:55.820> quite<00:02:56.090> fast

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
zoom in and also this is quite fast

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.570 
zoom in and also this is quite fast
otherwise<00:02:56.840> your<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:57.800> keyboard<00:02:58.190> is<00:02:58.280> of<00:02:58.400> course

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
otherwise your the keyboard is of course

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.490 
otherwise your the keyboard is of course
not<00:02:58.820> slow<00:02:59.150> either<00:02:59.360> of<00:02:59.690> course<00:03:00.050> and<00:03:00.230> right<00:03:00.350> now

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
not slow either of course and right now

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.900 
not slow either of course and right now
it<00:03:00.860> doesn't<00:03:00.920> show<00:03:01.310> this<00:03:01.459> off<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.730> keyboard

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
it doesn't show this off the keyboard

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.640 
it doesn't show this off the keyboard
you<00:03:02.120> can<00:03:02.150> just<00:03:02.450> use<00:03:02.660> this<00:03:03.050> one<00:03:03.110> so<00:03:03.410> this<00:03:03.500> is

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
you can just use this one so this is

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.650 
you can just use this one so this is
fast<00:03:03.860> but<00:03:03.980> also<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.760> on-screen<00:03:05.030> keyboard<00:03:05.540> is

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
fast but also the on-screen keyboard is

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.990 
fast but also the on-screen keyboard is
quick<00:03:06.140> enough<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.770> this<00:03:07.220> rotation<00:03:07.790> also

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
quick enough and this rotation also

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.580 
quick enough and this rotation also
quite<00:03:08.840> fast<00:03:10.450> so<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.600> last<00:03:11.750> thing<00:03:11.900> here<00:03:12.410> of

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
quite fast so the last thing here of

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.250 
quite fast so the last thing here of
course<00:03:12.860> how<00:03:13.550> does<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.209> camera<00:03:14.540> look<00:03:14.690> so<00:03:15.110> let's

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
course how does the camera look so let's

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.509 
course how does the camera look so let's
check<00:03:15.530> out<00:03:15.650> first<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:15.920> front<00:03:16.100> cam<00:03:16.250> you<00:03:16.340> can

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
check out first the front cam you can

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.390 
check out first the front cam you can
see<00:03:16.670> here<00:03:16.850> we<00:03:16.940> have<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.180> jelly<00:03:17.870> bean<00:03:18.400> surface

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
see here we have the jelly bean surface

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.820 
see here we have the jelly bean surface
year<00:03:19.610> so<00:03:19.850> it<00:03:20.269> already<00:03:20.450> seized<00:03:20.989> or<00:03:21.260> tracks<00:03:21.620> my

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
year so it already seized or tracks my

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.190 
year so it already seized or tracks my
face<00:03:22.070> actually<00:03:22.310> we<00:03:22.580> have<00:03:22.760> 1.3<00:03:23.420> megapixel<00:03:24.019> here

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
face actually we have 1.3 megapixel here

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.830 
face actually we have 1.3 megapixel here
and<00:03:24.380> I<00:03:24.739> can<00:03:24.950> just<00:03:25.400> really<00:03:25.700> quickly<00:03:26.269> flip<00:03:26.660> here

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
and I can just really quickly flip here
