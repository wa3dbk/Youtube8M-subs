00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.540
 well, only friends of youtube like 

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:06.730
 I hope you are pretty enough 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.620
 well and today we are going to compare 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.809
 two great games that have come out this 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.510
 year we are talking nothing more and nothing 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.760
 less than white 2 and halo 4 ok 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.699
 ok let's start and before we start 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.199
 this video I want to clarify that I do not 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.510
 I am in favor of no game that 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:26.140
 I do not want fanboys to get here either 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:28.990
 to give him dislike or to comment negative 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.739
 Each game has its pros and each game 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.170
 has its cons ok so for that 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:39.000
 there is no discussion in that sense ok ok 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:42.570
 has already clarified that let's start 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.989
 as we know halo 4 is exclusive of 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.100
 xbox 360 so good for that part 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.590
 Well, I kind of have a bit of 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.120
 disadvantage since the black off 2 for 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.720
 as we know we have it in both 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.570
 playstation3 and xbox 360 consoles 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.060
 so well there I think I would lose 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.900
 jaÃ©n hello but then remember that 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:06.030
 hello is a super exclusive of xbox well 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.460
 Well, what can we do? 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.770
 although the cairo is a very good game 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.260
 so black ops gun in that sense ok 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.510
 well now we go with the price the price 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.970
 I'm going to talk here in Mexico the price in 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.400
 mexico of halo and of black ops is 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.560
 totally the same 850 pesos 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.330
 depending on where they buy it obviously 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.860
 There are places where it will cost more 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.840
 expensive and other places where they are going to 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.600
 cost cheaper on launch day 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.330
 both cost a thousand pesos at least 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.000
 where I bought the games were in the 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.830
 same price thousand pesos and good the 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.020
 next aspect that we are going to see are 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.450
 the special editions 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.299
 each game had its special edition of 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.219
 launch as we know the halo 4 had 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.500
 its special edition and the black ops 2 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:51.869
 it also had its special edition but in 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.319
 this time with the black ops 2 since 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.319
 its edition carp cage that was the package 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:00.420
 of help was very sold here in Mexico 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:02.969
 although a little expensive yes but good 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.280
 edition brought more things and included a 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.700
 remote controlled aircraft contained of leces 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.250
 in the box was very striking in the end 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.010
 I think that was special edition was 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.890
 better than the one that pulled halo and good now 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.410
 let's go to history the story halo is 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.680
 super good wins by much to black 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.260
 ops an example is that I never play the 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.000
 campaigns of kot games 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.650
 I've never finished a campaign 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.019
 modern warfare 3 I left it in the middle 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.000
 because I got bored the black ops did not 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.010
 I have touched since it does not call me the 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.870
 attention I bought the game more for the 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.780
 multiplayer and for the zombies the 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.849
 campaign almost does not pay attention and 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.639
 the let them I always have played well 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.670
 that in the campaign because I think halo is the 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.890
 carries 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.200
 and by much and good now we go to the 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.180
 graphics in graphics are almost the same 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.849
 the graphics do not notice much difference 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.580
 but I think halo wins again has 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.890
 some excellent graphics are very good 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.290
 its graphics have nothing wrong 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.330
 and well, that would be in terms of 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.730
 history or graphics 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.160
 now let's type of game in kind of 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.190
 game as we know hello then without de novo 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.490
 but black ops takes it completely 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:20.450
 for the zombies the zombies is I think 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.340
 that its main advantage of black ops is 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.200
 so many people buy it and in 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.810
 seriously the zombies to me personally 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.880
 they like it a lot and the maps that included 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.830
 this time they are very good and the mode 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.070
 transit the new game mode that 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.900
 they included the same is very good so 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.090
 I think that in game modes, I know 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.310
 it takes black ops and finally in 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.800
 connections in connections and 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.470
 unfortunately here in Mexico they are 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.269
 very bad in black ops I'm always 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.150
 in yellow and that I have an internet 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:52.790
 of 2 megabytes with infinity is pretty bad 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.790
 the connection is always in 2 megabytes and 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.129
 most of the games 10 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.500
 of every ten games I play 8 are 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:03.620
 the guided ones so easy then then 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.819
 it's almost impossible to play it and as for 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.319
 halo halo 4 I played a couple of times in 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.610
 the multiplayer and believe me that has not 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:16.260
 given problem I've never seen the acc 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.609
 and the gameplay the connections 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.680
 there are also many people who join 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.960
 games so I think in connection 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.450
 and in the multiplayer in general, 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.280
 hello wins him over black ops well 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.560
 how good is this little girl 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.140
 comparative I hope you liked it if 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.760
 it was a like subscribe and comment if 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:37.170
 something happens in this video me so 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.170
 I say goodbye and see you soon
