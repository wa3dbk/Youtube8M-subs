00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.339
 Recordings from the glittering time in German racing championship 

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:10.939
 1981 dominated cars 

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:16.070
 500 to 700 hp that happen single copies here for example the 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.249
 BMW m1 even made a lot more 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.249
 a very weak one has been the last ten years 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:25.960
 survived unscathed and drives today to obstruct 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.159
 the story of this car and forest owners 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.410
 fresh fish heat danger must 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.390
 he was also know she also led the sports championship around 17 35 clock 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.360
 move 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.060
 and this shape-by-word frontman would actually always use the ORF 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.680
 some new customers 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.310
 it also came into their possession 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.980
 but that's been paid by referee Michael Weiner Borbeck 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.540
 Mother with the program before 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.790
 to fight back for funding that is then hotly debated the 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:56.820
 Sales will be 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.780
 and of course I'm super to schnitzel winter and wish him too 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.630
 but will overwhelm you to build wonderfully the dough will knead the tractor-trailer 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.620
 oversized spoilers coined at the time were five cars 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.280
 Hans-joachim Stuck likes to remember this time 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.870
 his legendary 1 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.980
 The first thing that comes to my mind is that from the point of view of the SPD it was possible to mobilize 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.920
 training 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.880
 incessantly had device of such a regulation 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.490
 that's what I thought the stone would be so worth it 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.760
 was a phenomenon that car which we could never explain 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.540
 Binder the 5 the fifth with Hassan Salzburger or Masseverwalter 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.450
 Hundertwasser 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.410
 then it suddenly became completely the same 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.800
 Felix said that 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.240
 whence came the bishop of blessings like Spybot once upon a time quite like that 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.240
 flowed nice 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.490
 it was also missed by that as 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.240
 usually we do not have a fitting song about the car 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.140
 it was just a work about the film 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.610
 Wildberger anyway who his life was the West for an end of his eleven 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.040
 Years are extended 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.440
 by Armin Hary not co-sponsored for half so he certainly will 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.110
 not given 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.850
 to work nationwide 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.960
 by Meike Hicken at 1 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.590
 after a moderate 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.600
 it is reminiscent of having won 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.080
 In addition we had an adult for the brakes 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.019
 built-in 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.370
 and for the location air cooler an electric Erwin Fladerer 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.679
 So it's up 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:21.119
 Air France gave presentation Branson cooling stable adjustment electric 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:23.369
 Erwin Diel APPD hatch 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:27.549
 a charging cable so worry the 12 here wants to lie in the car in front of the free fall 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.769
 Chef will also be allowed to referee and seller face before kickoff ten 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.430
 Years later, the car is again in pole position 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.930
 in races in discipline, the legendary in the individual experiences nothing more 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.459
 hear second career 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.840
 next to it another copy of this now become rare 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.089
 Predatory sports car 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:48.439
 The reason for this being better prepared is one, though 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:49.579
 are quite aware 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.109
 and makes about 450 hp 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.079
 the list of exotics is abolished and correct to five from the 8 4 liter displacement 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.650
 a four wheel drive woman the St 1 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.309
 the legendary rally has 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:06.339
 Rennleiter Aliesch farewell from Feldhoff the introductory round of this Roberts the 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:10.529
 Weather conditions fog house rents and thus high demands on the 

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:13.829
 Great Depression driver door on top of touring car 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.839
 and then a novelty on the NÃ¼rburgring the start is given by flank 

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:23.819
 after the day before at the Truck Race the complete died at 5 pm was chosen 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.999
 Behind it, a spectator with the Porsche 911 can take a lead of 400 m 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:31.999
 by Richard Haimann with the 2 0 against Mainz 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.649
 These three can set them off the field in the first round 

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:47.879
 while others the race is over early 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:55.539
 On the very slippery track are also the good 450 hp of the Chevrolet 

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:58.309
 Hardly restraining Jochen's Corvette 

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:01.770
 this slip-up here at Castrol will be people from Darmstadt 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.870
 the on his vehicle basically everything is prepared in hindsight yet 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.870
 hard to deal with 

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:16.499
 Often the burn marks are the author of the two-time SCC overall winner 

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:19.449
 last two years 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:21.340
 slowly on the move 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.340
 the end 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.850
 with the weather conditions, the Audi Quattro s1 naturally shines 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:37.479
 deal 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:42.379
 Four-wheel drive and a five-cylinder deep in the moto2 after all 400 hp make the 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:45.650
 Car for rain because of serious opponents 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.620
 in the largest division 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.870
 at all the complete field of the special force Bangkok fly 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.590
 Point of view 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.319
 through the excellent technology 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:57.319
 and is around others through a growing consciousness 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.699
 2 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.900
 Mugello 

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:20.939
 No 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.370
 2 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:42.339
 at the 

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:45.339
 long 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.030
 with the leading Hans full Borger already at the end of the race again 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.020
 really tight 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.730
 Cozy to pull his tracks if he rushes Willi King 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.689
 in Extremo Porsche 9 35 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:06.409
 but not overlooked 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:09.479
 Driver was a stop the 0 percent replace the two 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.860
 that of course they do that repeatedly 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.780
 the Berlin authorities 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.640
 it is no longer necessary for the school traffic so 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.560
 It describes the oppressive God's help for the first meeting in form 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.810
 a master butcher from Miesbach the winner of the big retail chains 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.380
 to procure is wonderful and ends with another victory 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.819
 retracted the car is 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:37.919
 that already in 1981 it was a premiere caused a sensation
