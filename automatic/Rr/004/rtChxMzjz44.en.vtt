are<00:01:24.369> all<00:01:24.520> blown<00:01:24.820> out<00:01:25.060> so<00:01:26.020> we'll<00:01:26.229> have<00:01:26.350> to

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
are all blown out so we'll have to

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.679 
are all blown out so we'll have to
override<00:01:26.829> the<00:01:27.189> meter<00:01:27.399> to<00:01:28.179> correct<00:01:28.509> the

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
exposure to do that we need to use

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.309 
exposure to do that we need to use
exposure<00:01:32.950> compensation<00:01:33.840> which<00:01:34.840> is<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.140> wheel

on the back of this camera by clicking

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.050 
on the back of this camera by clicking
it<00:01:37.810> two<00:01:38.020> clicks<00:01:38.350> to<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.560> left<00:01:38.890> that<00:01:39.850> will

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
it two clicks to the left that will

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.719 
it two clicks to the left that will
indicate<00:01:40.360> we've<00:01:40.869> gone<00:01:41.110> -<00:01:41.979> two<00:01:42.189> thirds<00:01:42.459> of<00:01:42.610> the

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
indicate we've gone - two thirds of the

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.990 
indicate we've gone - two thirds of the
stop<00:01:43.000> to<00:01:43.569> the<00:01:43.659> dark<00:01:43.899> side

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.090 

that's<00:01:48.690> a<00:01:48.840> little<00:01:49.020> better<00:01:49.170> but<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.070> a

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
that's a little better but that a

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.770 
that's a little better but that a
highlight<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.790> front<00:01:51.000> pair<00:01:51.300> is<00:01:51.480> a<00:01:51.510> little

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
highlight on that front pair is a little

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.050 
highlight on that front pair is a little
burned<00:01:52.020> out<00:01:52.200> still<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.400> let's<00:01:53.580> make<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.820> couple

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
burned out still so let's make a couple

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.710 
burned out still so let's make a couple
of<00:01:54.240> more<00:01:54.420> adjustments<00:01:56.420> we're<00:01:57.420> going<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.600> go

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
of more adjustments we're going to go

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.990 
of more adjustments we're going to go

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
back to our exposure compensation wheel

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.870 
back to our exposure compensation wheel
and<00:02:00.330> click<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.140> down<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.710> more<00:02:01.890> clicks<00:02:02.190> so

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
and click it down to more clicks so

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.990 
and click it down to more clicks so
we're<00:02:03.030> effectively<00:02:03.480> a<00:02:03.630> stop<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.440> a<00:02:04.530> third

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
we're effectively a stop in a third

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.670 
we're effectively a stop in a third
darker<00:02:06.000> than<00:02:06.270> our<00:02:06.390> first<00:02:06.660> exposure<00:02:07.050> which<00:02:07.500> was

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
darker than our first exposure which was

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.160 
darker than our first exposure which was
our<00:02:07.800> automatic<00:02:08.340> exposure

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.979 

and<00:02:42.920> here's<00:02:43.920> our<00:02:44.069> result<00:02:44.519> it<00:02:45.390> seems<00:02:45.689> to<00:02:45.840> be<00:02:45.959> a

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
and here's our result it seems to be a

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.410 
and here's our result it seems to be a
little<00:02:46.230> flat<00:02:46.620> so<00:02:47.430> I<00:02:47.519> think<00:02:47.819> we<00:02:47.970> need<00:02:48.180> to

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
little flat so I think we need to

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.089 
little flat so I think we need to
readjust<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:49.110> fuel<00:02:49.530> car<00:02:51.709> so<00:02:52.709> this<00:02:52.890> is<00:02:52.980> what

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
readjust that fuel car so this is what

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.309 
readjust that fuel car so this is what
we<00:02:53.220> need<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.489> do<00:02:53.640> we'll<00:02:54.450> move<00:02:54.599> the<00:02:54.810> card<00:02:55.049> which

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
we need to do we'll move the card which

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.349 
we need to do we'll move the card which
is<00:02:55.349> in<00:02:55.590> front<00:02:55.829> of<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.069> still<00:02:56.310> life<00:02:56.489> right

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
is in front of the still life right

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.720 
is in front of the still life right
around<00:02:57.629> to<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:57.930> right<00:02:58.140> side<00:02:58.250> so<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.340> becomes<00:02:59.609> a

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
around to the right side so it becomes a

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.300 
around to the right side so it becomes a
strong<00:03:00.030> side<00:03:00.599> light<00:03:00.930> fill<00:03:03.829> it<00:03:04.829> should<00:03:05.069> give<00:03:05.189> us

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
strong side light fill it should give us

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.539 
strong side light fill it should give us
more<00:03:05.340> sculpting<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.390> a<00:03:06.930> much<00:03:07.170> more<00:03:07.829> contrast

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
more sculpting and a much more contrast

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
the background out of focus which adds

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.250
