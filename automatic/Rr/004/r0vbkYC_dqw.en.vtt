00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:16.400
 then this is a review on the truck 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:21.240
 ntn gel excludes parishes 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:24.990
 ntn hitler violet then I am 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.590
 all three are phases c ok so not 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.189
 need basic do from base do 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.980
 of elongation form the crown I have 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:37.590
 heard from a girl that the blues 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.239
 of the caterpillar in the barbarous group that the ice 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.460
 blue loses practically really like 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.379
 ends the spectacular is expected 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.469
 a minute 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:48.210
 then I had a great time with 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.780
 all 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.719
 let's say that I find a lot with customers 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.070
 well in stretching because it's a lot 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.980
 dense 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.649
 only flaw in the ccfl red lamp 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.739
 catalyzes in 90 seconds instead of 60 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.299
 like all the others also in the blue iss 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.860
 I felt good in density 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:14.490
 in the stretching but more in the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.500
 I think this is a summer camber 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.890
 will then be an average of quotes then 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.380
 let's say that with the crear it seems medium 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.509
 I think that in the summer with the bayern and the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.720
 edge king I found myself very well in the 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.670
 crowning even if they are monophasic 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.990
 anyway me 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.110
 mixes I do a stretch hold 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.659
 the harder I do then the convexity I do with 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.259
 that vaio said however after it depends 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:46.450
 also from you how you work then 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.450
 I practically did then 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.240
 a fingernail this here that then after I have it 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.820
 covered than after the crown review a 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.560
 part I did an experiment in fact I have 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.130
 made a mega camber just because 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.310
 I wanted to do an experiment anyway 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.140
 therefore it holds the stapling in the very 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.050
 sense that the thought holds it 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.790
 really good like these here 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.900
 here for example these here you do it with 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.510
 the brad bird 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.260
 but I have to say that the stapling is me 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:22.070
 found good and then we say that I have 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.410
 also done for example now here not 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.750
 I remember if I used the clergy and obvious 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:33.290
 buy also said in this quest 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:37.100
 nail here used the after the disconnected 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.810
 of the rubber hand anyway one of the 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.690
 three now I honestly don't remember 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.090
 however we say that thinkability with the 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.190
 clear good lapini stability with the c2 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.920
 good to thinkability with the bayern not 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.910
 I tried it because it is a gel that 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.910
 however not 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.540
 I don't like to stretch but not because 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.709
 you can't but because I prefer and it is 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.330
 already the hardest then I used to make the 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.900
 convexity in this which will then make one 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.299
 review part for this here so I have 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.239
 used to do the camber also on this 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.440
 and I really found myself very very 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.489
 well 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:21.720
 so let's say they are very valid 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:24.780
 they cost little and therefore for those who want 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.579
 an alternative gel also to not go 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.150
 to take those of knight areas 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:32.489
 that ooze these do not transcend not 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.560
 they give no problems whatsoever to one 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.620
 good grip with the brush then 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:44.190
 let's say I think I paid 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:48.690
 live view from 50 ml 10 euros says in the 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:51.989
 sense the 36 euros I took the ntn I have it 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:55.519
 taken from 30 ml and others from then more 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:58.829
 or less 10 euro 50 ml in short to say 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:01.079
 compassion nails that are very good 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.630
 come 20 euros says here 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:06.239
 We obviously save buying on the site 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.569
 of the pa snow that with 20 euros of 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:12.389
 shipping, of course, is bought when 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.730
 you have to buy it for stuff if not not 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:17.489
 agrees because he went to get 3 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.739
 gel then pay more 20 euros 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.260
 I don't know I made an order more 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.770
 small to see how they were more 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.979
 small paid so much euro 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.110
 where I placed an order of 161 euros where 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.120
 has taken quite a lot of stuff that 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.780
 however you will see in the second channel 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:39.479
 order to the parishes and in any case 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.330
 really very valid certainly not 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.610
 I know when I'll do video tutorials 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.240
 maybe a stretch with one with 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.669
 the other 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.400
 but I wanted to do some things done a little 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:52.379
 for good I did video anyway 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.009
 they say I bought reviews from 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:58.560
 what I think and then maybe go 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.970
 I will also show you a moment how it is 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.370
 working 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:07.740
 nothing for the rest I really am 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:10.680
 found it well and let me know what 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.580
 if you have tried it as you are 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.620
 found 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.270
 if you have any questions when I can 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.599
 I answer 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:21.650
 one last thing even though I would have it 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:25.620
 said in the videos of your questions 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.240
 Give her site still in there passno 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.909
 the Italian flag put the 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.979
 Italian flag and change currency 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:33.780
 in euro a bat is understood with the 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:37.180
 boca 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.820
 okay flag at the top and 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:43.380
 the currency is on the right which is one 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:47.830
 you pull down the dollar 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:49.360
 some currencies currencies apologies if 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.600
 you have questions below in the comments 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.600
