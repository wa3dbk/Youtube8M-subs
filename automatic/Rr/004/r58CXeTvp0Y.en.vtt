00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
let them see it is by clinching it in

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.170 
let them see it is by clinching it in
one<00:02:50.120> of<00:02:50.150> three<00:02:50.330> ways<00:02:51.430> one<00:02:52.430> like<00:02:52.640> this<00:02:52.880> and

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
one of three ways one like this and

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:00.160 
one of three ways one like this and
bending<00:02:53.570> it<00:02:53.660> outward<00:02:55.840> one<00:02:56.840> like<00:02:57.170> this<00:02:59.170> which

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
bending it outward one like this which

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.170 
bending it outward one like this which
kind<00:03:00.410> of<00:03:00.500> brings<00:03:00.620> more<00:03:00.890> attention<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.400> one

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
kind of brings more attention and one

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.850 
kind of brings more attention and one
like<00:03:02.360> this<00:03:02.800> bending<00:03:03.800> inward<00:03:05.200> that<00:03:06.200> one<00:03:06.380> is<00:03:06.620> the

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
like this bending inward that one is the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.060 
like this bending inward that one is the
best<00:03:07.040> method<00:03:07.280> depending<00:03:07.940> Edward<00:03:08.440> so<00:03:09.440> now<00:03:09.590> more

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
best method depending Edward so now more

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.140 
best method depending Edward so now more
on<00:03:10.340> actually<00:03:11.150> grabbing<00:03:11.420> it<00:03:12.100> if<00:03:13.100> you<00:03:13.760> can<00:03:13.910> grab
