00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.330
 all right 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.420
 good very good guys and welcome to 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.400
 my channel I am horse and and the Monday before 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.140
 You're welcome because Monday is always bad 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.490
 day for everyone and you have to start the 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.950
 week with a little energy guys 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.990
 first of all say that this game does not 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.940
 it's my bad is my friend's serious because 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.490
 he has left it to me that aside from not 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.560
 had of place 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.970
 before I pulled this one is late 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.970
 same afternoon I know I'm uploading this 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.220
 pretty pretty late video and I had 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.680
 gameplay what happens that I did not have the 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.489
 capturing put I have taken a 25 to 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.840
 2 in a team match 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.940
 a streak of 15 and followed a run of 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.110
 10 what if they would not have killed 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.420
 maybe it would have been a pretty streak 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.370
 high 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.989
 and the truth has killed me and they have 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.390
 Fucked enough not to have the catch 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.890
 now bet to show us what 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.360
 tell you that this is a great game 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.620
 Ok now I'm going to tell you the weapons and 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.390
 the advantages and everything in case you want 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.930
 try is a game I think stoneware 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.360
 is in xbox is worth playing with the hbr to 3 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.610
 you will have joe vale so it is called alarm not 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.840
 I know if it's an elite weapon or it does not seem like 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.370
 takes like diamond flash I'm not 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.380
 sure to be self camouflage 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.880
 of the weapon because you know that when they give you 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.860
 elite weapons and such also varies 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.270
 camouflage and so on so I do not have any 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.720
 idea no no no no I dare to assure 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.820
 secure nothing because not 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.210
 We ask that you give advantages it takes hardness and 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.430
 Scavenger and brings the advantages the v 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.440
 war with the bomber and the drone of 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.760
 attack all with their respective improvements 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.880
 I'm not going to stop to comment because 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.620
 you will see them when when 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.350
 start killing with them because tell you 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.150
 that he has told me to war with in this 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.930
 game is swelling to kill so 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.310
 we'll have to see him guys he was very 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.930
 bundled this weekend is worth 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.230
 in fact the video that came up on Saturday 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.840
 it was a bit against the clock because no no 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.820
 I could not even put the labels 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.979
 the video is the labels of the end of 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.380
 previous video random video and so on 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.729
 because he did not give me time or according to 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.979
 uploaded the video I was finishing off 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.479
 to shower and then to prepare myself and I was 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.150
 my colleague down with the car waiting for me 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.730
 to go, be the speed that 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.290
 I was wearing and besides, it did not give me time 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.750
 do nothing else in the whole morning that is 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.480
 that he was going to the time trial, he came back at 5 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.950
 the morning because he had a party and such 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.959
 I returned Sunday on Sunday I woke up 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.500
 I went home to my grandparents to eat another 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.269
 town I was eating there when I came back 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.480
 I had this, I had to be with the 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.400
 logical girlfriend because the girlfriend also 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.040
 he needs his time he needs my time 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.110
 go tell the truth guys 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.120
 I did not have time for anything or I got to 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.450
 12 to the computer I was a while 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.989
 talking to colleagues and then I got 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.700
 in bed 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.019
 today I got up and I also had to 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.390
 do several things I've been with the 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.430
 girlfriend with my girlfriend doing some errands 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.560
 after I was with my sister and doing 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.299
 other errands and I have arrived at houses the 7 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.920
 in the afternoon I have set to play table 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.609
 with the party of a game that the 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.609
 he really fucked me up a lot 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.830
 I did not have a catcher, I had 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.720
 taken a 25 to 2 with a run of 15 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.650
 only weapon on a 15- streak and another 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.030
 of 10 and the truth I would have liked 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.860
 bring her by almost a game quite 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.090
 pretty pretty what happens that I did not have 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.860
 the capturing put so I said to 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.970
 my friend greg hey leave me the game by 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.550
 please a game you have out there 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.110
 let it be beautiful italy 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.569
 and it has left me with a good colleague mel 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.920
 left 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.140
 now you are going to see how swells 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.349
 warwick are you going to see 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:37.530
 autopiloted it and you're going to see it in 5 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:39.920
 seconds how many people kill 1 2 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.920
 3 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.910
 4 fix what kills warwick guys 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.190
 If you do not have a blind eye, I tell you that 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.680
 you can or do people say that in this 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.840
 game the streaks are bad is not that 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.700
 be bad is that the blind eye makes you 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.170
 immune to them and in this game then 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.140
 It seems that many people use blind eye 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.569
 I do not see logic to use it neither me nor I 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.099
 personally not a single blind person or use 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.660
 of the unnoticed is that of the cojones 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.310
 that drives me crazy I do not know about you 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.220
 but to me the advantages are 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.620
 unnoticed the blind eye the murderer in 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.630
 other games the ghost to me never me 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.000
 they have liked and the truth gives me a lot 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.669
 People give me disgusted the people who 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.230
 use nothing more than to camp yes 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.940
 let's see what seems perfect to me 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.000
 use those advantages if you are going to play with 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.650
 them well I think perfect and ximo 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.750
 so, if you're going to play with those 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.040
 advantages so that they do not kill you but not 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.620
 neither are you in a corner 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.320
 waiting for someone to pass or what 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.840
 is it is you understand me is that this kind of 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.530
 people is not that I like much 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.360
 I do not like playing with her 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.830
 so guys, I promise you this 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.780

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:15.670
 by winning guys lately I know what 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.460
 only better there have not been videos of 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.020
 games like this because as they 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.240
 I say I have not had time to play no 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.249
 has had time to play just the 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.369
 part of the game 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:29.520
 is being a good game coming out 

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:31.770
 but neither 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.650
 it's being a game where you can 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.319
 take out gameplay you know it's not a game like 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.849
 I say to youtube totally because 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:40.199
 the one that was not for youtube totally 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:41.909
 was the ghost call of duty cost is the 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:44.190
 game for youtube was really bad 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.960
 terrible because it was a real shit or 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.060
 be that game yes that was bad for 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.190
 Youtube 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.870
 but this is costing but the truth 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.950
 people are taking out their little things and 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.169
 it seems that youtube is triumphing 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.150
 this game so we will have to take out 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:58.760
 little things to catch comes quiet 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.740
 lately I 'm catching it 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.050
 if you take a monster I still 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.249
 get more if you take a master 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.479
 you still get it more 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:08.939
 so nothing guys around here has 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:11.279
 finished and you know it has been a 

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:13.049
 aerial killing with the gusts the 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:14.609
 bomber you see that he had killed 

00:06:13.049 --> 00:06:17.549
 three the warwick I do not know how many 

00:06:14.609 --> 00:06:18.689
 killed I do not know if he will have killed 78 only 

00:06:17.549 --> 00:06:20.549
 I know that at the beginning he has just killed 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:22.619
 four people and with that I stayed and 

00:06:20.549 --> 00:06:24.449

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:28.079

00:06:28.079 --> 00:06:31.829
 you have ten missiles you can kill ten 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:34.319
 people even 20 if they are together 

00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:37.499
