00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:09.540
 May 2015 well yes nancy wine on 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.290
 start right away with a new 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.059
 world record 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.980
 this is the record for the biggest 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.870
 strawberry she weighs not less than 250 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.220
 grams it's just huge and clearly 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.220
 it looks like several strawberries in one 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.010
 Oh 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.420
 so I inquired and it's a 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.390
 times what it comes from japan fukushima 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.860
 all this so that's a fact an effort if 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.150
 our nuclear power plants do not fart 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.790
 will not be able to compete 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.200
 thank you in florida we had the 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.670
 opening ceremony of the flying 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.630
 of good hotels so maybe it's because 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.460
 I'm a kid but I find that 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.629
 way too stylish to lego models that's fine 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.629
 to be a kit when a kid in 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:01.860
 and then the ceremony with confetti 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:05.030
 and smoked dragon short the talent is nice 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.030
 but do not break bricks 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.080
 here is the innovation of the day I you 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.490
 presents the smart klate senate suite with 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.110
 three cameras and three balance mics 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.000
 that helps to understand and know 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.470
 what food and on your plate 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.869
 through a connection with your 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.009
 smartphone and it's 99% accurate 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.270
 cost to better plan your food 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:29.539
 following what you have as your goal 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:31.410
 and it's in style 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.580
 what must be said is that people 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.170
 who are so stupid that they have a 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.670
 smarter plate than is this 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.810
 pretty low in and to make it bugger 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.250
 on the other hand it's easy you just have to 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.270
 fuck the japanese strawberry on it 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.350
 australia we were going to see a phenomenon 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.090
 kind of weird 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.560
 indeed since the spider we speak there 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.399
 of millions of bars and deny the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.929
 phenomenon is explained as 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.280
 scientist for example spiders 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.360
 they can climb on the trees themselves 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.550
 make a small parachute with their 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.539
 canvases for traveling with the m ago 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.679
 other phenomena also related to 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.880
 water lifts for example 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.310
 but hey it's still very 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.210
 disturbing 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.410
 it's just a shame that you arrive in 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.550
 australia what it will come to 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.660
 fukushima he might have a chance 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.660
 to turn into a spider man 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.940

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.200
 slice of his mistress and does not notice 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.200
 nothing at all 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.200
 the new video that finally gives a 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.150
 hope in the new generation is 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.099

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.510
 manager at the end who narrowly avoids 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.810
 is really happy with a plateau 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.010
