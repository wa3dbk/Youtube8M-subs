mine<00:04:21.310> is<00:04:21.760> actually<00:04:22.510> tamed<00:04:22.810> I<00:04:23.139> was<00:04:23.470> really

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
mine is actually tamed I was really

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.480 
mine is actually tamed I was really
trying<00:04:23.830> to<00:04:24.070> avoid<00:04:24.310> a<00:04:24.370> whole<00:04:24.610> bunch<00:04:24.820> of<00:04:24.909> product

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
trying to avoid a whole bunch of product

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.920 
trying to avoid a whole bunch of product
because<00:04:25.610> his<00:04:25.729> hair<00:04:25.940> really<00:04:26.120> doesn't<00:04:26.539> like<00:04:26.660> a

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
because his hair really doesn't like a

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.540 
because his hair really doesn't like a
whole<00:04:27.289> bunch<00:04:27.500> of<00:04:27.590> heaviness<00:04:27.949> and<00:04:28.130> heavy

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
whole bunch of heaviness and heavy

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.460 
whole bunch of heaviness and heavy
product<00:04:29.060> so<00:04:29.180> the<00:04:29.300> tar<00:04:29.599> starts<00:04:29.900> tangling<00:04:30.349> it

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
product so the tar starts tangling it

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.290 
product so the tar starts tangling it
dry<00:04:30.740> and<00:04:31.099> I<00:04:31.430> think<00:04:31.669> that<00:04:31.789> that<00:04:31.819> was<00:04:32.030> my<00:04:32.180> mistake

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
dry and I think that that was my mistake

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.879 
dry and I think that that was my mistake
the<00:04:32.599> first<00:04:32.810> time<00:04:32.990> by<00:04:33.110> putting<00:04:33.410> the<00:04:33.500> Admiral

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
the first time by putting the Admiral

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.249 
the first time by putting the Admiral
Sheen<00:04:34.099> in<00:04:34.250> it<00:04:34.370> it<00:04:34.580> was<00:04:35.030> making<00:04:35.479> it<00:04:35.569> shiny<00:04:35.930> but

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
Sheen in it it was making it shiny but

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.879 
Sheen in it it was making it shiny but
it<00:04:36.380> was<00:04:36.500> like<00:04:36.620> mm-hmm<00:04:37.610> that's<00:04:38.479> a<00:04:38.569> no-go<00:04:38.780> so<00:04:39.560> I

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
it was like mm-hmm that's a no-go so I

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.559 
it was like mm-hmm that's a no-go so I
just<00:04:40.310> stuck<00:04:40.520> with<00:04:40.580> why<00:04:40.819> I<00:04:40.849> knew<00:04:41.150> I<00:04:41.210> use<00:04:41.419> my

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:41.569 
just stuck with why I knew I use my

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:43.629 
just stuck with why I knew I use my
glycerin<00:04:42.080> in<00:04:42.199> my<00:04:42.289> noodle<00:04:42.560> head<00:04:42.710> I<00:04:42.889> got<00:04:43.160> defined

really<00:04:57.139> important<00:04:57.860> to<00:04:58.400> get<00:04:58.550> the<00:04:58.729> definition

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
really important to get the definition
