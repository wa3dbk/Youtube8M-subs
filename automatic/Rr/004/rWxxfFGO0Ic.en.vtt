00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 the common chi this is called and wants 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.250
 extract 1 video say what was 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.770
 Answer a question I have received 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.120
 quite the past few days and this is how 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.860
 level up once you get to 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.809
 level 20 so let's continue here for 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.780
 example to my character we are going to mention 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.890
 we see that it comes out above that I'm level 24 and 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.539
 here we can see that it comes out that 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.250
 also level 24 but look here too 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.439
 you know I'm level 20 then how's it going 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.910
 the thing the answer is that to climb 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.490
 level after level 20 you have to 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.380
 equip armor with light as you can see 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.330
 here in my helmet says down there in your 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.369
 states that it has 12 points of light my 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.770
 account says he is 9 impel me this one 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.630
 Perchera says he has 15 thousand boots 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.360
 legendary says he has 22 and by the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.700
 sum of all this gives me 58 points of light 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.230
 that takes me up to level 24 then 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.760
 to level up after level mind 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.950
 we have to equip an armor with light 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.200
 that accumulating the among all 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.480
 will add a point that we say that 3 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.070
 We need some to fill a quota for 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.199
 level up and then I can 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.059
 simply and can also change me 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.559
 my armor and then this one if I wear 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.840
 one with less these light as they see there 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.699
 because this number will decrease as 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.320
 the number that I am this that the number 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.850
 that they have light that they have 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.050
 pieces that I'm putting on now 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.060
 it is much less then 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.280
 It can be decreasing as I can also 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.700
 get it back if I go back put the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.740
 armor that came before so 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.850
 basically to level up be one 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.560
 once I call at level 20 we have to 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.300
 to mature with light the armor that 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.520
 can have light are the rare ones that are 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.080
 those that are blue this 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.850
 legendary that is a purple or 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.320
 the exotic ones that are yellow 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.230
 there are several ways to get these 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.490
 armor the easiest are to repeat 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.650
 the history missions with the 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.120
 difficulty at level 20 or higher and 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.790
 complete until it was a chance to 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.420
 get armor with light this other 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.390
 way is also to play in the crucible and 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.950
 once it's level 20 if you're lucky the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.780
 Reward of the game can be a 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.190
 piece of armor that has both light 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.320
 rare as legendary as well 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.840
 exotic another way is getting 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.240
 engrams the engrams are like planes of 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.550
 weapons and armor that decodes them 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.530
 encrypt here in the tower and if you 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.000
 you wear a blue or purple one you have good 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.030
 odds of receiving a suit of armor 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.980
 rare or superior that has light of last 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.020
 another way to get light is by doing 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.940
 Heroic missions of the day or of the week 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.500
 or the strike two assault missions of 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.160
 vanguard complete these missions 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.260
 also made 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.700
 they received mature with light also others 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.170
 methods and more advanced ways of 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.610
 get armor with light but you're 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.500
 they are the main and the most basic 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.300
 besides being the besides being the 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.730
 unique things you can do as soon as you get to 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.050
 level 20 and what happens with special other 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.700
 character once we are level 20 the 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.110
 experience will not do any good because 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.400
 the experience still serves to raise 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.590
 level our souls to our 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.000
 armors and also to our this the 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.460
 skills of our class if not the 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.650
 let's say it's unlocked 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.090
 all but also this experience 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.530
 It serves for our character if we go to 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.240
 our level in our and our 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.730
 optional we can see that below being a 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.080
 bar that says progress for next 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.370
 atom of light and the thing is that the 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.870
 winning experience will fill 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.600
 this bar and then once you have it 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.610
 you will receive this rare object that is known 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.050
 how to how to use flight mode in English 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.400
 and this you can change it with 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.380
 certain special characters the tower 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.460
 by special objects and once 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.810
 we get to that bar because this one 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.460
 just start making principle 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.320
 fill yes then simply the 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.970
 Let us accumulate experience 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.050
 will give us will give atoms of light that 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.210
 we can also get from others 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.920
 methods but in no method let's say 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.120
 what can we control by winning 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.820
 experience to be able to go getting 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.070
 Psychological this is the way 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.030
 level up 20 this team 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.980
 demonstrator that has 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.690
 the game is suppose to have that doubt 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.950
 they reached level 20 and vienna characters 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.590
 with higher levels and they did not know how 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.910
 level up and I hope that this 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.200
 video help them and any questions that 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.550
 have or goods in the comments if
