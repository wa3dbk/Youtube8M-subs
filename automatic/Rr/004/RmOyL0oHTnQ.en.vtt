00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.859 
this has been my favorite mascara I'm
just<00:01:54.990> fixing<00:01:55.259> up<00:01:55.710> I'm<00:01:56.610> just<00:01:56.939> fixing<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.540> up<00:01:57.689> a

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
just fixing up I'm just fixing it up a

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.170 
just fixing up I'm just fixing it up a
little<00:01:58.079> from<00:01:58.770> how<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.399> left

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
little from how it left

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.300 
little from how it left
because<00:02:00.510> the<00:02:00.840> other<00:02:00.990> mascara<00:02:01.560> can<00:02:01.890> look<00:02:02.100> a

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
because the other mascara can look a

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.770 
because the other mascara can look a
little<00:02:02.730> bit<00:02:03.090> too<00:02:03.420> sloppy<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:06.210> one<00:02:06.510> will

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
little bit too sloppy so this one will

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.219 
little bit too sloppy so this one will
make<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.200> look<00:02:07.410> a<00:02:07.440> little<00:02:07.860> bit<00:02:08.160> better<00:02:09.229> or

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
make it look a little bit better or

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.050 
make it look a little bit better or
maybe<00:02:10.679> even<00:02:11.210> like<00:02:12.210> a<00:02:12.240> spider<00:02:12.870> but<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.710> love<00:02:14.610> my
