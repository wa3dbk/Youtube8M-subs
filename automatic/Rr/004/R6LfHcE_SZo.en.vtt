00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.940
 at the end of July we moved to the 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.129
 soybean province this afternoon 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.139
 we will accompany Alberto Aníbal Álvarez 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:16.619
 in holding a wait for the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.150
 Roe deer is beginning and is a 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.789
 good time to try to shoot down 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.259
 some of these great males that just 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.259
 they show their faces in this era 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.040
 stationed on top of a hillside 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.230
 we await events 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.300
 we dominate a wide valley with an area 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.680
 with the crops still not picked and 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.680
 others already in stubble 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.640
 shortly after sitting down 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.300
 we began to observe movements of 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.300
 several animals 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.030
 this is a pretty nice male but not 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.420
 we throw him for being a copy 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.429
 Young with a lot of future ahead 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.770
 we look goes after the trail of a 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.770
 female as if it were a bloodhound 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.160
 the short while it eats 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.120
 quietly oblivious to the passions that 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.120
 they begin to generate 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.940
 a very young machete with a rope 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.129
 quite poor appears in another planting 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.870
 his movements are slow and it seems 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.739
 hide from the gaze of other males 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.739
 stronger 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.630
 We did not take much time and we have 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.850
 sighted enough animals although in 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.010
 this time most deer are 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.490
 move at the very last hour due to 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.490
 high temperatures 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.950
 hunt the roe deer during the heat 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.720
 allows you to enjoy beautiful and 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.600
 spectacular races of the males 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.690
 after the females 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.770
 all that activity the males do not stop 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.770
 to haunt the females
