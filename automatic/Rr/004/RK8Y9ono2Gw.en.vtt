00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.140
 is life 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.510
 but the play is sometimes or not 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.510
 the motherfucking pass of sofia 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.490
 I would like to play with 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.969
 we 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.969
 to nobody 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.130
 I have created the game 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:35.280
 throw the model towel 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:41.310
 a famous 23 production 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.310
 fast and you're done 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.170
 and the best in Spain 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.150
 because there is no place at all 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.610
 competition with them is an agreement that 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.550
 have no sense context 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.460
 so speaking of that he says I do not have to 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.740
 a friend of mine that is supposed to point 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.850
 from Spain and that says you're bullshit 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.850
 because it's made 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:33.460
 something natural and warm 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:46.979
 and natural but every time it turns 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:46.979
 to people who are stupid who do not reach 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.950
 I do not know well what willy reviewed in the 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.909
 games that you know how to lose 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.909
 the world 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.500
 I have uploaded parts also have 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.190
 that's why I 've done it because 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.190
 there are so many people 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.629
 many let me kill a little I say that 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.250
 I'm going to hook on the human but a 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.250
 imaginary tune 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:33.239
 and you have good too 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.430
 and I had it I erase because the cousins 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.000
 insulting each other promised that a 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.390
 bank since he had won 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.440
 I have to kill a bit said 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.440
 my other planned 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.870
 why do you understand why not kill people for 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:56.129
 do not kill but that's what I say before 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.129
 of one thing and people do the opposite 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:07.230
 It is very easy 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.130
 this and nothing at all 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.710
 you can draw it is clear that you can not take 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.710
 with the coach with that I'm saying 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.560
 at the time of killing 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.980
 many 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.740
 low 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.470
 ideas 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.159
 but the next one I do not wear the 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.420
 ballistics of everyone at home with sister 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.549
 I do not take it out the sister is not me 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.629
 straining to the tip of the knee by 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.760
 want to put the point is worth yes 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.370
 chromatic 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.599
 and the posters of the state yes I think 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.870
 I want to get my gun and then the 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.870
 last 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:25.660
 and that can produce anyone 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.820
 that has not done nobody said a person 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.220
 1010 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.170
 yesterday, it was not known yesterday where yesterday 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.700
 begins with a chain of casualties but the 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.700
 turbine institute 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:48.110
 It happens today a video that puts chain 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:51.790
 salt chain in Turin but not us 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.790

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.630

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:02.640
 because it happened then why why 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.640

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:12.389
 I am a little more than whites 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.389

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.790
 12 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:45.460

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:31.080

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.110
 of what you have over the top 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:44.830
 with the war machine with no exit 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.830
