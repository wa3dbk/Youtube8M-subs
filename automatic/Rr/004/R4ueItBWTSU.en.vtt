00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.069 

and<00:03:20.379> I<00:03:20.980> modeled<00:03:21.459> my<00:03:21.579> early<00:03:22.209> rhythm<00:03:22.540> playing<00:03:22.810> on

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
and I modeled my early rhythm playing on

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.800 
and I modeled my early rhythm playing on
Bruce<00:03:23.500> Welsh<00:03:23.799> from<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.370> shadows<00:03:24.819> he<00:03:25.390> was<00:03:25.569> my

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
Bruce Welsh from the shadows he was my

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.289 
Bruce Welsh from the shadows he was my
big<00:03:26.049> influence<00:03:26.560> you<00:03:26.769> know<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:28.060> then<00:03:28.420> later<00:03:28.900> on

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
big influence you know and then later on

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.309 
big influence you know and then later on
so<00:03:31.299> many<00:03:31.510> other<00:03:32.489> good<00:03:33.489> rhythm<00:03:34.329> players<00:03:34.599> and

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
so many other good rhythm players and

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:36.690 
so many other good rhythm players and
then<00:03:35.590> of<00:03:35.709> course<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.099> other<00:03:36.250> thing<00:03:36.340> that<00:03:36.519> I

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
then of course the other thing that I

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.729

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.350 
and that worked well for me because I
could<00:05:02.920> play<00:05:03.130> that<00:05:03.160> and<00:05:03.580> then<00:05:03.940> my<00:05:04.120> brother

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
could play that and then my brother

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.940 
could play that and then my brother
would<00:05:04.690> take<00:05:04.870> a<00:05:04.900> solo<00:05:05.200> an<00:05:05.470> arm<00:05:05.650> and<00:05:05.830> then

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
would take a solo an arm and then

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:11.970 
would take a solo an arm and then
immediately<00:05:06.130> go<00:05:09.420> so<00:05:10.420> forth<00:05:10.660> but<00:05:11.290> then<00:05:11.500> once<00:05:11.860> I

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
immediately go so forth but then once I

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.730 
immediately go so forth but then once I
got<00:05:12.130> the<00:05:12.250> thumb<00:05:12.460> pick<00:05:13.050> or<00:05:14.050> the<00:05:14.230> thumb<00:05:14.410> pick<00:05:14.590> on

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
got the thumb pick or the thumb pick on

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.500 
got the thumb pick or the thumb pick on
them<00:05:14.950> that<00:05:15.220> made<00:05:15.430> it<00:05:15.580> a<00:05:15.640> lot<00:05:15.760> easier<00:05:15.820> for<00:05:16.450> me

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
them that made it a lot easier for me

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.050 
them that made it a lot easier for me
but<00:05:17.440> I<00:05:17.650> still<00:05:17.800> figured<00:05:18.310> a<00:05:18.370> way<00:05:18.400> of<00:05:18.670> being<00:05:18.940> able

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
but I still figured a way of being able

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.770 
but I still figured a way of being able
to<00:05:20.250> place<00:05:21.250> trumped<00:05:21.760> with<00:05:22.060> the<00:05:22.270> with<00:05:22.630> the

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
to place trumped with the with the

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.410 
to place trumped with the with the
thumping<00:05:23.250> yeah<00:05:24.250> don't<00:05:24.520> leave<00:05:24.730> every<00:05:25.090> playing

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
thumping yeah don't leave every playing

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.540 
thumping yeah don't leave every playing
solo<00:05:25.840> a<00:05:26.050> leading<00:05:26.440> time<00:05:26.710> with<00:05:26.980> the<00:05:27.070> company<00:05:27.280> so

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
solo a leading time with the company so

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.090 
solo a leading time with the company so

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
it sounds great yeah and it's really

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.580 
it sounds great yeah and it's really
difficult<00:05:30.460> because<00:05:30.940> people<00:05:31.600> who<00:05:31.690> play<00:05:31.900> faster

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
difficult because people who play faster

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.130 
difficult because people who play faster
solo<00:05:32.950> or<00:05:33.490> leader<00:05:33.730> where<00:05:34.270> I<00:05:34.300> mostly<00:05:34.870> use<00:05:35.110> it
