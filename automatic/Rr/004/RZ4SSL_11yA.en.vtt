can see that that areas just coming up
nice<00:03:09.330> if<00:03:10.330> you<00:03:10.540> have<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:11.459> local<00:03:12.459> that's<00:03:13.049> in<00:03:14.049> a<00:03:14.290> lot

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
nice if you have a local that's in a lot

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.539 
nice if you have a local that's in a lot
better<00:03:14.830> quality<00:03:15.160> and<00:03:15.610> has<00:03:15.760> a<00:03:15.790> matte<00:03:16.120> finish<00:03:16.150> I

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
better quality and has a matte finish I

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.850 
better quality and has a matte finish I
would<00:03:18.549> suggest<00:03:19.200> trying<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.440> little<00:03:20.680> area

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
would suggest trying a little area

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.699 
would suggest trying a little area
inside<00:03:21.459> first<00:03:21.850> to<00:03:22.180> see<00:03:22.420> what<00:03:22.959> effect<00:03:23.350> it<00:03:23.500> has

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
inside first to see what effect it has

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.460 
inside first to see what effect it has
but<00:03:23.980> you<00:03:24.070> could<00:03:24.310> you<00:03:24.760> could<00:03:24.940> use<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:26.440> could

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
but you could you could use you could

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.569 
but you could you could use you could
still<00:03:26.829> use<00:03:27.010> page<00:03:27.340> but<00:03:27.610> I<00:03:27.820> would<00:03:28.209> just<00:03:28.239> the

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
still use page but I would just the

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.110 
still use page but I would just the
tiniest<00:03:30.579> amount<00:03:31.060> and<00:03:31.360> then<00:03:32.290> just<00:03:32.590> sort<00:03:32.799> of<00:03:33.120> so

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
tiniest amount and then just sort of so

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.600 
tiniest amount and then just sort of so
it<00:03:34.239> doesn't<00:03:34.570> really<00:03:35.530> wet<00:03:35.950> anything<00:03:36.430> you<00:03:36.579> just

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
it doesn't really wet anything you just

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.759 
it doesn't really wet anything you just
you<00:03:37.299> can<00:03:37.420> see<00:03:37.600> it's<00:03:37.750> not<00:03:37.870> you<00:03:38.140> can't<00:03:38.380> even<00:03:38.620> see

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
you can see it's not you can't even see

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.009 
you can see it's not you can't even see
it<00:03:38.890> going<00:03:39.070> on<00:03:39.310> but<00:03:39.459> it's<00:03:39.820> just<00:03:40.030> clean<00:03:40.989> it

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
it going on but it's just clean it

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.500 
it going on but it's just clean it
better<00:03:41.950> than<00:03:42.190> nothing<00:03:42.519> at<00:03:42.670> all

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
better than nothing at all

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.880 
better than nothing at all
they<00:03:45.510> say<00:03:45.780> again<00:03:46.319> you<00:03:46.500> can<00:03:46.650> buff<00:03:46.890> it<00:03:47.040> up<00:03:47.219> and

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
they say again you can buff it up and

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.630 
they say again you can buff it up and
okay<00:03:49.890> that<00:03:50.750> works<00:03:51.750> for<00:03:52.049> all<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.250> rolling

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640

little bit you can see that the brush is
getting<00:05:09.930> quite<00:05:10.080> dirty<00:05:10.440> upon<00:05:15.320> and<00:05:16.320> then<00:05:16.500> you

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
getting quite dirty upon and then you

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.439 
getting quite dirty upon and then you
can<00:05:16.860> just<00:05:17.039> clean<00:05:17.310> off<00:05:17.490> where<00:05:17.760> it<00:05:17.940> wherever<00:05:18.180> you

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:38.309 
okay I think that takes care of most of
cleaning<00:05:31.910> and<00:05:32.210> I<00:05:35.050> found<00:05:36.050> this
