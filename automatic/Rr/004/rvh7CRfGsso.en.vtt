than this interest yeah all right so
let's<00:00:17.250> explain<00:00:17.580> what<00:00:17.730> we're<00:00:17.850> doing<00:00:18.150> here<00:00:18.359> with

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
let's explain what we're doing here with

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.900 
let's explain what we're doing here with
the<00:00:18.660> gas<00:00:19.109> detector<00:00:19.650> well<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.730> major

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
the gas detector well this is the major

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.490 
the gas detector well this is the major
part<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.539> here<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.810> course<00:00:21.990> it's<00:00:22.230> got<00:00:22.380> the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
part of it here of course it's got the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.920 
part of it here of course it's got the
board<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:22.920> here<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.670> tells<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.390> solenoid

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
board in here and it tells the solenoid

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.420 
board in here and it tells the solenoid
here<00:00:25.109> what<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.470> do<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.800> open<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.189> close

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
here what to do to open and close

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.880 
here what to do to open and close
literally<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.390> solenoid<00:00:27.689> that's<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.470> detector

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
literally a solenoid that's the detector

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.169 
literally a solenoid that's the detector
that's<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.160> detector<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.699> Luther<00:00:29.910> if<00:00:30.029> this

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
that's the detector and Luther if this

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.030 
that's the detector and Luther if this
detects<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.900> leak<00:00:31.080> it's<00:00:31.289> gonna<00:00:31.470> shut<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
detects a leak it's gonna shut the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.530 
detects a leak it's gonna shut the
someone<00:00:32.309> right<00:00:32.430> off<00:00:32.460> shutting<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.120> gas<00:00:33.270> off

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
someone right off shutting the gas off

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.990 
someone right off shutting the gas off
to<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.809> system<00:00:34.230> okay<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.890> solenoid<00:00:35.370> goes

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
to the system okay the solenoid goes

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.240 
to the system okay the solenoid goes
underneath<00:00:36.600> right<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:37.530> always<00:00:37.860> it's<00:00:38.070> always

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
underneath right it's always it's always

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.100 
underneath right it's always it's always
near<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.550> propane<00:00:38.969> tank<00:00:39.270> right<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.930> we've

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
near the propane tank right and we've

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.780 
near the propane tank right and we've
checked<00:00:40.379> out<00:00:40.559> already<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:41.250> okay<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
checked out already and it's okay the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.459 
checked out already and it's okay the
problem<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.180> here<00:00:42.420> okay<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:42.960> we<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.350> to

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
problem is here okay so we have to

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.080 
problem is here okay so we have to
replace<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.920> guy<00:00:44.100> right<00:00:44.250> there<00:00:44.280> correct<00:00:44.879> and

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
replace that guy right there correct and

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.880 
replace that guy right there correct and
it's<00:00:45.210> wired<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.690> here<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.079> let<00:00:46.230> me<00:00:46.289> go<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.590> here

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
it's wired in here so let me go in here

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.920 
it's wired in here so let me go in here
okay<00:00:49.520> as<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.789> can<00:00:50.910> see<00:00:51.059> there<00:00:51.270> really<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.600> much

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
okay as you can see there really is much

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.860 
okay as you can see there really is much
to<00:00:52.350> these<00:00:52.590> two<00:00:53.520> screws<00:00:53.879> hold<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.329> man<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.629> I

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
to these two screws hold of man and I

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.540 
to these two screws hold of man and I
think<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.379> manufacturers<00:00:56.129> recommended

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
think the manufacturers recommended

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.189 
think the manufacturers recommended
these<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.969> be<00:00:57.030> replaced<00:00:57.420> about<00:00:57.660> every<00:00:57.899> five

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
these to be replaced about every five

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.510 
these to be replaced about every five
years<00:00:58.500> regardless<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.219> whether<00:00:59.340> they're

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
years regardless of whether they're

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.880 
years regardless of whether they're
working<00:00:59.640> or<00:00:59.910> not<00:00:59.969> for<00:01:00.359> safety<00:01:00.780> no<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.710> this

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
working or not for safety no and so this

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.319 
working or not for safety no and so this
is<00:01:02.070> seen<00:01:02.250> its<00:01:02.399> better<00:01:02.550> days<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.149> time<00:01:03.300> to

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
is seen its better days so it's time to

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.820 
is seen its better days so it's time to
place<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.870> obviously<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.409> has<00:01:04.559> been<00:01:04.710> in

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
place it obviously this has been in

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.219 
place it obviously this has been in
there<00:01:04.949> more<00:01:05.100> than<00:01:05.189> five<00:01:05.400> years<00:01:05.430> right<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.600> you

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
there more than five years right and you

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.600 
there more than five years right and you
just<00:01:07.380> need<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.560> pay<00:01:07.770> attention<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.250> your<00:01:08.369> wires

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
just need to pay attention to your wires

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.670 
just need to pay attention to your wires
if<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:08.970> take<00:01:09.150> them<00:01:09.270> off<00:01:09.420> one<00:01:09.659> at<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.840> time<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
if you take them off one at a time the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.590 
if you take them off one at a time the
red<00:01:10.950> wires<00:01:11.460> aren't<00:01:11.729> polarized<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.390> makes<00:01:12.510> a

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
red wires aren't polarized it makes a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.179 
red wires aren't polarized it makes a
difference<00:01:12.930> which<00:01:13.260> one<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.590> red<00:01:13.740> goes<00:01:13.979> to

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
difference which one that red goes to

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.310 
difference which one that red goes to
okay<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.030> let's<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.390> do<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.750> one<00:01:15.900> at<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.110> time

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
okay so let's just do it one at a time

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.590 
okay so let's just do it one at a time
like<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.710> said<00:01:17.009> some<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.850> them<00:01:17.939> have<00:01:18.090> wire<00:01:18.299> nuts

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
like I said some of them have wire nuts

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.410 
like I said some of them have wire nuts
on<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.189> some<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.310> them<00:01:20.400> have<00:01:20.610> butt<00:01:20.909> connectors

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
on and some of them have butt connectors

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.940 
on and some of them have butt connectors
you<00:01:21.540> may<00:01:21.659> have<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.900> cut<00:01:22.140> them<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.380> solder<00:01:22.740> them

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
you may have to cut them and solder them

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.070 
you may have to cut them and solder them
ER<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:24.060> either<00:01:24.390> way<00:01:24.600> it's<00:01:24.720> not<00:01:24.869> very

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
ER but either way it's not very

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.890 
ER but either way it's not very

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
you get the wires straight it's really

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.450 
you get the wires straight it's really
not<00:01:36.720> difficult<00:01:36.900> anybody<00:01:37.650> can<00:01:37.860> do<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.189> just

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
not difficult anybody can do this just

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.850 
not difficult anybody can do this just
watch<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.180> wiring<00:01:39.509> code<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.200> like<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.799> said

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
watch the wiring code and like I said

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.670 
watch the wiring code and like I said
you<00:01:41.159> there's<00:01:41.729> really<00:01:41.909> not<00:01:42.240> much<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
you there's really not much to that the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.010 
you there's really not much to that the
yellow<00:01:43.890> wire<00:01:44.159> goes<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> solenoid<00:01:45.420> and

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
yellow wire goes to the solenoid and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.800 
yellow wire goes to the solenoid and
then<00:01:46.590> simply<00:01:47.159> put<00:01:47.369> this<00:01:47.490> back<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:48.119> all<00:01:48.600> right

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
then simply put this back in all right

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.480 
then simply put this back in all right
two<00:01:49.170> screws<00:01:49.500> go<00:01:49.710> right<00:01:49.890> back<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.340> same

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
two screws go right back in the same

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.950 
two screws go right back in the same
spot<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.149> like<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.630> said<00:01:51.750> I've<00:01:51.990> tested<00:01:52.439> this

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
spot and like I said I've tested this

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.459 
spot and like I said I've tested this
solenoid<00:01:54.960> before<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:55.979> we<00:01:56.100> know<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.579> works

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
solenoid before so we know that it works

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:59.929 
solenoid before so we know that it works
so<00:01:58.469> we're<00:01:58.590> literally<00:01:58.950> all<00:01:59.310> we<00:01:59.490> need<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.670> do<00:01:59.820> is

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
so we're literally all we need to do is

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.420 
so we're literally all we need to do is
turn<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.299> on<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.740> can<00:02:01.890> see<00:02:02.040> it's<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
turn this on and you can see it's in the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.490 
turn this on and you can see it's in the
reset<00:02:02.820> mode<00:02:03.060> now<00:02:03.270> it'll<00:02:03.509> do<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:03.840> roughly<00:02:04.229> for

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
reset mode now it'll do this roughly for

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.039 
reset mode now it'll do this roughly for
about<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> minute<00:02:05.040> mm-hmm<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.030> then<00:02:06.899> you'll

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
about a minute mm-hmm and then you'll

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.589 
about a minute mm-hmm and then you'll
hear<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.290> solenoid<00:02:07.829> click<00:02:08.300> and<00:02:09.300> then<00:02:09.420> we'll

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
hear the solenoid click and then we'll

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.050 
hear the solenoid click and then we'll
have<00:02:09.810> gas<00:02:10.050> at<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.319> time<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:11.489> part<00:02:11.879> here

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
have gas at that time this part here

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.790 
have gas at that time this part here
