00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
and my 10 inch pan now what I what I did

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.750 
and my 10 inch pan now what I what I did
went<00:02:10.379> right<00:02:10.560> by<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.770> instructions<00:02:11.400> at<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
went right by the instructions at the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.460 
went right by the instructions at the
culinary<00:02:12.180> fanatic<00:02:12.629> talks<00:02:12.900> and

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
culinary fanatic talks and

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.640 
culinary fanatic talks and
I<00:02:13.550> put<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.670> into<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.910> oven<00:02:15.030> in<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:16.110> cleaning

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
I put it into the oven in the cleaning

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.580 
I put it into the oven in the cleaning
mode<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:17.700> only<00:02:18.180> did<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.420> for<00:02:18.510> about<00:02:18.780> an<00:02:18.930> hour<00:02:18.990> and

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
mode I only did it for about an hour and

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.830 
mode I only did it for about an hour and
it<00:02:20.490> was<00:02:20.670> pretty<00:02:20.940> hot<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.540> basically

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
it was pretty hot and it basically

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.440 
it was pretty hot and it basically
strips<00:02:22.530> off<00:02:22.709> everything<00:02:23.220> then<00:02:23.850> he<00:02:23.880> also<00:02:24.090> talks

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
strips off everything then he also talks

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.809 
strips off everything then he also talks
about<00:02:24.540> another<00:02:24.750> method<00:02:25.260> for<00:02:25.470> using<00:02:25.819> oven

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
about another method for using oven

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.730 
about another method for using oven
cleaner<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.300> actually<00:02:27.450> used<00:02:28.260> oven<00:02:28.530> cleaner

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
cleaner and I actually used oven cleaner

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.500 
cleaner and I actually used oven cleaner
as<00:02:28.890> well<00:02:28.920> just<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.459> get<00:02:29.610> everything<00:02:29.910> off<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.330> it

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
as well just to get everything off of it

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.270 
as well just to get everything off of it
be<00:02:31.020> careful<00:02:31.410> wear<00:02:31.560> gloves<00:02:31.830> if<00:02:32.070> you're<00:02:32.190> going

be careful wear gloves if you're going

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.850 
be careful wear gloves if you're going
to<00:02:32.370> do<00:02:32.520> that<00:02:33.020> and<00:02:34.020> then<00:02:34.170> he<00:02:34.320> talks<00:02:34.560> about

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
to do that and then he talks about

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.420 
to do that and then he talks about
taking<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.459> drill<00:02:35.930> with<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.990> wire<00:02:37.350> brush<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:37.950> and

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
taking a drill with a wire brush and and

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.030 
taking a drill with a wire brush and and
cleaning<00:02:39.390> this<00:02:39.480> out<00:02:39.690> cleaning<00:02:40.440> off<00:02:40.620> all<00:02:40.830> of

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
cleaning this out cleaning off all of

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.680 
cleaning this out cleaning off all of
that<00:02:41.220> little<00:02:42.030> high<00:02:42.180> spots<00:02:42.569> and<00:02:44.450> getting<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.540> a

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
that little high spots and getting it a

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.330 
that little high spots and getting it a
little<00:02:45.720> smoother<00:02:46.320> it<00:02:46.530> doesn't<00:02:46.950> really<00:02:47.130> you

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
little smoother it doesn't really you

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.040 
little smoother it doesn't really you
don't<00:02:47.430> really<00:02:47.640> care<00:02:47.940> or<00:02:48.510> need<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.900> get<00:02:49.020> a

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
don't really care or need to get a

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.390 
don't really care or need to get a
smooth<00:02:49.350> you<00:02:49.530> can<00:02:49.560> kind<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:49.920> see<00:02:50.070> that<00:02:50.220> there's

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
smooth you can kind of see that there's

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.650 
smooth you can kind of see that there's
actually<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.790> little<00:02:51.000> bit<00:02:51.120> of<00:02:51.209> it<00:02:51.330> looks<00:02:51.600> like

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
actually a little bit of it looks like

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.040 
actually a little bit of it looks like
orange<00:02:51.989> peel<00:02:52.350> I<00:02:52.560> think<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.310> actually<00:02:53.610> helps

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
orange peel I think that actually helps

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.670 
orange peel I think that actually helps
to<00:02:55.489> keep<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.610> pans<00:02:56.880> fairly<00:02:57.600> nonstick<00:02:58.050> but<00:02:58.290> I

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
to keep the pans fairly nonstick but I

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.920 
to keep the pans fairly nonstick but I
think<00:02:59.010> it<00:02:59.100> works<00:02:59.280> both<00:02:59.519> ways<00:02:59.750> whatever<00:03:00.750> you

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
think it works both ways whatever you

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.170 
think it works both ways whatever you
like<00:03:01.050> but<00:03:01.110> let<00:03:01.500> me<00:03:01.560> show<00:03:01.769> you<00:03:01.830> now<00:03:01.920> also<00:03:02.250> what<00:03:03.150> I

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
like but let me show you now also what I

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.290 
like but let me show you now also what I
did<00:03:03.510> that<00:03:03.660> he<00:03:03.810> didn't<00:03:04.230> talk<00:03:04.380> about<00:03:04.590> was<00:03:05.550> I<00:03:05.820> used

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
did that he didn't talk about was I used

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.009 
did that he didn't talk about was I used
a<00:03:06.450> file<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:07.680> go<00:03:07.830> along<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.250> sides<00:03:08.489> all<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.900> way

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
a file to go along the sides all the way

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.160 
a file to go along the sides all the way
around<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:11.340> thing<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:12.420> handles<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.050> went

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
around the thing the handles and went

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.350 
around the thing the handles and went
inside<00:03:13.290> here<00:03:13.709> where<00:03:13.860> all<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.220> those<00:03:14.370> casting

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
inside here where all of those casting

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.569 
inside here where all of those casting
marks<00:03:15.660> were<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.200> then<00:03:16.860> I<00:03:17.130> took<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:19.070> I<00:03:20.070> took<00:03:20.549> a

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
marks were and then I took a I took a

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.120 
marks were and then I took a I took a
half<00:03:21.209> or<00:03:21.570> a<00:03:21.600> round<00:03:21.870> file<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:22.709> did<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:22.920> same

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
half or a round file and did the same

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.340 
half or a round file and did the same
thing<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.519> all<00:03:23.670> these<00:03:23.880> edges<00:03:24.329> little<00:03:25.110> holes

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
thing to all these edges little holes

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
thing to all these edges little holes
all<00:03:26.220> these<00:03:26.579> round<00:03:26.850> spots<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.450> hear<00:03:27.600> both<00:03:28.140> sides

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
all these round spots to hear both sides

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.280 
all these round spots to hear both sides
file<00:03:29.370> those<00:03:29.640> down<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.180> because<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:30.900> didn't

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
file those down and because I didn't

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.539 
file those down and because I didn't
have<00:03:31.500> I<00:03:33.110> didn't<00:03:34.110> have<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.320> drill<00:03:35.130> with<00:03:35.310> that

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
have I didn't have a drill with that

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.370 
have I didn't have a drill with that
wire<00:03:35.820> brush<00:03:36.630> I<00:03:36.930> simply<00:03:37.650> used<00:03:37.829> a<00:03:37.950> really<00:03:38.130> heavy

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
wire brush I simply used a really heavy

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.530 
wire brush I simply used a really heavy
sandpaper<00:03:40.380> and<00:03:41.040> it<00:03:41.220> worked<00:03:41.430> fine<00:03:41.700> it<00:03:42.030> probably

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
sandpaper and it worked fine it probably

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.360 
sandpaper and it worked fine it probably
took<00:03:42.959> me<00:03:43.019> I'm<00:03:43.410> probably<00:03:43.620> working<00:03:43.920> to<00:03:44.070> each<00:03:44.190> of

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
took me I'm probably working to each of

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.710 
took me I'm probably working to each of
these<00:03:44.430> pans<00:03:45.079> for<00:03:46.079> a<00:03:46.110> good<00:03:46.850> 25<00:03:47.850> or<00:03:48.030> 30<00:03:48.269> minutes

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
these pans for a good 25 or 30 minutes

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.390 
these pans for a good 25 or 30 minutes
you<00:03:49.380> know<00:03:49.530> just<00:03:49.709> standing<00:03:49.860> it<00:03:50.100> all<00:03:50.190> down<00:03:50.370> I

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400
