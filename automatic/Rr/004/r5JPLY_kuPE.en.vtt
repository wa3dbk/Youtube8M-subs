00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:07.459
 seen me as a man or friend and 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.979
 no more than filmmaker then somewhere 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:12.230
 The camera was included but was 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.880
 never present i can get a part of 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.739
 our conversation actually straight with 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.690
 me talked and the camera but only 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.269
 a witness to it actually or takes 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.130
 but the most important person was me because 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:26.019
 I also saw a lot more because I too 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.730

 collaboration 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:42.349

 Judge BÃ¶hm would you visit Europe at this 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:48.390
 strong character 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.460
 I find the many similarities 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.890
 between such businesses and men 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.340
 Survival story we have 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.530
 Do not think so easily abandoned both 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.960
 ibrahim with his art as with humans 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.180
 bypasses and speaks without 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.850
 German knowledge has found new way

 new hope found switzerland and 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.680
 then I am the same as myself 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.640
 I had to leave my country and me 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.470
 had to flee 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.260
 I 'm laying back in Switzerland 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.000
 I did everything to find my way back 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.710
 to turn my films again and me 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.060
 have managed to find a deep 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.060
 Today I'm really overjoyed 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.070
 you have to say you have to say you are 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:35.850
 already 65 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:37.800
 you are already you get ahv the 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.180
 film is ready but our lives are on 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.340
 further divided from a friendship 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.400
 has and actually this film has us 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.440
 brought closer together just as much 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.540
 also film the children with their father and 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.940
 who brought together the family 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.459
 and I think that's very good too 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.680
 film was a reason that the family 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.660
 comes together again despite all 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.100
 difficulties have lived here and 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.100
 that is also a positive side 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.090
