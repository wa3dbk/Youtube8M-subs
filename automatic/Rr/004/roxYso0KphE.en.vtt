down is it the back so his heads on a
swivel<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.100> he's<00:01:02.820> also<00:01:03.090> running<00:01:03.420> proximity

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
swivel and he's also running proximity

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.590

not<00:01:37.229> going<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.470> win<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.650> match<00:01:37.920> if<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.400> don't

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
not going to win a match if you don't

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.120 
not going to win a match if you don't
have<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.030> if<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.659> don't<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.049> tank<00:01:40.350> on<00:01:40.530> this

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
have to if you don't have a tank on this

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.130 
have to if you don't have a tank on this
mode<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:42.060> IBM<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.600> doing<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.780> good<00:01:42.899> job<00:01:42.960> of

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
mode so IBM is doing a good job of

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.810 
mode so IBM is doing a good job of
watching<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.710> front<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.100> watching<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
watching the front and watching the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.700 
watching the front and watching the
right<00:01:45.030> now<00:01:45.270> let's<00:01:45.390> talk<00:01:45.540> about<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:45.930> z11<00:01:46.200> and

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
right now let's talk about this z11 and

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.770 
right now let's talk about this z11 and
a<00:01:46.799> little<00:01:47.009> bird<00:01:47.189> thing<00:01:47.490> as<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.450> can<00:01:48.570> see<00:01:48.689> I'm

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
a little bird thing as you can see I'm

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.789 
a little bird thing as you can see I'm
getting<00:01:48.960> locked<00:01:49.200> I'm<00:01:49.350> trying<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.590> figure<00:01:49.710> out

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
getting locked I'm trying to figure out

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.950 
getting locked I'm trying to figure out
where<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.130> coming<00:01:50.159> from<00:01:50.399> it's<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:51.570> dance

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
where it's coming from it's this dance

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.249 
where it's coming from it's this dance
so<00:01:52.890> what<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.610> perfect<00:01:53.880> target<00:01:54.149> for<00:01:54.390> z11<00:01:54.750> a

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
so what is the perfect target for z11 a

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.399 
so what is the perfect target for z11 a
tank<00:01:55.920> at<00:01:56.159> distance<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.329> tank<00:01:57.659> at<00:01:57.869> an<00:01:57.990> angle

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
tank at distance and a tank at an angle

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.190 
tank at distance and a tank at an angle
so<00:01:59.130> what<00:01:59.610> can<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.909> do<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.180> make<00:02:00.600> life<00:02:00.869> tough

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
so what can you do to make life tough

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.039 
so what can you do to make life tough
for<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.530> z11<00:02:01.710> or<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.700> little<00:02:02.880> bird<00:02:03.060> or<00:02:03.240> attack

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
for the z11 or the little bird or attack

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.490 
for the z11 or the little bird or attack
chopper<00:02:04.500> drive<00:02:05.369> underneath<00:02:05.939> him<00:02:06.329> use<00:02:07.259> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
chopper drive underneath him use the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.380 
chopper drive underneath him use the
buildings<00:02:07.920> recover<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.580> maps<00:02:08.789> like<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.209> you

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
buildings recover and maps like this you

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.750 
buildings recover and maps like this you
got<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.539> little<00:02:09.720> building<00:02:10.379> cover<00:02:10.619> not<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.400> lot<00:02:11.640> of

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
got a little building cover not a lot of

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.130 
got a little building cover not a lot of
space<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.000> play<00:02:12.270> on<00:02:12.420> this<00:02:12.540> one<00:02:12.690> but<00:02:12.870> drive

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
space to play on this one but drive

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.860 
space to play on this one but drive
underneath<00:02:13.500> them

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
underneath them

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.300 
underneath them
so<00:02:14.110> what<00:02:14.319> happens<00:02:14.739> when<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:15.010> drive

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
so what happens when you drive

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.250 
so what happens when you drive
underneath<00:02:15.610> them<00:02:15.940> they<00:02:16.720> all<00:02:16.840> of<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:16.959> sudden

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
underneath them they all of a sudden

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.930 
underneath them they all of a sudden
don't<00:02:17.470> have<00:02:17.680> an<00:02:17.799> egg<00:02:17.950> they<00:02:18.519> have<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.760> make<00:02:18.909> a

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
don't have an egg they have to make a

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.110 
don't have an egg they have to make a
hard<00:02:19.209> decision<00:02:19.590> do<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:20.620> turn<00:02:20.890> around<00:02:21.250> above

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
hard decision do I turn around above

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.809 
hard decision do I turn around above
this<00:02:22.269> tank<00:02:22.569> try<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.319> get<00:02:23.530> an<00:02:23.620> angle<00:02:23.950> meanwhile

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
this tank try to get an angle meanwhile

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.670 
this tank try to get an angle meanwhile
you're<00:02:25.390> still<00:02:25.870> putting<00:02:26.200> yourself<00:02:26.590> under

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
you're still putting yourself under

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.100 
you're still putting yourself under
Neath<00:02:26.950> I'm<00:02:27.099> hoping<00:02:27.580> he<00:02:28.269> messes<00:02:28.659> up<00:02:28.690> with<00:02:28.989> an

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
Neath I'm hoping he messes up with an

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.160 
Neath I'm hoping he messes up with an
angle<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.560> you<00:02:30.190> get<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.370> pot<00:02:30.610> shot<00:02:30.640> on<00:02:31.060> him<00:02:31.209> but

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
angle and you get a pot shot on him but

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.990 
angle and you get a pot shot on him but
let's<00:02:32.680> say<00:02:32.860> he's<00:02:32.950> trying<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.340> maneuver<00:02:33.579> above

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
let's say he's trying to maneuver above

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.160 
let's say he's trying to maneuver above
you<00:02:34.180> what<00:02:34.780> is<00:02:34.900> he<00:02:35.049> doing<00:02:35.379> he's<00:02:36.370> distracted

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
you what is he doing he's distracted

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.319 
you what is he doing he's distracted
he's<00:02:38.170> worrying<00:02:38.530> about<00:02:38.650> you<00:02:39.239> trying<00:02:40.239> to

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
he's worrying about you trying to

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.990 
he's worrying about you trying to
acquire<00:02:40.720> a<00:02:40.780> shot<00:02:41.340> meanwhile<00:02:42.340> he's<00:02:42.700> getting

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
acquire a shot meanwhile he's getting

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.720 
acquire a shot meanwhile he's getting
popped<00:02:43.569> by<00:02:43.840> snipers<00:02:44.379> assault<00:02:45.280> rifles

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
popped by snipers assault rifles

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.449 
popped by snipers assault rifles
carbines<00:02:46.180> RPGs<00:02:47.109> javelins<00:02:47.799> the<00:02:48.010> whole<00:02:48.190> nine

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
carbines RPGs javelins the whole nine

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.150 
carbines RPGs javelins the whole nine
yards<00:02:48.970> so<00:02:49.629> it's<00:02:49.840> more<00:02:50.049> of<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.260> stall<00:02:50.620> technique

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
yards so it's more of a stall technique

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.550 
yards so it's more of a stall technique
and<00:02:51.400> a<00:02:51.940> positioning<00:02:52.629> technique<00:02:53.049> where<00:02:53.470> you

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
and a positioning technique where you

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.740 
and a positioning technique where you
could<00:02:53.709> take<00:02:53.890> a<00:02:53.920> pop<00:02:54.220> shot<00:02:54.519> on<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:55.269> guy<00:02:55.420> if<00:02:55.690> they

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
could take a pop shot on the guy if they

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.259 
could take a pop shot on the guy if they
get<00:02:56.140> too<00:02:56.410> low<00:02:56.680> if<00:02:56.950> their<00:02:57.400> angle<00:02:57.790> is<00:02:57.849> not<00:02:57.970> steep

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
get too low if their angle is not steep

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.690 
get too low if their angle is not steep
enough<00:02:58.420> you'll<00:02:59.140> blow<00:02:59.470> them<00:02:59.650> up<00:02:59.859> a<00:03:00.069> lot<00:03:00.459> because

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
enough you'll blow them up a lot because

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.970 
enough you'll blow them up a lot because
the<00:03:00.970> lead<00:03:01.209> isn't<00:03:01.510> much<00:03:01.900> up<00:03:02.349> close<00:03:02.590> it's

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
the lead isn't much up close it's

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.270 
the lead isn't much up close it's
actually<00:03:03.280> no<00:03:03.609> lead<00:03:04.170> but<00:03:05.170> over<00:03:05.620> ranges<00:03:06.069> and<00:03:06.220> you

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
actually no lead but over ranges and you

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.680 
actually no lead but over ranges and you
can<00:03:06.400> see<00:03:06.519> this<00:03:06.609> guy<00:03:06.790> just<00:03:06.849> fall<00:03:07.269> from<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.540> sky

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
can see this guy just fall from the sky

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.750 
can see this guy just fall from the sky

right<00:03:56.799> now<00:03:56.980> I'm<00:03:57.310> hitting<00:03:57.579> with<00:03:57.699> the<00:03:57.730> HMG<00:03:58.329> so

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
right now I'm hitting with the HMG so

00:03:59.079 --> 00:03:59.970 
right now I'm hitting with the HMG so
there's<00:03:59.199> two<00:03:59.319> things<00:03:59.470> you<00:03:59.590> can<00:03:59.739> do<00:03:59.829> with<00:03:59.889> the

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
there's two things you can do with the

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.830 
there's two things you can do with the
HMG<00:04:00.280> you<00:04:00.519> can<00:04:00.639> either<00:04:00.760> damage<00:04:01.269> a<00:04:01.329> helicopter

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
HMG you can either damage a helicopter

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.449 
HMG you can either damage a helicopter
or<00:04:01.959> shoot<00:04:02.500> them<00:04:02.530> out<00:04:02.739> with<00:04:02.919> that<00:04:03.069> thing<00:04:03.099> the

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
or shoot them out with that thing the

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.789 
or shoot them out with that thing the
lmg<00:04:03.849> you<00:04:04.359> just<00:04:04.629> gotta<00:04:04.780> hope<00:04:05.049> that<00:04:05.349> the

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
lmg you just gotta hope that the

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.170 
lmg you just gotta hope that the
peashooter<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.430> frozen<00:04:06.760> pea<00:04:06.879> shooter

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
peashooter the frozen pea shooter

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.059 
peashooter the frozen pea shooter
actually<00:04:07.599> shoots<00:04:08.199> out<00:04:08.319> the<00:04:08.440> chopper<00:04:08.709> pilot

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
actually shoots out the chopper pilot

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.189 
actually shoots out the chopper pilot
that's<00:04:09.310> why<00:04:09.489> I<00:04:09.519> like<00:04:09.579> HMG<00:04:10.209> it<00:04:10.419> does<00:04:10.870> a<00:04:10.900> ton<00:04:11.169> of

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:11.199 
that's why I like HMG it does a ton of

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:12.809 
that's why I like HMG it does a ton of
damage<00:04:11.440> to<00:04:11.650> infantry<00:04:12.129> in<00:04:12.310> this<00:04:12.549> spot<00:04:12.760> right

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
splash damage is enough to kill them

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.850 
splash damage is enough to kill them
because<00:04:54.210> usually<00:04:54.420> when<00:04:54.750> we<00:04:54.930> pillar<00:04:55.200> or<00:04:55.530> hug

corners<00:04:56.310> we<00:04:56.610> don't<00:04:56.760> step<00:04:57.090> away<00:04:57.210> ten<00:04:57.570> feet

corners we don't step away ten feet
we're<00:04:58.710> right<00:04:58.890> then<00:04:59.070> I'm<00:04:59.160> going<00:04:59.310> to<00:04:59.340> take<00:04:59.400> a

potshot at our z11 just to be that guy

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.630 
potshot at our z11 just to be that guy
because<00:05:03.450> he<00:05:03.570> scared<00:05:03.840> me<00:05:03.900> you<00:05:04.320> could<00:05:05.130> shoot<00:05:05.520> a

because he scared me you could shoot a

and you'll be surprised how many kills
you<00:05:10.020> get<00:05:10.200> or<00:05:10.380> if<00:05:10.980> there's<00:05:11.190> two<00:05:11.370> guys<00:05:11.520> stand

third guy that's laying prone and IBM
and<00:05:21.240> I<00:05:21.300> are<00:05:21.450> trying<00:05:21.720> to<00:05:21.840> even<00:05:22.230> the<00:05:22.470> team's<00:05:22.710> and

down the instant spawn chopper but

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
obviously that's not working at this

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
bit that does ample tank damage I don't

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.170

it<00:05:33.480> can<00:05:34.170> make<00:05:34.380> the<00:05:34.560> difference<00:05:35.270> and<00:05:36.270> you<00:05:36.450> got

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
it can make the difference and you got

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.430 
it can make the difference and you got
to<00:05:36.600> keep<00:05:36.780> that<00:05:36.840> thing<00:05:37.110> down<00:05:37.290> because<00:05:37.740> it<00:05:37.890> is<00:05:38.460> as

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
to keep that thing down because it is as

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.470 
to keep that thing down because it is as
it<00:05:40.440> is<00:05:40.800> his<00:05:40.950> bogey<00:05:41.250> would<00:05:41.370> say<00:05:41.550> it<00:05:42.090> can<00:05:42.300> be<00:05:42.450> a

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480 
it is his bogey would say it can be a

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.850 
it is his bogey would say it can be a
Mexican<00:05:42.870> bus<00:05:43.050> you<00:05:43.380> know<00:05:43.470> if<00:05:43.560> you<00:05:43.620> get<00:05:43.740> two

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
Mexican bus you know if you get two

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:44.990 
Mexican bus you know if you get two
different<00:05:43.950> guys<00:05:44.160> in<00:05:44.220> the<00:05:44.430> squad<00:05:44.580> holding

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
different guys in the squad holding

spawn<00:05:45.270> and<00:05:45.450> stuff<00:05:45.600> like<00:05:45.720> that<00:05:45.780> and<00:05:46.200> everybody

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
spawn and stuff like that and everybody

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.250 
spawn and stuff like that and everybody
jumps<00:05:47.310> out<00:05:47.400> at<00:05:47.520> one<00:05:47.910> time<00:05:48.240> and<00:05:48.540> we<00:05:48.930> don't<00:05:49.050> have

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
jumps out at one time and we don't have

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.850 
jumps out at one time and we don't have
a<00:05:49.320> fiesta<00:05:49.560> so<00:05:50.490> that's<00:05:51.060> a<00:05:51.180> free<00:05:51.360> kill<00:05:51.740> he<00:05:52.740> was

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
a fiesta so that's a free kill he was

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.200 
a fiesta so that's a free kill he was
already<00:05:53.010> going<00:05:53.220> down<00:05:53.460> he<00:05:53.700> probably<00:05:53.910> had<00:05:54.090> two

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
already going down he probably had two

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.210 
already going down he probably had two
percent<00:05:54.540> hit<00:05:54.660> points<00:05:55.050> and<00:05:55.230> the<00:05:55.770> carcass<00:05:56.100> is

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
percent hit points and the carcass is

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.100 
percent hit points and the carcass is
kind<00:05:56.400> of<00:05:56.460> freaking<00:05:56.730> out<00:05:56.790> there<00:05:57.060> so<00:05:57.390> people<00:05:57.570> are

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
kind of freaking out there so people are

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.740 
kind of freaking out there so people are
spotting<00:05:58.500> it<00:05:58.650> they<00:05:59.280> got<00:05:59.430> their<00:05:59.610> tank<00:05:59.820> back<00:06:00.060> he

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
spotting it they got their tank back he

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.780 
spotting it they got their tank back he
probably<00:06:01.020> got<00:06:01.260> c4<00:06:02.250> or<00:06:02.430> something<00:06:02.670> like<00:06:02.730> that

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
probably got c4 or something like that

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.870 
probably got c4 or something like that
so<00:06:03.240> now<00:06:03.870> I'm<00:06:04.170> changing<00:06:04.830> my<00:06:04.860> side<00:06:05.280> to<00:06:05.520> my<00:06:05.670> right

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 
so now I'm changing my side to my right

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.940 
so now I'm changing my side to my right
side<00:06:06.180> and<00:06:06.570> don't<00:06:06.780> forget<00:06:07.020> the<00:06:07.200> old<00:06:07.320> reactive

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
side and don't forget the old reactive

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.430 
side and don't forget the old reactive
dance<00:06:08.210> that<00:06:09.210> you<00:06:09.300> can<00:06:09.480> do<00:06:09.630> if<00:06:09.840> you<00:06:09.900> take<00:06:10.260> damage

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
dance that you can do if you take damage

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.250 
dance that you can do if you take damage
lose<00:06:10.890> reactive<00:06:11.400> on<00:06:11.520> one<00:06:11.700> side<00:06:12.050> spin<00:06:13.050> to<00:06:13.200> the

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.260 
lose reactive on one side spin to the

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.560 
lose reactive on one side spin to the
other<00:06:13.470> side<00:06:13.850> spin<00:06:14.850> to<00:06:14.970> the<00:06:15.060> front<00:06:15.360> where<00:06:15.540> you

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570 
other side spin to the front where you

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.660 
other side spin to the front where you
take<00:06:15.810> the<00:06:15.930> least<00:06:16.110> amount<00:06:16.290> of<00:06:16.530> damage<00:06:16.590> so<00:06:17.100> what

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:17.670 
take the least amount of damage so what

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.190 
take the least amount of damage so what
it<00:06:17.760> can<00:06:17.910> be<00:06:18.030> is<00:06:18.210> it<00:06:18.330> can<00:06:18.420> be<00:06:18.540> left<00:06:18.720> side<00:06:18.960> damage

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
it can be is it can be left side damage

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.640 
it can be is it can be left side damage
front<00:06:19.860> damage<00:06:20.310> right<00:06:21.060> side<00:06:21.390> damage<00:06:21.690> then<00:06:22.350> back

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
front damage right side damage then back

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.740 
front damage right side damage then back
to<00:06:22.830> front<00:06:23.130> as<00:06:23.280> you're<00:06:23.640> rotating<00:06:23.910> your<00:06:24.390> tank

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
to front as you're rotating your tank

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.510 
to front as you're rotating your tank
around<00:06:24.930> right<00:06:25.740> give<00:06:25.950> him<00:06:26.070> all<00:06:26.220> different

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
around right give him all different

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.020 
around right give him all different
angles<00:06:26.610> so<00:06:26.910> he<00:06:27.540> eats<00:06:27.780> up<00:06:28.020> reactive<00:06:28.950> front<00:06:29.790> shot

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
angles so he eats up reactive front shot

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.520 
angles so he eats up reactive front shot
which<00:06:30.330> only<00:06:30.540> takes<00:06:30.660> a<00:06:30.990> little<00:06:31.020> bit<00:06:31.260> of<00:06:31.320> health

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530
