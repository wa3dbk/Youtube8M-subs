machine<00:02:18.710> even<00:02:19.400> though<00:02:19.520> we<00:02:19.670> hadn't<00:02:19.970> been<00:02:20.090> in<00:02:20.210> it

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
machine even though we hadn't been in it

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.220 
machine even though we hadn't been in it
before<00:02:20.660> so<00:02:21.010> felt<00:02:22.010> very<00:02:22.160> comfortable<00:02:22.460> with<00:02:22.970> it

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230

actually<00:02:28.100> very<00:02:28.130> nice<00:02:28.700> to<00:02:28.760> drive<00:02:29.150> compared<00:02:29.660> to

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
actually very nice to drive compared to

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.150 
actually very nice to drive compared to
us<00:02:29.810> some<00:02:30.110> of<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.290> other<00:02:30.410> ones<00:02:30.620> that<00:02:30.800> I've<00:02:30.920> ran

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
took some high-speed turns with it

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.530 
took some high-speed turns with it
handled<00:02:39.590> great<00:02:39.880> almost<00:02:40.880> like<00:02:40.970> a<00:02:41.030> sports<00:02:41.270> car

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540
