nose on this car is the least radical of
all<00:01:55.090> so<00:01:55.299> far<00:01:55.600> but<00:01:56.139> we<00:01:56.229> haven't<00:01:56.380> seen<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.770> Red

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
Bull yet my bet the Red Bull looks more

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.620 
Bull yet my bet the Red Bull looks more
