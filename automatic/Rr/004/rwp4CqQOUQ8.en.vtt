 i 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.910
 d 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:16.049
 nobody imagines what it is that makes one without 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.180
 home that is to be without a father without 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.390
 a mother without a roof and stay alone in 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.630
 the world my name is joanne alberto 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.790
 lopez ardila I am 27 years old being so 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.280
 only one child at 5 years of age 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.510
 my family has vandalized me I stayed 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.629
 alone in the world without knowing what to do 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.670
 but thank god he and cf rescued me and 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.480
 from that moment I am in protection of 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.380
 family welfare 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.690
 they placed me in substitute home there 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.350
 I found love, the love that I 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.059
 I needed some parents that without being my 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.300
 biological parents mediate a support 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.879
 unconditional 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.969
 in my case it is special if I was given the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.969
 opportunity 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.400
 to go out for adoption 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:05.360
 but by destinations 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:09.340
 or I would call him the things of God 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:13.090
 I would have for that family 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.100
 one more substitute for me is my mom the 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.819
 I want very much she has given many 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.469
 things for me the truth was already the one that 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:23.380
 supported with the study of the university 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:25.659
 So I think that's why we have to 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.079
 To have a lot of heart and to love myself 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.969
 the most important thing for the development of 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.140
 a child that is in a process of 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:35.259
 right restoration that is 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.439
 abandoned is a substitute home a 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.479
 Substitute home is a very place 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.030
 I have the privilege in the world 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.390
 to belong to the icbf program as 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.509
 substitute home precisely as its 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.509
 name indicates it by never replacing 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.479
 a biological family because it is not 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:58.629
 our idea but rather taking care and 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.369
 protecting supporting all these children 

00:01:58.629 --> 00:02:02.500
 girls and teenagers who come to 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.409
 our green toad home that takes a 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.379
 sunbath near the juices 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:11.379
 we open the doors of our home 

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:13.750
 so that the children feel as if 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:16.989
 were on their own they were 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.540
 It provides well-being much support 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:23.049
 teaches that they should have a self-esteem 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:27.760
 unique for your training as people 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:32.410
 adults are given the study their 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.319
 feeding your room and first of all 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.890
 love the comfort that the 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:41.410
 hope for a better life while 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.700
 solves your problem in your family 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:48.790
 the boss has given me the support that a 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.069
 child needs replaces everything that the 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.110
 biological parents should give that to me 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.890
 He also gave the institute that 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.530
 gave a surrogate mother who welcomed me 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.569
 as a son and that was super important in 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.730
 that situation and she accompanied me in everything 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.819
 the process of restoring 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.819
 rights 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.420
 and our home is very happy 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.120
 personally I feel very happy when 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.280
 these children already have to fly from 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.060
 our home are made about 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.900
 champions some good people are going 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.799
 very nourished because 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.140
 all that is health nutrition education 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:33.629
 is the number one factor in your rights 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.090
 and you have to do perfectly with that 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.590
 the substitute doctor but my home or if 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.780
 everything was the best that I could have 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.000
 past in my life and today I am here as 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.620
 witness that substitute households are 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.370
 the best option for children who have 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.370
 lost everything in life
