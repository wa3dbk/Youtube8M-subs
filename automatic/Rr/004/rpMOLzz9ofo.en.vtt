 no no 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.750
 hi how about friends how are you 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.760
 welcome welcome to the art channel 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.320
 nelson if I am nelson once again here 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.880
 well demonstrating this in this way more 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.920
 easy to do things in this video 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.049
 I'm going to teach you how to make an easy fund 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.820
 and economically I the day of how I'm going to 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.189
 do it so pay close attention 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.810
 in health for all of you many 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.730
 thank you because this channel is 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.560
 growing every day below the 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.330
 good materials for the development of 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.269
 this project is going to need the 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.270
 next tools a pliers and a 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.010
 playón fillets glue do not have can 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.660
 use hot silicone you're also going to 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.700
 So use the following materials 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.160
 wooden strips we will also use 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.410
 a strip or a tape in this case is a 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.289
 cord type two types of planting 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.820
 permanent markers that you no longer 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.670
 serve a plug 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.530
 These plugs are also PVC for the 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.010
 arm of another pop monkey we will use 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.500
 a tube of PVC of half an inch a tube 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.840
 give you that same but three-eighths 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.030
 that is, it should be smaller and the tube 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.000
 earlier that I mentioned a rod 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.200
 turned three quarters and also 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.009
 we have these 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.590
 I shot the butterfly type good I'm going to 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.270
 show briefly the process of 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.920
 how the assembly is done due to 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.869
 I can not show you everything 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.520
 it worked on what is wood but 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.350
 today I'm going to show you next 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.899
 with your wooden strip you must 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.140
 share it in three pieces so 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.390
 that from here you will get the support to join your 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.610
 phone that process a little bit long and 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.770
 I've already created two pieces of 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.929
 wood the dimensions are twelve 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.939
 centimeters and takes out eight and this one 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:41.000
 has zinc so here it goes to 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.189
 fit the rotating part or the head 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.860
 of our car that I had not 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.500
 said at the beginning we cut it to a 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.869
 height where your phone goes then in 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.060
 this case to enter my phone 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.739
 approximately has eight then 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.649
 centimeters of medium taken the measure of 

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:59.630
 this cardboard to indicate you is not going to 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.399
 to be more or less this space what 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.079
 next thing you're going to do is screw it 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.079
 observe this here is not tail 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:07.610
 it is simply liquid glue or 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.530
 also known as a witch or 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.389
 superbowl applies and on top of it 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.140
 bicarbonate and then it looks good 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:14.390
 stuck by 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.250
 you are going to take the score with your saw going 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.870
 to cut approximately 5 centimeters and 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.480
 half or six centimeters first 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.310
 you are going to wáyar with a drill of the width of 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.680
 the rod in this case is 34 that 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.640
 traverse the rod then it will be a 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.890
 cut will help you with a few blades or 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.200
 you can also warm up these two are 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.570
 the capons that come in the marker 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.340
 it's just finished markers for 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.050
 put one on each side so this 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.870
 be a little more now they are going to trace 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.459
 or you are going to cut the length that you decide 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.870
 in your world, I have 50 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.330
 centimeters usually the monopostos 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.190
 come 40 and 30 walker in the part 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.660
 from below to make it the vent and 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.459
 at the top to make it the 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.290
 sure in the other tube you are going to put 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.660
 covers to wrap covers inside 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.519
 Inside the case contains a small piece 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.140
 that so that the pressure and if you see that it 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.700
 You software is very much going to put a 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.010
 rod in the part of ventel thing 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.660
 next is that the plugs that you 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.700
 I had told him to make a hole 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.530
 way that entertained three-eighths the 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.570
 base piece is also going to be made of wood 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.090
 shows and is going to have a hole that 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.560
 through both ends will enter 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.670
 in the previous piece that I had told you 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.830
 this is going to be our rotating head 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.510
 ok once I had all these parts 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.819
 let's make the assembly as a measure 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.920
 and we introduce we see that it is very good 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.140
 I have that if they existed it is done 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.819
 approximately one meter one time 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.239
 proven to those we proceed to do what 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.800
 following 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.470
 right here is where you go insert 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.360
 the big tube or the pvc tube you go to 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.250
 proceed to put glue on these 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.060
 ends for almost this is achieved paste 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.250
 okay 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.230
 for more information I'll leave you 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.269
 here below the graphical way that I am going to 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.830
 upload for you to observe if ideas 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.590
 as in building so 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.390
 graphic for the second part is the 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.250
 phone holder remembers that the 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.540
 phone is going to be here then this 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.950
 you must hold on to do this 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.440
 we are going to make a true and 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.299
 we are going to use there the formwork we are going to 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.480
 use the two washers and also 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:05.100
 let's use the hook we do this 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.010
 previously with the marker what serves 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.480
 this first we passed the hook 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.400
 then we put a washer or a 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.530
 knee we have the planting that can be 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.530
 any cut according to him because that 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.150
 need and then cabinet screws 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.609
 every time we want to put it 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.380
 we would only raise pressure 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.030
 down would make that inside phone it 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.920
 stay fixed is a very 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.540
 in doing so I recommend that you leave it 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.880
 well pressed for when you go to the 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.950
 beach somewhere because this is very 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.360
 fixed and you can take pictures then let's go 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.280
 to do the assembly to do that 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.530
 we only locate the part that is going to go 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.370
 forwards and we're going to go through the 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.350
 rod that we had cut 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.810
 above which call for which 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.150
 enter what we locate larroudé the type 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.760
 butterfly then this would already be panel 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.650
 regulation that is how you stay for 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.200
 the pop monkey will grant all source has 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.940
 the same structure that the 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.010
 bad monoposto that I teach you here in this 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.460
 so if they realize they have the same 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.080
 is identical and here is only for 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.650
 put it here once it is well then 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:08.780
 given the color of all the steps to 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.780
 perform something like that 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.669
 an amazing month and super super typhoon 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.490
 but I have all my video I will do the 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:20.300
 first shots ok ok for it I'm going to 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:24.330
 use my phone if you visualize 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:26.610
 Well, there is an interest in my image and 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:33.979
 you see that it is already mounted in the world by 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:33.979
 observe, I'm already recording my motorcycle 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:40.240
 it's a very fixed instrument and you can 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.040
 set my camera for a while 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.230
 determined for me to take the courts 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.190
 then it will start to discount for 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.190
 I will use it 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.930
 and it is the contribution that we get 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.430
 with our pop background but you like it 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.500
 record already know the little man up 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:00.480
 subscribe comment in the part of 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.480
 down 9 next video bye
