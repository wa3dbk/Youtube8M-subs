00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
this end because that would be bad so

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.650

now<00:01:31.830> we<00:01:32.830> are<00:01:32.950> just<00:01:33.160> going<00:01:33.340> to<00:01:33.610> take<00:01:34.119> and<00:01:34.390> do<00:01:34.630> a

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
now we are just going to take and do a

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.109 
now we are just going to take and do a
series<00:01:34.930> of<00:01:35.200> cuts<00:01:35.440> straight<00:01:35.920> down<00:01:36.160> across<00:01:36.729> the

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
series of cuts straight down across the

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:44.370 
series of cuts straight down across the
ones<00:01:37.270> we<00:01:37.390> just<00:01:37.600> did<00:01:38.110> just<00:01:39.360> like<00:01:40.360> this<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:43.380> this

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
ones we just did just like this and this

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:57.330 
ones we just did just like this and this
will<00:01:44.560> create<00:01:44.680> a<00:01:45.100> very<00:01:45.759> small<00:01:46.060> dice

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.580 

and<00:01:58.340> that<00:01:59.119> is<00:01:59.540> everything<00:01:59.960> this<00:02:00.290> way<00:02:00.409> you're

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
and that is everything this way you're

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.020 
and that is everything this way you're
only<00:02:00.680> wasting<00:02:00.890> this<00:02:01.250> tiny<00:02:01.490> little<00:02:01.640> bit<00:02:01.880> here

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
only wasting this tiny little bit here

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.990 
only wasting this tiny little bit here
on<00:02:02.119> the<00:02:02.210> end<00:02:02.530> so<00:02:03.530> now<00:02:03.770> I'm<00:02:04.640> gonna<00:02:04.760> put<00:02:04.909> this

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
on the end so now I'm gonna put this

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.430 
on the end so now I'm gonna put this
aside<00:02:05.150> and<00:02:05.479> to<00:02:05.630> peel<00:02:05.810> our<00:02:05.900> garlic<00:02:06.140> real

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
aside and to peel our garlic real

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.480 
aside and to peel our garlic real
quickly<00:02:06.680> and<00:02:06.860> then<00:02:06.979> we're<00:02:07.070> going<00:02:07.159> to<00:02:07.250> kind<00:02:07.369> of

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
quickly and then we're going to kind of

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.319 
quickly and then we're going to kind of
break<00:02:08.000> things<00:02:08.240> up<00:02:08.509> and<00:02:08.630> we<00:02:08.780> usually<00:02:09.080> do<00:02:09.200> it
