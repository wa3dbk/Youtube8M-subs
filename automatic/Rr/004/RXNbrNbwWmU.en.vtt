00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.480
 Oh 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.550
 tonight 

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:40.179
 c 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.280
 hello my chicken we find ourselves 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.559
 today for the first roasters 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.760
 report I take you to the exhibition of 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.829
 paris video game 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.230
 exhibition that stands the city of 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.690
 science and industry until 24 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.850
 August 2014 that was imagined and designed by 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.610
 one of the big heads of ubisoft whose 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.750
 I forgot the name 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.680
 in any case I know he worked 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.680
 on assassin's foot 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.600
 in any case I know he worked 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.450
 on the murderer skier fucking he has 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.330
 worked on assassin's creed ii 4 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.680
 black flag 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.050
 as much to warn you right away 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.730
 video content is a lot less 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.580
 provided that what I wanted you did not 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.180
 been easy at all to be able to film at 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.470
 interior 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.870
 so I did as I could I go 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.600
 still you m small sequences 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.310
 video I managed to film followed by 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.650
 three photos I confess that I am 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.570
 a little disgusted but I wanted when 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:45.660
 even posted this video to give you 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:48.759
 my opinion on this expo and show you 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:52.229
 we see quite briefly how that 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.229
 match so it's gone 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.450
 good 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.450
 and 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.790
 as I told you I have almost 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.129
 could not film the exhibition itself 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.140
 I wanted to turn the intro of this 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.840
 video inside the city of 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.629
 science and I was forbidden donations 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.269
 that wanted to turn outside with 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:00.360
 only the facade in the background on me 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.580
 forbid being moderately to kill 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.900
 a security officer or finish at the 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.150
 cops for a youtube video 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.730
 I left suddenly my impressions 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.519
 on this expo are a little tainted 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.709
 objectively the video game expo is 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.510
 very small on some sites 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.069
 it is written thousand square meters 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.079
 maybe they counted the attic 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.690
 corridors and toilets the stands 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.000
 in themselves are rather funny by 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:28.440
 against then we have things going 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:33.420
 rather recent video game collectors 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:37.019
 for the uncharted 3 ultimate box 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.209
 helmet edition of the gast a statue is 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.020
 of connor quesnoy in assassin's creed 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.390
 but also a lot of 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:50.780
 retro console then dainese segas 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:52.760
 controllers of old games , one of which 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.160
 stands that I liked the most it was 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.080
 a mechanical pong those who know 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.240
 do not darken the game with both socks and 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.920
 the fight pixel will be sent so 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.900
 why mechanical because he 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.310
 it was not a video game but a 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.170
 real playing machine 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.319
 good we went there was also a booth 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:13.069
 kinect with panoramic screen of stands 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.659
 fps 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.310
 where the screen is replaced as a species 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:19.370
 bubble that envelops us it was 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.789
 sound pretty good games 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.160
 ordis i also want to create our own 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:27.800
 platform game that needed 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:32.150
 try to finish I have not managed to 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:36.169
 finish otherwise the expo was rife with 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:39.410
 interactive terminals you can choose 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:42.230
 of wells or not being able to information 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.300
 on your certain cult characters 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.920
 video games of known players from 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.070
 professional players of the developers 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.810
 of all kinds go around without 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.880
 to be bored 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.230
 it takes half an hour 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.720
 good after that remains affordable is in 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.760
 excess 12 euros I think the normal rate 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.430
 and 9 euros for under 25s 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.380
 goes up a little bit under a lot more if 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.180
 you go through the shop box before 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.830
 to go out again that does not break three 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.610
 paws interrupts touch a lot of 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.170
 books of magazines of small goodies 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.920
 very expensive but not much 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:17.420
 can find on the internet or in 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.420
 various shops that make time 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:23.210
 are really original it's nice if 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:25.550
 you are Parisian go ahead frankly 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.890
 it's always a nice outing if 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.360
 you live a little further 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.040
 very honestly you do not piss off at 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.330
 go up to Paris for that I hope that 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.030
 despite all the problems that I have 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.860
 met to turn that you liked 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.540
 I really did my best as 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.130
 usually do not hesitate to subscribe 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.950

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.000
