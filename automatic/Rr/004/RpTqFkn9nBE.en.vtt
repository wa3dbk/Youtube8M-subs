00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.129
 the kennemerduinen written sources from the time that jesus lives 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.530
 the approach to the Dead Sea on the West Bank 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.259
 found at the u19 47 manuscripts from the beginning of our era 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.889
 the manuscripts contain a wealth of information about Jewish society 

00:00:26.889 --> 00:00:28.249
 around the year zero 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:32.349
 theologians anker by man investigated the role of the disabled in time 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.730
 that deliver jesus 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.069
 they used these dead sea scrolls for that 

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:39.479
 that were discovered by accident by a Bedouin sixty years ago 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.070
 after the opening went looking for a cigarette 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.120
 with a rocky area more donors to the Dead Sea 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.480
 and Gordon becoming a big one to see if the facts might be themselves 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.180
 and then heard the earth work break he thought hey there is a treasure in one 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.000
 big 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.860
 and he went to look he found unfortunately went darling winnings no gold and silver 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.470
 but books that were crawling through 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.460
 he took the kitchen with him to see if it could make any money 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.940
 and then it turned out that those jugs and not the notebook that it contained 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.520
 invaluable for science 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.800
 what were the oldest religious manuscripts found so far 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.800
 were and the children 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.450
 Now you have texts that the Bedouins had found that this is just the tip of it 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.780
 to be the iceberg 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.479
 because they have found many other texts 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.090
 ten other major ones 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.790
 who says the lyrics belong to the group 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.270
 who called themselves the SCM and that was Jewish groups 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.350
 who are very focused on exactly following Jewish law 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.220
 and in such a case, they were also a celibate, that is 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.190
 to have a wife 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.700
 in the same week 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.050
 yes put into work in a cave 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.440
 who like here and there have split off from him therefore even stricter with it 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.110
 inspect the law and they also thought the end of the times was near 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.749
 used to be 

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:08.749
 they could see they had the woman hanging they no longer needed 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:17.519
 beh 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.110
 I have our backyard in what way that already in the victory 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.059
 talked about people who have physical defects 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:27.739
 then I checked whether such a physical defect also had consequences 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.739
 for social and religious participation in that community 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:35.389
 a procession held this season no that's just the crazy thing 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:39.350
 I'm going to think about makes I think he was very common in that period 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.599
 that's almost nothing written about 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.599
 and I think that was very common because almost everyone has some sort of 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.879
 physical chemistry pack was in that time because you have to imagine that 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.679
 if we break our leg now we go to the doctor and he puts the mountain guide around it 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:58.769
 but then and of course do not happen because there were many doctors and the 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.069
 giving green hem legs to each other 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.739
 and we go to the optician and let him know 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.120
 but at a time when none begin so people like me don't do so well 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.579
 could see now I am considered blind 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.279
 you didn't have a chora price either 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:17.139
 so I think there were a lot of people who somehow 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.959
 physically no I have tears 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.589
 nevertheless his review text 

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:25.350
 defeats is found of the 800m texts 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.210
 income 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.860
 both are to five who say something very short about none I have the 

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:39.119
 the fact that I think I have examined his texts to read the rules 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:42.879
 towards the sc rules for the people who comment 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:47.099
 And I have you buy a rule that is going to buy the blind and the deaf 

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:50.899
 and the following is said about winter 

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:54.219
 already mansouri if you email for the team 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:58.329
 You have when it is not right how it feels to have to beat in her again 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:03:59.329
 home 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:00.629
 and that means 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.059
 and about the blind 

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:05.539
 who can't see if can't watch 

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:09.079
 each individual mixture they cannot see the violation 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:15.079
 the question is why are they just closed out and then it is actually here 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.079
 about 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.109
 it's about sacrificing here 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.699
 and apparently not allowed inside 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:24.150
 a lot of scientists have said after that within that may or we because 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.449
 they are under end 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.330
 therefore driving between the statistics in the silver domain so you do not enter 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.800
 come into contact with religious matters 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.389
 I have looked into the context of this rule and I conclude from that 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.270
 That is about his future you have 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.460
 but that the point is to tie the team just practically unable to 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.590
 about this 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.979
 it says in the text that they cannot keep an eye on this 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:50.919
 and that they cannot see their transgression 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.870
 and I think that means 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.280
 for example, that they can throw something wrong together that makes them 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.139
 suitcase is not good and if a suitcase is not good then something goes very bad 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.190
 wrong according to Jewish thoughts must meet all requirements 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.550
 and that you can't just do something together 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.039
 because or not, something goes wrong 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.039
 and that is the danger and therefore not for the moment 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:15.659
 but not because they are still falling 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:22.550
 I've been viewing texts all the time 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.129
 I translated you 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:26.419
 for example, this is a text that goes 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.210
 that disabled people may not be present at the meeting 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.400
 I have but I have made a look at Italy what exactly is there 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.410
 but also what is not there 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.879
 dick lawyer van z also inside 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:43.119
 there is no mention of inequality it is then I think 

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:46.489
 that is not the reason why those people are excluded but another 

00:05:46.489 --> 00:05:46.990
 reason 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.990
 if an orange was important, they would have added that 

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:06.169
 the five extra I've investigated that doesn't exclude a crime 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:09.550
 with that exclusion with I don't think they were allowed in that community 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.159
 live 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:13.650
 but it means that they were not allowed to participate in certain situations 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.750
 And they were not allowed to join in for the few practical considerations or because they were not 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.960
 were safe enough 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.319
 but not because they make orange for example 

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:24.659
 that's why it's important for the public 

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:27.740
 well in the new testament people talk a lot about people with 

00:06:27.739 --> 00:06:30.529
 handicaps and other things he has done 

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:33.999
 and New Testament is asthma from about the same period 

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:35.419
 worry 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:39.120
 and if you compare that to my research, coming was a very strict one 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.279
 lawful the cult 

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:42.990
 and even come on 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.630
 were those people who can win total parias here deduce that he 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.810
 perhaps did not take him as a pariah in the New Testament 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.289
 were considered 

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:54.460
 so we can nuance the picture with my research
