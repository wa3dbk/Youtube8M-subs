00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.500
 Hello 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.450
 with this engraving machine 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.570
 surely you have seen some 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.540
 there in some fair for band bracelets 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.980
 and such is not because it is not made 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.009
 totally recycled things all 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.599
 all the springs for example are those of 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.189
 mier 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.980
 these shooters are those of the shooters 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:31.420
 of the kitchen cabinets in these 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.420
 moths are from an antenna 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.280
 everything all everything that is here here is a 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.559
 piece of the first of these things that 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.019
 they are left over from the kitchen when it gets into 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.790
 kitchen and the oven whatever it is a 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.920
 trance and media 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.270
 this has had several battles has been 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.060
 several things already that's why you have these 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.910
 holes not this 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.610
 on this side then the legs are of 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.230
 old TVs and it has taken advantage 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.370
 to be the legs of the machine 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.600
 all of us copper 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.019
 made of bronze 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.970
 a piece of everything I can go to 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.780
 dominated to build me on the machines 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.240
 to record not then I will record you 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.619
 I'm going to record something 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.659
 they are going to give for example friend 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.280
 objective put angel will not do it here 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.740
 in this 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.939
 in this little iron 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.939
 it's like gravel 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.390
 record is easy 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.960
 you just have to be able to center the letters 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:37.280
 for example here center the letters of 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.790
 angel in he searched the center and down and the 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.920
 center 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.500
 I am seeking the partiality of the letter as 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.830
 with the bottom of the letter 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:52.160
 as soon as he's focused, going back because 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.160
 You can either move or this here 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.070
 we can see this 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.810
 or the car 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.849
 perform on these two buttons 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.660
 but if these are the simple ones 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.660
 plates that I have put 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.680
 if you can move the car forward to 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.239
 back according to to look just the center 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.549
 of the letter once you have searched 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.319
 the center the letter for example there are more or 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:26.469
 less 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:30.269
 we accept everything we make sure it is 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:30.269
 everything is all my project 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:37.370
 now that they do not know that they are arid lyrics 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:40.850
 in this all the moths well prey 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.750
 and we go swimming to see 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.750
 let's give 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.640
 on the table 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.950
 because I do not have a job 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.970
 he also speaks cheeky 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.160
 that the table is and has a screen 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.160
 plasma television 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.909
 letters that have no lamp inside 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.640
 in great and under the inclemency of my 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.560
 head 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.420
 for all they serve caste for 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.800
 it gets worse if you record a ladies moment if 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.800
 something to teach 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.600
 this all has to be to take a 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.600
 welding for all the screws 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.600
 all are screws 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.840
 one way and another stalin rivet 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.840
 age 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.900
 all points that turn and you see 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.050
 you take bearings the turns for 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.050
 plates 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.769
 the gas is already I have the n 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.769
 I'm going to bring it closer
