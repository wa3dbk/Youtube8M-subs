00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360
 hello car mazda demio dw3w 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:13.679
 2002 release or ford festiva mini 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:18.630
 car today i will show you how 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:24.990
 change the front wheel studs see 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:30.150
 what they have here two new means 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:33.360
 after winter I began to unscrew them and here 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.600
 this together with the nut flew off and here 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.370
 give me a spin with us 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:45.379
 need a hammer wrench for 14 good 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:50.010
 flat screwdriver and of itself of course 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:56.969
 Bulgarian open the tank with the brake 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:01:02.780
 liquid take grinder and cross here 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:08.580
 so here is a nut with a pin saw cut in 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:11.760
 then hammer all whip and now 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.549
 we have two paths before us 1 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.549
 it means unscrew the caliper 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:27.170
 remove brake disc 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:33.740
 and unscrew this nut on 29 which 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:39.530
 keeps the wheel bearing and in principle 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:41.540
 then very easily the stud changes 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.369
 I do not like this option because 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:49.390
 that everyone knows that this car is very 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.880
 hard then adjust the bearing 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:56.180
 so today I will show you another 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.470
 a little way not to shoot this one 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:03.680
 nut option 2 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:09.679
 it seemed to me much easier need 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:15.680
 means flat -head screwdriver to squeeze the caliper 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:20.140
 for this, we insert it right here 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:25.549
 a little bit and a key to 14 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:27.590
 unscrew the 2 bolts that hold 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:32.480
 caliper one below 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:36.500
 another from the top by unscrewing two bolts remove 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:45.680
 caliper notice someone so i'm not 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:49.239
 take it off we lay it on the bricks then 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.239
 remove the brake disc 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.500
 I thought the way that he is not at all so 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:00.860
 easy to remove 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:05.299
 those who do not remove the disc explain 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:11.269
 here there is a hole there 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:16.130
 bolt wrench key 13 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:20.150
 Balto means spinning as much as possible 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:24.070
 as far as possible if he does not 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.070
 removed take the hammer 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:37.250
 knocking come in a circle then again 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:39.470
 pull the bolt again remember 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:45.050
 but the general so here little by little 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:48.500
 bolt contention squeezed out take grinder 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:51.880
 and here is such a defense 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:56.810
 standing here with us just 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:04:00.340
 cut off so that the stud you have passed here 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:04.400
 from here to this hole 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:09.920
 the most interesting thing that stud on Mazda 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:13.460
 costs around 150 rubles and not so 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:17.930
 just find and if you find you 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:20.060
 just wait for her for five days i found here 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:26.230
 such studs they 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.230
 one to one with kia car masks 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:34.750
 worth 40 rubles 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:38.570
 collect everything back do not forget to close 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.160
 tank with brake fluid and not 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:46.160

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:49.990
 brake pedal at least 5 times in order 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.570
 to make the pads in place 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:56.810
