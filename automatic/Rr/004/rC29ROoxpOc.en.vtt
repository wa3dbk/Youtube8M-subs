I<00:01:57.750> would<00:01:58.050> suggest<00:01:58.730> twisting<00:01:59.730> just<00:02:00.000> doing<00:02:00.570> a

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
I would suggest twisting just doing a

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.980 
I would suggest twisting just doing a
real<00:02:00.900> loose<00:02:01.230> twist<00:02:01.620> that<00:02:02.280> works<00:02:02.550> as<00:02:02.790> well<00:02:02.990> that

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
real loose twist that works as well that

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.300 
real loose twist that works as well that

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
I've done just to position it to make

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.610 
I've done just to position it to make
them<00:02:35.580> as<00:02:35.730> small<00:02:36.030> or<00:02:36.600> as<00:02:36.870> large<00:02:36.900> as<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:37.470> would

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
like so now that we're through with the

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.260 
like so now that we're through with the
outer<00:02:43.380> perimeter<00:02:43.770> it<00:02:44.220> gives<00:02:44.460> you<00:02:44.550> an<00:02:44.640> idea<00:02:44.790> on

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
outer perimeter it gives you an idea on

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.980 
outer perimeter it gives you an idea on
how<00:02:45.360> I<00:02:46.260> made<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.860> two<00:02:47.040> rolls<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:48.000> was<00:02:48.660> asked

how I made the two rolls I was asked

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.820 
how I made the two rolls I was asked
about<00:02:49.020> that<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:50.250> we're<00:02:50.490> gonna<00:02:50.640> start<00:02:51.030> with

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
about that and so we're gonna start with

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:58.640 
about that and so we're gonna start with
the<00:02:52.830> center<00:02:53.190> piece<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:57.870> basically<00:02:58.290> what<00:02:58.560> I'm

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
the center piece and basically what I'm

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.500 
the center piece and basically what I'm
doing<00:02:58.680> right<00:02:59.010> here<00:02:59.070> is<00:02:59.280> just<00:02:59.370> you<00:03:00.090> know<00:03:00.180> making

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
doing right here is just you know making

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.640 
doing right here is just you know making
sure<00:03:00.660> that<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.050> back<00:03:01.230> is<00:03:02.959> lying<00:03:03.959> down<00:03:04.230> pretty

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
well now what I'm doing in the center

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.400 
well now what I'm doing in the center
piece<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.420> I've<00:03:09.570> taken<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.930> ponytail<00:03:10.380> holder

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
out evenly so I can store a two-position

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.940 
out evenly so I can store a two-position
those<00:03:18.120> sections<00:03:18.720> as<00:03:18.870> well<00:03:19.050> and<00:03:19.380> I<00:03:19.530> do<00:03:19.590> the
