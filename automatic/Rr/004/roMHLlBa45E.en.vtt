 present the only river alive in the city the initiative proposed 25 ago 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.320
 years by the state government did not have continuity due to the high costs of 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.290
 maintenance and the park was losing its integration with the community the 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.420
 forest area was closed and reduced to operation at the zoo 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.109
 today the proposal of the state the guadeloupe town hall and the 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.109
 private initiative for the great ecological park the shepherdess 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.589
 is much more outstanding because it is an ecological project 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:41.379
 integral that contemplates the strengthening of the park in the area of 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.699
 the shepherd larry generation the river bed the chair the building of the 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:48.699
 football stadium monterrey 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.550
 the objective is to improve the quality of life of the inhabitants of guadeloupe 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.630
 increasing green areas and sports and cultural spaces 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.480

 ecological and tourist for the state of new lion the development of 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.750
 project contemplates different zones the first time inside the natural park 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.750
 protected through the street paseo del valle 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.620
 the second is to regenerate and integrate the teka parks the chair and advertising 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.400
 from left turning it into a single tourist and ecological corridor 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.440
 after an operational analysis of the current road network in charge of the 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.750
 municipal and state authorities it was concluded that even without the stadium 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.929
 there are two critical points 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.450
 the bottleneck on Avenida Eloy Cavazos and the Americas and that is 

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:45.770
 generates at the intersection of the exhibition and Juarez Avenue 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.850
 In order to resolve this situation and ensure the efficiency levels are not 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.770
 only in the area of ​​the project but throughout the municipality the road system 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.900
 de guadalupe includes road solutions in paseo de las americas and alfonso 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.469
 Kings 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.180
 as well as throughout the americas in its beginnings with the aek abastos juárez and 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:04.189
 german miguel 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.149
 adding to the solutions already proposed by the road ring 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:08.539
 metropolitan 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.569
 Regarding access to the Monterrey football stadium, two 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.069
 vehicular bridges and the extension of an existing pedestrian bridge 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.569
 only 700 meters away is the subway station and the easy sand 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.640
 connection with the public transport network the property considered for the 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:29.730
 stadium is foreign to the protected natural area does not adjoin with ale 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.359
 any housing 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:36.239
 consists of 24 points five hectares of which approximately five will be 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.670
 used in the stadium building itself, the building will have the capacity to 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:45.999
 50 thousand fans approximately 90% of the locations 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.539
 they will correspond to general sections 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:52.979
 as for the parking lot it will be an authorized open and constructed space 

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:54.560
 with ecological materials 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.779
 that allow the growth of peace on the surface 

00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:01.759
 is contemplated for around five thousand places and will additionally give 

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:04.759
 daily service to the great ecological park the shepherdess 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.339
 another benefit for the Guadalupe community that will bring this project 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:13.569
 integral is the generation of more than 2 thousand 300 jobs during construction 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.680
 and the creation of around a thousand permanent jobs to guarantee their 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.349
 proper functioning 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.389
 currently the land is in disuse and there are even areas that represent a 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.389
 health hazard from the garbage that is there 

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:34.419
 thanks to the aid that is in the riverbed it is necessary to clarify that 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:38.629
 are within the terrain in question so they will not undergo any changes 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.049
 according to the corresponding environmental studies in the designated area 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:43.230
 for the stadium 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.420
 the existence in 60 do not assimilate and some other species 

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:52.470

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.930
 proposes to plant trees in the area of ​​the football stadium monterrey in the most 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.560
 of 19 thousand square meters of planters that will connect the entire 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.099
 rain runoff 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.949
 thus guaranteeing the day with the height of the trees in addition to the 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:11.519
 infiltration of rainwater to later transfer it clean to the 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.229
 riverbed the chair 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:18.009
 The integral project is a large ecological park, including the 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:21.579
 new soccer stadium monterrey proposes the preservation and 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.490

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.370
 river alive inside the city 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.290
 this great project will become an icon of the state of new lion with 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.410
 international level presence 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.979
 but mainly it will be an area of ​​coexistence and development 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.249
 toyota has commented on environmental culture figueruelas for the benefit not 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:49.050
 only of the Neoleonian families of today but of the coming generations 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.599
