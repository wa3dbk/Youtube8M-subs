a<00:03:01.280> period<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:02.209> I'm<00:03:02.390> really<00:03:02.780> happy<00:03:03.049> for<00:03:03.230> them

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
and their performance I really I also

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.259 
and their performance I really I also
think<00:03:07.940> that<00:03:08.060> Edward<00:03:08.569> it<00:03:09.049> was<00:03:09.440> and<00:03:10.010> is<00:03:10.489> a<00:03:10.519> really

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
think that Edward it was and is a really

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.280 
think that Edward it was and is a really
great<00:03:11.420> player<00:03:12.010> it's<00:03:13.010> just<00:03:13.400> their<00:03:14.290> problems

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
great player it's just their problems

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.620 
great player it's just their problems
between<00:03:15.590> gangi<00:03:16.069> in<00:03:16.370> himself<00:03:16.670> so<00:03:17.389> they

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
between gangi in himself so they

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.099 
between gangi in himself so they
couldn't<00:03:17.870> synergize<00:03:18.739> their<00:03:19.069> play<00:03:19.489> style

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
couldn't synergize their play style

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.009 
couldn't synergize their play style
together<00:03:21.109> I<00:03:21.530> hope<00:03:21.799> I<00:03:22.040> can<00:03:22.389> do<00:03:23.389> better<00:03:23.600> with

problem in that game was that like all
lanes<00:06:11.180> basically<00:06:11.990> needed<00:06:13.120> diamond<00:06:14.120> box<00:06:14.539> help

for<00:06:15.770> example<00:06:16.250> like<00:06:16.990> bot<00:06:17.990> lane<00:06:18.289> they<00:06:18.680> were

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:18.889

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
either against virus plus Johnny combo

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.350 
either against virus plus Johnny combo
and<00:06:26.240> like<00:06:27.020> they<00:06:27.979> were<00:06:28.219> pushing<00:06:29.000> really<00:06:29.210> hard

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
and like they were pushing really hard

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.189 
and like they were pushing really hard
all<00:06:29.870> the<00:06:30.050> time<00:06:30.080> and<00:06:30.500> we<00:06:31.339> didn't<00:06:31.880> know<00:06:32.020> was<00:06:33.020> it

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199 
all the time and we didn't know was it

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:36.580 
all the time and we didn't know was it
just<00:06:33.710> because<00:06:33.800> they<00:06:34.339> are<00:06:34.839> confident<00:06:35.839> or

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:36.590 
just because they are confident or

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.490 
just because they are confident or
was<00:06:36.740> it<00:06:36.920> just<00:06:36.950> because<00:06:37.520> volibear<00:06:38.510> lurking<00:06:39.350> in

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
was it just because volibear lurking in

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.470 
was it just because volibear lurking in
the<00:06:39.650> near<00:06:39.860> brush<00:06:40.190> so<00:06:40.580> it<00:06:41.120> was<00:06:41.270> hard<00:06:41.300> to<00:06:43.240> do<00:06:44.240> in

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:44.480 
the near brush so it was hard to do in

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.570 
the near brush so it was hard to do in
the<00:06:44.750> lane<00:06:44.960> actually<00:06:45.530> like<00:06:45.950> when<00:06:46.160> you're

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:46.580 
the lane actually like when you're

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.060 
the lane actually like when you're
getting<00:06:46.760> pushed<00:06:47.270> to<00:06:47.630> your<00:06:47.660> turret<00:06:48.110> it's<00:06:48.320> hard

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:49.070 
getting pushed to your turret it's hard

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.190 
getting pushed to your turret it's hard
to<00:06:49.340> make<00:06:49.610> pressure<00:06:49.940> on<00:06:50.210> your<00:06:50.390> enemies<00:06:50.870> like
