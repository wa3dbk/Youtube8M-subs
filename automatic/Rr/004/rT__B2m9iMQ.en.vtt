00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
use multi-touch so you have to press

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.649

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
fingers which gets really really

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.149 
fingers which gets really really
challenging<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.479> hard<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:25.380> once<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.830> get<00:01:25.979> up
