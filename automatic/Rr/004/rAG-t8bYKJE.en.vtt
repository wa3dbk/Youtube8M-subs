00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.440
 It was personal, all right. 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.719
 Today I'm going to record for you a day of 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.910
 Pure protein, a lot of people gave me this 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.310
 idea to record what I normally do 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.590
 when I make a day of pure protein 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.420
 As you know, my mother was here. 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.160
 last week she went to Brazil then 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.160
 last week I did not make my day 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.410
 Pure protein, I ate a lot of that nonsense. 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.920
 weekend also a tour of the account 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.590
 eating many things that I do not eat 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.450
 I usually decided that this 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.540
 I'll make two days of protein 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.239
 to compensate last week for 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.040
 I did not make pure protein and for this 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.800
 week also give a balanced in 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.440
 weight because many people are neglected 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.239
 Come back to get fat and then I'll go 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.340
 show you now what I'm going to 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.649
 eat breakfast 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.750
 This is going to be my breakfast today. 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.149
 I'm going to have a big cup of coffee with 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.600
 milk as it stands is great I 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:10.710
 I put four lozenges 4 lozenges 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:13.799
 sweeteners and I will eat 3 3 slices of 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.560
 thin ham and I'm taking now 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.290
 I'm going to work, taking it to me. 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:24.420
 Work is on snack food now. 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:28.710
 the morning the yogurts 0% and the guti is 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:33.810
 of strawberry and milk and yoghurt 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:39.110
 strawberry skim 0% and has 50 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:41.850
 Calories 125 grams has 50 calories 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.280
 so it is excellent and creamy it does not have 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.189
 pieces of fruit or anything and I always 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.630
 Give her a little pot with a sung lid. 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.149
 so in my purse 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.659
 a little oat bran that I can 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.560
 need to eat with the yogurt 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.030

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.680

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.519
 walking and 40 minutes to go back 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:52.200
 so it was an hour and ten minutes now 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:54.660
 I made a chicken breast as well on the na 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.130
 even without anything olive oil I did 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.170
 a chicken breast with a bit of 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.590
 The pain was a little salt and I go with 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.750
 he with a glass of zero cola 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.820

 of those of crab bars they 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.620
 are very good for the attack phase 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.690
 because this is something you 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.600

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.670
 harm you in diet and I'll take 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:31.680

 The day that I have not finished taking

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.690

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.120
 people went out of their way she went to a 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.220
 I went to the other side and I ended up coming 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.530
 I only left the house at half past six. 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.410
 now seven o'clock at night 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.900
 You're super super cold, I know only with this one. 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.419
 since I had fininha with this case here 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.880
 de lanzini without fininho is very cold 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:26.850
 I was trembling on the street then 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.780
 I'm already going home and 6 and 6 hours 7 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.610

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:36.480

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.919
 I'm going to the house for dinner, what I want to do. 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.560
 A new bread to prove that I 'm going to like it. 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.650
 and a little while we'll see you then 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.650

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:52.140
 so the staff is already finished 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:54.750
 tired sweaty or even noticed my face 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.340

 So my dinner tonight is going to be this one. 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.270
 sandwich I made with a new one that I 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:08.580
 was experimenting with microwaves and 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:10.410
 I have not tasted it yet if I like 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.930
 I'm going to make the recipe for 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.540
 I'll leave you on the channel and 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.060
 a latte is a normal sandwich 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.919
 with good new microwave I did and 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.550
 cheese and ham only now I 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:26.230
 I put on the supporter and almost tower good 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:28.960
 but that's it this is going to be this 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:31.630
 my schedule today now nine hours 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.570
 in the evening and around 10:30 a.m. 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.970
 have some green tea and you're done for today 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:39.250
 I finished my day with pure protein 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:42.010
 that's it I hope you excuse the 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:44.230
 my face like that from day to day and that 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:46.810
 You liked it if you liked it. 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.370
 of this type of video but rather a type vlov 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:51.220
 to show what I normally eat 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:53.980
 leave me in the comments that I'm going 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.990
 to vote for you, I recorded 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.850
 this one-day pure protein video 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.830
 occurring usually because had 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:02.080
 A lot of people who asked for it also have 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.520
 enough doubts I do not go hungry anymore 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.950
 also because I'm already accustomed to 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.980
 do one day a week pure protein 

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:12.820
 so normal for me it can not be hungry 

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:15.460
 but you have seen that the quantities by 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:17.080
 example of the chicken was half a day can 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.020
 increase you can eat the amount you 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:23.050
 You wish me to eat with a breast of 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.760
 whole chicken for me was quite up to 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.560
 in the end I was already choking because the 

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.410
 chicken breast done like that 

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:32.110
 You know it does not look delicious right? 

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:33.610
 is only to kill the hunger even then 

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.200
 This is what I can record one day from 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.780
 protein vegetables for you to see as 

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.580
 I do but it's basically that but today 

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:41.830
 protein calculation so when I'm in 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.720
 home that does not have to work, I do 

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:47.740
 a more elaborate thing make a fish 

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:49.480
 in the oven or a pork on the river 

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.250
 things like that but when I 'm 

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.440
 working that I need things 

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:55.930
 practical things fast things that 

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.730
 even the dust could remember to eat in the 

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.590
 work, so it's more or less as soon as 

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:01.510
 I do stopped, I hope you have 

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.520
 I like it if you like I like it 

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:06.400
 I did not sign up for the channel 

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:10.410
 stay connected on all the new kiss 

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.410
 and until the next total video
