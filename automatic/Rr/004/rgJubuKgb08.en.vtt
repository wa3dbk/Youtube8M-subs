and<00:05:53.409> like<00:05:53.470> I<00:05:53.650> said<00:05:53.710> think<00:05:54.159> is<00:05:54.250> a<00:05:54.280> guy<00:05:54.550> who<00:05:54.810> the

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
and like I said think is a guy who the

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.180 
and like I said think is a guy who the
shariat<00:05:56.139> grades<00:05:56.379> out<00:05:56.620> at<00:05:56.800> the<00:05:56.919> combine

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.159 
shariat grades out at the combine
everything<00:05:57.580> but<00:05:57.879> I<00:05:57.909> think<00:05:58.180> he's<00:05:58.300> an<00:05:58.449> NFL<00:05:58.690> level

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169
