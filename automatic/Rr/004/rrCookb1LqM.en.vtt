00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
position a bit like a laptop that's the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.180

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
screen the new 3ds has these two bumpers

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.840 
screen the new 3ds has these two bumpers
so<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.649> shouldn't<00:00:47.039> have<00:00:47.190> those<00:00:47.370> lines<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.789> I

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
so it shouldn't have those lines and I

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.819 
so it shouldn't have those lines and I
haven't<00:00:48.180> noticed<00:00:48.360> anything<00:00:48.780> yet<00:00:49.230> our<00:00:49.469> games

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
haven't noticed anything yet our games

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.819 
haven't noticed anything yet our games
like<00:00:50.100> Pokemon<00:00:50.399> X&amp;Y<00:00:51.350> smoother<00:00:52.350> when<00:00:52.559> playing

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.910 
and this is where the 3d turned on
framerate<00:00:57.300> does<00:00:57.660> lower<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.109> bit<00:00:58.410> but<00:00:58.800> when

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
framerate does lower a bit but when

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.010 
framerate does lower a bit but when
compared<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.340> an<00:00:59.489> original<00:00:59.789> 3ds<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.600> would<00:01:00.840> say

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
compared to an original 3ds I would say

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.439 
compared to an original 3ds I would say
that<00:01:01.199> yes<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:02.010> little<00:01:02.430> bit<00:01:02.579> smoother<00:01:03.030> can
