 It also looks very nice 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:27.130
 ok well quickly for this we are going to 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:33.270
 need the following we are going to 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:37.950
 need colored sheets ok 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:41.130
 we're going to need four shades of the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.579
 that you want this time I'm going to 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:49.170
 use in blue 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.440
 we are going to need a red color and a 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.170
 rosita ok also if you have any 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.460
 newspaper that can serve this his 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.629
 inside 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.250
 ok well we quickly go to the 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.830
 following 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.200
 we are going to need also a 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:13.250
 stapler ok the small ones come 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.110
 but if you have a big one it's fine this 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.219
 note then it is not so marked if it is so 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.409
 new economic 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:22.020
 We are going to need scissors 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:26.490
 pencil rule 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:32.270
 and then for the lacito you can occupy thread 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:36.450
 or good yarn let's go now let's with 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:41.100
 our paper we are going to do the following 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:45.090
 measure we go with a rule to be measured only 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.880
 of 2 centimeters so ok of two 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.470
 centimeters then we will win 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.400
 our pencil 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.400
 and let's do it 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.090
 we are going to mark here 2 centimeters 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.090
 with our pencil 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.060
 similarly down here 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.440
 A) Yes 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:15.030
 and let's make a line 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.660
 from point to point 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.660
 okay 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.290
 A) Yes 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.440
 and then since we have this line of 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:34.480
 two centimeters and you can trim it with 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:37.390
 Scissors ok like that or if you have any 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.360
 guillotine that can be fine how are you 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.770
 if you have it then that's fine and if you do not 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.380
 worry you can do with the 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:51.160
 scissors I think this one is faster 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.160
 ok of these we're going to do the whole sheet 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:59.129
 so we're going to follow all the sheets and 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:03:00.870
 also the newspaper ok and these are 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:05.459
 the following measures as we have 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.800
 ready and lines like this so we 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.160
 they have to leave 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.670
 that are 2 centimeters since they are 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.130
 you are now going to cut them when 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.819
 are the long initials we're going to 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.560
 cut as follows 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:28.620
 let's cut one of 8 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:33.450
 they are going to make 22 of 8 centimeters 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:36.030
 one of 10 we will go two in two 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.569
 one of 12 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.890
 and one of 14 centimeters these are the 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.890
 measures that we are going to need 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.540
 okay 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.870
 we are going to cut them from the 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.000
 long pieces as we have these 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.040
 measures of all do not worry you 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.569
 I'll leave them in the description of 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.550
 video 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:03.350
 let's move on to the following 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.350
 I already have them cut out 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.080
 okay 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.670
 I have here 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:20.190
 here are the measurements that I use ok 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:23.430
 good now what we are going to do we are going to 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.200
 grab the 8-centimeter we 're going to 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.050
 grab 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.540
 and what we are going to do we are going to win the 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.610
 big 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:37.060
 of 14 centimeters and we will put it like this 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:40.120
 ok and after this we are going to grab the 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:46.470
 of 10 the of 12 forgiveness 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.470
 the 12 then we will grab the 10 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.470
 and the 8 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:57.550
 If we are going to have to put together we are going 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:00.060
 to turn around and let's repeat the 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.060
 process 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.270
 14 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.910
 everyone 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.850
 10 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:26.050
 and 8 we are going to match this that we have 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:31.030
 in between those of 12-14 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:34.560
 we're going to lower it a little bit ok this is 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:37.670
 we are going to lower it a little bit 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:43.110
 ok like half 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:47.300
 and since it 's from this now we're going to 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.300
 put a staple here 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:56.050
 and it has to be like that 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:59.470
 ok and why do we leave this 8 in between 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:02.860
 so that we stay 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:07.420
 so it's from here where we're going to 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:09.340
 insert our yarn or our thread 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.340
 well now what are we going to do what 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:16.020
 let's turn and let's do this 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.020
 let's grab the tips 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.780
 A) Yes 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.979
 to form hearts 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.200
 A) Yes 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.600
 and so 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:50.050
 what 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:53.650
 since these are together 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:57.360
 since they are together these now we are going to 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.360
 give another 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.760
 with the stapler like this 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:10.039
 and it has to be like that 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.800
 they are many tones and it looks really 

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:15.409
 It looks very nice and to make it 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:19.879
 if you drill a hole punch him 

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:22.159
 you can do a roll here ok but if 

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:25.129
 you do not have no worries just in 

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:27.530
 land a little bit with pressure with the 

00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:32.449
 pencil and it's going to be a small hole 

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:34.460
 here and here you can put the thread 

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:37.879
 and you are going to do many you can 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:42.580
 interspersed to give you a touch 

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:47.310
 nice and then this has to be 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.310
 how I showed you before like this 

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:53.330
 okay 

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:57.560
 well this is an idea if you like 

00:07:53.330 --> 00:08:01.400
 give me a little hand up and subscribe 

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.400
 thanks bye
