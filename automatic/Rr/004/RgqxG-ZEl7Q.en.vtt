00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.200 
some black markers to draw with so the
way<00:00:16.230> we<00:00:16.470> draw<00:00:16.650> our<00:00:16.680> car<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.400> you're<00:00:18.000> going<00:00:18.119> to

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
way we draw our car is you're going to

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.150 
way we draw our car is you're going to
start<00:00:18.420> off<00:00:18.570> with<00:00:18.750> some<00:00:18.960> very<00:00:19.260> very<00:00:19.590> basic

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
start off with some very very basic

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.550 
start off with some very very basic
shapes<00:00:20.600> we're<00:00:21.600> going<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.779> start<00:00:22.109> off<00:00:22.260> with<00:00:22.500> the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
shapes we're going to start off with the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.460 
shapes we're going to start off with the
wheels<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.760> we're<00:00:23.880> going<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.060> do<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> big<00:00:25.140> circle

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
wheels so we're going to do a big circle

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.050 
wheels so we're going to do a big circle
and<00:00:25.859> then<00:00:26.039> we're<00:00:26.160> going<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.310> do<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.519> smaller

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
and then we're going to do a smaller

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.569 
and then we're going to do a smaller
kind<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.689> oval<00:00:28.170> shape<00:00:31.309> then<00:00:32.309> we're<00:00:32.430> going<00:00:32.520> to

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
kind of oval shape then we're going to

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.360 
kind of oval shape then we're going to
draw<00:00:32.820> in<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.059> little<00:00:33.300> rectangle<00:00:33.960> over<00:00:34.230> here<00:00:34.649> for

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
draw in a little rectangle over here for

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.540 
draw in a little rectangle over here for
the<00:00:35.460> windshield<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:37.710> drawing<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.129> car<00:00:38.370> can

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
the windshield the drawing a car can

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.490 
the windshield the drawing a car can
seem<00:00:38.790> very<00:00:39.059> daunting<00:00:39.390> but<00:00:39.870> when<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.140> break<00:00:40.350> it

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
seem very daunting but when you break it

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.400 
seem very daunting but when you break it
down<00:00:40.649> into<00:00:41.040> basic<00:00:41.520> shapes<00:00:42.050> then<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.200> doesn't

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
down into basic shapes then it doesn't

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
down into basic shapes then it doesn't
seem<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.700> difficult<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.510> as<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:46.050> can<00:00:46.260> see

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
seem so difficult and as you can see

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.310 
seem so difficult and as you can see
we've<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.700> done<00:00:47.879> another<00:00:48.270> little<00:00:48.629> rectangle

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
we've just done another little rectangle

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.229 
we've just done another little rectangle
and<00:00:50.059> again<00:00:51.059> another<00:00:51.870> little<00:00:52.289> rectangle<00:00:53.239> to

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
and again another little rectangle to

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.750 
and again another little rectangle to
show<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.629> front<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.050> car<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:56.280> basically

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
show the front of the car so basically

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.240 
show the front of the car so basically
what<00:00:57.030> I'm<00:00:57.149> doing<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.660> I'm<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.109> boxing<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
what I'm doing is I'm just boxing in the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.060 
what I'm doing is I'm just boxing in the
basic<00:01:00.239> shape<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.050> car<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.530> then<00:01:01.920> we<00:01:02.010> are

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
basic shape of the car and then we are

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.070 
basic shape of the car and then we are
going<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.250> go<00:01:02.370> back<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.239> fill<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.719> some<00:01:04.019> of

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
going to go back in and fill in some of

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.280 
going to go back in and fill in some of
the<00:01:04.229> detail<00:01:05.510> so<00:01:06.510> when<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.780> look<00:01:06.930> at<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.170> like

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
the detail so when you look at it like

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.870 
the detail so when you look at it like
this<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.619> could<00:01:07.979> see<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.549> really

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
this you could see that it's really

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.590 
this you could see that it's really
quite<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.180> simple<00:01:09.450> task<00:01:11.150> then<00:01:12.150> we<00:01:12.299> can<00:01:12.450> go<00:01:12.570> back

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
quite a simple task then we can go back

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.330 
quite a simple task then we can go back
and<00:01:12.990> start<00:01:13.140> putting<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.560> some<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.920> detail

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
and start putting in some of the detail

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.219 
and start putting in some of the detail
will<00:01:14.610> add<00:01:14.790> two<00:01:15.119> more<00:01:15.360> circles<00:01:15.900> for<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
will add two more circles for the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.399 
will add two more circles for the
headlamps<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.270> then<00:01:18.270> some<00:01:18.540> lines<00:01:18.570> for<00:01:19.350> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
headlamps and then some lines for the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.710 
headlamps and then some lines for the
doors<00:01:20.030> and<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.180> can<00:01:21.330> go<00:01:21.479> back<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.380> add<00:01:23.720> some

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
doors and we can go back in and add some

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.780 
doors and we can go back in and add some
lines<00:01:24.990> for<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.040> fenders<00:01:27.170> and<00:01:28.549> another<00:01:29.549> line

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
lines for the fenders and another line

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.140 
lines for the fenders and another line
here<00:01:29.820> for<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.360> fender<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.820> again<00:01:32.820> just

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
here for the fender and again just

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.710 
here for the fender and again just
another<00:01:33.270> rectangle<00:01:33.780> for<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.500> for<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.159> grill

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
another rectangle for the for the grill

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.920 
another rectangle for the for the grill
two<00:01:36.720> little<00:01:37.079> lines<00:01:38.090> two<00:01:39.090> little<00:01:39.420> lines<00:01:39.540> coming

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
two little lines two little lines coming

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.219 
two little lines two little lines coming
down<00:01:40.200> for<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.530> trunk<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.540> we<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:42.750> put<00:01:42.960> some

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
down for the trunk and we can put some

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.780 
down for the trunk and we can put some
more<00:01:43.409> circles<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.100> here<00:01:44.399> for<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.729> tires<00:01:46.579> if<00:01:47.579> we

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
more circles in here for the tires if we

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.219 
more circles in here for the tires if we
want<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.119> make<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.600> little<00:01:48.840> bit<00:01:48.990> more

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
want to make it in a little bit more

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.130 
want to make it in a little bit more
perspective<00:01:50.180> you<00:01:51.180> can<00:01:51.299> just<00:01:51.540> draw<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:51.899> two

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
perspective you can just draw in two

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.990 
perspective you can just draw in two
little<00:01:52.409> lines<00:01:52.530> like<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.310> show<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.520> tires

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
little lines like this to show the tires

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.499 
little lines like this to show the tires
and<00:01:54.540> then<00:01:54.930> have<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:56.670> wheel<00:01:56.909> wheel<00:01:57.149> coming

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
and then have the wheel wheel coming

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.440 
and then have the wheel wheel coming
around<00:02:00.979> another<00:02:01.979> little<00:02:02.340> rectangle<00:02:03.000> here<00:02:03.180> for

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
around another little rectangle here for

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.609 
around another little rectangle here for
the<00:02:03.600> back<00:02:04.530> trunk<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.340> then<00:02:06.119> just<00:02:06.899> pop<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.500> a

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
the back trunk and then just pop in a

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.010 
the back trunk and then just pop in a
little<00:02:07.829> triangle<00:02:08.250> right<00:02:08.610> there<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.869> can

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
little triangle right there and you can

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.690 
little triangle right there and you can
