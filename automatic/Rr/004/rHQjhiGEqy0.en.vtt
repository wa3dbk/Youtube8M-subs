tools<00:02:32.989> on<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.079> doors

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:53.860

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.900 

so<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.260> next<00:02:55.530> few<00:02:55.770> areas<00:02:56.250> are<00:02:56.400> just<00:02:56.610> learning

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
so the next few areas are just learning

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:04.100 
so the next few areas are just learning
how<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.530> use<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.860> tools<00:02:59.280> and<00:03:01.010> whatnot<00:03:03.020> so<00:03:04.020> I'm

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
how to use the tools and whatnot so I'm

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.480 
how to use the tools and whatnot so I'm
going<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.290> come<00:03:04.470> back<00:03:04.650> in<00:03:04.770> a<00:03:04.830> second<00:03:05.280> I'm<00:03:05.400> going

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
going to come back in a second I'm going

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.660 
going to come back in a second I'm going
to<00:03:05.580> fast<00:03:05.760> forward<00:03:06.150> just<00:03:06.450> some<00:03:07.200> areas<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:07.980> give

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
to fast forward just some areas and give

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.760 
to fast forward just some areas and give
you<00:03:08.820> guys<00:03:09.540> some<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:09.960> monster<00:03:10.320> gameplay<00:03:10.710> so

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
you guys some of the monster gameplay so

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.770 
you guys some of the monster gameplay so
a<00:03:11.010> different<00:03:11.490> game<00:03:11.700> this<00:03:12.000> is<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.210> normal<00:03:12.600> game

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
a different game this is the normal game

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.050 
a different game this is the normal game
so<00:03:13.110> it's<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.260> little<00:03:13.350> bit<00:03:13.530> more<00:03:13.680> difficult<00:03:14.190> as<00:03:14.880> I

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
so it's a little bit more difficult as I

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:22.570 
so it's a little bit more difficult as I
go<00:03:15.900> in<00:03:16.080> here<00:03:16.290> this<00:03:16.500> happens<00:03:17.160> typically<00:03:17.600> where

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.280 

what<00:03:23.580> happens<00:03:23.880> is<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.090> get<00:03:24.209> locked<00:03:24.480> in<00:03:24.750> and

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
what happens is you get locked in and

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.350 
what happens is you get locked in and
you<00:03:26.130> have<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.340> survive<00:03:27.270> until<00:03:29.120> this<00:03:30.120> guy's

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
you have to survive until this guy's

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:42.170 
you have to survive until this guy's
nasty<00:03:40.040> okay<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.070> used<00:03:41.250> some<00:03:41.430> Kinesis<00:03:41.880> on<00:03:42.030> and

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
nasty okay I used some Kinesis on and

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.150 
nasty okay I used some Kinesis on and
screw<00:03:42.420> them<00:03:42.570> up<00:03:42.690> so<00:03:42.990> that's<00:03:43.200> good<00:03:43.500> there's

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
screw them up so that's good there's

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.040 
screw them up so that's good there's
other<00:03:44.340> monsters<00:03:44.820> in<00:03:44.970> here<00:03:45.240> and<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.900> whole

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
other monsters in here and the whole

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.390 
other monsters in here and the whole
idea<00:03:46.410> is<00:03:46.580> to<00:03:48.230> try<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:49.260> kill<00:03:49.560> them<00:03:49.709> all<00:03:49.860> so<00:03:50.250> that

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
idea is to try to kill them all so that

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.449 
idea is to try to kill them all so that
you<00:03:50.580> can<00:03:50.790> live<00:03:51.239> that<00:03:51.959> guy's<00:03:52.170> still<00:03:52.500> alive

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459

go over there and pick up what's left

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.570 
go over there and pick up what's left
