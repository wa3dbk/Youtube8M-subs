00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.300 
back with another rare mount guide this
romantic<00:00:04.170> goads<00:00:04.380> on<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:04.620> armature<00:00:05.009> was<00:00:05.160> a

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
romantic goads on the armature was a

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.190 
romantic goads on the armature was a
shoe<00:00:05.490> Raptor<00:00:05.850> and<00:00:06.150> I've<00:00:06.540> not<00:00:06.690> made<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.839> guide<00:00:07.049> on

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
shoe Raptor and I've not made a guide on

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.930 
shoe Raptor and I've not made a guide on
this<00:00:07.319> yet<00:00:07.770> because<00:00:08.040> it's<00:00:08.340> not<00:00:08.490> actually<00:00:08.790> been

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
this yet because it's not actually been

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.390 
this yet because it's not actually been
solo<00:00:09.240> but<00:00:09.570> until<00:00:09.870> 5.3<00:00:10.620> they<00:00:10.740> made<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.889> change<00:00:11.130> to

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
solo but until 5.3 they made a change to

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.850 
solo but until 5.3 they made a change to
this<00:00:11.490> rate<00:00:11.759> so<00:00:12.480> it's<00:00:12.719> on<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.900> 1%<00:00:13.469> drop<00:00:13.590> chance

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
this rate so it's on a 1% drop chance

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.310 
this rate so it's on a 1% drop chance
from<00:00:14.130> Blood<00:00:14.429> Lord<00:00:14.730> man<00:00:15.089> dokie<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.719> think<00:00:16.170> it's

from Blood Lord man dokie I think it's

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.640 
from Blood Lord man dokie I think it's
called<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:17.449> it<00:00:18.449> comes<00:00:18.720> from<00:00:18.810> Zagreb<00:00:19.320> which<00:00:19.500> is

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
called and it comes from Zagreb which is

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.759

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.470 
a level 85 heroic Cataclysm dungeon so
should<00:00:23.010> be<00:00:23.039> solo<00:00:23.340> but<00:00:23.609> my<00:00:23.760> most<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.180> made<00:00:24.330> my

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
should be solo but my most I made my

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.330 
should be solo but my most I made my
panther<00:00:24.810> guy<00:00:24.930> had<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.109> few<00:00:25.320> wants<00:00:25.560> ago<00:00:25.740> now<00:00:25.949> and

panther guy had a few wants ago now and

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.099 
panther guy had a few wants ago now and
I<00:00:26.430> wasn't<00:00:26.640> like<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.789> 480<00:00:27.269> item<00:00:27.689> level<00:00:27.960> so

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
I wasn't like a 480 item level so

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.480 
I wasn't like a 480 item level so
anything<00:00:28.439> above<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.859> should<00:00:29.130> find<00:00:29.340> this

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
anything above that should find this

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.690 
anything above that should find this
quite<00:00:29.760> easy<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.150> solo<00:00:30.980> so<00:00:31.980> you'll<00:00:32.130> find<00:00:32.399> Zulu

probably say fly from stone wind would

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.610 
probably say fly from stone wind would
be<00:00:41.640> your<00:00:41.820> quickest<00:00:42.239> bet<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:43.320> that's<00:00:43.469> how<00:00:43.559> you

this dungeon so once you are inside and
this<00:01:03.030> won't<00:01:03.329> take<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.600> very<00:01:03.719> long<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.140> clear

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
this won't take you very long to clear

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.960 
this won't take you very long to clear
to<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> boss<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:05.100> remember<00:01:05.430> there<00:01:05.580> are<00:01:05.610> two

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
to the boss but remember there are two

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.910 
to the boss but remember there are two
buses<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.630> raid<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.200> will<00:01:07.320> drop<00:01:07.530> mounts

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
buses in this raid that will drop mounts

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.920 
buses in this raid that will drop mounts
so<00:01:08.460> if<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.640> are<00:01:08.700> at<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.420> know<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.600> don't<00:01:09.780> have

so if you are at you know you don't have
any<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.260> them<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.470> would<00:01:10.619> recommend<00:01:11.040> doing<00:01:11.280> both

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
any of them I would recommend doing both

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.539 
any of them I would recommend doing both
of<00:01:11.520> them<00:01:11.820> as<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.810> if<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.680> chance<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.250> getting

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
of them as it if you a chance of getting

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.789 
of them as it if you a chance of getting
some<00:01:14.939> form<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.330> mount<00:01:15.570> from<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.680> can

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
some form of mount from this and you can

some form of mount from this and you can
only<00:01:16.920> do<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.280> dungeon<00:01:17.850> once<00:01:18.119> per<00:01:18.420> day<00:01:18.570> so

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
only do this dungeon once per day so

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.749 
only do this dungeon once per day so
keep<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.500> mind<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:20.009> make<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.400> most<00:01:20.580> of

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
keep that in mind do make the most of

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.340 
keep that in mind do make the most of
your<00:01:20.909> runs<00:01:21.150> as<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.390> said<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.840> can<00:01:21.960> only<00:01:22.080> do<00:01:22.229> it

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
your runs as I said you can only do it

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.149 
your runs as I said you can only do it
once<00:01:22.560> per<00:01:22.799> day

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
once per day

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.649 
once per day
it's<00:01:23.369> definitely<00:01:23.520> come<00:01:23.850> back<00:01:24.000> every<00:01:24.360> single

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
it's definitely come back every single

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.929 
it's definitely come back every single
day<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.049> it'll<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:26.130> know<00:01:26.159> you'll<00:01:26.369> get<00:01:26.880> it

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
day and it'll you know you'll get it

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.370 
day and it'll you know you'll get it
quicker<00:01:27.240> than<00:01:27.330> slacking<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.049> doing<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.259> once

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380

Lobel previously and that was because of

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.999 
Lobel previously and that was because of
an<00:01:57.360> ability<00:01:57.930> he's<00:01:58.229> got<00:01:58.469> called<00:01:58.770> and

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
instantly kills the target and then you

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.840 
instantly kills the target and then you
meant<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.049> be<00:02:04.079> resurrected<00:02:04.380> by<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.950> ghost<00:02:05.340> and

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.100 
meant to be resurrected by a ghost and
that<00:02:05.939> was<00:02:06.060> like<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.210> mechanics<00:02:06.689> behind<00:02:06.840> the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
that was like the mechanics behind the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.960 
that was like the mechanics behind the
fight<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.409> had<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.710> kill<00:02:08.220> him<00:02:08.250> before<00:02:08.759> he

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
fight you had to kill him before he

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.510 
fight you had to kill him before he
killed<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.660> know<00:02:09.720> yeah<00:02:10.069> before<00:02:11.069> you<00:02:11.250> run

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
killed you you know yeah before you run

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.740 
killed you you know yeah before you run
out<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.670> roses<00:02:12.000> essential

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
out of roses essential

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.550 
out of roses essential
and<00:02:14.150> now<00:02:15.150> they've<00:02:15.480> changed<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:16.320> that<00:02:16.350> the

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
and now they've changed it so that the

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.200 
and now they've changed it so that the
primary<00:02:16.950> target<00:02:17.430> doesn't<00:02:17.670> get<00:02:17.910> decapitated

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
primary target doesn't get decapitated

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.390 
primary target doesn't get decapitated
so<00:02:19.140> if<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.320> are<00:02:19.410> using<00:02:19.590> pets<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.220> would

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
so if you are using pets I would

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.420 
so if you are using pets I would
recommend<00:02:21.080> making<00:02:22.080> sure<00:02:22.320> it's<00:02:22.650> your<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:23.160> know

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430

recommend making sure it's your I know
you're<00:02:23.700> mean<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.180> grow<00:02:24.360> he's<00:02:24.540> actually

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
you're mean and I grow he's actually

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.750 
you're mean and I grow he's actually
fighting<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.530> instead<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:26.100> pet<00:02:26.310> if<00:02:26.460> you<00:02:26.490> pet

fighting you instead of a pet if you pet
his<00:02:27.090> tank<00:02:27.420> him<00:02:27.600> then<00:02:28.110> he<00:02:28.340> he<00:02:29.340> might<00:02:29.520> end<00:02:29.700> up

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
his tank him then he he might end up

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.120 
his tank him then he he might end up
decapitating<00:02:30.600> you<00:02:30.720> instead<00:02:31.020> of<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:31.290> pet<00:02:31.530> so

damage<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.520> them<00:02:41.670> it'll<00:02:42.000> encase<00:02:42.630> them<00:02:42.780> in<00:02:42.900> ice

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
damage to them it'll encase them in ice

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.320 
damage to them it'll encase them in ice
and<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:44.010> just<00:02:44.220> makes<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.490> trash<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.820> lot<00:02:45.120> easy

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
and it just makes the trash a lot easy

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.480 
and it just makes the trash a lot easy
it's<00:02:45.570> a<00:02:45.660> clip<00:02:45.930> as<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:46.500> see<00:02:46.680> we've<00:02:46.890> I've<00:02:47.280> only

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
it's a clip as you see we've I've only

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.280 
it's a clip as you see we've I've only
sped<00:02:47.850> this<00:02:48.000> video<00:02:48.300> up<00:02:48.420> slightly<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.170> we're

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
sped this video up slightly and we're

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.980 
sped this video up slightly and we're
already<00:02:49.520> like<00:02:50.520> what<00:02:51.270> we're<00:02:51.450> already<00:02:51.540> at<00:02:51.840> the

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
already like what we're already at the

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.300 
already like what we're already at the
boss<00:02:52.170> essentially<00:02:52.740> a<00:02:52.770> zone<00:02:52.950> we've<00:02:53.070> got<00:02:53.160> one

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
boss essentially a zone we've got one

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.100 
boss essentially a zone we've got one
more<00:02:53.490> trash<00:02:53.790> bag<00:02:54.030> way<00:02:54.240> so<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:54.570> signals<00:02:54.990> like

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
more trash bag way so it signals like

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.110 
more trash bag way so it signals like
five<00:02:55.410> minutes<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.890> get<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.160> this<00:02:56.280> point<00:02:56.550> so<00:02:57.060> it

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
five minutes to get to this point so it

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.880 
five minutes to get to this point so it
won't<00:02:57.300> take<00:02:57.360> long<00:02:57.510> out<00:02:58.050> of<00:02:58.110> your<00:02:58.380> day<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.560> do

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
won't take long out of your day to do

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.500 
won't take long out of your day to do
these<00:02:59.040> runs<00:02:59.340> so<00:02:59.580> I<00:02:59.610> would<00:02:59.940> recommend<00:03:00.390> doing

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
these runs so I would recommend doing

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.600 
these runs so I would recommend doing
them<00:03:00.750> each<00:03:00.870> day<00:03:01.140> because<00:03:02.100> it's<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.430> quick

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
them each day because it's a quick

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.300 
them each day because it's a quick
chance<00:03:02.940> that<00:03:03.120> amount<00:03:03.770> so<00:03:04.770> once<00:03:04.920> again<00:03:05.010> making

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
chance that amount so once again making

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.800 
chance that amount so once again making
use<00:03:05.520> of<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.730> cauldron<00:03:06.120> getting<00:03:06.570> all<00:03:06.690> these

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
use of the cauldron getting all these

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.780 
use of the cauldron getting all these
mobs<00:03:07.080> encased<00:03:07.560> in<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:07.950> just<00:03:08.310> makes<00:03:08.459> them<00:03:08.580> so

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
mobs encased in it just makes them so

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.030 
mobs encased in it just makes them so
much<00:03:08.910> easier<00:03:09.300> to<00:03:09.450> kill<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:09.840> then<00:03:10.590> once

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
much easier to kill and then once

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.560 
much easier to kill and then once
they're<00:03:11.250> all<00:03:11.370> dead<00:03:11.610> we<00:03:11.790> can<00:03:11.940> make<00:03:12.240> our<00:03:12.390> way<00:03:12.510> to

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
they're all dead we can make our way to

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.660 
they're all dead we can make our way to
the<00:03:12.750> boss<00:03:12.900> so<00:03:13.200> he<00:03:13.380> has<00:03:13.560> decapitate<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.490> won't

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
the boss so he has decapitate you won't

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.830 
the boss so he has decapitate you won't
need<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.820> worry<00:03:15.060> about<00:03:15.120> if<00:03:15.390> you're<00:03:15.540> actually

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
need to worry about if you're actually

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.740 
need to worry about if you're actually
tanking<00:03:16.230> him<00:03:16.350> and<00:03:16.530> he's<00:03:17.250> devastate<00:03:18.030> I<00:03:18.300> think

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
tanking him and he's devastate I think

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.690 
tanking him and he's devastate I think
it's<00:03:18.870> called<00:03:19.110> basically<00:03:19.950> I'll<00:03:20.100> do<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.250> frontal

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
at a certain point you will need to

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.199 
at a certain point you will need to
worry<00:03:25.830> about<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.310> pop<00:03:26.489> offensive<00:03:27.060> and

point but even so even if you're in a
low<00:03:46.140> item<00:03:46.530> lovely<00:03:46.799> should<00:03:47.070> have<00:03:47.250> no<00:03:47.489> issues

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
defensive light you should be fine so

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.170 
defensive light you should be fine so
remember<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.160> reason<00:03:59.400> of<00:03:59.519> a<00:03:59.610> mob<00:03:59.760> in<00:03:59.940> here

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
remember the reason of a mob in here

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.910 
remember the reason of a mob in here
they'll<00:04:00.510> burn<00:04:00.750> of<00:04:00.840> a<00:04:00.930> boss<00:04:01.110> that<00:04:01.350> will<00:04:01.500> drop<00:04:01.739> a

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
they'll burn of a boss that will drop a

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.100 
they'll burn of a boss that will drop a
mount<00:04:02.220> that<00:04:02.340> is<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:02.790> Swift<00:04:03.180> Zoli<00:04:03.660> in<00:04:03.810> Panther

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
mount that is the Swift Zoli in Panther

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.350 
mount that is the Swift Zoli in Panther
so<00:04:04.920> I<00:04:04.950> would<00:04:05.310> recommend<00:04:05.700> doing<00:04:05.820> both<00:04:06.120> of<00:04:06.150> them

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
so I would recommend doing both of them

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.970 
so I would recommend doing both of them
if<00:04:06.480> you<00:04:06.600> don't<00:04:06.750> have<00:04:06.989> any<00:04:07.200> of<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.500> mounts<00:04:07.860> you

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
if you don't have any of the mounts you

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.500 
if you don't have any of the mounts you
know<00:04:08.100> just<00:04:08.400> just<00:04:08.730> enough<00:04:08.970> amounts<00:04:09.330> your

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
know just just enough amounts your

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.960 
know just just enough amounts your
collection<00:04:09.930> really<00:04:10.220> if<00:04:11.220> you're<00:04:11.640> not<00:04:11.760> sure

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
collection really if you're not sure

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.880 
collection really if you're not sure
what<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.209> armored<00:04:12.840> roses<00:04:13.140> raptor<00:04:13.560> looks<00:04:13.739> like

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
what the armored roses raptor looks like

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.620 
what the armored roses raptor looks like
in<00:04:14.100> game<00:04:14.280> I<00:04:14.459> showed<00:04:14.640> your<00:04:14.820> image<00:04:15.150> of<00:04:15.299> it<00:04:15.420> at<00:04:15.540> the

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
in game I showed your image of it at the

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.539 
in game I showed your image of it at the
beginning<00:04:15.720> but<00:04:16.350> basically<00:04:16.739> it<00:04:17.040> is<00:04:17.070> a<00:04:17.220> red

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
beginning but basically it is a red

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.969 
beginning but basically it is a red
version<00:04:17.790> of<00:04:18.060> the<00:04:18.419> old<00:04:18.690> Swift<00:04:19.229> repair<00:04:19.709> and
