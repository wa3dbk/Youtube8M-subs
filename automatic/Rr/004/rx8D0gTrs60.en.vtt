00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.330
 next part to the scoreboard for 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.370
 scoreboard 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.860
 in the last two tutorials have 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.559
 we yes that the meyers and the 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.900
 Objectives made the goals and today 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.510
 I come to the teams that's why we are 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.060
 here also so that we also supplies 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.070
 of course, teams could form 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.019
 two teams so that software is with the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.920
 balogh kraft right left of alv rohde 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.859
 and opposite a friend ok and dustin 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.079
 Let's go and I would like to 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.950
 let the list show during 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:44.100
 welcome the nice gentlemen and indeed 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:46.950
 stop at the teams the list that's yes 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.399
 currently no register in the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.969
 scoreboard therefore will add first 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:01:02.420
 We call this a new team 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:05.580
 just once really cool name so then 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.439
 there's yes we jetset in the function 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.830
 shy 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:14.850
 I admit right now a team 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.610
 Of course not objective and now 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.479
 looking forward 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.869
 now I want and if I am now 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.119
 Of course, it is not possible to simply look 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.640
 Of course I have to manage again 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.340
 Give thiemann if I only one now 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.710
 there I am there then something goes in there 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.780
 it looks like that in the lists 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.479
 square brackets optional that is it 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.890
 you do not have to be there so i could 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.189
 enter player name 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:45.180
 but now if I just ran so now 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:48.380
 Sun ran a give then I was again 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.509
 out of the team went out a little later 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.670
 so that we want two teams to fly 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.420
 I again a team that has added 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:01.009
 have recommended so and if we are now 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.600
 Look at a lot more list 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.130
 you can see that is the two teams there 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.300
 with zero players but I am yes 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.400
 again out of the team went out like that 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.680
 then i add now denmark and in 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:20.170
 Daniel 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:22.549
 with the function to the eurogroup added 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.650
 that was wrong of course i have to have one 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:32.780
 Add money for new teams 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:39.170
 in jolo comes as frodo and the balogh 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:49.280
 then join the zach team and jan 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:53.290
 and me and me as the car 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.480
 I'm completely okay with the tab 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:02.480
 Well then we have two teams with us 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.409
 There are two players each now 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.260
 shy away 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:09.769
 as you can see there is also the 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.019
 option version so that means that in 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:16.159
 If so, options are available to the teams 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:21.829
 of course now it had to be imprinted 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:24.440
 Only then will be for which team 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.549
 I would like that then I take now 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.750
 system jolo 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.430
 then you go the 3 choose the man 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.260
 can 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:39.590
 and then I take now first the 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:42.530
 friendly fire and set it to true 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:46.759
 jolo is marco and dani marco lick 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.229
 dani again, that's his name 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:52.699
 can hurt his teammate 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:57.949
 Add that to continue please still 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:04:00.560
 I can not beat it anymore 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:02.120
 that means friendly fire on the spot 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.959
 with it and his friends no harm 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.669
 can inflict 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:11.359
 for the people and him of course already 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:12.829
 so then my team gets the team purpose 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:15.259
 now another option 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:18.440
 and that's what 's already happening, she gives 

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:22.550
 kalla and there is a big one 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:25.139
 water is quite big already wrong 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.480
 but tell me, yes, some 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.430
 in different colors and here 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.340
 there are also strikes true so 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.930
 crossed out underline and so on 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:41.169
 and then I take for our team now 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:46.410
 blue rogesa the jahn and I would have to 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:51.100
 Also a blue name have exercise head like that 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:55.180
 well so sorry shortly took short coffee 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:59.380
 back there ok janduda stop the button 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.419
 press on the command blog so it is 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.030
 yes now visible as no longer 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.850
 That's why there is a great other here 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:10.230
 function and the friendly investors 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:13.919
 so friends of the invisible people 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:17.169
 and if I put it on pro then then 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.650
 is in the very slight shimmer sag 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.250
 me once 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:26.470
 and the others rather marco and dani 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:28.540
 can not see the jÃ¶rg marco of 1 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.850
 only I can see him which 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.850
 just turned on ok and now 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:38.860
 Just let the list show that 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:42.520
 was yes scoreboard tips and then the 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.500
 list is here in it 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.310
 how is your club in purpose 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:51.910
 two players yes and no jolo two players 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:55.000
 photo and marko baloh crafter lure 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:59.350
 now there is also the function around the 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.640
 to empty groups I show times and 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:07.720
 Although the group jolo willingly emptied 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:10.270
 Now marco and daniel are not anymore 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.260
 in the comic karimov car players 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.660
 from team jolo 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.450
 and then there's the remote 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.520
 function so the deletion function and the 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.010
 teams said i just slash now 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.850
 we do not need that anymore 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:27.850
 If we now again the list 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:29.770
 Calling you can see that without jolo there 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.390
 is because i deleted it but got it 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.240
 no players stop 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:37.360
 since I was the one off, that's okay 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.080
 now all the functions for the for the 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.000
 teams 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.979
 I hope this is was understandable in 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.009
 Questions write in the comments 

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:49.539

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:52.090

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:04.300
