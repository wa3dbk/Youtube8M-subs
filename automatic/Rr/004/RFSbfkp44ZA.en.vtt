00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
behavior one of the things that I see a

softly I think a lot of folks are

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.439 
softly I think a lot of folks are
nervous<00:00:20.369> about<00:00:20.550> over<00:00:20.880> correcting<00:00:21.240> which<00:00:21.359> I

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
nervous about over correcting which I

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.300 
nervous about over correcting which I
understand<00:00:21.900> but<00:00:22.500> one<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.859> things<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.220> we

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
understand but one of the things that we

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.060 
understand but one of the things that we
end<00:00:23.460> up<00:00:23.580> doing<00:00:23.789> when<00:00:24.539> we<00:00:24.689> when<00:00:24.960> they're<00:00:25.140> overly

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
end up doing when we when they're overly

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.509 
end up doing when we when they're overly
cautious<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.760> incrementally<00:00:27.510> correcting

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
cautious and incrementally correcting

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.650 
cautious and incrementally correcting
just<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.609> little<00:00:29.820> bit<00:00:29.939> more<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.269> little<00:00:30.510> bit<00:00:30.539> more

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
just a little bit more a little bit more

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.420 
just a little bit more a little bit more
what<00:00:31.019> we<00:00:31.109> end<00:00:31.260> up<00:00:31.380> doing<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.679> nagging<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.279> dog

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
what we end up doing is nagging the dog

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.690 
what we end up doing is nagging the dog
and<00:00:32.899> teaching<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.020> dog<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.469> just<00:00:34.739> ignore<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
and teaching the dog to just ignore the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.979 
and teaching the dog to just ignore the
consequences<00:00:36.450> or<00:00:37.550> Corrections<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.600> it's

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
consequences or Corrections and so it's

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.650 
consequences or Corrections and so it's
much<00:00:40.320> more<00:00:40.350> effective<00:00:40.770> if<00:00:41.190> we<00:00:41.340> look<00:00:41.670> for<00:00:42.059> a

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
much more effective if we look for a

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.380 
much more effective if we look for a
more<00:00:43.469> significant<00:00:44.160> conversation<00:00:44.820> not<00:00:45.000> trying

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
more significant conversation not trying

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.220 
more significant conversation not trying
to<00:00:45.480> blow<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.809> dog's<00:00:45.960> mind<00:00:46.430> nothing<00:00:47.430> that's

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
to blow the dog's mind nothing that's

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.010 
to blow the dog's mind nothing that's
inappropriate<00:00:49.230> but<00:00:50.360> we<00:00:51.360> have<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.719> find<00:00:51.930> that

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
inappropriate but we have to find that

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.020 
inappropriate but we have to find that
sweet<00:00:52.289> spot<00:00:52.590> where<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:53.070> create<00:00:53.430> buy-in<00:00:53.850> from

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
sweet spot where we create buy-in from

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.170 
sweet spot where we create buy-in from
the<00:00:54.120> dog<00:00:54.390> because<00:00:54.840> if<00:00:55.710> we<00:00:55.829> continuously<00:00:56.430> go<00:00:57.059> in

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
the dog because if we continuously go in

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.330 
the dog because if we continuously go in
these<00:00:57.300> tiny<00:00:57.629> little<00:00:57.899> increments<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
these tiny little increments and the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.770 
these tiny little increments and the
reward<00:00:59.760> for<00:01:00.859> chasing<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.920> squirrel<00:01:02.190> or<00:01:02.780> running

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
the front door breaking place is more

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.359 
the front door breaking place is more
valuable<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.110> them<00:01:07.380> than<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.770> consequence

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
valuable to them than the consequence

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.219 
valuable to them than the consequence
has<00:01:08.520> value<00:01:08.939> they're<00:01:09.390> gonna<00:01:09.540> continue<00:01:09.869> to

at least I'm telling you that that that

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.690 
at least I'm telling you that that that
conversation<00:01:24.869> isn't<00:01:25.140> really<00:01:25.680> valuable<00:01:26.580> or

already<00:01:42.060> taught<00:01:42.360> those<00:01:42.600> fairly<00:01:42.869> before<00:01:43.259> we<00:01:43.350> go

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
already taught those fairly before we go

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.830 
already taught those fairly before we go
to<00:01:43.530> Corrections<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.700> only<00:01:44.880> exceptions<00:01:45.450> tend

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
to Corrections the only exceptions tend

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.179 
to Corrections the only exceptions tend
to<00:01:45.960> be<00:01:47.360> more<00:01:48.360> along<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.840> lines<00:01:49.049> with<00:01:49.320> with<00:01:50.070> the

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
to be more along the lines with with the

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.889 
to be more along the lines with with the
walk<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:51.950> thresholds<00:01:53.119> with<00:01:54.119> those<00:01:54.329> because

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
walk and thresholds with those because

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.359 
walk and thresholds with those because
they're<00:01:55.229> very<00:01:55.350> simple<00:01:55.740> behaviors<00:01:56.280> just

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
they're very simple behaviors just

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.219 
they're very simple behaviors just
slowing<00:01:56.939> down<00:01:57.060> movement<00:01:57.509> I'll<00:01:57.630> tend<00:01:58.140> to

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
slowing down movement I'll tend to

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.660 
slowing down movement I'll tend to
correct<00:01:58.530> earlier<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:59.070> but<00:01:59.250> anything<00:01:59.549> more

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
correct earlier on but anything more

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.060 
correct earlier on but anything more
complex<00:02:00.090> ones<00:02:00.390> we<00:02:00.930> want<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.380> want<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:01.979> make

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
complex ones we want to want to make

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.350 
complex ones we want to want to make
sure<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.340> dog<00:02:02.490> knows<00:02:02.759> what<00:02:02.939> we're<00:02:03.090> looking

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
sure the dog knows what we're looking

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.999 
sure the dog knows what we're looking
for

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
for

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.889 
for
so<00:02:05.009> if<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.369> dogs<00:02:05.579> on<00:02:05.880> leash<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.270> prong<00:02:06.540> then

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
so if the dogs on leash and prong then

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.869 
so if the dogs on leash and prong then
it's<00:02:07.049> going<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.380> mean<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.860> stronger<00:02:08.429> pop<00:02:08.670> with

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
it's going to mean a stronger pop with

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.550 
it's going to mean a stronger pop with
the<00:02:08.970> leash<00:02:09.119> Oppong<00:02:09.479> if<00:02:09.810> it's<00:02:10.050> on<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.229> e-collar

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
the leash Oppong if it's on the e-collar

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.900 
the leash Oppong if it's on the e-collar
it's

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
it's

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.220 
it's
I<00:02:10.940> mean<00:02:11.150> a<00:02:11.180> higher<00:02:11.450> level<00:02:11.780> on<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:11.900> e-collar

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
I mean a higher level on the e-collar

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.710 
I mean a higher level on the e-collar
and<00:02:12.530> your<00:02:13.460> job<00:02:13.700> is<00:02:13.730> really<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.210> find<00:02:14.510> that

so if you see the behavior happening

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.930

valuable for him enough to change his

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.470 
valuable for him enough to change his
behavior<00:02:33.800> so<00:02:34.370> look<00:02:34.700> for<00:02:34.880> that<00:02:34.910> sweet<00:02:35.270> spot
