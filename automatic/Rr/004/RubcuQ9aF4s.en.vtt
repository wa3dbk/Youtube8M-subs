notification<00:02:14.550> light<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.270> guess<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:15.959> anyway

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
notification light I guess so anyway

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.330 
notification light I guess so anyway
let's<00:02:16.800> turn<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.069> on<00:02:17.160> let's<00:02:17.879> check<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.209> out

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
let's turn it on let's check that out

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.850 
let's turn it on let's check that out
oops<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:22.530> we're<00:02:23.160> up<00:02:23.310> guys<00:02:24.260> see<00:02:25.260> ya<00:02:25.410> this<00:02:25.620> turns

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
oops so we're up guys see ya this turns

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.190 
oops so we're up guys see ya this turns
this<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.520> a<00:02:26.849> capacitor<00:02:27.420> capacitor<00:02:27.870> for<00:02:27.989> home

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
this is a capacitor capacitor for home

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.619 
this is a capacitor capacitor for home
key<00:02:29.090> yep<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:31.170> that's<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:32.099> Menu<00:02:32.459> key<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:33.450> back

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
key yep and that's the Menu key the back

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.180 
key yep and that's the Menu key the back
key<00:02:34.370> so<00:02:35.370> yeah<00:02:35.489> this<00:02:35.670> is<00:02:35.819> a<00:02:35.910> 5.5<00:02:36.629> inch<00:02:36.989> display

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
key so yeah this is a 5.5 inch display

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.570 
key so yeah this is a 5.5 inch display
let's<00:02:38.190> crank<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.150> brightness<00:02:39.540> up<00:02:40.310> so<00:02:41.310> looks

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
let's crank the brightness up so looks

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.250 
let's crank the brightness up so looks
pretty<00:02:42.000> pride<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.510> viewing<00:02:42.840> angles<00:02:43.140> of

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
pretty pride the viewing angles of

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.690 
pretty pride the viewing angles of
decent<00:02:43.860> as<00:02:43.980> well<00:02:45.950> so<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:46.980> kind<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.370> feel<00:02:47.670> that

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
decent as well so I kind of feel that

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.839 
decent as well so I kind of feel that
this<00:02:48.120> phone<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:48.920> directly<00:02:49.920> competing<00:02:50.519> with

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
this phone is directly competing with

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.259 
this phone is directly competing with
the<00:02:51.030> oneplus<00:02:51.510> one<00:02:51.959> so

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
the oneplus one so

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.720 
the oneplus one so
the<00:02:54.810> specs<00:02:55.110> reflect<00:02:55.920> that<00:02:56.129> it's<00:02:56.340> powered<00:02:56.550> by<00:02:56.700> a

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
the specs reflect that it's powered by a

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.899 
the specs reflect that it's powered by a
Snapdragon<00:02:56.879> 801<00:02:57.629> chipset<00:02:58.379> so<00:02:58.700> that<00:02:59.700> is

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
Snapdragon 801 chipset so that is

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.210 
Snapdragon 801 chipset so that is
clogged<00:03:00.629> with<00:03:01.019> that<00:03:01.200> is<00:03:01.319> that<00:03:01.349> for<00:03:01.709> Krait<00:03:01.980> 400

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
clogged with that is that for Krait 400

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.280 
clogged with that is that for Krait 400
core<00:03:02.580> is<00:03:02.700> clocked<00:03:02.940> at<00:03:03.060> 2.5<00:03:03.629> gigahertz<00:03:03.959> each

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.740 
table Dino Dino 330 GPU and 2 gigs of

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.149 
RAM so that's one gig of ram less over
here<00:03:10.220> this<00:03:11.220> also<00:03:11.489> supports<00:03:12.209> 4k<00:03:13.159> video

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
here this also supports 4k video

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:20.030 
here this also supports 4k video
recording<00:03:14.690> so<00:03:16.129> let's<00:03:17.129> check<00:03:17.940> it<00:03:18.090> out<00:03:19.040> yeah

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
recording so let's check it out yeah

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.949 
recording so let's check it out yeah
that's<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:21.000> video<00:03:21.209> camera

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
that's the video camera

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.110 
that's the video camera
no<00:03:22.550> okay<00:03:23.580> that<00:03:23.909> is<00:03:25.159> the<00:03:26.159> gallery<00:03:26.519> okay<00:03:26.849> the

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
no okay that is the gallery okay the

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.559 
no okay that is the gallery okay the
video<00:03:27.450> camera<00:03:27.810> mode<00:03:28.730> settings<00:03:29.730> with<00:03:30.390> your

video camera mode settings with your
quality<00:03:30.959> 4k<00:03:31.650> video<00:03:32.750> so<00:03:33.750> that's<00:03:34.200> 4k<00:03:36.230> and<00:03:37.230> the

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
quality 4k video so that's 4k and the

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:49.160

battery is low writing off if you get

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.220 
battery is low writing off if you get
that<00:04:06.420> full<00:04:06.780> of<00:04:06.900> dyma<00:04:09.110> here's<00:04:10.110> the

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
that full of dyma here's the

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.170 
that full of dyma here's the
front-facing<00:04:10.470> camera<00:04:11.040> hey<00:04:11.819> guys

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
front-facing camera hey guys

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.879 
front-facing camera hey guys
five<00:04:13.019> megapixel<00:04:13.530> again<00:04:14.180> so<00:04:15.180> pretty<00:04:15.750> good<00:04:15.889> so

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
five megapixel again so pretty good so

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.240 
five megapixel again so pretty good so
it's<00:04:17.609> got<00:04:17.850> 32<00:04:18.810> gigs<00:04:19.019> of<00:04:19.229> on-board<00:04:19.410> storage<00:04:19.680> and

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
it's got 32 gigs of on-board storage and

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.830 
it's got 32 gigs of on-board storage and
apart<00:04:20.669> from<00:04:20.729> that<00:04:20.880> you<00:04:21.030> can<00:04:21.209> expand<00:04:21.540> using

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
apart from that you can expand using

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.340 
apart from that you can expand using
micro<00:04:22.109> SD<00:04:22.350> which<00:04:22.500> is<00:04:22.590> a<00:04:22.620> definite<00:04:23.070> plus

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
micro SD which is a definite plus

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.140 
micro SD which is a definite plus
od<00:04:25.350> one<00:04:25.470> plus<00:04:25.650> one<00:04:25.860> and<00:04:25.919> it<00:04:26.160> sprays<00:04:26.460> similarly

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
od one plus one and it sprays similarly

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.450 
od one plus one and it sprays similarly
so<00:04:27.960> it's<00:04:28.110> available<00:04:28.530> just<00:04:28.740> in<00:04:28.889> China<00:04:29.160> right

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
so it's available just in China right

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.040 
so it's available just in China right
now<00:04:29.520> and<00:04:29.910> when<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.210> international<00:04:30.690> rollout

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
now and when the international rollout

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.110 
now and when the international rollout
begins<00:04:31.460> which<00:04:32.460> ZD<00:04:33.000> say<00:04:33.900> will<00:04:34.440> happen<00:04:34.970> when<00:04:35.970> the

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
begins which ZD say will happen when the

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.030 
begins which ZD say will happen when the
international<00:04:36.570> rollout<00:04:36.900> begins<00:04:37.320> it<00:04:37.560> should

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
international rollout begins it should

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.909 
international rollout begins it should
offer<00:04:38.220> competition<00:04:39.000> to<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.470> one<00:04:40.470> plus<00:04:40.710> one

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
offer competition to the one plus one

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.010 
offer competition to the one plus one
and<00:04:41.100> my<00:04:41.160> honest<00:04:41.400> opinion<00:04:41.729> so<00:04:41.880> a<00:04:42.210> log<00:04:42.570> boil<00:04:42.810> down

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
and my honest opinion so a log boil down

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.170 
and my honest opinion so a log boil down
to<00:04:43.080> the<00:04:43.440> way<00:04:43.560> software<00:04:43.830> works<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:45.030> new
