00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.610
 hello to all so it's the little gobbi 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.010
 and we end up in a new 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.469
 video I introduced you the pen of 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.389
 Hogwarts so great object harry 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:25.350
 potter of which what to go directly to the 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:29.510
 presentation so the box measures 32 cm 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.640
 on 13 cm and 5 cm in height 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.040
 so the box to do it but there is 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.340
 a very pretty satin ribbon that is 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.550
 yellow is behind the box there is it 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.290
 is written harry potter warner bros and 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.290
 2007 so she the year of manufacture 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:51.360
 on the front of the box we can 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.670
 observe the Hogwarts castle on 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:03.300
 hen's coat of arms again is a feather 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:08.700
 so we're going to open it inside there 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.979
 the pen and inkwells and toss the pen 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.470
 who has a handle 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:20.189
 so we hold it that is rigid 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.890
 unlike the feather pen and 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.619
 chocolate colors with reflections 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:31.079
 brown the back of the pen is a 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:33.119
 little white color creates a little 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.210
 bottle where we are given de lancre 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:43.320
 the black inked and there is no symbol 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:45.600
 Harry Potter on the ink there 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.560
 so rigid plastic so as in 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.270
 the character woods of the chopsticks 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.540
 we will move to the most beautiful object of 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.060
 the box for me is the inkwell so 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.500
 a super nice well detailed object that 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.840
 ferrand true what not replicate so on 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.360
 the inkwell al blazon of Hogwarts with 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.060
 Slytherin Gryffindor Hufflepuff Srd 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.200
 eagles the inkwell placed on a small 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:16.830
 wooden platform and behind one can 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.260
 observe one more a harry writing 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.260
 potter with the year of manufacture which 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.900
 is 2007 and warner bros is useful three 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.730
 small lozenges like velvet for 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.720
 protect the wood from friction 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.640
 when we put it on a support so 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.410
 the anchor when poured it in the inkwell 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.019
 inside there is a small foam 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.200
 which absorbs throwing that prevents throwing of 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:43.170
 to dry and to be able to keep it 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.360
 so we plant the feather in the inkwell 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.019
 and it's a super nice object 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.850
 collection 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:53.220
 we can display in his room by 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:55.610
 example so here is a + and do not forget 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.610
