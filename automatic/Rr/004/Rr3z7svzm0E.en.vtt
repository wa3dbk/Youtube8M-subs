lot of bacon they give you it's like
bacon<00:02:25.450> bites<00:02:25.650> it's<00:02:26.650> very<00:02:27.010> small<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:28.950> amount

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
bacon bites it's very small the amount

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.640 
bacon bites it's very small the amount
of<00:02:30.250> making<00:02:30.550> they<00:02:30.640> they<00:02:31.150> give<00:02:31.330> you<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.660> you

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
of making they they give you it you

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.060 
of making they they give you it you
barely<00:02:33.010> taste<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:34.209> egg<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:35.500> kind<00:02:35.769> of<00:02:35.860> I

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
barely taste it the egg you kind of I

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.150 
barely taste it the egg you kind of I
mean<00:02:36.459> this<00:02:37.030> also<00:02:37.269> is<00:02:37.570> overtaking<00:02:38.170> all<00:02:38.890> the

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
mean this also is overtaking all the

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.550 
mean this also is overtaking all the
flavor<00:02:39.750> which<00:02:40.750> is<00:02:40.780> good<00:02:41.019> it<00:02:41.230> tastes<00:02:41.410> really

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
flavor which is good it tastes really

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.520 
flavor which is good it tastes really
good<00:02:41.800> but<00:02:41.860> it's<00:02:42.280> just<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:43.810> just<00:02:43.840> tells<00:02:44.170> my<00:02:44.290> mind

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
good but it's just it just tells my mind

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.860 
good but it's just it just tells my mind
hey<00:02:44.709> this<00:02:44.890> isn't<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.220> breakfast<00:02:45.610> I<00:02:45.850> don't<00:02:46.690> hear

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
hey this isn't a breakfast I don't hear

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.590 
hey this isn't a breakfast I don't hear
it<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.230> I<00:02:48.160> think<00:02:48.610> that<00:02:48.700> kind<00:02:48.880> of<00:02:48.940> defeats<00:02:49.570> the

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
it and I think that kind of defeats the

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.009 
it and I think that kind of defeats the
purpose

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
purpose

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.610 
purpose
um<00:02:50.230> I<00:02:50.620> think<00:02:51.250> what<00:02:51.340> they<00:02:51.430> should<00:02:51.640> have<00:02:51.670> done<00:02:52.620> is

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
um I think what they should have done is

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.900 
um I think what they should have done is
that<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.950> sausage<00:02:54.340> patty<00:02:54.580> in<00:02:54.700> there<00:02:54.820> because

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
that the sausage patty in there because

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.060 
that the sausage patty in there because
I<00:02:55.000> think<00:02:55.200> when<00:02:56.200> I<00:02:56.230> think<00:02:56.290> about<00:02:56.500> breakfast<00:02:57.010> I

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
I think when I think about breakfast I

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.330 
I think when I think about breakfast I
think<00:02:57.220> about<00:02:57.340> eggs<00:02:57.580> sausage<00:02:58.120> patty<00:02:58.390> I<00:02:59.340> don't

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
think about eggs sausage patty I don't

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.949 
think about eggs sausage patty I don't
know<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.580> combinations<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.239> salsa<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:01.900> the

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
know the combinations of salsa and the

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.580 
know the combinations of salsa and the
sausage<00:03:02.290> patty<00:03:02.530> would<00:03:02.920> would<00:03:03.690> would<00:03:04.690> conflict

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
sausage patty would would would conflict

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.440 
sausage patty would would would conflict
with<00:03:05.830> each<00:03:06.250> other<00:03:06.430> or<00:03:06.640> maybe<00:03:07.060> thought<00:03:07.269> was

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
with each other or maybe thought was

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.789 
with each other or maybe thought was
just<00:03:07.600> too<00:03:07.690> expensive<00:03:07.840> if<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:08.380> don't<00:03:08.560> charge<00:03:08.680> a

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
just too expensive if you don't charge a

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.650 
just too expensive if you don't charge a
$3<00:03:09.340> even<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:09.820> just<00:03:09.940> gave<00:03:10.060> a<00:03:10.090> sausage<00:03:10.420> fat<00:03:10.570> in

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
$3 even and just gave a sausage fat in

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.180 
$3 even and just gave a sausage fat in
there<00:03:10.810> I<00:03:10.840> think<00:03:10.959> that<00:03:11.110> would<00:03:11.290> be<00:03:11.440> very<00:03:11.680> great

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
there I think that would be very great

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.280 
there I think that would be very great
improvement<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:13.330> I<00:03:13.420> stole<00:03:13.720> from<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:13.959> scale<00:03:14.170> one

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
improvement and I stole from a scale one

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.550 
improvement and I stole from a scale one
to<00:03:14.380> ten<00:03:14.560> I<00:03:14.590> might<00:03:14.830> have<00:03:14.920> to<00:03:15.010> give<00:03:15.130> us<00:03:15.220> a<00:03:15.310> five<00:03:15.580> I

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
to ten I might have to give us a five I

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.820 
to ten I might have to give us a five I
mean<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:18.100> flavors<00:03:18.489> are<00:03:18.610> there<00:03:18.640> but<00:03:19.620> I'm<00:03:20.620> not

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
mean the flavors are there but I'm not

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.789
