quite route to this first pond over here

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.140 
quite route to this first pond over here
which<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.650> actually<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.950> deep<00:01:20.159> pond<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.759> it

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
which is actually a deep pond and it

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.850 
which is actually a deep pond and it
clicks<00:01:21.390> all<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.840> solids<00:01:22.259> as<00:01:22.380> well<00:01:22.560> as<00:01:22.710> all

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
clicks all of the solids as well as all

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.340 
clicks all of the solids as well as all
of<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.070> liquid<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.549> washdown<00:01:23.729> water

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
of the liquid and the washdown water

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.830

that'll<00:01:25.350> be<00:01:25.439> pumped<00:01:25.799> directly<00:01:25.920> using<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.140 

goes<00:01:30.840> on

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
goes on

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.460 
goes on
is<00:01:31.390> it<00:01:31.540> getting<00:01:31.660> organic<00:01:32.020> measuring

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
is it getting organic measuring

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.260 
is it getting organic measuring
nutrients<00:01:33.040> so<00:01:33.190> it's<00:01:33.310> got<00:01:33.430> a<00:01:33.460> fertilizer<00:01:33.940> value

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
nutrients so it's got a fertilizer value

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.610 
nutrients so it's got a fertilizer value
and<00:01:34.390> you<00:01:34.480> can't<00:01:34.690> belly<00:01:34.900> which<00:01:35.110> goes<00:01:35.290> back<00:01:35.470> on

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
and you can't belly which goes back on

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.910 
and you can't belly which goes back on
the<00:01:35.770> farm<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:37.600> it<00:01:37.930> gets<00:01:38.170> full<00:01:38.440> except<00:01:38.800> you've

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
the farm is it gets full except you've

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.980 
the farm is it gets full except you've
got<00:01:39.010> an<00:01:39.130> overflow<00:01:39.550> pipe<00:01:39.850> and<00:01:40.540> it<00:01:40.690> drains

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
got an overflow pipe and it drains

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.780 
got an overflow pipe and it drains

sued<00:01:44.380> through<00:01:45.100> to<00:01:45.220> here<00:01:45.520> and<00:01:46.300> we<00:01:46.360> can<00:01:46.510> also

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
sued through to here and we can also

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.270 
sued through to here and we can also
pump<00:01:47.020> from<00:01:47.170> this<00:01:47.350> pond<00:01:47.590> as<00:01:47.770> well<00:01:47.920> so<00:01:48.160> if<00:01:48.250> we

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
pump from this pond as well so if we

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.550 
pump from this pond as well so if we
want<00:01:48.430> an<00:01:48.550> irrigation<00:01:48.910> water<00:01:49.210> we<00:01:50.140> can<00:01:50.320> pump

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
want an irrigation water we can pump

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.710 
want an irrigation water we can pump
using<00:01:50.980> net<00:01:51.160> irrigation<00:01:52.000> value<00:01:52.390> during<00:01:52.570> the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
using net irrigation value during the

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.110 
using net irrigation value during the
summer<00:01:52.960> and<00:01:53.500> it<00:01:53.680> could<00:01:53.710> also<00:01:53.980> be<00:01:54.160> recycled<00:01:54.760> to

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
summer and it could also be recycled to

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.570 
summer and it could also be recycled to
go<00:01:55.270> back<00:01:55.480> through<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:56.380> yards<00:01:56.800> only<00:01:56.950> but<00:01:57.310> text

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
go back through the yards only but text

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.730 
go back through the yards only but text

me reuse for rewashing beyond the the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.170 
me reuse for rewashing beyond the the
system<00:02:00.190> so<00:02:01.030> here<00:02:01.210> we<00:02:01.330> are<00:02:02.910> individually<00:02:03.910> head

to pass the main rotor equal film which

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.550 
to pass the main rotor equal film which
we'll<00:02:27.100> see<00:02:27.130> in<00:02:27.490> a<00:02:27.610> minute<00:02:27.730> here<00:02:28.690> is<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.440> front

everything<00:03:40.820> that<00:03:40.940> goes<00:03:41.090> into<00:03:41.390> movement

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:04:04.450 

various<00:03:51.760> ways<00:03:51.999> to<00:03:52.299> bring<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:53.790> mating

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
so the verdict we had a range of having

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.410 
so the verdict we had a range of having
kittens<00:04:06.800> luckily<00:04:07.490> wanted<00:04:07.850> this<00:04:08.000> quite<00:04:08.300> as

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
kittens luckily wanted this quite as

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:32.200 
kittens luckily wanted this quite as
possible

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:45.140

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.989 

maybe<00:04:50.169> just<00:04:50.379> a<00:04:50.499> little<00:04:50.679> bit<00:04:50.800> closer<00:04:51.039> so<00:04:51.819> this

00:04:51.989 --> 00:04:51.999 
maybe just a little bit closer so this

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:53.620 
maybe just a little bit closer so this
is<00:04:52.149> a<00:04:52.179> little

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630
