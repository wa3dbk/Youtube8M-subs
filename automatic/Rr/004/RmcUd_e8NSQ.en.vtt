 obviously all welcome to all from DJs 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.880
 for 98 in this very small tutorial e 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.539
 here they spend how to download and 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:24.400
 install so fast that 4 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:26.169
 4 skins for rich virtual dj sets on the 17th 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.039
 pro however also works for the version 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.499
 offline 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.060
 then saw that in order to save the 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:33.670
 cards officially from the site of two 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.590
 police and servants sign up and have a 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.330
 partner plan in practice you have to pay 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.520
 I will put in description link where 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:46.360
 it will therefore be for itself if it represents this 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.420
 file that occupies exactly fifteen 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.940
 almost sixteen megabytes so busy 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.580
 with space and quickly discharges e 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.370
 nothing i will tell you how to download as 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.870
 install the skins with stress that 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.820
 first of all, internet to hygiene 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.440
 download the advice file from 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.509
 open it with the transit which is a lot 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.729
 fast with that extract you will find with 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.490
 just four of these four skins 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.060
 different now is we'll have a proof 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.730
 serene 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.790
 the last monster skin that monster that is 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.250
 less pure alienware then in this 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.030
 if we extract this we put it here 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.119
 on the desktop 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.390
 and here it is monster kevin now 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.270
 you can also discharge your thumb in 7 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.610
 pros who still did the tutorial 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.600
 at it will do so or on the version 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.430
 Free 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.910
 then you have to go to explore 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.550
 document resources and you need to look for the 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:56.910
 virtual dj file so you have to go 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:02:00.720
 on documents we need to find echo virtual 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:04.080
 a fact of everything at the DJ and going into the 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:08.959
 skins folder then needed 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:12.480
 open the estimate you have chosen is 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.610
 dragged your two files that are 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.260
 who are inside and dragged her and 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.640
 in here 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.840
 in this case of the genre drag 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.970
 however not paying or allo 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.830
 drag directly as a file 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:30.150
 compressed that so much is the same thing 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:32.549
 then just open virtual dj in this 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.680
 both case or even halt 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.860
 also the free version in this 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.690
 case already a inserted kill that the skin 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.650
 alienware anyway go up 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.269
 configuration from the sun 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.730
 on the back side of the options 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:51.010
 and all the skins will appear here 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.420
 which is inside the folder that 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.200
 we put in this case monster 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.680
 kevin is this type of skin here or 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.349
 you can choose from the other skins that 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.540
 however and containing the file we have 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.860
