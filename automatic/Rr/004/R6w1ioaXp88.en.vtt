00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.129
 on the lake the white fleet of 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.070
 Lake Constance invites you in from the water 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.679
 whether by canoe by sailboat or by 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.199
 linienschiff already an everyday 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:27.019
 Commuter ferry passage can take a breath of 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.539
 Holiday mediate the so-called white 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.939
 Fleet these are the ships of Lake Constance 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.220
 Ship operations around the transport in 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.909
 our times annually over 2 million 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:41.089
 passengers over the lake the proud ms 

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:43.370
 Überlingen lays off the sun in constancy 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:44.449
 seems happy and sitting on deck 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.210
 acting people 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.979
 I'm going to be all summer 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.979
 I like the prospect of continuing 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.420
 the peaceful way 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.660
 We like that and above all else 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.550
 this crisscross drive now mine 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.850
 Constance now back in Meersburg or 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.640
 überlingen and lives in hagnau 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.280
 So there's a student in the ship 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.860
 opportunities well mostly a fresh 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.390
 air and has because it is bad 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.550
 Of course not so nice but we have 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.070
 So we are lucky most of the time 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.619
 weather it is only there as heat too 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.190
 made of big rounds is stone 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.900
 on the rhine and below to bregenz 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.119
 one does not need to inhabited abroad 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.729
 beautiful when thinking about storage 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.070
 car or lake Garda in all around 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.050
 this high-tech cockpit glazed 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.600
 the most modern bodensee ship is hardly 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.600
 to feel a vibration of the machine 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.090
 no wind hardly noises the captain 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.550
 explained that in the construction of this 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.899
 ship environmental standards an important 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.790
 have played role 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.220
 there was already the construction and the 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.670
 construction made sure that this 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.470
 ship in fuel consumption very cheap 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.569
 is designed from drag 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.630
 how do you do it? 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:08.000
 the current and this under water 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.000
 construction not so optimized 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.490
 that you do not cause much waves 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.420
 So when I'm on this ship very much 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.780
 well accomplished 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.550
 So if we have a great shape there 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.580
 The children are not so much anymore 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.490
 because there will be too few waves 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.380
 bit of history in the pile museum on 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.720
 the opposite shore of the lake 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.120
 we have already learned that in the 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.670
 Stone and bronze time traffic on 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.700
 the lake prevailed and the 20,000 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.069
 Visitors during the Constant Council 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.860
 Most of the meals came with the board 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.900
 over the water the history of the modern 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.110
 passenger shipping begins before 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.220
 about 200 years 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:54.380
 In 1824 there was the first one, so to speak 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.840
 course ship with a steamboat from 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.019
 friedrichshafen from direction rorschach 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.330
 that has then evolved it 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.480
 gave 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:07.020
 then the Baden shipping also in 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.720
 Konstanz the time later the Bavarian 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.520
 Shipping from Lindau and just the 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.220
 Württemberg from Friedrichshafen the 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.010
 were then summarized as later 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.460
 after the second world war then too 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.770
 through the German railway the whole 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.930
 countries and has taken over shipping 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.170
 that's how she was born 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:32.400
 Bodensee ship operations then only 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.740
 2003 came off the train has the train has 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.170
 the colorful ship then to the 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.390
 Stadtwerke Konstanz sold at 18 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.540
 million overnight stays a year 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.480
 The Bodenseeregion one of the most important 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.980
 tourism destinations Lake Constance 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.230
 environmentally friendly by boat tour so 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.360
 silke rockenstein the spokeswoman of 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.110
 bodensee ship operations that is one 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.640
 real trend so what very strong 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.920
 continue to come is the 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.740
 yes have bicycle tourism at Lake Constance 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.450
 We keep on increasing and paying 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.760
 we also focus on that 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.489
 for example, the new ship ms 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.030
 We have a lot more to do over there 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:14.580
 area for bikes also planned 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.250
 more space for each bike 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.330
 because yes, the passengers always 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.580
 more valuable drive for humorous 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.950
 Participate in the Bodensee Schiffsbetriebe 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.270
 at the European 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.120
 Environmental certification the so-called 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.820
 formerly the seal of quality and put it that way 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.100
 at least a bit far from nature 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.230
 and landscaping demand the 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.350
 bodensee landscape to get 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:43.710
 We attach importance to partnerships 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.870
 offer many combo tickets with 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.690
 our big partners here at the lake like 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.090
 For example, the island mainau a 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.600
 Kombiticket and Federal ship operations 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.130
 For example, emas is also certified 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.370
 that means we also put a lot here 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.500
 Worth that our guests 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:04.200
 Environmentally friendly get to us on board 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.580
 So for the last leg of this Lake Constance 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.580
