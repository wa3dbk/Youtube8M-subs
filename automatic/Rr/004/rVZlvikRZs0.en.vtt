 Gameplay comments and indeed a whole 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.080
 normal team allowed with on the village 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.849
 it is played with the sar with one 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.410
 muffler to raiders quickly 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.449
 pull and steady everything in the hand 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.239
 Pro version and this extra weapons park 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.519
 is recoil yes I have it before that 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.250
 a user differentiated game 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:40.340
 played all have mastered against hab 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.150
 I still on tactics he on the 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.860
 default settings played and here 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.180
 i just wanted to go back to tactics 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.159
 and of course exactly in that 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.699
 moment someone comes around the corner and 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:52.170
 shoot me yes what do you learn out one 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.210
 put in front of the bridge in front of the bridge 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.879
 that you are secure or just yourself 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.070
 Retreat a safe corner and there 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.629
 that you can rest in a spot one 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.580
 can not be seen from 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.869
 I simply would have any opponents 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.430
 I just have to do something different 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:06.570
 leave me around the corner no one comes 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.330
 I have unfortunately been deceived 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.950
 and there had to be with so to speak 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.100
 pay for it as life is in 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.600
 mw3 yes on the village I find it 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.250
 pretty good one here these corners here 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.900
 controlled and manipulated is always 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.850
 or on the other side always this 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.230
 passage controlled here 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.820
 we look there are the opponents 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.220
 intercept pretty well with the ace year 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.440
 gives very good far rangers very well 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.630
 and why I take the silencer with me 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.400
 has and not other other attac 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.140
 switzerland it is very easy explained here 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.520
 several very nice brown fields 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.160
 just swearing in front of me is running me 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.550
 directly into the water pure so in the weapon 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.920
 me into the better albach fw 3 errors and 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.510
 rather why the participant balkan itself 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.580
 that's my first in the b3 game 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.260
 I have played since then again 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.360
 So I started playing that was 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.770
 about two weeks ago and there comes 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.180
 it was just this game that was that 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.560
 everything really the first thing I did 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.940
 once did not play course so synonymous 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.440
 outstanding for a first game night 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.070
 and barely half a year break with the 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.409
 whole stuff 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.810
 but I think it's just fine and me 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.120
 So enjoy far ahead of me at my it 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.140
 Year over in the background and so on 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.149
 You actually do it when you are now 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.230
 beginner is so I call myself now 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.890
 just myself again more than beginners 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.390
 not played for a long time 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.489
 that's why I try the from the 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.560
 Hotspot out of the things where 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.760
 So often opponents are where I am very much 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.269
 many can guess against 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.769
 What is it from the world is that one 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.670
 character were left beside me 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.970
 become 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.590
 I know how videos were developed 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.780
 but I really like the developer 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.890
 then fry over why the predator 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.159
 not met and I know myself 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.190
 Not 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:40.110
 but somehow I have in this game 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.250
 so are a trader magnet 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.379
 if I have three now four times 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.049
 run away from the things but me 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.489
 drive still wanted to say is a mine 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.540
 I started again as a beginner until I returned 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.310
 in it with the play 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.959
 and as long as I always try out of the 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.250
 Zones where I know that many are opponents 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.659
 especially I can stay out 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.010
 not so good on the maps anymore 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.810
 there are any clichés there are 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.220
 give something that you have to 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.659
 should pay attention to any maps 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.190
 and that's why everyone was always happy 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.810
 safe cover stays and mine 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.090
 can compensate for cover to the one located 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.079
 at the moment not so good with the goal here 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.269
 I need a bit 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:11.129
 look the same and yet the 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.440
 larger covers I procured myself 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.290
 I just do not balance that 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.909
 I just tell so slow slow 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.440
 should achieve something slow 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.750
 putting on balance can be the opposite 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.730
 to a better opponent of course that 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.260
 You think I'm slowly aiming for someone 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.790
 who did not have the cover of the 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.230
 then be able to aim very well for my sake 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.370
 You still can not not 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.199
 because I'm in a ton 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.120
 urban I do not know what these 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:35.310
 band that against me what i have 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.780
 they did somehow bad day 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.430
 let me go because they had not 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.530
 but that has me a bit 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.120
 the predators are eaten up by the speech of 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.430
 Here, that was not a good idea 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.799
 you tell the whole thing the same 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.090
 whole thought my whole it will be 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.099
 of course disappear alone in 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.750
 the middle and the cd same that I 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.190
 gets nervous and does not know what 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.319
 I'll blinded myself too 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.760
 I said a bit 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.129
 a little bit of fear do not get a tip 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.959
 given time to look at real estate then 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.879
 in the minimap because there is namely 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.560
 yours so in the big moment moves the 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.150
 Start button participated there 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.889
 namely your map drawn in and 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.569
 there you can see exactly where 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:11.040
 possibly a red dot origin and 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.810
 shoot the enemy that could be on the 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.190
 small stage 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.650
 then do not look left because just in 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.000
 blinded to the moment so you one 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.320
 small tip next if you totally 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.730
 flashed time you have to press start 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.290
 then you see the big map 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.270
 and if you are somewhere in one 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.150
 red dot sees the shoots then you can 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.100
 you still fight colleagues, so to speak 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.750
 you have seen that as you can see I am 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.370
 first of all in the team what not exactly for 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.350
 the good kite of my team speaks well 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.730
 because normally they would have to 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.180
 actually be all shape if the 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.620
 are a little better in gambling and there 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.330
 You can see I play very carefully 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.590
 I'm all guessing that there is someone 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.820
 that was only luck that he me 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.139
 approved hit why am I on 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.520
 I shot where I got the whole drum 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:46.790
 this will probably be watched by yourself 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.680
 Not 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.000
 and again a nice brown mistake like 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.580
 the daily mirror 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.590
 where I play in this first couple 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.660
 So umgeguckt because am once again 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.790
 that I've been extremely annoyed 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.440
 partly that you especially on the 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.430
 I want to break down smaller maps now 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.440
 nothing to say he's probably 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.030
 it did not go any different 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.800
 but is also so bigger 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.780
 webservices and i am just small 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.919
 not big but not small 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.139
 That would be a bit too much 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.460
 optimize that not so submitted 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.290
 are points and you can then 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.020
 somehow not change I will establish the 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.880
 transport the type in the im 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.830
 space where else in the area of ​​100 meters 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.430
 He says he weighs because I'm fine 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.280
 do not know how to do that 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.450
 but development technology does 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.490
 somehow it must be feasible that 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.580
 it is not really blatant if 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.840
 this game is pretty over with that now 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.130
 family brought back in if you see 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.830
 now I'm shot too 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.910
 I can not connect anymore because of that 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.560
 I cover up as slow 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.830
 will tackle previously with the technology 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.610
 opponents are thus with orientation 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.810
 find out where the opponents are then 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.639
 I've heard names from now 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.500
 shoulder goes away a little bit luck 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:50.240
 but do not rush anything but then 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.950
 then you meet the opponents celebrate 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.020
 if you do not play so well yes 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.190
 already on the left comes one and I am 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.080
 gone again because I was not paying attention 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.280
 have my flanks long in the case 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.539
 I should have just retired 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.860
 because I did not know how many opponents there 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.780
 I've been researching 2 from the left 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.130
 I have killed, I would have called me 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.770
 had to retreat would have to wait 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.330
 whether other opponents to take advantage of that and 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.220
 then on from the ambush again 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.960
 strike them here on this 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.580
 wanted to pull snipers was one 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.810
 pretty good idea of ​​me, I have to 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.190
 just come in again and those in 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.780
 such automatisms that you can not do that 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.700
 makes more 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.290
 I can also give you on the way 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.120
 if you see it fall asleep for you 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.280
 An opponent pulls off a pretty path 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.650
 Great distance of the year so good 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.940
 big distance but then go dear 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.830
 in cover it does not risk because that 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.210
 it's not worth it 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:34.300
 in the end my team has unfortunately 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.740
 I'm lost only on 21 09 is now 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.000
 no outstanding games but what wants 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.150
 more from the first game 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.500
 few months break and I hope that 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.110
 the video has fallen and I would 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:47.070
 thank me for the thumbs up 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.070
 and see you next time
