00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.270 
something along those lines something
very<00:01:56.219> easy<00:01:56.490> we'd<00:01:57.149> be<00:01:57.270> like<00:01:57.420> na<00:01:57.750> ump45<00:01:58.350> nuke<00:01:58.859> so

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
very easy we'd be like na ump45 nuke so

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.219 
very easy we'd be like na ump45 nuke so
I<00:01:59.310> thought<00:01:59.520> I'll<00:01:59.700> try<00:01:59.909> vector<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.600> obviously

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
I thought I'll try vector and obviously

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.419 
I thought I'll try vector and obviously
you've<00:02:01.439> got<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.649> unlock<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.070> suppressor

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
you've got to unlock the suppressor

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:04.999 
you've got to unlock the suppressor
because<00:02:03.390> it's<00:02:03.539> the<00:02:03.719> noisiest<00:02:04.229> submachine<00:02:04.799> gun

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
because it's the noisiest submachine gun

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.679 
because it's the noisiest submachine gun
unearthed<00:02:05.429> as<00:02:05.700> he<00:02:05.820> just<00:02:06.060> ripped<00:02:06.149> through

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
unearthed as he just ripped through

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.900 
unearthed as he just ripped through
bullets<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.350> like<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:08.190> know<00:02:08.220> just<00:02:08.550> totally

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
bullets and like you know just totally

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.630 
bullets and like you know just totally
empties<00:02:09.330> them<00:02:09.479> all<00:02:09.600> out<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.520> obviously<00:02:11.520> I

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
empties them all out and obviously I

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.010 
empties them all out and obviously I
wanted<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:11.970> put<00:02:12.060> scavenger<00:02:12.540> on<00:02:12.600> instead<00:02:12.960> of

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
wanted to put scavenger on instead of

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.630 
wanted to put scavenger on instead of
sleight<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.320> hand<00:02:13.560> which<00:02:13.740> for<00:02:13.980> me<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.310> another

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
sleight of hand which for me is another

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.040 
sleight of hand which for me is another
little<00:02:14.790> bit<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.120> disadvantage<00:02:15.420> because

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
little bit of a disadvantage because

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.510 
little bit of a disadvantage because
sleight<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.680> hand<00:02:16.950> gives<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.430> little

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
sleight of hand gives you that a little

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.980 
sleight of hand gives you that a little
bit<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.760> an<00:02:17.880> edge<00:02:18.030> when<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.300> have<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.630> speed<00:02:18.960> up

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
bit of an edge when you have to speed up

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.110 
bit of an edge when you have to speed up
for<00:02:19.319> aiming<00:02:19.860> down<00:02:20.010> site<00:02:20.400> which<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:20.700> one<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:21.060> my
