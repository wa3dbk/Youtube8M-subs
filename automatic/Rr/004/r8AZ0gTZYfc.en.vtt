00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
positions especially because we went in

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.350 
positions especially because we went in
at<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.409> market<00:01:04.830> position<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.489> then<00:01:06.150> when<00:01:06.330> we

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
at a market position and then when we

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.600 
at a market position and then when we
closed<00:01:06.720> out<00:01:06.960> we<00:01:07.740> were<00:01:07.799> able<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.040> salvage<00:01:08.250> some

of<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.850> but<00:01:09.150> for<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.420> most<00:01:09.570> part<00:01:09.689> not<00:01:10.680> as

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
of that but for the most part not as

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.289 
of that but for the most part not as
good<00:01:11.010> as<00:01:11.100> we<00:01:11.220> could<00:01:11.369> have<00:01:11.430> done<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.240> course

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
good as we could have done and of course

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.789 
good as we could have done and of course
a<00:01:12.510> reminder<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.080> every<00:01:13.290> one<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.740> these

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
a reminder that every one of these

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.890 
a reminder that every one of these
positions<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.340> open<00:01:14.670> had<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.090> not<00:01:15.270> opened<00:01:15.780> with

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
positions we open had we not opened with

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.240 
positions we open had we not opened with
a<00:01:15.930> market<00:01:16.320> position<00:01:16.740> we<00:01:16.890> would<00:01:17.040> have<00:01:17.130> opened

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
a market position we would have opened

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.800 
a market position we would have opened
with<00:01:17.490> with<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> limit<00:01:18.240> where<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:18.479> could<00:01:18.630> shave

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
with with a limit where we could shave

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.899 
with with a limit where we could shave
the<00:01:19.020> pricing<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:20.009> highly<00:01:20.369> recommended<00:01:20.400> to

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
the pricing it's highly recommended to

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.160 
the pricing it's highly recommended to
do<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.270> because<00:01:21.420> every<00:01:21.840> one<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.080> these

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
do that because every one of these

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.510 
do that because every one of these
trades<00:01:22.470> would<00:01:22.650> have<00:01:22.740> performed<00:01:22.890> better<00:01:23.220> had

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
trades would have performed better had

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.149 
trades would have performed better had
we<00:01:23.549> done<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:24.290> now<00:01:25.290> at<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.530> same<00:01:25.740> time<00:01:25.950> we

either three of them are entirely are

either three of them are entirely are
entirely<00:01:35.100> positive<00:01:35.430> for<00:01:35.820> us<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.180> one<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.360> them

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
is entirely negative so in that case you

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.580 
is entirely negative so in that case you
know<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.240> can<00:01:39.390> either<00:01:39.479> let<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.869> positions

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
know we can either let the positions

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.069 
know we can either let the positions
expire<00:01:41.009> or<00:01:41.280> we<00:01:41.400> can<00:01:41.579> let<00:01:41.610> them<00:01:41.939> get<00:01:42.780> assigned

expire or we can let them get assigned
and<00:01:43.350> cancel<00:01:43.740> out<00:01:43.860> but<00:01:44.070> either<00:01:44.159> way<00:01:44.399> we

and cancel out but either way we

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.249 
and cancel out but either way we
consider<00:01:44.880> those<00:01:45.030> trades<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.540> all<00:01:45.659> expire<00:01:46.049> and

consider those trades to all expire and

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.749 
consider those trades to all expire and
we<00:01:46.649> will<00:01:46.799> keep<00:01:46.950> an<00:01:47.100> eye<00:01:47.159> on<00:01:47.189> those<00:01:47.399> through<00:01:47.729> the

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
mentioned over and over again that's not

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.730 
mentioned over and over again that's not
really<00:02:26.210> a<00:02:26.240> great<00:02:26.480> way<00:02:26.630> to<00:02:26.690> measure<00:02:26.990> where<00:02:27.590> you

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
really a great way to measure where you

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.500 
really a great way to measure where you
are<00:02:27.860> standing<00:02:28.070> in<00:02:28.250> an<00:02:28.370> options<00:02:28.760> portfolio<00:02:29.300> so

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
are standing in an options portfolio so

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.390 
are standing in an options portfolio so
we<00:02:29.660> use<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.960> market<00:02:30.290> open<00:02:30.560> position<00:02:30.980> so

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
we use the market open position so

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.500 
we use the market open position so
that's<00:02:31.520> where<00:02:31.640> we<00:02:31.730> take<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.000> cash<00:02:32.180> where<00:02:32.420> we

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
that's where we take the cash where we

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:33.850 
that's where we take the cash where we
are<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:33.080> we<00:02:33.230> take<00:02:33.440> any<00:02:33.620> of<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.740> positions

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
are and we take any of the positions

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.380 
are and we take any of the positions
we're<00:02:34.190> currently<00:02:34.340> open<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:34.910> compare<00:02:35.180> them<00:02:35.360> to

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
we're currently open and compare them to

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.960 
we're currently open and compare them to
how<00:02:35.600> what<00:02:35.810> we<00:02:35.930> would<00:02:36.110> have<00:02:36.200> gotten<00:02:36.440> had<00:02:37.010> we<00:02:37.220> had

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
how what we would have gotten had we had

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.820 
how what we would have gotten had we had
to<00:02:38.090> open<00:02:38.120> them<00:02:38.450> again<00:02:38.540> today<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.230> in<00:02:39.740> that

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
to open them again today and in that

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.710 
to open them again today and in that
case<00:02:40.040> we<00:02:40.100> are<00:02:40.340> up<00:02:40.490> two<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.270> a<00:02:41.360> half<00:02:41.510> percent

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
case we are up two and a half percent

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.080 
case we are up two and a half percent
this<00:02:42.500> significant<00:02:43.190> drop<00:02:43.400> from<00:02:43.610> last<00:02:43.850> week

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
this significant drop from last week

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.970 
this significant drop from last week
unfortunately<00:02:44.270> a<00:02:44.840> lot<00:02:45.200> of<00:02:45.500> that<00:02:45.590> has<00:02:45.740> to<00:02:45.770> do

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
unfortunately a lot of that has to do

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.410 
unfortunately a lot of that has to do
with<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.280> liquidity<00:02:46.580> hits<00:02:46.940> we<00:02:47.090> took<00:02:47.240> on

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
with the liquidity hits we took on

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.420 
with the liquidity hits we took on
closing<00:02:47.900> out<00:02:48.020> the<00:02:48.110> positions<00:02:48.530> as<00:02:48.680> well<00:02:49.250> as

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
closing out the positions as well as

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.280 
closing out the positions as well as
many<00:02:49.850> of<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.150> positions<00:02:50.570> we<00:02:50.660> were<00:02:50.750> in<00:02:50.930> kind<00:02:51.200> of

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
many of the positions we were in kind of

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.530 
many of the positions we were in kind of
just<00:02:51.440> operating<00:02:51.950> against<00:02:52.370> us<00:02:52.520> but<00:02:53.120> that's<00:02:53.360> the

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
just operating against us but that's the

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.150 
just operating against us but that's the
nature<00:02:53.570> of<00:02:53.870> investing<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:54.650> that's<00:02:54.890> what

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
nature of investing and that's what

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.850 
nature of investing and that's what
we're<00:02:55.310> here<00:02:55.430> for<00:02:55.490> so<00:02:56.330> we<00:02:56.870> are<00:02:57.050> slightly<00:02:57.710> ahead

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
we're here for so we are slightly ahead

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:58.960 
we're here for so we are slightly ahead

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
of the market which is something to be

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.520 
of the market which is something to be
happy<00:02:59.000> about<00:02:59.270> and<00:02:59.690> we'll<00:03:00.170> see<00:03:00.290> where<00:03:00.440> things

dealing with the liquidity here doesn't

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.159 
dealing with the liquidity here doesn't
seem<00:04:19.160> to<00:04:19.280> be<00:04:19.400> great<00:04:19.700> from<00:04:20.480> what<00:04:20.660> we<00:04:20.750> checked<00:04:20.989> on

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
seem to be great from what we checked on

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.560 
seem to be great from what we checked on
and<00:04:21.440> so<00:04:21.620> kind<00:04:22.490> of<00:04:22.610> we've<00:04:22.729> got<00:04:22.850> some<00:04:23.000> big<00:04:23.180> ranges

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
and so kind of we've got some big ranges

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.480 
and so kind of we've got some big ranges
to<00:04:23.690> work<00:04:23.840> with<00:04:24.050> and<00:04:24.320> as<00:04:24.740> a<00:04:24.770> result<00:04:25.040> I<00:04:25.310> think

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
to work with and as a result I think

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.650 
to work with and as a result I think
we'll<00:04:25.610> probably<00:04:25.790> want<00:04:26.120> to<00:04:26.240> stick

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
we'll probably want to stick

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.050 
we'll probably want to stick
with<00:04:27.020> some<00:04:27.530> single<00:04:27.920> leg<00:04:28.040> options<00:04:28.520> probably

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
with some single leg options probably

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.540 
with some single leg options probably
just<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.330> long<00:04:29.570> calls<00:04:29.840> in<00:04:30.020> these<00:04:30.170> case<00:04:30.550> and

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
just the long calls in these case and

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.730 
just the long calls in these case and
then<00:04:31.730> we<00:04:31.880> will<00:04:32.030> give<00:04:32.510> ourselves<00:04:32.660> will<00:04:33.560> knock

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
then we will give ourselves will knock

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.050 
then we will give ourselves will knock
out<00:04:33.920> the<00:04:34.070> budget<00:04:34.400> and<00:04:34.430> just<00:04:34.700> see<00:04:34.850> what<00:04:35.030> our

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
out the budget and just see what our

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.150 
out the budget and just see what our
minimum<00:04:35.390> position<00:04:36.230> is<00:04:36.590> that<00:04:36.710> we<00:04:36.830> can<00:04:36.980> enter

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
minimum position is that we can enter

again<00:06:20.600> here<00:06:20.840> we'll<00:06:21.110> move<00:06:21.260> ourselves<00:06:21.410> down<00:06:21.860> to

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.100 
again here we'll move ourselves down to

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.070 
again here we'll move ourselves down to
have<00:06:22.280> a<00:06:22.310> moderately<00:06:22.910> bearish<00:06:23.360> view<00:06:23.630> on<00:06:23.810> the

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
have a moderately bearish view on the

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.530 
have a moderately bearish view on the
stock<00:06:24.320> over<00:06:24.620> that<00:06:24.770> time<00:06:24.980> frame<00:06:25.010> and<00:06:25.430> we<00:06:26.390> can

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:26.540 
stock over that time frame and we can

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.420 
stock over that time frame and we can
see<00:06:26.660> there's<00:06:26.870> a<00:06:26.930> probably<00:06:27.919> going<00:06:28.040> to<00:06:28.100> go<00:06:28.190> long

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 
see there's a probably going to go long

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.890 
see there's a probably going to go long
put<00:06:28.820> just<00:06:29.180> because<00:06:29.419> we're<00:06:29.570> keeping<00:06:29.660> that

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
put just because we're keeping that

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.570 
put just because we're keeping that
single<00:06:30.260> leg<00:06:30.290> in<00:06:30.530> place<00:06:30.710> so<00:06:30.919> we<00:06:31.010> don't<00:06:31.160> get<00:06:31.280> to

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
single leg in place so we don't get to

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.450 
single leg in place so we don't get to
to<00:06:32.510> hurt<00:06:32.720> on<00:06:32.900> the<00:06:33.080> liquidity<00:06:33.770> when<00:06:34.190> we<00:06:34.340> go<00:06:34.430> to

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
to hurt on the liquidity when we go to

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.100 
to hurt on the liquidity when we go to
close<00:06:34.729> out<00:06:34.910> these<00:06:35.060> positions<00:06:35.450> next<00:06:35.630> week<00:06:35.900> and

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
close out these positions next week and

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.610 
close out these positions next week and
so<00:06:36.979> we've<00:06:37.310> got<00:06:37.460> to<00:06:37.550> put<00:06:37.760> that's<00:06:38.000> right<00:06:38.620> right

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
so we've got to put that's right right

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.450 
so we've got to put that's right right
in<00:06:39.740> the<00:06:39.800> money

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
in the money

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.770 
in the money
it's<00:06:40.639> probably<00:06:40.880> the<00:06:40.970> best<00:06:41.030> trade<00:06:41.389> we<00:06:41.509> can<00:06:41.660> make

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:41.780 
it's probably the best trade we can make

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.260 
it's probably the best trade we can make
at<00:06:41.900> this<00:06:41.990> point<00:06:42.350> so<00:06:42.650> let's<00:06:42.800> go<00:06:42.919> ahead<00:06:42.949> and

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
at this point so let's go ahead and

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.430 
at this point so let's go ahead and
choose<00:06:44.270> to<00:06:44.419> analyze<00:06:44.750> that<00:06:44.960> we<00:06:45.169> could<00:06:45.289> take<00:06:45.410> a

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 
choose to analyze that we could take a

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.439 
choose to analyze that we could take a
look<00:06:45.620> the<00:06:45.740> break-even<00:06:45.949> here<00:06:46.430> is<00:06:46.520> $21<00:06:47.180> so

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:47.449 
look the break-even here is $21 so

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:48.999 
look the break-even here is $21 so
that's<00:06:47.600> not<00:06:47.780> too<00:06:48.050> much<00:06:48.080> movement<00:06:48.440> downward

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:49.009 
that's not too much movement downward

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:51.400 
that's not too much movement downward
it's<00:06:49.340> a<00:06:49.430> little<00:06:50.270> over<00:06:50.509> half<00:06:50.690> percent<00:06:51.199> or<00:06:51.349> a

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:51.410 
it's a little over half percent or a

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.480 
it's a little over half percent or a
little<00:06:51.740> over<00:06:52.780> five<00:06:53.780> percent<00:06:54.169> downward<00:06:54.530> and<00:06:54.680> so

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
little over five percent downward and so

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.820 
little over five percent downward and so
you<00:06:56.240> know<00:06:56.360> I<00:06:56.599> think<00:06:56.960> we're<00:06:57.199> going<00:06:57.319> to<00:06:57.380> kind<00:06:57.740> of

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:57.830 
you know I think we're going to kind of

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.370 
you know I think we're going to kind of
make<00:06:57.979> the<00:06:58.069> best<00:06:58.220> we<00:06:58.400> can<00:06:58.550> out<00:06:58.819> of<00:06:58.849> this<00:06:59.060> and

00:06:59.370 --> 00:06:59.380 
make the best we can out of this and

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:04.020 
make the best we can out of this and
let's<00:07:00.380> let's<00:07:00.860> go<00:07:00.889> ahead<00:07:00.979> and<00:07:01.069> lace<00:07:01.220> the<00:07:01.340> trade
