00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
all of these meteorites and I guess

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.019 
all of these meteorites and I guess
various<00:00:22.680> planets<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.430> are<00:00:23.490> kind<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.850> being

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
sucked into its gravitational pull so

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.769 
sucked into its gravitational pull so
I'm<00:00:26.699> assuming<00:00:26.880> you're<00:00:27.269> throwing<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:27.720> little

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
I'm assuming you're throwing this little

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.019 
I'm assuming you're throwing this little
rock<00:00:28.289> because<00:00:28.590> that's<00:00:28.890> what<00:00:29.250> I've<00:00:29.550> decided

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
rock because that's what I've decided

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.450 
rock because that's what I've decided
that<00:00:30.390> you're<00:00:30.929> throwing<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.890> that's<00:00:32.399> how

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
that you're throwing and that's how

that you're throwing and that's how
you're<00:00:32.610> going<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.790> start<00:00:32.940> taking<00:00:33.090> out<00:00:33.360> all

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
you're going to start taking out all

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.380 
you're going to start taking out all
these<00:00:33.750> meteorites<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.120> plan<00:00:36.120> into

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
these meteorites and and plan into

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.760 
these meteorites and and plan into
things<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.719> can<00:00:36.840> see<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> planet<00:00:37.410> coming<00:00:37.680> in

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
things you can see a planet coming in

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.260 
things you can see a planet coming in
there<00:00:37.890> from<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.129> left<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:38.910> tossed<00:00:39.149> my

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
there from the left so I tossed my

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.880 
there from the left so I tossed my
little<00:00:39.540> rock<00:00:39.690> at<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.350> course<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.739> kind

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
little rock at it and of course it kind

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.650 
little rock at it and of course it kind
of<00:00:40.950> creates<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.309> weird<00:00:41.579> supernova<00:00:42.420> and

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
of creates this weird supernova and

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.270 
of creates this weird supernova and
starts<00:00:43.110> attracting<00:00:43.620> all<00:00:43.739> these<00:00:43.890> other<00:00:44.070> dudes

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
starts attracting all these other dudes

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.650 
starts attracting all these other dudes
now<00:00:44.760> you'll<00:00:44.940> notice<00:00:45.059> here<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.480> keep

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
now you'll notice here that I keep

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.150 
now you'll notice here that I keep
shooting<00:00:45.989> out<00:00:46.079> these<00:00:46.200> little<00:00:46.320> rockets<00:00:46.980> and

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
shooting out these little rockets and

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.799 
shooting out these little rockets and
that<00:00:47.250> actually<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.730> due<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.149> power<00:00:48.420> up<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:48.780> I

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
that actually is due to power up so I

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.959 
that actually is due to power up so I
can<00:00:48.989> start<00:00:49.170> getting<00:00:49.200> enough<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.879> know

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
can start getting enough and you know

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.400 
can start getting enough and you know
you<00:00:51.059> take<00:00:51.180> out<00:00:51.360> enough<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.719> these<00:00:51.780> things<00:00:52.050> then

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
you take out enough of these things then

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.959 
you take out enough of these things then
you'll<00:00:52.949> start<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.160> get<00:00:53.309> these<00:00:53.430> power-ups<00:00:53.730> such

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
you'll start to get these power-ups such

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.400 
you'll start to get these power-ups such
as<00:00:54.239> like<00:00:54.390> these<00:00:54.539> little<00:00:54.660> rockets<00:00:55.199> let<00:00:55.320> you

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
as like these little rockets let you

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.619 
as like these little rockets let you
shoot<00:00:55.649> out<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.219> another<00:00:56.640> cool<00:00:56.940> thing<00:00:56.969> such<00:00:57.449> as

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
shoot out and another cool thing such as

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.479 
shoot out and another cool thing such as
this<00:00:57.750> shield<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.559> ends<00:00:58.829> up<00:00:58.890> going<00:00:59.070> up<00:00:59.280> around

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
this shield that ends up going up around

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.860 
this shield that ends up going up around
your<00:00:59.609> plan<00:00:59.850> just<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.149> case<00:01:00.239> things<00:01:00.539> start

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
your plan just in case things start

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.540 
your plan just in case things start
getting<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.230> little<00:01:01.410> bit<00:01:01.770> too<00:01:01.920> close<00:01:02.219> for<00:01:02.460> your

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
getting a little bit too close for your

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.210 
getting a little bit too close for your
liking<00:01:02.969> now<00:01:03.870> you'll<00:01:04.229> also<00:01:04.470> notice<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:04.979> when

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
liking now you'll also notice that when

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.500 
liking now you'll also notice that when
I<00:01:05.250> start<00:01:05.489> taking<00:01:05.820> these<00:01:05.909> things<00:01:06.180> out<00:01:06.330> at<00:01:06.420> least

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
I start taking these things out at least

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.910 
I start taking these things out at least
the<00:01:06.689> bigger<00:01:06.869> ones<00:01:07.110> for<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.380> matter<00:01:07.650> which

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
the bigger ones for that matter which

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.980 
the bigger ones for that matter which
I'll<00:01:08.070> do<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.700> there<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.119> go<00:01:09.210> if<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.780> can

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
I'll do in just there you go if you can

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.390 
I'll do in just there you go if you can
take<00:01:10.140> out<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> large<00:01:10.470> cluster<00:01:10.979> then<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.159> start

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
take out a large cluster then you start

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.859 
take out a large cluster then you start
getting<00:01:11.909> these<00:01:12.000> diamonds<00:01:12.420> up<00:01:12.720> these<00:01:12.810> things

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
getting these diamonds up these things

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.539 
getting these diamonds up these things
drop<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.619> you're<00:01:13.890> going<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.100> want<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.310> collect

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
drop and you're going to want to collect

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.249 
drop and you're going to want to collect
as<00:01:14.760> many<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.150> these<00:01:15.270> diamonds<00:01:15.600> as<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.990> can

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
as many of these diamonds as you can

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.080 
as many of these diamonds as you can
because<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.740> more<00:01:17.009> diamonds<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.490> collect<00:01:17.939> in

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
because the more diamonds you collect in

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.390 
because the more diamonds you collect in
between<00:01:18.479> levels<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.409> can<00:01:19.590> actually<00:01:19.799> orb

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
between levels you can actually orb

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.490 
between levels you can actually orb
levels<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.030> guess<00:01:21.240> each<00:01:21.509> we're<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:22.170> level

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
levels I guess each we're on like level

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.800 
levels I guess each we're on like level
one<00:01:22.680> or<00:01:22.860> two<00:01:22.979> right<00:01:23.100> now<00:01:23.250> but<00:01:23.490> um<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:24.390> between

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
one or two right now but um in between

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.539 
one or two right now but um in between
games<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.500> can<00:01:25.650> actually<00:01:25.799> start<00:01:26.130> purchasing

just<00:01:36.329> because<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.689> are<00:01:36.810> kind<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.110> spinning

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
just because you are kind of spinning

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.960 
just because you are kind of spinning
around<00:01:37.590> spinning<00:01:38.310> around<00:01:38.400> now<00:01:38.670> I've<00:01:38.790> actually

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
around spinning around now I've actually

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.760 
around spinning around now I've actually
made<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.360> up<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.570> level<00:01:39.720> 14<00:01:40.320> believe<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.619> or<00:01:40.710> not

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
made it up to level 14 believe it or not

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.069 
made it up to level 14 believe it or not
and<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.070> was<00:01:41.250> not<00:01:41.520> as<00:01:41.700> easy<00:01:42.060> as<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.299> think<00:01:42.750> as

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
and that was not as easy as it think as

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.350 
and that was not as easy as it think as
it<00:01:43.470> seems<00:01:43.939> things<00:01:44.939> start<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.180> get<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.329> little

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
it seems things start to get a little

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.969 
it seems things start to get a little
bit<00:01:45.570> crazier<00:01:46.020> as<00:01:46.079> time<00:01:46.290> goes<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.710> these

bit crazier as time goes on these

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.560 
bit crazier as time goes on these
planets<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.579> meteorites<00:01:47.970> start<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.329> come<00:01:48.450> at

helicopter here now there's a couple of

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.440 
helicopter here now there's a couple of
different<00:03:00.129> control<00:03:00.459> schemes<00:03:00.489> this<00:03:01.299> is

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
different control schemes this is

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.660 
different control schemes this is
actually<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:02.280> joystick<00:03:03.280> so<00:03:03.370> we're<00:03:03.489> going<00:03:03.610> to

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
actually the joystick so we're going to

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.920 
actually the joystick so we're going to
go<00:03:03.730> ahead<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:03.910> actually<00:03:04.060> switch<00:03:04.599> that<00:03:04.870> up

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
go ahead and actually switch that up

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.360 
go ahead and actually switch that up
you've<00:03:05.500> got<00:03:05.620> some<00:03:05.769> different<00:03:06.040> control

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
you've got some different control

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.000 
you've got some different control
schemes<00:03:06.720> I'm<00:03:07.720> going<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:07.959> go<00:03:08.049> ahead<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:08.319> use

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
schemes I'm going to go ahead and use

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.390 
schemes I'm going to go ahead and use

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
and bumping it into things which will

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:29.759 
and bumping it into things which will
happen<00:03:29.019> but<00:03:29.109> you<00:03:29.200> don't<00:03:29.349> want<00:03:29.470> it<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:29.650> happen

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
too much otherwise you'll have to start

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.960 
too much otherwise you'll have to start
over<00:03:32.709> so<00:03:33.280> as<00:03:33.370> you<00:03:33.459> can<00:03:33.519> see<00:03:33.639> as<00:03:33.730> you<00:03:33.819> start

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
over so as you can see as you start

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.190 
over so as you can see as you start

aren't red so you got this little
grappling<00:03:38.590> hook<00:03:38.799> that<00:03:38.950> drops<00:03:39.190> out<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:39.579> we<00:03:39.849> go

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970
