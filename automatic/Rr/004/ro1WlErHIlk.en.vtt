in<00:00:00.719> a<00:00:00.900> previous<00:00:01.410> video<00:00:01.620> we<00:00:01.920> took<00:00:02.070> a<00:00:02.129> look<00:00:02.220> at

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
in a previous video we took a look at

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.820 
in a previous video we took a look at
the<00:00:02.580> dopamine<00:00:03.000> pathway<00:00:03.449> and<00:00:03.720> a<00:00:04.529> whole<00:00:04.650> bunch

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
the dopamine pathway and a whole bunch

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.650 
the dopamine pathway and a whole bunch
of<00:00:04.920> molecules<00:00:05.430> that<00:00:05.549> are<00:00:05.640> involved<00:00:05.940> in<00:00:06.299> the

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
of molecules that are involved in the

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.049 
of molecules that are involved in the
dopamine<00:00:07.049> pathway<00:00:07.760> remember<00:00:08.760> that<00:00:08.910> this

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
dopamine pathway remember that this

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.640 
dopamine pathway remember that this
pathway<00:00:09.300> is<00:00:09.540> one<00:00:09.780> of<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:09.960> major<00:00:10.110> ones<00:00:10.410> that's

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
pathway is one of the major ones that's

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.950 
pathway is one of the major ones that's
really<00:00:10.740> affected<00:00:11.550> when<00:00:12.300> someone<00:00:12.690> smokes

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
really affected when someone smokes

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.600 
really affected when someone smokes
cigarettes<00:00:13.410> on<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.559> regular<00:00:13.950> basis<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.549> so

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
cigarettes on a regular basis and so

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.490 
cigarettes on a regular basis and so
basically<00:00:15.059> what<00:00:15.269> this<00:00:15.450> picture<00:00:15.630> shows<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:16.289> is

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
basically what this picture shows you is

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.320 
basically what this picture shows you is
a<00:00:16.529> summary<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.190> all<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.520> molecules<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.150> we

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
a summary of all the molecules that we

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.210 
a summary of all the molecules that we
talked<00:00:18.570> about<00:00:18.720> that<00:00:19.439> are<00:00:19.619> involved<00:00:20.010> in<00:00:20.100> the

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
talked about that are involved in the

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.000 
talked about that are involved in the
dopamine<00:00:20.640> pathway<00:00:21.439> all<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.680> these<00:00:22.800> molecules

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
dopamine pathway all of these molecules

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.950 
dopamine pathway all of these molecules
that<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.460> see<00:00:23.730> here<00:00:24.090> are<00:00:24.300> some<00:00:24.330> sort<00:00:24.869> of

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
that you see here are some sort of

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.589 
that you see here are some sort of
protein<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:26.580> remember<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.060> if<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.420> cell

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
protein and so remember that if the cell

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.480 
protein and so remember that if the cell
is<00:00:27.630> making<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.140> protein<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.800> kind<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.070> implies

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
is making a protein that kind of implies

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.420 
is making a protein that kind of implies
that<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.359> cell<00:00:30.570> has<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.810> gene<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.949> tells<00:00:31.980> it

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
that the cell has a gene that tells it

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.459 
that the cell has a gene that tells it
how<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.850> make<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.270> particular<00:00:33.570> protein<00:00:33.989> and

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
how to make that particular protein and

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.319 
how to make that particular protein and
so<00:00:35.280> what<00:00:35.460> we're<00:00:35.550> gonna<00:00:35.610> do<00:00:35.820> here<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.090> take<00:00:36.300> a

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
so what we're gonna do here is take a

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.869 
so what we're gonna do here is take a
look<00:00:36.570> at<00:00:36.690> those<00:00:36.809> genes<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.610> kind<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.700> talk

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
look at those genes and kind of talk

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.760 
look at those genes and kind of talk
about<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.390> considerations<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.290> someone

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
about the considerations that someone

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.709 
about the considerations that someone
makes<00:00:41.070> when<00:00:42.059> they're<00:00:42.300> trying<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.570> decide

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
makes when they're trying to decide

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.540 
makes when they're trying to decide
which<00:00:43.110> one<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.469> those<00:00:43.559> genes<00:00:43.860> has<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.370> most

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
which one of those genes has the most

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.720 
which one of those genes has the most
potential<00:00:45.120> as<00:00:45.510> far<00:00:46.410> as<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> gene<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.489> might

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
potential as far as a gene that might

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.060 
potential as far as a gene that might
play<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> role<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.600> determining<00:00:49.590> whether<00:00:49.770> one

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
play a role in determining whether one

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.889 
play a role in determining whether one
person<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.579> more<00:00:50.760> susceptible<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.420> smoking

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
person is more susceptible to smoking

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.160 
person is more susceptible to smoking
addiction<00:00:52.020> versus<00:00:52.680> another<00:00:52.980> person<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:54.170> so

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
addiction versus another person and so

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.720 
addiction versus another person and so
since<00:00:55.410> we<00:00:55.559> are<00:00:55.739> talking<00:00:55.890> about<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.489> genes

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
since we are talking about the genes

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.610 
since we are talking about the genes
that<00:00:56.850> encode<00:00:56.940> for<00:00:57.539> these<00:00:57.719> proteins<00:00:58.230> how<00:00:58.469> about

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
that encode for these proteins how about

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.729 
that encode for these proteins how about
if<00:00:58.739> we<00:00:58.859> take<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.070> look<00:00:59.399> at<00:00:59.840> the<00:01:00.840> nucleus<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.500> a

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
if we take a look at the nucleus of a

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.009 
if we take a look at the nucleus of a
human<00:01:02.070> nerve<00:01:02.250> cell<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:03.000> because<00:01:03.359> that's<00:01:03.629> this

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
human nerve cell so because that's this

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.539 
human nerve cell so because that's this
is<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.229> human<00:01:04.619> cell<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.010> because<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.460> a

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
is a human cell and because it's a

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.480 
is a human cell and because it's a
somatic<00:01:05.850> cell<00:01:06.049> you<00:01:07.049> would<00:01:07.140> expect<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.590> find<00:01:07.680> 46

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
somatic cell you would expect to find 46

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.469 
somatic cell you would expect to find 46
chromosomes<00:01:08.960> within<00:01:09.960> its<00:01:10.140> nucleus<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:12.210> genes

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
chromosomes within its nucleus the genes

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.910 
chromosomes within its nucleus the genes
that<00:01:12.540> encode<00:01:12.750> for<00:01:12.960> all<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.320> these<00:01:13.439> molecules

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
that encode for all of these molecules

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.899 
that encode for all of these molecules
that<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.159> see<00:01:14.340> here<00:01:14.610> are<00:01:14.729> basically

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
that you see here are basically

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.300 
that you see here are basically
scattered<00:01:15.689> throughout<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.320> chromosomes<00:01:17.100> and

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
scattered throughout the chromosomes and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.010 
scattered throughout the chromosomes and
so<00:01:17.520> we'll<00:01:17.729> use<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:18.030> differently<00:01:18.689> colored

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
so we'll use a differently colored

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.410 
so we'll use a differently colored
stripe<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.890> represent<00:01:20.490> each<00:01:20.880> one<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.330> those

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
stripe to represent each one of those

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.999 
stripe to represent each one of those
genes<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.960> encodes<00:01:22.380> for<00:01:22.619> those<00:01:22.740> molecules

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
genes that encodes for those molecules

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.600 
genes that encodes for those molecules
involved<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.820> dopamine<00:01:24.180> pathway

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
involved in the dopamine pathway

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.649 
involved in the dopamine pathway
remember<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.759> we<00:01:26.850> should<00:01:27.030> have<00:01:27.210> two<00:01:27.450> copies

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
remember that we should have two copies

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.510 
remember that we should have two copies
of<00:01:27.869> each<00:01:28.170> one<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.380> those<00:01:28.500> genes<00:01:28.860> because<00:01:29.280> we

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
of each one of those genes because we

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.910 
of each one of those genes because we
have<00:01:29.700> two<00:01:29.939> parents<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.600> inherit<00:01:31.020> one<00:01:31.259> copy

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
have two parents and we inherit one copy

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.600 
have two parents and we inherit one copy
of<00:01:32.070> each<00:01:32.250> gene<00:01:32.610> from<00:01:32.820> each<00:01:32.970> parent<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:34.610> so

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
of each gene from each parent and so

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.130 
of each gene from each parent and so
again<00:01:35.970> say<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.390> you're<00:01:36.570> someone<00:01:36.930> who's

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
again say that you're someone who's

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.929 
again say that you're someone who's
trying<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.470> figure<00:01:37.799> out<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.579> know<00:01:38.700> what

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
trying to figure out you know what

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.090 
trying to figure out you know what
causes<00:01:39.150> one<00:01:39.509> person<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.140> be<00:01:40.320> more<00:01:40.770> susceptible

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
causes one person to be more susceptible

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.039 
causes one person to be more susceptible
to<00:01:41.430> smoking<00:01:42.030> addiction<00:01:42.150> versus<00:01:42.810> another

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
to smoking addiction versus another

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.889 
to smoking addiction versus another
person<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.680> you're<00:01:44.780> additionally<00:01:45.780> you're

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
person and you're additionally you're

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.060 
person and you're additionally you're
trying<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.140> figure<00:01:46.409> out<00:01:46.530> which<00:01:46.680> one<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:46.920> these

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
trying to figure out which one of these

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.480 
trying to figure out which one of these
genes<00:01:47.450> has<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.200> best<00:01:49.409> potential<00:01:49.979> as<00:01:50.159> far

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
genes has the the best potential as far

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.399 
genes has the the best potential as far
as<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> gene<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.149> plays<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> role<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.380> that

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
as a gene that plays a role in that

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.399 
as a gene that plays a role in that
regard<00:01:53.450> so<00:01:54.450> what<00:01:54.720> we're<00:01:54.810> gonna<00:01:54.869> do<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.200> kind<00:01:55.290> of

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
regard so what we're gonna do is kind of

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.830 
regard so what we're gonna do is kind of
list<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.770> criteria<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:57.060> would<00:01:57.960> make<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.500> gene

list the criteria that would make a gene
potentially<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.899> good<00:02:01.049> one<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.290> study<00:02:01.439> for<00:02:01.950> this

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
potentially a good one to study for this

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.190 
potentially a good one to study for this
particular<00:02:02.520> purpose<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.149> actually<00:02:04.079> what

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
particular purpose and actually what

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.109 
particular purpose and actually what
we're<00:02:04.320> gonna<00:02:04.409> do<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.829> narrow<00:02:05.219> our<00:02:05.490> focus<00:02:05.520> so

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
we're gonna do is narrow our focus so

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.180 
we're gonna do is narrow our focus so
not<00:02:06.299> only<00:02:06.450> are<00:02:06.719> going<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.960> talk<00:02:07.079> about<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
not only are going to talk about the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.249 
not only are going to talk about the
criteria<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.879> would<00:02:09.119> make<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.539> particular

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259

gene<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:11.660> possibly<00:02:12.660> good<00:02:12.900> one<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.200> study<00:02:13.349> for

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
gene a possibly good one to study for

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.890 
gene a possibly good one to study for
this

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
this

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.110 
this
purpose<00:02:14.140> but<00:02:14.920> we're<00:02:15.430> gonna<00:02:15.549> try<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.790> figure

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
purpose but we're gonna try to figure

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.649 
purpose but we're gonna try to figure
out<00:02:16.920> what<00:02:17.920> criteria<00:02:18.519> would<00:02:18.700> make<00:02:18.909> a<00:02:18.939> specific

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
out what criteria would make a specific

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.890 
out what criteria would make a specific
region<00:02:19.989> of<00:02:20.379> a<00:02:20.860> gene<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:21.400> good<00:02:22.090> one<00:02:22.239> to<00:02:22.420> study<00:02:22.629> for

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
region of a gene a good one to study for

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.479 
region of a gene a good one to study for
this<00:02:22.989> particular<00:02:23.260> purpose<00:02:23.680> all<00:02:24.250> right<00:02:24.340> so

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
this particular purpose all right so

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:25.679 
this particular purpose all right so
we're<00:02:24.610> gonna<00:02:24.670> narrow<00:02:25.000> our<00:02:25.120> focus<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.599> not

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:25.689 
we're gonna narrow our focus and not

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.720 
we're gonna narrow our focus and not
only<00:02:25.959> look<00:02:26.110> at<00:02:26.200> entire<00:02:26.500> genes<00:02:26.860> but<00:02:27.069> we're

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
only look at entire genes but we're

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.300 
only look at entire genes but we're
gonna<00:02:27.849> consider<00:02:28.269> specific<00:02:28.599> regions<00:02:29.439> of<00:02:29.650> each

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
gonna consider specific regions of each

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.869 
gonna consider specific regions of each
gene<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:31.000> so<00:02:31.920> what<00:02:32.920> we'll<00:02:33.040> do<00:02:33.189> here<00:02:33.489> is<00:02:33.549> list

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
gene and so what we'll do here is list

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.720 
gene and so what we'll do here is list
some<00:02:34.060> of<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.359> criteria<00:02:34.870> that<00:02:35.409> would<00:02:36.189> give<00:02:36.459> a

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
some of the criteria that would give a

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.979 
some of the criteria that would give a
gene<00:02:37.090> region<00:02:37.540> a<00:02:37.689> lot<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:38.049> potential<00:02:38.620> as<00:02:39.099> far<00:02:39.489> as

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
gene region a lot of potential as far as

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.630 
gene region a lot of potential as far as
possibly<00:02:40.989> influencing<00:02:41.769> smoking<00:02:42.250> behavior

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
possibly influencing smoking behavior

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.750 
possibly influencing smoking behavior
between<00:02:42.849> different<00:02:43.329> people<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:45.220> one<00:02:45.609> example

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
between different people so one example

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.599 
between different people so one example
of<00:02:46.120> a<00:02:46.389> gene<00:02:46.930> region<00:02:47.379> that<00:02:47.709> might<00:02:48.040> have<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:48.370> lot

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
of a gene region that might have a lot

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:51.300 
of a gene region that might have a lot
of<00:02:48.639> potential<00:02:49.090> in<00:02:49.420> this<00:02:49.599> regard<00:02:50.019> is<00:02:50.230> a<00:02:50.799> gene

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
of potential in this regard is a gene

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.910 
of potential in this regard is a gene
region<00:02:51.700> that<00:02:52.000> has<00:02:52.450> sufficient<00:02:53.409> differences

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
region that has sufficient differences

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.640 
region that has sufficient differences
between<00:02:54.220> different<00:02:54.639> people<00:02:55.120> and<00:02:55.420> so<00:02:56.409> here's

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
between different people and so here's

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.410 
between different people and so here's
the<00:02:56.829> idea<00:02:57.099> behind<00:02:57.310> that<00:02:57.579> say<00:02:58.000> that<00:02:58.180> you<00:02:58.269> have

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
the idea behind that say that you have

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.690 
the idea behind that say that you have
two<00:02:58.659> different<00:02:58.810> people<00:02:59.280> one<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.310> them<00:03:00.549> is

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
two different people one of them is

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.729 
two different people one of them is
addicted<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.180> smoking<00:03:01.439> whereas<00:03:02.439> the<00:03:02.620> other

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
addicted to smoking whereas the other

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.979 
addicted to smoking whereas the other
one<00:03:02.920> has<00:03:03.069> tried<00:03:03.340> smoking<00:03:03.819> but<00:03:04.000> has<00:03:04.599> not<00:03:04.810> become

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
one has tried smoking but has not become

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.470 
one has tried smoking but has not become
addicted<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.560> it<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:05.980> you're<00:03:06.939> trying<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.239> find

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
addicted to it and you're trying to find

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.220 
addicted to it and you're trying to find
out<00:03:07.720> hmm

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
out hmm

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.800 
out hmm
I<00:03:08.260> wonder<00:03:09.099> if<00:03:09.370> there's<00:03:09.609> a<00:03:09.700> particular<00:03:10.060> gene

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
I wonder if there's a particular gene

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.460 
I wonder if there's a particular gene
that<00:03:12.060> caused<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.480> one<00:03:13.629> person<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:14.170> be<00:03:14.319> more

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
that caused the one person to be more

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.410 
that caused the one person to be more
susceptible<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:15.099> addiction<00:03:15.310> as<00:03:15.939> compared<00:03:16.359> to

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
susceptible to addiction as compared to

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.319 
susceptible to addiction as compared to
the<00:03:16.569> other<00:03:16.689> person<00:03:17.109> and<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.970> say<00:03:19.150> for<00:03:19.180> example

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
the other person and so say for example

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.449 
the other person and so say for example
you<00:03:19.720> think<00:03:19.870> I<00:03:20.379> wonder<00:03:20.590> if<00:03:20.709> there's<00:03:20.859> a<00:03:20.949> specific

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
you think I wonder if there's a specific

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.659 
you think I wonder if there's a specific
region<00:03:21.639> within<00:03:22.030> this<00:03:22.299> th<00:03:22.720> gene<00:03:23.109> that<00:03:23.980> might<00:03:24.280> be

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:24.669 
region within this th gene that might be

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:26.339 
region within this th gene that might be
causing<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.269> difference<00:03:25.629> in<00:03:25.870> smoking

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
causing the difference in smoking

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.819 
causing the difference in smoking
behavior<00:03:26.799> between<00:03:27.010> these<00:03:27.400> two<00:03:27.609> people<00:03:28.030> and<00:03:28.829> a

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
behavior between these two people and a

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.800 
behavior between these two people and a
say<00:03:30.069> for<00:03:30.250> example<00:03:30.639> that<00:03:30.790> you<00:03:31.180> took<00:03:31.329> a<00:03:31.389> look<00:03:31.659> at

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
say for example that you took a look at

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.449 
say for example that you took a look at
that<00:03:31.959> particular<00:03:32.109> region<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:32.980> you<00:03:33.069> noticed

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
that particular region and you noticed

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.939 
that particular region and you noticed
that<00:03:33.730> is<00:03:33.879> completely<00:03:34.510> identical<00:03:35.049> between<00:03:35.590> the

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:35.949 
that is completely identical between the

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.640 
that is completely identical between the
two<00:03:36.359> well<00:03:37.359> if<00:03:37.480> that's<00:03:37.599> the<00:03:37.810> case<00:03:38.049> if<00:03:38.349> you<00:03:38.470> have

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
two well if that's the case if you have

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.439 
two well if that's the case if you have
a<00:03:38.680> gene<00:03:39.430> region<00:03:39.790> that's<00:03:39.940> completely

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:40.449 
a gene region that's completely

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:42.509 
a gene region that's completely
identical<00:03:40.840> between<00:03:41.139> the<00:03:41.680> smoker<00:03:41.949> and<00:03:42.370> the

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
identical between the smoker and the

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.550 
identical between the smoker and the
nonsmoker<00:03:43.000> then<00:03:43.479> basically<00:03:43.989> you<00:03:44.199> can<00:03:44.379> rule

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
nonsmoker then basically you can rule

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.849 
nonsmoker then basically you can rule
that<00:03:44.590> out<00:03:44.799> as<00:03:46.079> one<00:03:47.079> of<00:03:47.109> the<00:03:47.290> things<00:03:47.440> that<00:03:47.680> might

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
that out as one of the things that might

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.920 
that out as one of the things that might
cause<00:03:48.129> the<00:03:48.519> difference<00:03:48.879> in<00:03:49.060> smoking<00:03:49.479> behavior

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
cause the difference in smoking behavior

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.379 
cause the difference in smoking behavior
and<00:03:50.190> so<00:03:51.190> basically<00:03:51.639> that's<00:03:51.819> the<00:03:52.060> difference

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
and so basically that's the difference

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:54.089 
and so basically that's the difference
here<00:03:52.479> you<00:03:52.659> want<00:03:52.900> if<00:03:53.349> you're<00:03:53.560> trying<00:03:53.739> to<00:03:53.799> figure

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
here you want if you're trying to figure

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.069 
here you want if you're trying to figure
out<00:03:54.280> what<00:03:54.729> what<00:03:55.000> gene<00:03:55.239> region<00:03:55.599> has<00:03:55.720> a<00:03:55.750> lot<00:03:55.959> of

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
out what what gene region has a lot of

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.899 
out what what gene region has a lot of
potential<00:03:56.409> to<00:03:56.829> study<00:03:57.069> as<00:03:57.250> far<00:03:57.459> as<00:03:57.579> you<00:03:57.790> know

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
potential to study as far as you know

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.039 
potential to study as far as you know
something<00:03:58.419> that<00:03:58.449> might<00:03:58.659> cause<00:03:58.840> the

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
something that might cause the

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.960 
something that might cause the
difference<00:03:59.319> in<00:03:59.440> smoking<00:03:59.739> behavior<00:04:00.159> you<00:04:00.819> want

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
difference in smoking behavior you want

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.939 
difference in smoking behavior you want
to<00:04:01.120> make<00:04:01.239> sure<00:04:01.269> that<00:04:01.510> it<00:04:01.690> at<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.530> very<00:04:02.650> least

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:02.949 
to make sure that it at the very least

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:05.309 
to make sure that it at the very least
shows<00:04:03.519> some<00:04:03.909> difference<00:04:04.359> between<00:04:04.629> different

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
shows some difference between different

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.969 
shows some difference between different
people<00:04:06.810> there's<00:04:07.810> a<00:04:07.900> few<00:04:08.169> terms<00:04:08.470> that<00:04:08.739> are

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:08.979 
people there's a few terms that are

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:11.939 
people there's a few terms that are
associated<00:04:09.280> with<00:04:09.639> this<00:04:09.940> idea<00:04:10.419> of<00:04:10.949> different

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:11.949 
associated with this idea of different

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.839 
associated with this idea of different
gene<00:04:12.909> segments<00:04:13.449> between<00:04:13.629> different<00:04:14.199> people

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849

gene segments between different people
one<00:04:15.849> term<00:04:16.090> is<00:04:16.470> polymorphism<00:04:17.470> and<00:04:17.669> one<00:04:18.669> way<00:04:18.820> of

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
one term is polymorphism and one way of

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.810 
one term is polymorphism and one way of
defining<00:04:19.329> a<00:04:19.570> polymorphism<00:04:20.500> is<00:04:20.650> a<00:04:21.190> genetic

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
defining a polymorphism is a genetic

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.779 
defining a polymorphism is a genetic
variation<00:04:22.150> that<00:04:22.630> occurs<00:04:22.990> in<00:04:23.469> at<00:04:23.590> least<00:04:23.800> 1%<00:04:24.580> of

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
variation that occurs in at least 1% of

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.550 
variation that occurs in at least 1% of
the<00:04:25.180> population

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
the population

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.710 
the population
and<00:04:26.650> actually<00:04:27.520> for<00:04:27.910> our<00:04:28.030> study<00:04:28.270> we're<00:04:28.540> going

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
and actually for our study we're going

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.740 
and actually for our study we're going
to<00:04:28.870> choose<00:04:29.680> a<00:04:30.010> fairly<00:04:30.520> or<00:04:30.820> we're<00:04:31.389> gonna<00:04:31.480> want

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
to choose a fairly or we're gonna want

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.200 
to choose a fairly or we're gonna want
to<00:04:31.900> choose<00:04:32.139> a<00:04:32.470> gene<00:04:33.160> region<00:04:33.580> that<00:04:34.000> has<00:04:34.180> a

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
to choose a gene region that has a

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.530 
to choose a gene region that has a
fairly<00:04:34.720> common<00:04:35.370> polymorphism<00:04:36.540> somewhere

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
fairly common polymorphism somewhere

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.090 
fairly common polymorphism somewhere
around<00:04:37.630> 5%<00:04:38.880> polymorphism<00:04:39.880> and<00:04:40.380> so<00:04:41.380> the<00:04:41.740> reason

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
around 5% polymorphism and so the reason

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.390 
around 5% polymorphism and so the reason
why<00:04:42.310> we<00:04:42.760> want<00:04:42.970> to<00:04:43.030> choose<00:04:43.240> a<00:04:43.300> gene<00:04:43.750> region<00:04:44.680> that

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
why we want to choose a gene region that

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.390 
why we want to choose a gene region that
tends<00:04:45.760> to<00:04:46.030> differ<00:04:46.440> among<00:04:47.440> 5%<00:04:48.130> of<00:04:48.280> the

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
tends to differ among 5% of the

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.430 
tends to differ among 5% of the
population<00:04:48.550> at<00:04:49.120> least<00:04:49.360> is<00:04:49.630> so<00:04:50.530> that<00:04:50.710> when<00:04:50.919> we

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
population at least is so that when we

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.200 
population at least is so that when we
consider<00:04:53.440> the<00:04:54.160> study<00:04:54.610> group<00:04:54.880> for<00:04:55.180> a

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
consider the study group for a

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.320 
consider the study group for a
population<00:04:55.660> we<00:04:56.020> wanna<00:04:56.610> we<00:04:57.610> want<00:04:57.820> some<00:04:58.030> sort<00:04:58.240> of

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
population we wanna we want some sort of

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.719 
population we wanna we want some sort of
guarantee<00:04:58.900> that<00:04:59.169> the<00:04:59.770> gene<00:05:00.130> region<00:05:00.490> network

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
guarantee that the gene region network

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.390 
guarantee that the gene region network
in<00:05:00.850> a<00:05:00.910> study<00:05:01.150> is<00:05:01.470> different<00:05:02.470> between<00:05:02.860> or

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
in a study is different between or

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.270 
in a study is different between or
within<00:05:03.940> that<00:05:04.090> population<00:05:04.889> right<00:05:05.889> so<00:05:06.100> again

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
within that population right so again

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.550 
within that population right so again
here's<00:05:06.460> the<00:05:06.610> reason<00:05:06.880> why<00:05:07.169> we're<00:05:08.169> gonna<00:05:08.229> choose

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
here's the reason why we're gonna choose

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.780 
here's the reason why we're gonna choose
a<00:05:08.620> fairly<00:05:09.040> common<00:05:09.220> polymorphism<00:05:11.790> another

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
a fairly common polymorphism another

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.700 
a fairly common polymorphism another
term<00:05:13.180> so<00:05:13.479> it<00:05:13.990> turns<00:05:14.169> out<00:05:14.380> that<00:05:14.500> there<00:05:14.680> is

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
term so it turns out that there is

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.040 
term so it turns out that there is
different<00:05:15.130> types<00:05:15.190> of<00:05:15.610> genetic<00:05:16.270> variations

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
different types of genetic variations

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.960 
different types of genetic variations
there's<00:05:17.290> different<00:05:17.680> types<00:05:17.889> of<00:05:18.070> polymorphisms

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
there's different types of polymorphisms

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.440 
there's different types of polymorphisms
one<00:05:19.870> type<00:05:20.110> of<00:05:20.190> polymorphic<00:05:21.270> polymorphism<00:05:22.270> is

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
one type of polymorphic polymorphism is

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.810 
one type of polymorphic polymorphism is
something<00:05:23.110> called<00:05:23.350> a<00:05:23.590> single<00:05:24.070> nucleotide

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
something called a single nucleotide

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.600 
something called a single nucleotide
polymorphism<00:05:25.780> or<00:05:25.900> SNP<00:05:26.620> and<00:05:26.889> you're<00:05:27.310> gonna<00:05:27.400> see

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
polymorphism or SNP and you're gonna see

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.210 
polymorphism or SNP and you're gonna see
this<00:05:27.760> term<00:05:28.080> reference<00:05:29.080> quite<00:05:29.470> a<00:05:29.500> few<00:05:29.710> times<00:05:29.950> in

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
this term reference quite a few times in

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.610 
this term reference quite a few times in
your<00:05:30.340> assignment<00:05:30.850> and<00:05:31.110> so<00:05:32.110> you<00:05:32.169> might<00:05:32.350> be<00:05:32.500> able

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
your assignment and so you might be able

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.350 
your assignment and so you might be able
to<00:05:32.770> deduce<00:05:32.979> what<00:05:33.039> as<00:05:33.490> something<00:05:34.060> called<00:05:34.180> a

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
to deduce what as something called a

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.800 
to deduce what as something called a
single<00:05:34.720> nucleotide<00:05:35.440> polymorphism<00:05:36.400> is<00:05:36.810> it's

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
single nucleotide polymorphism is it's

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.960 
single nucleotide polymorphism is it's
whenever<00:05:38.560> you<00:05:38.830> have<00:05:39.010> a<00:05:39.039> genetic<00:05:39.580> variation

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
whenever you have a genetic variation

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.990 
whenever you have a genetic variation
between<00:05:40.360> two<00:05:40.720> people<00:05:41.140> and<00:05:41.380> what<00:05:42.310> causes<00:05:42.640> the

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
between two people and what causes the

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.110 
between two people and what causes the
difference<00:05:43.360> is<00:05:43.570> just<00:05:44.440> a<00:05:44.830> change<00:05:45.340> in<00:05:45.700> one

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
difference is just a change in one

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.510 
difference is just a change in one
single<00:05:46.600> nucleotide<00:05:49.320> another<00:05:50.320> example<00:05:50.919> of<00:05:51.070> a

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
single nucleotide another example of a

people within each one of those

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:25.680 
people within each one of those

that's indigenous in North America so

that's indigenous in North America so
