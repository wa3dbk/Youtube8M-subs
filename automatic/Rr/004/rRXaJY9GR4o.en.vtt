00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:07.379
 hello today we finally have a video 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.110
 DIY I will show you how you can 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.750
 hands decorate this summer cottages made distant 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.250
 some functional things to their 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.080
 it was more convenient to sign or 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.240
 just make them more fun 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.119
 so unusual means that interesting 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.949
 let's start soon for the first 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.840
 notebooks we will do this little thing 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.210
 so that you can sign it to 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.220
 not sat there they produce so 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.189
 It can be done with your hands need 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.230
 find such a thing as a stencil in 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.190
 Internet inter google can write 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.190
 label 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.020
 in English letters and then you will find 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.510
 then you need to print it fit 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.250
 size or if you can not wear 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.289
 reigning picture or just don't want 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.260
 printout it can be drawn by hand 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.379
 so did i so you draw there 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.910
 can form with shells and then 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.590
 fold in half to make it more 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.590
 symmetric and cut 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.309
 here you can where you go and 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.490
 invent any form of Capricorn 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.790
 like it now i take pretty 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.470
 decorative cardboard with a pattern and 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:18.330
 redrawn on this stencil 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.340
 form and then I cut out the selection does not 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.380
 the ways of you are very beautiful so I decided 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.950
 all the same make the usual rectangular 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.110
 form 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.460
 it also looks very nice so 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:33.869
 you can not bother now I'm cleaning 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.780
 where I want to put it and then cut it out 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.759
 a piece of plain white cardboard i 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.920
 a little bit smaller to make it easier 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.229
 write because color will not 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.119
 so clearly visible and then I have these two parts 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.119
 connect with each other for with the early 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:54.420
 scotch tape and the tape itself I stick 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:56.610
 this little thing to the string itself and all that 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.500
 it now remains to write your name you 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.070
 You can of course sign everything there 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.840
 need a class and sat down to and but sometimes you can 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.700
 write just first name last name by 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.099
 so we can therefore I did 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.380
 and this is a great way if your notebooks 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.290
 no place to sign you 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.860
 can you do it yourself 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.269
 I took again a piece of cardboard 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.760
 decorative and measured how much to me 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.650
 need to close all this here 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.950
 window where sign because I 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.750
 wanted to make new ones more beautiful and so 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.420
 what I cut out of paper such a square 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.200
 and then on top I made a rectangle 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.299
 from white paper and this all connect and 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.379
 stick on a notebook 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.599
 this is also a cool way to do 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.670
 a hundred more interesting because if 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.870
 lasso all usually you can do such 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.870
 signing stuff 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.560
 for the third way you need to first 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.840
 make stencil again for this on 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.060
 the usual little paper I drew 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.890
 isosceles triangle 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.570
 and then I cut it out you can 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.790
 calculate what size you need 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.880
 triangle or just draw any 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.400
 the size of it as I did and then I 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.920
 and triangle translated into different you 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.300
 on color and lick then eat 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.010
 triangles cut into more 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.600
 small because I understood that 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.820
 big I do not very well 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.400
 it turns out so that they cut them 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.430
 small and now i start them 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.260
 lay out like not like very much 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.720
 It looks beautiful when you have them all 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:46.930
 more or less when thou turn out very different 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:49.239
 Interestingly in small sections I spread 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.420
 glue and then where are the triangles so he 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.010
 not tired dry need to try 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.390
 finish more or less evenly and 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.390
 apply them tightly to each other 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.859
 from above I pressed it all down so she 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:09.219
 was more or less even and then I 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.239
 put under the press the best day 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:13.209
 it all dried up 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:15.040
 for sure I added triangles there 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.560
 where I had empty seats 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.949
 began to dry again and cut off all 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.600
 superfluous and so they surely hold on and 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:25.090
 so as not to get dirty and so 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.240
 glossy spheres I cry and inflicted more 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.280
 one layer of glue for decoupage and here is our 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.860
 the notebook is ready it is so very bright and 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.080
 unusual funny he will suit both 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.759
 diary or as a gift to someone 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.759
 my very world looks like 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.979
 I bought a black notebook 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:50.020
 or start i cut out the cardboard just 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.960
 such a white leaf to close because 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.270
 what good that the background was not black white 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.319
 so this sheet I pasted straight 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:01.930
 above you need to go to Mars traps here 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:03.969
 everything kept well but what fast tkat 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.400
 glue is not arched it must be then put 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:07.120
 again under the press to perish the books or 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.520
 magazines 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:13.680
 preferably for a day so that it is exactly 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.680
 straight dried still perfectly kept 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.140
 and at this time you can go for a tambler 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.540
 or google and find pictures which 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.370
 do you like i took my pictures from 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.740
 my tambler account i put 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.590
 link if you are suddenly interested and now 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.300
 they need to be placed on a leaf in the city and 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.940
 become small so that you have them all 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:42.320
 fit print and now i have them 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:43.280
 cut out has this blood you need 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.530
 in which 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.600
 collages to make it all harmoniously 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.040
 looked or then start again 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.200
 stick using glue for decoupage 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.390
 it fits you well for paper 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.610
 it does not soak and best of all at first 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:58.340
 smear on the picture itself glue and 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:02.690
 you apply magicians then it will be easier for you 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:05.810
 and in this way I stick everything 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.280
 pictures and they also need good 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.200
 smooth out anything in it 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.480
 bubbles so that they hold well and 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.280
 where I just left the place I 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.800
 decided to draw a little such 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.960
 arrow so you can use 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.000
 stickers pictures from magazines can 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.950
 yourself draw something when you have 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.600
 big white space you can do 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.510
 and what 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:28.270
 with a notebook was glossy and whether it 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:30.520
 do not get dirty you need to stick a tape on top 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.170
 scotch and can be bought anywhere in 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.720
 supermarket or in a stall to some 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.270
 100 is a very useful thing because 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.680
 the titanium of the fire becomes so glossy 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:41.350
 more beautiful as if really bought in 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.360
 the store and it was all master class 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.950
 whose bodies today show hope 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.230
 you liked it and you make your own 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.060
 unusual notebooks that no one has 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.980
 will no longer be required to send 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:55.110
 photos of the group are really looking forward to them 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.110
 and thanks for watching everyone bye
