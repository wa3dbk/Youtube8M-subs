far I think I'm really happy with the

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.410 
far I think I'm really happy with the
team<00:02:20.739> is<00:02:20.920> all<00:02:21.069> and<00:02:21.250> I<00:02:21.550> really<00:02:21.819> do<00:02:21.940> enjoy<00:02:22.090> using

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
team is all and I really do enjoy using

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.180 
team is all and I really do enjoy using
this<00:02:22.630> team<00:02:22.870> you<00:02:22.959> can<00:02:23.110> see<00:02:23.290> got<00:02:23.739> tougher

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
this team you can see got tougher

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.380 
this team you can see got tougher
I<00:02:24.250> believe<00:02:24.520> we're<00:02:24.700> near<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:24.910> bottom<00:02:25.120> of<00:02:25.300> the

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
I believe we're near the bottom of the

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.850 
I believe we're near the bottom of the
table<00:02:25.569> as<00:02:25.780> well<00:02:25.930> so<00:02:26.110> I<00:02:26.140> think<00:02:26.319> in<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.650> end<00:02:26.739> it

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
table as well so I think in the end it

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.650 
table as well so I think in the end it
wasn't<00:02:26.980> one<00:02:27.190> no<00:02:27.340> victory<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:27.970> yet<00:02:28.330> Nash<00:02:28.510> he

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
wasn't one no victory and yet Nash he

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.270 
wasn't one no victory and yet Nash he
wasn't<00:02:28.870> no<00:02:28.959> no<00:02:29.140> wasn't<00:02:29.319> it<00:02:29.470> but<00:02:29.590> anyway<00:02:29.770> we're

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
wasn't no no wasn't it but anyway we're

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.740 
wasn't no no wasn't it but anyway we're
going<00:02:30.519> into<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:31.000> next<00:02:31.239> game<00:02:31.360> of<00:02:31.510> today's

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
going into the next game of today's

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.720 
going into the next game of today's
episode<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.140> it's<00:02:32.739> a<00:02:32.890> again<00:02:33.250> I<00:02:33.459> got<00:02:33.610> up

be<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.830> really<00:02:36.280> tough<00:02:36.459> game<00:02:36.640> when<00:02:36.849> we<00:02:37.000> need<00:02:37.150> to

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
be a really tough game when we need to

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.460 
be a really tough game when we need to
get<00:02:37.330> a<00:02:37.390> win<00:02:37.540> from<00:02:37.630> this<00:02:37.780> game<00:02:37.989> as<00:02:38.140> well<00:02:38.290> so

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
get a win from this game as well so

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.050 
get a win from this game as well so
which<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.190> we<00:02:39.340> actually<00:02:39.550> picked<00:02:39.700> up<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.819> ball

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
which it we actually picked up the ball

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.490 
which it we actually picked up the ball
here<00:02:40.239> midway<00:02:40.599> through<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.930> first<00:02:41.140> half<00:02:41.230> you

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
here midway through the first half you

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.680 
here midway through the first half you
can<00:02:41.590> see<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:41.980> great<00:02:42.430> passer<00:02:42.670> from<00:02:43.000> Elim<00:02:43.360> nd<00:02:43.660> I

think his name is passing it to Berlin
as<00:02:45.400> a<00:02:45.430> fantastic<00:02:46.060> finish<00:02:46.209> pass<00:02:46.810> the

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440

amazing<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.069> just<00:02:51.250> felt<00:02:51.610> really<00:02:51.850> timed

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.440 
his run they're going past the defenders
and<00:02:53.860> then<00:02:54.010> really<00:02:54.310> nice<00:02:54.459> chest<00:02:54.670> down<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:55.120> he

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:58.830 
made it one nil so again a great passer
through<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.850> Gareth<00:02:58.120> Bale<00:02:58.269> he<00:02:58.420> has<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.540> chance

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
through the Gareth Bale he has a chance

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.059 
through the Gareth Bale he has a chance

opportunities<00:03:06.549> and<00:03:07.209> we<00:03:07.269> actually<00:03:07.480> get<00:03:07.569> across

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
opportunities and we actually get across

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.059

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
really really good from corners but

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.289 
really really good from corners but
actually<00:03:12.190> attacking<00:03:12.430> corners<00:03:12.790> but<00:03:12.849> defending

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
actually attacking corners but defending

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.000 
actually attacking corners but defending
corners<00:03:13.599> we<00:03:13.989> actually<00:03:14.230> set<00:03:14.470> in<00:03:14.560> shambles<00:03:14.950> you

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
corners we actually set in shambles you

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.289 
corners we actually set in shambles you
can<00:03:15.160> see<00:03:15.310> their<00:03:15.519> head<00:03:15.670> is<00:03:15.790> just<00:03:16.000> going<00:03:16.209> all

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
can see their head is just going all

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.569 
can see their head is just going all
over<00:03:16.330> the<00:03:16.540> place<00:03:16.750> from<00:03:17.319> Sergio<00:03:17.620> Ramos<00:03:17.859> and<00:03:18.220> you

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
can see there go upwards this team I

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.630 
can see there go upwards this team I
think<00:03:20.200> cell<00:03:20.530> should<00:03:20.709> maybe<00:03:20.859> Vallecano<00:03:21.310> some

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
think cell should maybe Vallecano some

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.039 
think cell should maybe Vallecano some
of<00:03:21.760> that<00:03:21.880> I<00:03:22.090> think<00:03:22.450> I've<00:03:22.510> got<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:22.660> team's<00:03:22.900> like

one one at this point we really need to
win<00:03:51.160> these<00:03:51.310> games<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:51.880> when<00:03:52.120> she<00:03:52.239> get<00:03:52.359> the

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
win these games and when she get the

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.729 
win these games and when she get the

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
ball steamer a great ball there from

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.500 
ball steamer a great ball there from
Ronaldo<00:03:54.190> a<00:03:54.370> great<00:03:54.730> stay<00:03:54.910> from<00:03:55.000> the<00:03:55.090> goalkeeper

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
Ronaldo a great stay from the goalkeeper

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.210 
Ronaldo a great stay from the goalkeeper
but<00:03:55.630> but<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:55.930> yang<00:03:56.079> of<00:03:56.170> Acosta<00:03:56.560> finally

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
but but the yang of Acosta finally

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.710 
but but the yang of Acosta finally
scores<00:03:57.459> his<00:03:57.609> first<00:03:57.790> goal<00:03:58.060> of<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.209> season<00:03:58.389> and

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
scores his first goal of the season and

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.569 
scores his first goal of the season and
that<00:03:58.750> makes<00:03:59.350> it<00:03:59.440> 2-1<00:03:59.680> so<00:03:59.950> I<00:04:00.010> think<00:04:00.069> that<00:04:00.400> could

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
that makes it 2-1 so I think that could

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.220 
that makes it 2-1 so I think that could
prove<00:04:00.760> to<00:04:00.790> be<00:04:00.910> a<00:04:01.000> really<00:04:01.239> important<00:04:01.600> goal<00:04:01.780> we

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
prove to be a really important goal we

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
prove to be a really important goal we
should<00:04:02.350> pick<00:04:02.440> up<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.620> ball<00:04:02.799> here<00:04:02.950> wouldn't

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
should pick up the ball here wouldn't

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.599 
should pick up the ball here wouldn't
again

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
again

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.370 
again
midway<00:04:04.239> through<00:04:04.269> the<00:04:04.480> first<00:04:04.569> half<00:04:04.840> second<00:04:05.290> off

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
midway through the first half second off

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.900 
midway through the first half second off
alone<00:04:05.590> it's<00:04:05.769> at<00:04:05.889> the<00:04:05.950> end<00:04:06.069> of<00:04:06.220> second<00:04:06.489> off<00:04:06.609> and

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
alone it's at the end of second off and

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.910 
alone it's at the end of second off and
if<00:04:07.150> she<00:04:07.269> comes<00:04:07.600> really<00:04:07.840> close<00:04:07.989> so<00:04:08.230> a<00:04:08.260> big<00:04:08.709> nice

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
if she comes really close so a big nice

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.110 
if she comes really close so a big nice
kill<00:04:09.100> there's<00:04:09.280> actually<00:04:09.519> four<00:04:09.730> stars<00:04:09.970> skill

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
kill there's actually four stars skill

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.240 
kill there's actually four stars skill
moves<00:04:10.180> as<00:04:10.420> well<00:04:10.480> so<00:04:11.230> where<00:04:11.709> she<00:04:11.859> win<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.100> game

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
moves as well so where she win the game

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.340 
moves as well so where she win the game
2-1<00:04:12.459> as<00:04:12.850> I<00:04:12.970> said<00:04:13.180> these<00:04:13.329> games<00:04:13.600> are<00:04:13.810> not<00:04:14.019> really

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
2-1 as I said these games are not really

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.840 
2-1 as I said these games are not really
you<00:04:14.709> think<00:04:14.950> on<00:04:15.069> paper<00:04:15.250> they're<00:04:15.459> not<00:04:15.579> gonna<00:04:15.700> be

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
you think on paper they're not gonna be

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.129 
you think on paper they're not gonna be
too<00:04:16.060> difficult<00:04:16.269> but<00:04:16.630> they<00:04:16.690> actually<00:04:16.810> always

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
too difficult but they actually always

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:18.840 
too difficult but they actually always
seem<00:04:17.320> to<00:04:17.350> be<00:04:17.500> really<00:04:17.650> difficult<00:04:18.220> because<00:04:18.519> the

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
seem to be really difficult because the

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.129 
seem to be really difficult because the
teams<00:04:19.060> now<00:04:19.239> you<00:04:19.299> defending<00:04:19.810> that<00:04:19.840> kind<00:04:20.109> of

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
teams now you defending that kind of

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:21.659 
teams now you defending that kind of
thing<00:04:20.350> and<00:04:20.530> they're<00:04:20.950> really<00:04:21.160> good<00:04:21.280> an<00:04:21.400> attack

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
thing and they're really good an attack

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.219 
thing and they're really good an attack
as<00:04:21.820> well<00:04:21.970> they<00:04:22.120> seemed<00:04:22.360> to<00:04:22.750> always<00:04:22.870> be<00:04:22.990> my

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
as well they seemed to always be my

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.570 
as well they seemed to always be my
jockey<00:04:23.530> who<00:04:23.620> stopped<00:04:23.800> my<00:04:23.890> jockey<00:04:24.220> was<00:04:24.310> always

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
jockey who stopped my jockey was always

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.279 
jockey who stopped my jockey was always
asleep<00:04:24.789> whilst<00:04:25.450> these<00:04:25.630> small<00:04:25.900> teams<00:04:26.140> are

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
it and you can see we actually got a

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.450 
it and you can see we actually got a
thing<00:04:32.139> is<00:04:32.230> eleven<00:04:32.620> twelve<00:04:32.860> points<00:04:33.130> I<00:04:33.190> think

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
thing is eleven twelve points I think

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.010 
thing is eleven twelve points I think
and<00:04:33.550> I've<00:04:33.910> let's<00:04:34.090> come<00:04:34.270> to<00:04:34.360> it<00:04:34.480> are<00:04:34.630> in<00:04:34.750> six

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
and I've let's come to it are in six

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.810 
and I've let's come to it are in six
positions<00:04:35.500> so<00:04:35.710> where<00:04:36.190> she<00:04:36.310> stopped<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.550> game

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
positions so where she stopped the game

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.760 
positions so where she stopped the game
here<00:04:37.000> at<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.270> Santiago<00:04:37.570> bernabéu<00:04:37.990> and<00:04:38.470> you

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
here at the Santiago bernabéu and you

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.050 
here at the Santiago bernabéu and you
know<00:04:38.919> that<00:04:39.100> athletic<00:04:39.430> Umbreon<00:04:39.730> aren't<00:04:39.970> too

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
know that athletic Umbreon aren't too

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.550 
know that athletic Umbreon aren't too
good<00:04:40.210> offense<00:04:40.630> because<00:04:40.810> they've<00:04:40.990> got<00:04:41.139> Miranda

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
good offense because they've got Miranda

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.230 
good offense because they've got Miranda
he's<00:04:41.950> not<00:04:42.130> really<00:04:42.310> that<00:04:42.400> defensive<00:04:43.030> is<00:04:43.120> more

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
he's not really that defensive is more

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.820 
he's not really that defensive is more
attacking<00:04:43.600> in<00:04:43.720> my<00:04:43.840> opinion<00:04:44.169> and<00:04:44.350> they<00:04:44.740> are

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
attacking in my opinion and they are

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.110 
attacking in my opinion and they are
really<00:04:45.010> good<00:04:45.190> and<00:04:45.250> attack<00:04:45.520> by<00:04:45.669> the<00:04:45.730> way<00:04:45.880> so<00:04:45.940> I'm

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
really good and attack by the way so I'm

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.520 
really good and attack by the way so I'm
not<00:04:46.210> going<00:04:46.360> to<00:04:46.419> take<00:04:46.540> anything<00:04:46.810> away<00:04:47.350> from

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
not going to take anything away from

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.860 
not going to take anything away from
their<00:04:47.860> team<00:04:48.040> so<00:04:48.280> guess<00:04:48.880> what<00:04:49.150> another<00:04:49.570> injury

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
their team so guess what another injury

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.909 
their team so guess what another injury
so<00:04:50.020> that<00:04:50.050> I<00:04:50.169> think<00:04:50.410> there's<00:04:50.560> this<00:04:50.680> time<00:04:50.889> a

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
so that I think there's this time a

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.440 
so that I think there's this time a
thing<00:04:51.160> is<00:04:51.280> moderate<00:04:51.730> and<00:04:51.910> that's<00:04:52.090> why<00:04:52.210> I<00:04:52.240> said

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
thing is moderate and that's why I said

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.940 
thing is moderate and that's why I said
earlier<00:04:52.660> in<00:04:53.169> the<00:04:53.290> episode<00:04:53.320> and<00:04:53.680> that<00:04:53.710> means

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
season from I in my opinion and you're

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.290 
season from I in my opinion and you're
gonna<00:05:20.950> sees<00:05:21.190> but<00:05:21.400> also<00:05:21.580> gonna<00:05:21.850> score<00:05:22.090> a<00:05:22.150> couple

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
gonna sees but also gonna score a couple

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.090 
gonna sees but also gonna score a couple
more<00:05:22.540> goals<00:05:22.780> this<00:05:22.900> season<00:05:22.960> obviously<00:05:23.320> so<00:05:24.070> a

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
more goals this season obviously so a

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.409 
more goals this season obviously so a
great<00:05:24.340> goal<00:05:24.490> there<00:05:24.639> great<00:05:24.850> celebration<00:05:25.330> as

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
great goal there great celebration as

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:26.909 
great goal there great celebration as
well<00:05:25.600> and<00:05:25.840> I<00:05:26.229> don't<00:05:26.290> know<00:05:26.470> how<00:05:26.590> did<00:05:26.770> that

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
well and I don't know how did that

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.710 
well and I don't know how did that
celebration<00:05:27.280> I<00:05:27.460> think<00:05:27.639> is<00:05:27.729> just<00:05:27.880> automatic<00:05:28.510> so

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
celebration I think is just automatic so

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.690 
celebration I think is just automatic so
so<00:05:29.290> drama<00:05:29.590> so<00:05:29.740> she<00:05:29.800> gives<00:05:30.040> away<00:05:30.250> a<00:05:30.370> penalty

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
so drama so she gives away a penalty

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.159 
so drama so she gives away a penalty
which<00:05:31.090> means<00:05:31.390> that<00:05:31.510> athletic<00:05:31.900> come<00:05:32.020> through

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
which means that athletic come through

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:33.420 
which means that athletic come through
it<00:05:32.229> do<00:05:32.650> you<00:05:32.710> have<00:05:32.830> the<00:05:32.860> chance<00:05:33.130> to<00:05:33.220> get<00:05:33.370> back

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
it do you have the chance to get back

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.980 
it do you have the chance to get back
into<00:05:33.700> the<00:05:33.880> game<00:05:34.030> you're<00:05:34.510> going<00:05:34.660> to<00:05:34.720> see<00:05:34.840> weave

still Opie and a great shot into the

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.770 
still Opie and a great shot into the
back<00:06:05.979> of<00:06:06.010> the<00:06:06.160> net<00:06:06.280> so<00:06:06.460> started<00:06:06.970> off<00:06:07.090> with<00:06:07.630> the

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
back of the net so started off with the

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.570 
back of the net so started off with the
Berber<00:06:08.020> spin<00:06:08.229> then<00:06:08.410> going<00:06:08.590> past<00:06:08.830> the<00:06:09.250> defender

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
Berber spin then going past the defender

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.100 
Berber spin then going past the defender
you<00:06:09.639> can<00:06:09.760> see<00:06:09.910> here<00:06:10.030> look<00:06:10.180> at<00:06:10.300> that<00:06:10.479> and<00:06:10.660> then<00:06:11.080> a

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
you can see here look at that and then a

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.900 
you can see here look at that and then a
finesse<00:06:11.560> shot<00:06:11.590> possible<00:06:11.919> people<00:06:12.460> caught<00:06:12.669> wide

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
finesse shot possible people caught wide

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.730 
finesse shot possible people caught wide
no<00:06:13.120> chance<00:06:13.389> and<00:06:13.600> I<00:06:13.900> think<00:06:14.139> the<00:06:14.320> contest

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
no chance and I think the contest

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.290 
no chance and I think the contest
actually<00:06:14.979> said<00:06:15.160> these<00:06:15.310> on<00:06:15.460> bad<00:06:15.639> form<00:06:15.910> so<00:06:16.120> I

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
actually said these on bad form so I

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.820 
actually said these on bad form so I
kind<00:06:16.750> of<00:06:16.780> took<00:06:16.930> advantage<00:06:17.260> of<00:06:17.500> that<00:06:17.620> with<00:06:17.800> a

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
kind of took advantage of that with a

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.620 
kind of took advantage of that with a
great<00:06:18.100> shot<00:06:18.280> there<00:06:18.310> and<00:06:18.789> two<00:06:19.030> great<00:06:19.210> goals<00:06:19.419> and

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
great shot there and two great goals and

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.450 
great shot there and two great goals and
means<00:06:20.050> it's<00:06:20.260> 2-1<00:06:20.590> going<00:06:20.889> into<00:06:21.100> the<00:06:21.160> second

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
means it's 2-1 going into the second

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.370 
means it's 2-1 going into the second
half<00:06:21.490> so<00:06:21.729> and<00:06:21.880> now<00:06:21.970> though<00:06:22.150> and<00:06:22.360> Gareth<00:06:23.020> Bale

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.380 
half so and now though and Gareth Bale

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.930 
half so and now though and Gareth Bale
two<00:06:23.500> goal<00:06:23.680> scorers<00:06:23.950> so<00:06:24.010> we're<00:06:24.639> going<00:06:24.789> into

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
two goal scorers so we're going into

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.129 
two goal scorers so we're going into
second<00:06:25.240> off<00:06:25.360> and<00:06:25.510> I'll<00:06:25.570> didn't<00:06:25.780> make<00:06:25.930> too<00:06:25.960> many

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:26.139 
second off and I'll didn't make too many

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:27.750 
second off and I'll didn't make too many
changes<00:06:26.260> but<00:06:26.710> we<00:06:26.830> know<00:06:26.950> that<00:06:26.979> yoga<00:06:27.400> cost<00:06:27.610> us

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760 
changes but we know that yoga cost us

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.400 
changes but we know that yoga cost us
finding<00:06:28.120> guys<00:06:28.210> first<00:06:28.479> goal<00:06:28.720> of<00:06:28.870> the<00:06:29.229> season

finding guys first goal of the season

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.740 
finding guys first goal of the season
you<00:06:29.560> could<00:06:29.800> see<00:06:29.979> it<00:06:30.070> we<00:06:30.460> actually<00:06:30.550> get<00:06:30.850> what's

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
you could see it we actually get what's

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.510 
you could see it we actually get what's
it<00:06:31.870> a<00:06:31.930> free<00:06:32.050> kick<00:06:32.289> against<00:06:32.680> us<00:06:32.830> and<00:06:33.039> it's<00:06:33.400> going

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
it a free kick against us and it's going

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.580

to be okay putting in the free kick and

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:36.899 
to be okay putting in the free kick and
I<00:06:35.620> don't<00:06:35.830> know<00:06:36.010> what's<00:06:36.159> going<00:06:36.370> on<00:06:36.430> my<00:06:36.580> defense

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:36.909 
I don't know what's going on my defense

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:38.790 
I don't know what's going on my defense
as<00:06:37.150> I<00:06:37.270> said<00:06:37.450> we<00:06:37.960> ran<00:06:38.080> and<00:06:38.229> said<00:06:38.380> you<00:06:38.470> almost<00:06:38.620> are

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
as I said we ran and said you almost are

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.360 
as I said we ran and said you almost are
so<00:06:39.010> good

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
so good

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.890 
so good
attacking<00:06:39.669> corners<00:06:40.120> but

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
attacking corners but

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.390 
attacking corners but
the<00:06:40.960> corners<00:06:41.320> are<00:06:41.380> an<00:06:41.470> absolute<00:06:41.800> shambles<00:06:41.949> as

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
the corners are an absolute shambles as

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.460 
the corners are an absolute shambles as
I<00:06:42.430> said<00:06:42.790> so<00:06:43.030> a<00:06:43.210> squatcher<00:06:43.900> picks<00:06:44.080> up<00:06:44.229> the<00:06:44.320> ball

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.470 
I said so a squatcher picks up the ball

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:45.780 
I said so a squatcher picks up the ball
when<00:06:44.590> we<00:06:44.710> are<00:06:44.800> on<00:06:44.919> the<00:06:45.009> 70th<00:06:45.370> minute<00:06:45.550> now<00:06:45.759> a

when we are on the 70th minute now a

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:46.950 
when we are on the 70th minute now a
great<00:06:46.030> cost<00:06:46.270> into<00:06:46.570> the<00:06:46.660> box

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 
great cost into the box

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.600 
great cost into the box
actually<00:06:47.440> goes<00:06:47.560> past<00:06:47.770> all<00:06:47.919> the<00:06:48.040> defenders<00:06:48.460> but

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.610 
actually goes past all the defenders but

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.040 
actually goes past all the defenders but
look<00:06:48.910> at<00:06:49.000> that<00:06:49.120> what<00:06:49.270> is<00:06:49.300> he<00:06:49.479> doing<00:06:49.720> there<00:06:49.930> and

chances really unlucky there now she

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.219 
chances really unlucky there now she
comes<00:06:54.460> off<00:06:54.669> a<00:06:54.699> defender<00:06:54.970> and<00:06:55.479> goes<00:06:55.870> out<00:06:56.050> for<00:06:56.169> a

00:06:56.219 --> 00:06:56.229 
comes off a defender and goes out for a

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:57.600 
comes off a defender and goes out for a
corner<00:06:56.590> and<00:06:56.650> I<00:06:56.740> didn't<00:06:57.220> actually<00:06:57.280> go<00:06:57.550> to

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:57.610 
corner and I didn't actually go to

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.249 
corner and I didn't actually go to
anything<00:06:58.000> in<00:06:58.150> the<00:06:58.240> end<00:06:58.360> so<00:06:58.539> we'd<00:06:59.020> be<00:06:59.110> other

00:06:59.249 --> 00:06:59.259 
anything in the end so we'd be other

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:00.480 
anything in the end so we'd be other
than<00:06:59.350> that<00:06:59.530> we<00:06:59.710> pick<00:06:59.860> up<00:06:59.949> the<00:07:00.070> ball<00:07:00.190> here<00:07:00.310> it's

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.490 
than that we pick up the ball here it's

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.340 
than that we pick up the ball here it's
go<00:07:00.669> and<00:07:00.940> he<00:07:01.120> goes<00:07:01.270> past<00:07:01.449> the<00:07:01.570> defender<00:07:01.960> but<00:07:02.080> so

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:02.350 
go and he goes past the defender but so

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.930 
go and he goes past the defender but so
unlucky<00:07:02.620> the<00:07:02.800> hit<00:07:02.949> in<00:07:03.009> the<00:07:03.100> post<00:07:03.310> and<00:07:03.550> that

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:03.940 
unlucky the hit in the post and that

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.310 
unlucky the hit in the post and that
could<00:07:04.090> have<00:07:04.180> won<00:07:04.300> the<00:07:04.419> game<00:07:04.539> no<00:07:04.780> three<00:07:05.020> points

could have won the game no three points

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.960 
could have won the game no three points
I<00:07:05.380> could<00:07:05.440> have<00:07:05.620> potentially<00:07:06.039> been<00:07:06.070> but<00:07:06.699> we're

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:06.970 
I could have potentially been but we're

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:08.189

been<00:07:07.150> lucky<00:07:07.449> there<00:07:07.630> we<00:07:07.690> actually<00:07:07.900> drew<00:07:08.080> the
