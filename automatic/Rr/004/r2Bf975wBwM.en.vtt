the development of artificial

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.240 
the development of artificial
intelligence<00:02:42.140> could<00:02:43.140> eventually<00:02:43.380> become<00:02:43.800> the

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
intelligence could eventually become the

intelligence could eventually become the
greatest<00:02:44.630> existential<00:02:45.630> threat<00:02:45.990> to<00:02:46.740> mankind

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
greatest existential threat to mankind

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.230 
greatest existential threat to mankind
first<00:02:48.530> eliminating<00:02:49.530> millions<00:02:50.220> of<00:02:50.430> jobs<00:02:50.880> and

first eliminating millions of jobs and

first eliminating millions of jobs and
then<00:02:51.660> eventually

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
then eventually

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.000 
then eventually
the<00:02:52.870> human<00:02:53.170> race<00:02:53.350> do<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.310> have<00:02:54.490> a<00:02:54.520> name<00:02:54.730> a<00:02:54.970> bus

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
the human race do you have a name a bus

the human race do you have a name a bus
question<00:02:57.010> is<00:02:57.220> will<00:02:57.730> life<00:02:57.970> eventually<00:02:58.660> imitate

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
question is will life eventually imitate
