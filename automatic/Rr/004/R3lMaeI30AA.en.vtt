00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.240
 decided to finish the second part of the video 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.220
 for those who are interested who are interested 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:18.510
 how it is arranged inside the cabin of shoes 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:20.279
 just wondering I'm probably the only one 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.260
 a person who does not guarantee anything 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.060
 he is trying to repair himself 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:34.380
 stronger but look how long 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:37.800
 the screws go through your whole body i 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:43.640
 I consider wastefulness iron principle 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.640
 Russia on iron yes not lagged behind 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.860
 you look like a Russian day to all 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.860
 interesting 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.930
 mostly 99 percent from us 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.000
 made in china last 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.420
 even watched the charger 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.950
 does 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:15.590
 2 toe edge and advertising will go well as 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.610
 interesting very much like straight 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:23.750
 system unit 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:32.800
 my computer power supply is very 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:32.800
 simple scheme so this is a diode 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.410
 this two transistors are 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:02:00.520
 I do not know my height is sometimes such a sound 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:06.190
 there was just like something sparkling somewhere i 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:10.080
 even found feels esprit and once well 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:14.340
 you do not think that buying Russian 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.230
 she's got to fix everything 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.410
 put everything in common Chinese 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.380
 Russian Germanic everything is done 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.880
 there is no such technique in which there are no jambs 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.790
 tangible for their practice something not 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.080
 even met a very expensive technique 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:37.000
 which is worth millions has shoals 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:40.840
 and even more so that costs up to 10,000 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.560
 or say 1000 people by has its 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.160
 shoals this carrier I will lay out it at once 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.160
 me not immediately 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:03:01.860
 as they saw it was sealed devices I 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.860
 showing you what it is worth 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:10.610
 transistors really beautiful soldering 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:14.450
 our radiator is badly squeezed so if 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:18.130
 I can basically speak a lot 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:21.860
 what to bypass if they give me the device 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.360
 everywhere I find the shoals of this device in 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.290
 The principle is that it works and does not 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.240
 restored no battery and know 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.780
 and jambs honestly do not even see 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:37.730
 the fact that it is rations obscene so let's say 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.500
 rosin is not removed it is even a good charge 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.750
 and think that the board should be 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.790
 perfect clean no she should not be 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.710
 net if she rosin you have 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.690
 less likely that moisture 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:51.050
 will fall and 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.630
 will close between the same diodes for 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.800
 capacitors what will you be case 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:01.670
 from to condensate stoves no this 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.260
 it will be simple here but the fee 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.290
 should it seems to me like in Soviet times 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.320
 be processed extra 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:13.460
 some varnishes that is if we do 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:15.500
 for a long time work before us should 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:19.040
 be normal radiators are not normal and 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:22.520
 accordingly the non-payment is covered ie 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:26.750
 why china is somehow called ip65 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:30.470
 dallas full protection water resistant which 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.990
 can be lowered there to a depth of 100 meters 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.050
 we will come nifiga will not be in this 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:40.930
 case 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.930
 rather bad pro i am on transistors 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:48.790
 soldering iron to be and amateurs 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.790
 mikroshemki there are 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:05:01.830
 microcircuit hall pans and is it me 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.830
 ical alcohol not try so constituted
