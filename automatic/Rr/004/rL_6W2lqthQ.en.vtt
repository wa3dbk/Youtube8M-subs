00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.109 
going to shooting at the 5 yard
intervals<00:01:46.260> so<00:01:46.680> like<00:01:47.130> CJ<00:01:47.430> he's<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.640> running<00:01:47.970> back

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
intervals so like CJ he's a running back

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.550 
intervals so like CJ he's a running back
so<00:01:48.600> he<00:01:48.720> would<00:01:48.840> start<00:01:49.080> the<00:01:49.200> running<00:01:49.380> back

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
so he would start the running back

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.170 
so he would start the running back
stance<00:01:49.860> if<00:01:50.070> you're<00:01:50.190> a<00:01:50.220> wide<00:01:50.400> receiver<00:01:50.550> you're

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
stance if you're a wide receiver you're

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.790 
stance if you're a wide receiver you're
here<00:01:51.420> if<00:01:51.750> you're<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.930> basketball<00:01:52.260> player<00:01:52.350> you

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
here if you're a basketball player you

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.080 
here if you're a basketball player you
might<00:01:53.010> want<00:01:53.160> to<00:01:53.190> just<00:01:53.430> even<00:01:53.610> walk<00:01:53.880> up<00:01:54.060> like

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
might want to just even walk up like

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.730
