00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
basically let's do it kind of like a

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.220 
basically let's do it kind of like a
Jerry<00:00:17.699> Bruckheimer<00:00:18.210> movie<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.750> they<00:00:19.050> like

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
that that was six years ago and we've

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.240 
that that was six years ago and we've
been<00:00:22.230> directing<00:00:22.529> at<00:00:22.619> full<00:00:22.740> time<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.039> last

we also love limited to D style

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.780 
we also love limited to D style
animation<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.890> we<00:01:31.980> try<00:01:32.190> to<00:01:32.220> figure<00:01:32.430> out<00:01:32.580> a<00:01:32.610> way

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
animation so we try to figure out a way

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.490 
animation so we try to figure out a way
to<00:01:32.850> get<00:01:33.630> some<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:33.960> style<00:01:34.320> into<00:01:34.830> a<00:01:34.860> full<00:01:35.280> 3d

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
to get some of that style into a full 3d

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.930 
to get some of that style into a full 3d
rich<00:01:37.500> environments<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.370> took<00:01:38.550> looked<00:01:38.820> at<00:01:38.910> a

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940
