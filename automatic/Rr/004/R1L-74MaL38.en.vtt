better known as BSOD and he's gonna run
us<00:00:09.059> through<00:00:09.090> his<00:00:09.809> setup<00:00:10.110> but<00:00:10.380> she<00:00:10.500> can't

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
us through his setup but she can't

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.160 
us through his setup but she can't
develop<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.280> systems<00:00:11.670> up<00:00:11.940> which<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.870> really

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
develop the systems up which is really

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.200 
develop the systems up which is really
badass<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.980> usually<00:00:14.580> don't<00:00:14.670> say<00:00:14.759> things<00:00:14.940> about

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
badass I usually don't say things about

your thing well first on the hardware
side<00:00:20.279> we<00:00:20.490> got<00:00:20.640> Mac<00:00:21.240> flip<00:00:21.449> fro<00:00:21.689> just<00:00:22.170> your

running Ableton Live which most of you

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.580 
running Ableton Live which most of you
producers<00:00:27.150> out<00:00:27.390> there<00:00:27.539> now<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> lot<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.109> DJ's<00:00:28.230> -

producers out there now a lot of DJ's -
it's<00:00:28.800> great<00:00:29.490> software<00:00:29.849> for<00:00:29.970> making<00:00:30.060> music

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
it's great software for making music

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.330 
it's great software for making music
great<00:00:30.599> software<00:00:30.960> for<00:00:31.109> performing<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:31.769> what

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
great software for performing so what

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.770 
great software for performing so what
I've<00:00:32.460> done<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:32.969> sort<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.180> extended<00:00:33.660> what

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
I've done is that sort of extended what

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.690 
I've done is that sort of extended what
it<00:00:33.899> does<00:00:34.079> by<00:00:34.980> writing<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.850> VST<00:00:36.120> plugin<00:00:36.719> that

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
it does by writing a VST plugin that

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.889 
it does by writing a VST plugin that
communicates<00:00:38.700> with<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.180> back<00:00:39.360> end<00:00:39.570> basically

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
communicates with the back end basically

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.290 
communicates with the back end basically
you<00:00:40.110> got<00:00:40.260> these<00:00:40.410> control<00:00:40.829> services<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.579> live

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
you got these control services in live

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.180 
you got these control services in live
that<00:00:42.719> allow<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.680> know<00:00:43.710> act<00:00:43.980> like<00:00:44.040> a

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
that allow you to you know act like a

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.240 
that allow you to you know act like a
hardware<00:00:44.460> control<00:00:44.820> or<00:00:45.030> if<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.300> are<00:00:46.129> you<00:00:47.129> know

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
hardware control or if you are you know

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.619 
hardware control or if you are you know
using<00:00:47.460> our<00:00:47.670> some<00:00:47.940> kind<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.120> remote<00:00:48.329> control

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
using our some kind of remote control

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.090 
using our some kind of remote control
service<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.020> wrote<00:00:49.260> my<00:00:49.379> own<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.590> sense<00:00:49.950> of

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
service so I wrote my own a sense of

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.760 
service so I wrote my own a sense of
essentially<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:51.050> that's<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.260> back<00:00:52.440> end<00:00:52.649> to

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
essentially that that's the back end to

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.799 
essentially that that's the back end to
live<00:00:52.949> how<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.370> my<00:00:53.699> plug-in<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.449> talking<00:00:54.719> to

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
live how it my plug-in is talking to

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.360 
live how it my plug-in is talking to
live<00:00:54.960> but<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.230> have<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.469> little<00:00:55.649> VST<00:00:56.039> plugin

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
live but I have this little VST plugin

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.520 
live but I have this little VST plugin
nothing<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.180> see<00:00:57.360> really<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.199> stupid

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
nothing to see really it's a stupid

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.560 
nothing to see really it's a stupid
little<00:00:58.620> window<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.250> just<00:00:59.640> has<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.510> B

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
little window that just has like a and B

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.150 
little window that just has like a and B
if<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.989> launch<00:01:01.199> my<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.590> B<00:01:01.770> decks

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
if I launch my and B decks

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.640 
if I launch my and B decks
the<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.879> B<00:01:03.000> light<00:01:03.239> up<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.809> what<00:01:04.350> I'm<00:01:04.439> doing

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the a and B light up so what I'm doing

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.840 
the a and B light up so what I'm doing
essentially<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.159> I'm<00:01:05.250> taking<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.610> Lemur

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
essentially is I'm taking the Lemur

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.940 
essentially is I'm taking the Lemur
which<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:07.320> know<00:01:07.409> just<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.680> touch<00:01:07.830> screen

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
which is a you know just a touch screen

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.980 
which is a you know just a touch screen
controller<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.850> could<00:01:09.150> use<00:01:09.270> an<00:01:09.390> iPad<00:01:09.720> if<00:01:09.900> I

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
controller I could use an iPad if I

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.899 
controller I could use an iPad if I
wanted<00:01:10.290> same<00:01:10.530> deal<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.520> lemur<00:01:11.729> is

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
wanted same deal and the lemur is

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.960 
wanted same deal and the lemur is
talking<00:01:12.510> over<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.960> Ethernet<00:01:13.650> connection<00:01:14.130> to

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
talking over the Ethernet connection to

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.609 
talking over the Ethernet connection to
the<00:01:15.090> Mac<00:01:15.270> which<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.689> talking<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.140> my<00:01:16.229> VST

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
the Mac which is talking to my VST

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.080 
the Mac which is talking to my VST
plugins'<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.130> I've<00:01:17.220> got<00:01:17.430> two<00:01:17.939> way

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
plugins' so I've got two way

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.609 
plugins' so I've got two way
communication<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.990> lemur<00:01:19.170> from<00:01:19.439> this

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
communication to the lemur from this

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.469 
communication to the lemur from this
plugin<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.369> plugin<00:01:20.640> also<00:01:20.970> has<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> second

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
plugin and this plugin also has a second

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.200 
plugin and this plugin also has a second
pair<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.689> ports<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.320> go<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.830> way<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.790> Ableton

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
pair of ports that go to way to Ableton

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.420 
pair of ports that go to way to Ableton
Live<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.990> it's<00:01:25.170> sort<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.439> as<00:01:25.890> small<00:01:26.040> as<00:01:26.310> it

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
Live so it's sort of as small as it

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.859 
Live so it's sort of as small as it
looks<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.000> brain<00:01:27.270> it's<00:01:27.299> really

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
looks it's the brain it's really

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.990 
looks it's the brain it's really
controlling<00:01:28.259> its<00:01:28.920> watching<00:01:29.340> what<00:01:29.490> bar<00:01:29.700> we're

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
controlling its watching what bar we're

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.640 
controlling its watching what bar we're
on<00:01:30.150> its<00:01:30.570> watching<00:01:30.869> how<00:01:30.990> long<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.320> it's<00:01:31.500> been

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
on its watching how long this it's been

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.319 
on its watching how long this it's been
running<00:01:31.829> for<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.579> allows<00:01:32.820> me<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.060> do<00:01:33.180> some

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329

night which is nice
so<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.600> sort<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.810> pairs<00:02:01.229> them<00:02:01.439> down<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.799> that

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
so it sort of pairs them down to that

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.709 
so it sort of pairs them down to that
and<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.549> can<00:02:02.579> see<00:02:02.790> here<00:02:03.000> I've<00:02:03.119> got<00:02:03.270> my<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.450> and

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
and you can see here I've got my a and

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.539 
and you can see here I've got my a and
my<00:02:04.049> P<00:02:04.200> decks<00:02:04.619> with<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.009> crust<00:02:05.250> we<00:02:05.399> enter

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
my P decks with the crust we enter

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.050 
my P decks with the crust we enter
between

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
between

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.970 
between
so<00:02:06.540> if<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.690> wanted<00:02:06.900> to<00:02:06.960> launch<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.320> song<00:02:07.650> on<00:02:07.830> deck

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
so if I wanted to launch a song on deck

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.610 
so if I wanted to launch a song on deck
a<00:02:08.100> I<00:02:08.160> simply<00:02:08.670> hit<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.360> then<00:02:10.020> pick<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.380> song

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.780 

and<00:02:13.620> there<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:13.890> go<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.340> then<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.550> song<00:02:14.700> is

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
and there you go and then the song is

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.330 
and there you go and then the song is
playing<00:02:15.000> so<00:02:15.690> I've<00:02:16.380> got<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.590> trim<00:02:16.890> there<00:02:17.130> I've

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
playing so I've got a trim there I've

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.560 
playing so I've got a trim there I've
got<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.490> crossfade<00:02:17.940> between<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.540> B

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
got a crossfade between the a and the B

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.390 
got a crossfade between the a and the B
deck<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.080> it's<00:02:19.200> very<00:02:19.320> easy<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.710> get<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:20.310> know

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
deck so it's very easy to get you know

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.480 
deck so it's very easy to get you know
two<00:02:20.460> different<00:02:20.850> songs<00:02:21.000> running<00:02:22.250> one<00:02:23.250> thing<00:02:23.430> I

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
two different songs running one thing I

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.800 
two different songs running one thing I
really<00:02:23.760> like<00:02:23.880> about<00:02:23.910> this<00:02:24.240> is<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.660> I<00:02:24.720> have

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
really like about this is that I have

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.870 
really like about this is that I have
cycles<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.410> eight<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.890> can<00:02:26.040> see<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.490> can<00:02:26.760> see

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
cycles of eight so you can see I can see

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.400 
cycles of eight so you can see I can see
where<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.060> am<00:02:27.330> in<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.510> cycle<00:02:27.810> of<00:02:27.870> eight<00:02:28.050> so<00:02:28.260> if<00:02:28.320> I

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
where I am in a cycle of eight so if I

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.440 
where I am in a cycle of eight so if I
want<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.650> line<00:02:28.800> two<00:02:29.010> songs<00:02:29.310> up<00:02:29.580> I<00:02:29.820> don't<00:02:30.330> have

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
want to line two songs up I don't have

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.760 
want to line two songs up I don't have
to<00:02:30.540> worry<00:02:30.720> about<00:02:30.810> what<00:02:31.050> time<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.320> launch<00:02:31.590> the

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
to worry about what time I launch the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.220 
to worry about what time I launch the
song<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.280> just<00:02:32.430> have<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.610> make<00:02:32.730> these<00:02:32.880> match

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
song and I just have to make these match

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.630 
song and I just have to make these match
so<00:02:34.230> there<00:02:34.380> we<00:02:34.500> go<00:02:34.530> now<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.860> just<00:02:34.950> hit<00:02:35.190> minus<00:02:35.520> two

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
so there we go now I just hit minus two

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.949 
so there we go now I just hit minus two
minus<00:02:35.790> one<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.330> get<00:02:36.450> them<00:02:36.570> both<00:02:36.690> on<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.870> same

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
minus one to get them both on the same

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.440 
minus one to get them both on the same
cycle<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:37.620> eight<00:02:37.770> nice<00:02:38.520> so<00:02:38.820> it's<00:02:38.970> really<00:02:39.150> easy

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
cycle of eight nice so it's really easy

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.600 
cycle of eight nice so it's really easy
to<00:02:39.600> cue<00:02:39.870> in<00:02:40.020> then<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.620> have<00:02:40.739> these<00:02:40.830> q<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:41.340> q<00:02:41.370> out

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
to cue in then I have these q and q out

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.100 
to cue in then I have these q and q out
points<00:02:41.910> in<00:02:42.030> silver<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:42.510> can<00:02:42.720> see<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.930> little

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
points in silver you can see a little

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.530 
points in silver you can see a little
bar<00:02:43.380> below<00:02:43.620> there<00:02:43.800> so<00:02:44.190> that's<00:02:44.310> my<00:02:44.489> me<00:02:45.239> telling

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
bar below there so that's my me telling

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.210 
bar below there so that's my me telling
myself<00:02:45.660> where<00:02:46.170> I'd<00:02:46.290> like<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.560> mix<00:02:46.770> in<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.130> out

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
myself where I'd like to mix in and out

of<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.459> certain<00:02:47.640> song<00:02:47.970> so<00:02:48.630> it's<00:02:48.750> really<00:02:48.959> easy<00:02:49.260> to

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
of a certain song so it's really easy to

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.860 
of a certain song so it's really easy to
get<00:02:49.709> stuff<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.280> crossfade<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.970> literally<00:02:51.600> could

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
get stuff to crossfade I literally could

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.150 
get stuff to crossfade I literally could
lose<00:02:52.020> my<00:02:52.170> hearing<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:52.709> could<00:02:52.830> still<00:02:53.040> do<00:02:53.130> a

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
lose my hearing and I could still do a

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.790 
lose my hearing and I could still do a
DJ<00:02:53.370> set<00:02:53.810> especially<00:02:54.810> since<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.410> also<00:02:55.530> have<00:02:55.709> all

my<00:02:56.160> organized<00:02:56.820> by<00:02:57.000> key<00:02:57.209> so<00:02:58.140> that's<00:02:58.320> that

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
my organized by key so that's that

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.930 
my organized by key so that's that
that's<00:02:58.709> what<00:02:58.980> sort<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.220> one<00:02:59.340> half<00:02:59.580> of<00:02:59.640> it<00:02:59.820> is

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
that's what sort of one half of it is

I can switch between different patterns

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.150 
I can switch between different patterns
and<00:03:32.700> even<00:03:33.180> program<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.870> patterns<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.440> then

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
and even program the patterns and then

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.740 
and even program the patterns and then
jam<00:03:35.430> out<00:03:35.610> on<00:03:35.730> this<00:03:35.850> patterns<00:03:36.209> so<00:03:36.360> I<00:03:36.390> can<00:03:36.570> really

jam out on this patterns so I can really
like<00:03:36.900> I<00:03:37.200> get<00:03:37.650> it<00:03:37.769> up<00:03:37.980> there

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
like I get it up there

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.900 
like I get it up there
should<00:03:39.730> be<00:03:39.850> a<00:03:39.880> scientist<00:03:40.330> well<00:03:41.550> I'm<00:03:42.550> now<00:03:42.880> I

should be a scientist well I'm now I

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.620 
should be a scientist well I'm now I
gotta<00:03:43.270> share<00:03:43.630> feets<00:03:43.900> reason<00:03:45.300> so<00:03:46.300> you<00:03:46.330> can<00:03:46.510> see

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630

add-in<00:03:48.850> little<00:03:49.090> drum<00:03:49.300> bits<00:03:51.900> that's<00:03:52.900> actually

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
add-in little drum bits that's actually

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.960 
add-in little drum bits that's actually
triggering<00:03:53.500> Ableton<00:03:54.040> drum<00:03:54.250> racks<00:03:54.520> right<00:03:54.790> now

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
triggering Ableton drum racks right now

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.150

and<00:03:55.600> then<00:03:55.690> I<00:03:55.750> also<00:03:55.900> have<00:03:56.110> the<00:03:56.260> sort<00:03:56.770> of<00:03:56.830> a<00:03:56.890> blend

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
and then I also have the sort of a blend

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.380 
and then I also have the sort of a blend
that<00:03:57.310> will<00:03:57.459> then<00:03:57.580> blend<00:03:57.880> me<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.209> nerve

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
that will then blend me to the nerve

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.800 
that will then blend me to the nerve
sexual<00:03:58.900> output<00:03:59.490> so<00:04:00.490> it's<00:04:00.670> fun<00:04:00.910> gives<00:04:01.690> me

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
sexual output so it's fun gives me

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.420 
sexual output so it's fun gives me
something<00:04:02.020> to<00:04:02.230> do<00:04:02.350> between<00:04:02.560> tracks<00:04:03.040> and

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
something to do between tracks and

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.920 
something to do between tracks and
something<00:04:03.760> to<00:04:03.850> add<00:04:04.000> in<00:04:04.209> if<00:04:04.360> I<00:04:04.450> hear<00:04:04.600> an<00:04:04.690> idea

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
something to add in if I hear an idea

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.870

for<00:04:05.170> a<00:04:05.260> little<00:04:05.470> shaker<00:04:05.950> part<00:04:06.340> or<00:04:06.489> something<00:04:06.790> I

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
for a little shaker part or something I

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.059 
for a little shaker part or something I
can<00:04:07.030> solo<00:04:07.239> up<00:04:07.390> a<00:04:07.480> shaker<00:04:07.870> and<00:04:08.050> select<00:04:08.920> a

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
can solo up a shaker and select a

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.070 
can solo up a shaker and select a
suitable<00:04:09.610> pattern<00:04:10.150> for<00:04:10.330> it<00:04:10.360> and<00:04:10.720> mix<00:04:10.870> that<00:04:11.020> in

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
suitable pattern for it and mix that in

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.199 
suitable pattern for it and mix that in
so<00:04:11.440> it's<00:04:11.560> it's<00:04:12.160> like<00:04:12.250> the<00:04:12.370> cynic<00:04:12.640> sort<00:04:13.060> of<00:04:13.120> an

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.520 
so it's it's like the cynic sort of an
extra<00:04:13.420> thing<00:04:13.630> to<00:04:13.720> do<00:04:13.840> and<00:04:14.050> I<00:04:14.080> really<00:04:14.290> enjoy

jamming out with the live kind of

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.460 
jamming out with the live kind of
repeater<00:04:16.180> thing<00:04:16.450> that's<00:04:16.630> in<00:04:16.780> nerve<00:04:16.959> allows<00:04:17.320> me

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
repeater thing that's in nerve allows me

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.830 
repeater thing that's in nerve allows me
to<00:04:17.590> stutter<00:04:18.220> stutter<00:04:19.000> the<00:04:19.239> beat<00:04:19.419> kind<00:04:19.630> of<00:04:19.750> do

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
to stutter stutter the beat kind of do
